00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.209 

we<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.480> what<00:00:09.480> are<00:00:09.690> all<00:00:09.900> our<00:00:10.170> front<00:00:10.590> chassis

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
we have what are all our front chassis

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.830 
we have what are all our front chassis
leads<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.730> that's<00:00:11.910> all<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.269> stuff<00:00:12.599> right

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
leads so that's all this stuff right

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.209 
leads so that's all this stuff right
here<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.230> everything<00:00:13.440> from<00:00:13.710> like<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> front

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
here so everything from like the front

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.210 
here so everything from like the front
USB<00:00:14.639> 3<00:00:15.020> to<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> front<00:00:16.379> leads<00:00:16.590> 4<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.010> power

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
USB 3 to the front leads 4 like power

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.410 
USB 3 to the front leads 4 like power
reset<00:00:17.910> HD<00:00:18.720> audio<00:00:18.900> USB<00:00:19.830> 3<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.490> whatnot<00:00:21.000> so

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
reset HD audio USB 3 and whatnot so

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.609 
reset HD audio USB 3 and whatnot so
we're<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.720> going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:22.020> ahead<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.410> run

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
we're just going to go ahead and run

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.140 
we're just going to go ahead and run
each<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.130> these<00:00:23.220> through<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
each one of these through to the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.660 
each one of these through to the
corresponding<00:00:24.779> points<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.340> get<00:00:26.340> these<00:00:26.490> guys

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
corresponding points and get these guys

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.320 
corresponding points and get these guys
connected

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
connected

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.999 
connected
so<00:00:27.539> first<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.519> here<00:00:31.009> ok

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
so first up see what we have here ok

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
so first up see what we have here ok
we've<00:00:32.250> actually<00:00:32.430> got<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.180> SATA<00:00:33.540> cable<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.110> so

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
we've actually got a SATA cable and so

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
we've actually got a SATA cable and so
the<00:00:34.380> SATA<00:00:34.590> cable<00:00:34.730> is<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.600> this

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the SATA cable is going to be for this

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
the SATA cable is going to be for this
top<00:00:37.050> portion<00:00:37.290> right<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.040> they<00:00:38.190> had<00:00:38.340> we

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
top portion right here so they had we

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.500 
top portion right here so they had we
have<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> ability<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.420> ahead

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
have the ability that we can go ahead

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.869 
have the ability that we can go ahead
and<00:00:39.780> mount<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.110> drive<00:00:40.260> inside<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.040> but

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and mount a drive inside of this but

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:42.889 
and mount a drive inside of this but
we're<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> go<00:00:42.270> ahead<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.600> need<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> be

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
we're going to go ahead and need to be

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.779 
we're going to go ahead and need to be
able<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> provide<00:00:43.379> data<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.640> course

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
able to provide data to it so of course

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.700 
able to provide data to it so of course
that's<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> inside<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.559> we'll<00:00:46.680> just

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that's on the inside here so we'll just

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
that's on the inside here so we'll just
go<00:00:46.950> ahead<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> run<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
go ahead and run that to one of the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.459 
go ahead and run that to one of the
actual<00:00:49.530> seta<00:00:49.800> ports<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.719> won't<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
actual seta ports if you won't want to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.540 
actual seta ports if you won't want to
go<00:00:52.530> ahead<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> fastest

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
go ahead and have the fastest

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.740 
go ahead and have the fastest
performance<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.059> would<00:00:54.180> use<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> primary

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
performance you would use the primary

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.040 
performance you would use the primary
SATA<00:00:55.230> 6g<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.270> didn't

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
SATA 6g and then if you didn't

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.029 
SATA 6g and then if you didn't
necessarily<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> highest

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
necessarily have to have the highest

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
necessarily have to have the highest
performance<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.000> still<00:01:00.239> wanted<00:01:00.510> very<00:01:00.690> fast

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
performance but still wanted very fast

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
performance but still wanted very fast
performance<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.620> use<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> supplemental

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
performance you use a supplemental

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
performance you use a supplemental
secondary<00:01:03.239> set<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.570> controller<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.589> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
secondary set of controller and this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.719 
secondary set of controller and this
would<00:01:04.949> pretty<00:01:05.100> much<00:01:05.189> probably<00:01:05.610> be

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
would pretty much probably be

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
would pretty much probably be
transparent<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.420> mechanical<00:01:06.840> hard<00:01:07.049> drive

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
transparent for mechanical hard drive

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.899 
transparent for mechanical hard drive
both<00:01:07.409> offering<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> same<00:01:08.040> performance<00:01:08.520> there

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
both offering the same performance there

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.370 
both offering the same performance there
was<00:01:09.030> an<00:01:09.119> SSD<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> little<00:01:10.229> bit

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
was an SSD you would see a little bit

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
was an SSD you would see a little bit
more<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> differential<00:01:11.150> depending<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
more of a differential depending on the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.420 
more of a differential depending on the
controller<00:01:12.659> being<00:01:12.869> used

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
controller being used

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.380 
controller being used
okay<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.820> ahead<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.689> connected<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> one

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
okay so ahead and connected that one

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.380 
okay so ahead and connected that one
alright<00:01:18.390> next<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:19.049> we've<00:01:19.229> got<00:01:19.340> USB<00:01:20.340> header<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
alright next up we've got USB header so

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.210 
alright next up we've got USB header so
USB<00:01:21.810> header<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.259> going<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.950> these

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
USB header that's going to be all these

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.249 
USB header that's going to be all these
guys<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> bottom<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.110> we're

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
guys right here at the bottom so we're

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.679 
guys right here at the bottom so we're
going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> route<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.710> cable<00:01:26.659> through<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
going to route that cable through the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.219 
going to route that cable through the
bottom<00:01:28.250> this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.310> also<00:01:29.610> keyed<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:31.020> can

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
bottom this is also keyed if you can

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
bottom this is also keyed if you can
maybe<00:01:31.380> check<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.189> King<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.880> see

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
maybe check out that King you can see

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.510 
maybe check out that King you can see
right<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.920> one<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> pins<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
right there that one of the pins is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
right there that one of the pins is
blocked<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.420> essentially<00:01:36.750> five<00:01:37.079> on

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
blocked so we have essentially five on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.660 
blocked so we have essentially five on
top<00:01:37.500> four<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> bottom<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.520> just

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
top four on the bottom so we just

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.280 
top four on the bottom so we just
essentially<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> match<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.840> pairing

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
essentially need to match that pairing

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.370 
essentially need to match that pairing
so<00:01:41.040> we're<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> go<00:01:41.700> next<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.570> run<00:01:43.290> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
so we're just going to go next up run it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
so we're just going to go next up run it
straight<00:01:43.560> into<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.909> keeps<00:01:45.119> things

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
straight into there that keeps things

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.520 
straight into there that keeps things
nice<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.570> tight<00:01:45.899> right<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.500> can

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
nice and tight right there as you can

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
nice and tight right there as you can
see<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.180> nice<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
see so that's going to be nice for the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.030 
see so that's going to be nice for the
cable<00:01:48.899> routing<00:01:50.810> next<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:52.020> we're<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
cable routing next up we're going to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.780 
cable routing next up we're going to
take<00:01:53.189> all<00:01:53.369> four<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:54.420> our<00:01:55.110> front<00:01:55.790> chassis

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
take all four of our front chassis

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.740 
take all four of our front chassis
connections<00:01:57.590> as<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.040> right<00:01:59.219> here

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
connections as you can see right here

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.340 
connections as you can see right here
and<00:02:00.750> we're<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> run<00:02:01.170> those<00:02:01.290> through

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and we're going to run those through

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.510 
and we're going to run those through
there<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.770> these<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.399> all

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
there so these are going to be for all

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
there so these are going to be for all
your<00:02:02.700> power<00:02:02.939> buttons<00:02:03.390> LEDs<00:02:03.810> stuff<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
your power buttons LEDs stuff like that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.260 
your power buttons LEDs stuff like that
here<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.009> top<00:02:05.219> I'm<00:02:05.729> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> same<00:02:06.119> thing

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
here at the top I'm going to same thing

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.550 
here at the top I'm going to same thing
we're<00:02:06.390> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> run<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.840> guy<00:02:07.020> down<00:02:07.259> here<00:02:07.500> at

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
we're going to run that guy down here at

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
we're going to run that guy down here at
the<00:02:07.680> bottom<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.489> you're<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> make

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the bottom but you're not going to make

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.910 
the bottom but you're not going to make
those<00:02:09.780> connections<00:02:09.989> yet<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> go

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
those connections yet we're going to go

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.670 
those connections yet we're going to go
ahead<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.220> use<00:02:11.340> our<00:02:11.489> Q<00:02:11.730> connector

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
ahead and use our Q connector

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.470 
ahead and use our Q connector
and<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.130> little<00:02:13.370> bit<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.580> make<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.880> easier<00:02:14.270> but

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and a little bit to make that easier but

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.150 
and a little bit to make that easier but
we're<00:02:14.630> since<00:02:14.840> you're<00:02:14.930> going<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> run<00:02:15.290> those<00:02:15.530> to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
we're since you're going to run those to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.550 
we're since you're going to run those to
this<00:02:16.340> front<00:02:17.060> header<00:02:17.300> right<00:02:17.540> here<00:02:18.790> next<00:02:19.790> stump

this front header right here next stump

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.520 
this front header right here next stump
we've<00:02:21.560> got<00:02:21.830> our<00:02:22.010> HD<00:02:22.460> audio<00:02:22.640> connection<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.320> for

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
we've got our HD audio connection so for

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.740 
we've got our HD audio connection so for
the<00:02:24.590> HD<00:02:24.950> audio<00:02:25.130> that's<00:02:26.120> actually<00:02:26.450> going<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.690> be

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
the HD audio that's actually going to be

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.100 
the HD audio that's actually going to be
this<00:02:26.900> header<00:02:27.140> all<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.890> way<00:02:28.010> over<00:02:28.580> here<00:02:28.940> or<00:02:29.810> if

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
this header all the way over here or if

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.540 
this header all the way over here or if
you<00:02:30.230> were<00:02:30.320> using<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.709> discrete<00:02:31.070> sound<00:02:31.340> card

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
you were using a discrete sound card

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.050 
you were using a discrete sound card
such<00:02:31.760> as<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> zone<00:02:32.270> r<00:02:32.420> DG<00:02:32.900> d<00:02:33.800> GX<00:02:34.130> RDS<00:02:34.670> X<00:02:34.910> or

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
such as like a zone r DG d GX RDS X or

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.460 
such as like a zone r DG d GX RDS X or
something<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.540> class<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.110> header<00:02:36.290> would

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
something in that class the header would

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.040 
something in that class the header would
be<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.040> card<00:02:37.250> itself<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.450> same<00:02:38.870> thing

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
be on the card itself so same thing

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.420 
be on the card itself so same thing
we're<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:39.260> going<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.560> go<00:02:39.680> ahead<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.100> route

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
we're just going to go ahead and route

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.520 
we're just going to go ahead and route
through<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.760> bottom<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.840> pull<00:02:45.290> through<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:47.530> I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
through the bottom and pull through so I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.870 
through the bottom and pull through so I
just<00:02:48.800> need<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.070> go<00:02:49.160> ahead<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.370> pull<00:02:49.730> this

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
just need to go ahead and pull this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.090 
just need to go ahead and pull this
cable<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.900> get<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:55.360> settled<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.510> there

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
cable in and get this settled in there

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.370 
cable in and get this settled in there
ok<00:02:58.100> that's<00:02:58.760> for<00:02:58.940> my<00:02:59.060> HD<00:02:59.390> audio<00:02:59.570> I<00:03:00.020> can<00:03:00.140> go<00:03:00.290> ahead

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
ok that's for my HD audio I can go ahead

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.720 
ok that's for my HD audio I can go ahead
and<00:03:00.470> pull<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.739> in<00:03:01.040> there<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.370> can<00:03:01.520> still

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
and pull that in there and I can still

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.770 
and pull that in there and I can still
have<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.000> looking<00:03:02.300> pretty<00:03:03.170> clean<00:03:04.480> alright<00:03:05.480> and

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
have it looking pretty clean alright and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.320 
have it looking pretty clean alright and
looks<00:03:06.470> like<00:03:06.620> you've<00:03:06.800> got<00:03:07.010> one<00:03:07.880> more<00:03:08.120> right

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
looks like you've got one more right

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.390 
looks like you've got one more right
here<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.840> that's<00:03:09.260> going<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.620> be<00:03:09.800> for<00:03:10.100> front

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
here and that's going to be for front

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.540 
here and that's going to be for front
USB<00:03:10.670> 3<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.750> that's<00:03:11.930> going<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.320> be<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.770> block

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
USB 3 so that's going to be this block

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.880 
USB 3 so that's going to be this block
right<00:03:13.730> here<00:03:13.790> directly<00:03:14.390> next<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.140> 24<00:03:15.709> pin

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
right here directly next to the 24 pin

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.620 
right here directly next to the 24 pin
power<00:03:16.070> connection<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.480> looks

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
power connection and so it looks

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.150 
power connection and so it looks
probably<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:18.140> optimal<00:03:18.650> routing<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.010> going

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
probably like optimal routing is going

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.560 
probably like optimal routing is going
to<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.340> through<00:03:19.820> this<00:03:19.970> header<00:03:20.180> right<00:03:20.360> here

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
to be through this header right here

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.080 
to be through this header right here
let's<00:03:21.440> go<00:03:21.560> ahead<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.920> run<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.220> guy<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.970> is

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
let's go ahead and run that guy this is

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.030 
let's go ahead and run that guy this is
a<00:03:23.120> little<00:03:23.299> bit<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.630> stiff<00:03:23.959> big<00:03:24.290> block<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:24.950> you

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
a little bit of a stiff big block so you

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.259 
a little bit of a stiff big block so you
just<00:03:25.190> got<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.430> be<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.549> little<00:03:25.700> bit<00:03:25.880> careful<00:03:26.180> with

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
just got to be a little bit careful with

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.910 
just got to be a little bit careful with
it<00:03:26.390> because<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.660> pins<00:03:26.930> here<00:03:27.230> are<00:03:27.530> very

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
it because the pins here are very

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.850 
it because the pins here are very
sensitive<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.610> they're<00:03:28.730> very<00:03:28.880> light<00:03:29.860> so

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
sensitive and they're very light so

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.420 
sensitive and they're very light so
we're<00:03:31.070> going<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.370> get<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.390> guy<00:03:33.280> settled<00:03:34.280> in

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
we're going to get that guy settled in

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.460

we can run the reset header directly to

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.010 
we can run the reset header directly to
our<00:04:36.410> D<00:04:36.740> RCT<00:04:37.310> header<00:04:37.520> which<00:04:38.180> would<00:04:38.360> work<00:04:38.539> as<00:04:38.720> a

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
our D RCT header which would work as a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.740 
our D RCT header which would work as a
direct<00:04:39.850> initialization<00:04:40.850> sequence<00:04:41.030> for<00:04:41.630> the

up<00:05:32.479> we're<00:05:32.690> just<00:05:32.720> going<00:05:32.960> to<00:05:32.990> go<00:05:33.139> ahead<00:05:33.260> and

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
up we're just going to go ahead and

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.770 
up we're just going to go ahead and
quickly<00:05:33.770> run<00:05:33.979> our<00:05:34.220> data<00:05:34.520> cables<00:05:34.970> for<00:05:35.660> our

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
quickly run our data cables for our

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.360 
quickly run our data cables for our
storage<00:05:36.020> devices<00:05:36.349> so<00:05:36.590> these<00:05:36.740> are<00:05:36.919> the<00:05:37.039> serial

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
storage devices so these are the serial

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.700 
storage devices so these are the serial
ata<00:05:37.580> cables<00:05:38.060> so<00:05:38.720> first<00:05:39.110> up<00:05:39.289> we're<00:05:39.410> going<00:05:39.500> to<00:05:39.590> go

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
ata cables so first up we're going to go

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.060 
ata cables so first up we're going to go
ahead<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:40.039> run<00:05:40.220> one<00:05:40.430> for<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.789> OTD<00:05:41.330> so<00:05:42.070> just

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
ahead and run one for the OTD so just

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.680 
ahead and run one for the OTD so just
going<00:05:43.159> to<00:05:43.250> go<00:05:43.400> ahead<00:05:43.460> and<00:05:43.909> a<00:05:44.030> fix<00:05:44.270> this<00:05:44.449> right

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
going to go ahead and a fix this right

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.159 
going to go ahead and a fix this right
to<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:44.900> back<00:05:45.139> of<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.440> OTD<00:05:45.919> and<00:05:47.050> then<00:05:48.050> we're

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
to the back of the OTD and then we're

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.450 
to the back of the OTD and then we're
just<00:05:48.349> going<00:05:48.470> to<00:05:48.500> run<00:05:48.710> that<00:05:48.889> back<00:05:49.130> out<00:05:49.280> through

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
just going to run that back out through

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.990 
just going to run that back out through
the<00:05:49.520> top<00:05:49.849> and<00:05:51.520> then<00:05:52.520> we're<00:05:52.639> actually<00:05:52.729> going<00:05:52.940> to

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
the top and then we're actually going to

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.050 
the top and then we're actually going to
run<00:05:53.150> that<00:05:53.330> back<00:05:53.510> in<00:05:54.280> just<00:05:55.280> to<00:05:55.430> minimize<00:05:55.610> them

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
run that back in just to minimize them

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.409 
run that back in just to minimize them
being<00:05:56.240> able<00:05:56.330> to<00:05:56.449> see<00:05:56.630> that<00:05:56.780> cable<00:05:57.699> so<00:05:58.699> let's<00:05:59.120> go

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
being able to see that cable so let's go

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.480 
being able to see that cable so let's go
ahead<00:05:59.570> and<00:06:01.419> run<00:06:02.419> that<00:06:02.720> right<00:06:03.530> here<00:06:03.740> up<00:06:04.099> to<00:06:04.340> you

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
ahead and run that right here up to you

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.950 
ahead and run that right here up to you
as<00:06:04.639> far<00:06:04.849> as<00:06:04.880> where<00:06:05.150> you'd<00:06:05.330> like<00:06:05.449> to<00:06:05.630> run<00:06:05.780> that

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
as far as where you'd like to run that

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.390 
as far as where you'd like to run that
whether<00:06:06.530> you<00:06:06.680> want<00:06:06.830> to<00:06:06.889> run<00:06:07.010> that<00:06:07.159> on<00:06:07.280> the

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
whether you want to run that on the

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.890 
whether you want to run that on the
adding<00:06:07.699> controller<00:06:08.120> or<00:06:08.360> whether<00:06:08.539> you<00:06:08.659> want<00:06:08.750> to

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
adding controller or whether you want to

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.260 
adding controller or whether you want to
run<00:06:09.020> that<00:06:09.169> on<00:06:09.320> the<00:06:09.409> Intel<00:06:09.680> controller<00:06:10.270> this

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
run that on the Intel controller this

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.580 
run that on the Intel controller this
would<00:06:11.510> be<00:06:11.599> actually<00:06:11.750> fine<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.229> run<00:06:12.380> on<00:06:12.500> the

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
would be actually fine to run on the

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.100 
would be actually fine to run on the
adding<00:06:13.039> controller<00:06:13.430> and<00:06:14.210> no<00:06:14.479> issues<00:06:14.810> there<00:06:15.020> in

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
adding controller and no issues there in

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.960 
adding controller and no issues there in
terms<00:06:15.260> of<00:06:15.440> performance<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:16.159> it's<00:06:16.639> entirely

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
terms of performance and it's entirely

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.310 
terms of performance and it's entirely
usable<00:06:17.389> there<00:06:17.659> and<00:06:17.780> you<00:06:17.870> could<00:06:17.990> keep<00:06:18.169> the

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
usable there and you could keep the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.050 
usable there and you could keep the
fastest<00:06:18.800> speed<00:06:19.010> ports<00:06:19.310> for<00:06:19.490> storage<00:06:19.789> devices

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
fastest speed ports for storage devices

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.210 
fastest speed ports for storage devices
or<00:06:20.360> storage<00:06:20.630> expansion<00:06:20.990> next<00:06:21.919> up<00:06:22.039> we've<00:06:22.190> got

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
or storage expansion next up we've got

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.430 
or storage expansion next up we've got
one<00:06:22.490> for<00:06:22.669> the<00:06:22.699> SSD<00:06:23.240> so<00:06:23.750> let's<00:06:23.990> go<00:06:24.199> ahead<00:06:24.320> and

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
one for the SSD so let's go ahead and

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.290 
one for the SSD so let's go ahead and
first<00:06:25.190> connect<00:06:25.520> that<00:06:25.639> here<00:06:25.940> on<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.599> back<00:06:28.300> I've

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
first connect that here on the back I've

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.710 
first connect that here on the back I've
got<00:06:29.630> that<00:06:29.810> running<00:06:29.990> there<00:06:30.289> to<00:06:30.440> our<00:06:30.530> SSD<00:06:31.720> and

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
got that running there to our SSD and

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.139 
got that running there to our SSD and
we're<00:06:32.990> going<00:06:33.110> to<00:06:33.139> run<00:06:33.349> one<00:06:33.560> more<00:06:33.770> in<00:06:34.070> here

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:36.149 
we're going to run one more in here

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:40.739 
we're going to run one more in here
and<00:06:38.129> snap<00:06:39.129> that<00:06:39.339> into<00:06:39.490> the<00:06:39.639> PCH<00:06:40.089> okay<00:06:40.479> we've

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:40.749 
and snap that into the PCH okay we've

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:42.809 
and snap that into the PCH okay we've
got<00:06:40.869> one<00:06:41.050> more<00:06:41.229> and<00:06:41.499> last<00:06:42.129> ones<00:06:42.399> going<00:06:42.580> to<00:06:42.669> be

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
got one more and last ones going to be

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:53.429 
got one more and last ones going to be
for<00:06:43.119> our<00:06:43.149> mechanical<00:06:43.809> hard<00:06:43.990> drive<00:06:52.169> run<00:06:53.169> one

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:53.439 
for our mechanical hard drive run one

00:06:53.439 --> 00:07:01.709 
for our mechanical hard drive run one
more<00:06:53.710> right<00:06:54.009> underneath<00:06:54.339> that<00:06:59.909> and<00:07:00.909> we'll

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:01.719 
more right underneath that and we'll

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:04.439 
more right underneath that and we'll
just<00:07:01.930> keep<00:07:02.199> that<00:07:02.259> on<00:07:02.439> the<00:07:02.649> same<00:07:02.919> header<00:07:03.449> okay

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
just keep that on the same header okay

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.899 
just keep that on the same header okay
so<00:07:04.899> that's<00:07:05.110> our<00:07:05.259> three<00:07:05.529> data<00:07:05.740> points<00:07:05.909> all

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:06.909 
so that's our three data points all

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.969 
so that's our three data points all
connected<00:07:07.479> to<00:07:07.869> the<00:07:08.110> actual<00:07:08.259> serial<00:07:08.709> ata

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
connected to the actual serial ata

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.010 
connected to the actual serial ata
connected<00:07:09.819> to<00:07:09.909> each<00:07:10.059> device<00:07:10.389> so<00:07:10.599> we're<00:07:10.779> good

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
connected to each device so we're good

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.439 
connected to each device so we're good
to<00:07:11.110> go<00:07:11.139> there
