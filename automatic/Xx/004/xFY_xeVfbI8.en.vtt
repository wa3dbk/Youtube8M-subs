changes for the South African PBM are

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.849 
changes for the South African PBM are
are<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.840> adds<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.739> secondary<00:02:44.459> cycle<00:02:45.060> so

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
are that it adds a secondary cycle so

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.729 
are that it adds a secondary cycle so

instead of one cycle all helium we'd

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.470

and the reason they're doing this is

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.640 
and the reason they're doing this is
because<00:03:20.489> there<00:03:21.389> is<00:03:21.480> much<00:03:21.810> stronger<00:03:22.109> interest
