I<00:00:06.859> took<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.340> dining-room<00:00:08.760> window<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.269> divide

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
I took the dining-room window and divide

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.200 
I took the dining-room window and divide
it<00:00:09.690> into<00:00:09.870> three<00:00:10.320> sections<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.250> larger<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.030> in

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
it into three sections the larger one in

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.930 
it into three sections the larger one in
the<00:00:12.300> middle<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.690> two<00:00:12.990> smaller<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.650> sides

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
the middle and two smaller on the sides

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
the middle and two smaller on the sides
when<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.030> look<00:00:15.269> at<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.839> window<00:00:16.170> frame

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
when you look at the window frame

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.130 
when you look at the window frame
closely<00:00:16.920> you'll<00:00:17.130> see<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.140> aluminum

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
closely you'll see that the aluminum

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.560 
closely you'll see that the aluminum
frame<00:00:19.500> with<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> Plexiglas<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.060> screw<00:00:21.330> nailed

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.800 
frame with the Plexiglas is screw nailed
to<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> wood<00:00:22.289> frame<00:00:22.470> which<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.010> created<00:00:23.810> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to a wood frame which I created the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.560 
to a wood frame which I created the
screws<00:00:25.320> our<00:00:25.740> holes<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.880> drilled<00:00:27.060> into<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
screws our holes are drilled into the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.929 
screws our holes are drilled into the
aluminum<00:00:28.019> frame<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> then<00:00:28.980> screw<00:00:29.490> nailed<00:00:29.760> in

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
aluminum frame and then screw nailed in

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.040 
aluminum frame and then screw nailed in
and<00:00:30.380> between<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.590> frame<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.759> wood<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.329> put

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and between the frame and the wood I put

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.299 
and between the frame and the wood I put
a<00:00:34.079> foam<00:00:34.350> insulation<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:36.600> windows<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
a foam insulation the windows on the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459 
a foam insulation the windows on the
side<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> house<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.629> able<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:39.989> create

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
side of the house I was able to create

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.030 
side of the house I was able to create
the<00:00:41.370> storms<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:42.930> were<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the storms so that they were on the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.729 
the storms so that they were on the
outside<00:00:44.730> edge<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.750> window<00:00:46.410> frames

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
outside edge of the window frames

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.549 
outside edge of the window frames
themselves<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.640> made<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> size<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> screw

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
themselves I made them to size and screw

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.959 
themselves I made them to size and screw
nailed<00:00:49.860> them<00:00:50.039> right<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.030> against<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.829> frame

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
nailed them right up against the frame

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.639 
nailed them right up against the frame
so<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> plexiglass<00:00:54.719> covers<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> entire

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so the plexiglass covers the entire

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.790 
so the plexiglass covers the entire
opening<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> window<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:57.870> makes<00:00:58.320> an<00:00:58.530> air

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
opening of the window this makes an air

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.430 
opening of the window this makes an air
lock<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.520> there's<00:00:59.910> no<00:01:00.239> way<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> air

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
lock so that there's no way that the air

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.890 
lock so that there's no way that the air
can<00:01:02.420> pass<00:01:03.420> from<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> window<00:01:05.729> outside<00:01:06.330> or

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
can pass from the window outside or

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
can pass from the window outside or
inside<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.680> actually<00:01:08.070> an<00:01:08.280> air<00:01:08.460> lock<00:01:08.700> in

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
inside it's actually an air lock in

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.410 
inside it's actually an air lock in
there<00:01:09.260> you'll<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.700> spate

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
there you'll see that there is a spate

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.830 
there you'll see that there is a spate
of<00:01:12.659> spacer<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.500> foam<00:01:14.369> insulation<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
of spacer of foam insulation up in the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.310 
of spacer of foam insulation up in the
corner

and<00:02:12.570> then<00:02:13.570> after<00:02:14.050> those<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:16.180> dried<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:17.080> then

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and then after those that dried I then

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.310 
and then after those that dried I then
took<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.400> plexiglass<00:02:19.060> with<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.780> channel

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
took the plexiglass with the you channel

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.600 
took the plexiglass with the you channel
on<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.860> put<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.880> into<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.570> metal<00:02:22.930> frame<00:02:23.610> it
