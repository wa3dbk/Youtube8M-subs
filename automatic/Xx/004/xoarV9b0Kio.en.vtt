00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.050
 we are on stand by to Welotec 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.840
 zschopauer 2013 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.510
 and we have a model here as well 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.650
 jett board was flown several times before 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:39.120
 completely new and indeed from a contribution 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.230
 the fmtg kleinschmidt is one of the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.910
 developer may say in the case 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.900
 not all alone maybe you can 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.989
 say something again 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.970
 The model was developed together with the 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.800
 wolfgang berlin developed and still with 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.280
 the collaboration of oliver veigneau 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.839
 Bodzek 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.430
 we had dinner times 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.800
 put together and conclude 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.210
 We've got a good lie that jett 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.860
 board and still have it in 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.809
 Cellar left over from it could be something 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.809
 make and it was just stop 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.580
 this zdf so with in the cellar 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.080
 you have to say that for those who 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.670
 Maybe it does not know the model 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.860
 There was just just one stop 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.479
 other drive you have so to speak 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.909
 now with a drive in the cellar 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.100
 Provided 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.100
 yes which in the cellar is there 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.680
 So use the new mac mini cases 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.259
 is an insert of the minivan evo me 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.270
 fly the mini interrogation with the 220 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.670
 motor and 4s lipo cells 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.780
 I have also seen so speedy 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.649
 yes, just understated 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.210
 that's really really fast 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.789
 on the way you have the speed 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.899
 times so determines the speed 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.929
 I have also measured times before 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.609
 on gps measured 200 km / h came 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.090
 clearly that gps is not that accurate 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.500
 measurement but I have the the flight 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.600
 repeated several times and each time the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.649
 So the same results get it 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.749
 is pretty much in the direction of 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.700
 200 km h 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:58.600
 yes the specification is in the fnp too 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.249
 you can find building plan better you can 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.069
 order there on the exciting set 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:05.770
 maybe something in which 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.280
 to shape which products are delivered 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.069
 You can get from the simple 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.230
 Milling use of spans 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.150
 the lateral parts of the headwork parts and 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.010
 everybody talks 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.310
 There you also get one more 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.690
 set with it cellar and moment must also 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.880
 let's see there is also still 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.610
 a complete set with mini fan 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.970
 evo and 220 motor so one 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.980
 complete set, so to speak, with drive 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.710
 different variants 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.540
 where is the complete or resp 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.280
 the kits for the camera also all 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.050
 about remotec also relate everything about w 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.240
 Mondays are based on pure milled parts 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.390
 costs 75 euros with books costs therefore 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.230
 fair price 79 euros and the complete set 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.030
 say something about the 170 180 euro 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.560
 build jan is absolutely not nowadays 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.890
 everybody's not everybody to everybody 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.060
 crafts what wood would be like 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.010
 you assess which skills 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.720
 effort to complete the model 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.400
 So these are not really any 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.020
 special skills required 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.280
 I have noticed many modellers 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.260
 the fright back in front of this 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.240
 curved nose bar and in front of the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.740
 cabin minarets surface but I have to 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.350
 say the model is relatively simple 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.120
 set up with an aid bar underneath 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.620
 the relief can be seen as the model 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.660
 also with the right idea 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.070
 then just has to build backwards 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.840
 puzzle together and seconds glue 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.610
 it's really not hard to guess 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.440
 so if and modellbauer it is 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.820
 quite feasible and about construction time 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.490
 what will be so 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.380
 So I was traveling relatively quickly 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.120
 had two weeks finished I think the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.220
 cut model farmer also gets in three 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.740
 up to four weeks of comfortable construction 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.200
 fine that sounds very interesting because 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.150
 the model is simply hand 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.060
 So I really saw start 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.120
 super flown before 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.090
 super fast and also for the speed fans 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.610
 probably just right yes 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.830
 I would like to thank you for that 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.020
 There are interviews and more as I said 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.630
 then of course in the fmt folder and 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.980
 or on the website me 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.160
 think you also have your own 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.690
 wolfgang berlin also has website 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.700
 only own website or at 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.500
 melancholy is the model to buy up 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.510
 the website also says yes and 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.130
 Of course, a builder publag great 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.130
 I thank you and see you soon 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.349
