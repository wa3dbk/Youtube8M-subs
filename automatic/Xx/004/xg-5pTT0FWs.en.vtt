 Although this time it is a motor for paper 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:35.540
 Aircraft in the fall of the wall from 2.0 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.710
 so to speak we upgraded it before then 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.980
 namely not need as much 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.360
 battery power and now you can 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.750

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.609
 seconds so for comparison normal 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.129
 Paper plane as bad 14 seconds 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:59.899

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.280

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.930

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.930

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.470

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.370
