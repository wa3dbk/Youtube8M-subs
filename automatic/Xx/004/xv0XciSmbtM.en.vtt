sit up right see it's kind of crooked
you<00:00:32.399> can't<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.759> tell<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.329> don't<00:00:33.390> think

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you can't really tell and I don't think

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.760 
you can't really tell and I don't think
it's<00:00:33.719> gonna<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.110> big<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> deal<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
it's gonna be that big of a deal in the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's gonna be that big of a deal in the
long<00:00:34.980> run<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:37.370> just<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
long run but I just think that for the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.340 
long run but I just think that for the
amount<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.450> money<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.690> pay<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.230> these

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
amount of money you pay for one of these

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.740 
amount of money you pay for one of these
dollhouses<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:41.219> should<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.579> straight<00:00:44.239> as<00:00:45.239> far

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
dollhouses it should be straight as far

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.799 
dollhouses it should be straight as far
as<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.309> seeing<00:00:47.700> right<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
as what you are seeing right now the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.450 
as what you are seeing right now the
banisters<00:00:49.289> are<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.620> painted<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.309> real

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
banisters are not painted and the real

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
banisters are not painted and the real
reason<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.030> they're<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.480> painted<00:00:51.840> yet<00:00:52.020> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
reason that they're not painted yet is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.729 
reason that they're not painted yet is
because<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.149> wood<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.050> decided<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
because this is wood that I decided to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.000 
because this is wood that I decided to
use<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> banisters<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.270> opposed<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:58.010> what

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
use for the banisters as opposed to what

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.920 
use for the banisters as opposed to what
they<00:00:59.430> had<00:00:59.670> given<00:01:00.000> me<00:01:00.149> now<00:01:00.329> these<00:01:00.480> were<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
they had given me now these were the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
they had given me now these were the
pieces<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.620> wood<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.010> they<00:01:02.160> come<00:01:02.430> with

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
pieces of wood that they come with

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
pieces of wood that they come with
they're<00:01:03.510> supposed<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.960> railings<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
they're supposed to be railings and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
they're supposed to be railings and
banisters<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> stuff<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> they're<00:01:06.060> just

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270

sure<00:04:14.350> it's<00:04:14.530> gonna<00:04:14.650> stay<00:04:14.950> yellow<00:04:15.190> again<00:04:15.670> back

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
sure it's gonna stay yellow again back

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.120 
sure it's gonna stay yellow again back
there<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.269> wallpaper<00:04:16.660> didn't<00:04:17.130> completely

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
there the wallpaper didn't completely

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.060 
there the wallpaper didn't completely
fit<00:04:18.519> so<00:04:19.080> might<00:04:20.080> just<00:04:20.320> repaint<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:20.919> whole

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.530 
got these kind of rustic looking stairs
it's<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.919> best<00:04:45.130> best<00:04:45.729> thing<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.180> could<00:04:46.389> do

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
it's the best best thing that I could do

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.200 
it's the best best thing that I could do
to<00:04:46.690> this<00:04:46.810> wood<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.350> make<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.650> look<00:04:47.970> good

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
to this wood to make it look good

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.700 
to this wood to make it look good
and<00:04:49.300> that's<00:04:49.900> kind<00:04:50.110> of<00:04:50.169> what<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.320> did<00:04:50.410> with<00:04:50.620> the

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
and that's kind of what I did with the

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.469 
and that's kind of what I did with the
floor<00:04:50.979> too<00:04:51.520> it's<00:04:51.639> my<00:04:52.419> best<00:04:52.720> little

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
floor too it's my best little

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.940 
floor too it's my best little
alternative<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.960> actually<00:04:56.410> putting<00:04:56.770> in

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
alternative to actually putting in

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.940 
alternative to actually putting in
flooring<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:58.030> this<00:04:58.180> house<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.470> be<00:04:59.620> very

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
flooring on this house it can be very

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.640 
flooring on this house it can be very
expensive<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.729> put<00:05:01.300> flooring<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.169> so<00:05:02.590> you

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
expensive to put flooring and so you

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.040 
expensive to put flooring and so you
know<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.280> think<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.240> best<00:05:04.450> thing<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.900> can

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
know I think that the best thing you can

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
know I think that the best thing you can
do<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.440> just<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:07.090> just<00:05:08.080> go<00:05:08.290> with<00:05:08.500> this

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
do is just to just go with this

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.500 
do is just to just go with this
I've<00:05:10.060> thought<00:05:10.479> about<00:05:10.840> using<00:05:11.320> this<00:05:11.919> as<00:05:12.520> like

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
I've thought about using this as like

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.350 
I've thought about using this as like
hardwood<00:05:14.550> but<00:05:15.550> I'm<00:05:15.700> not<00:05:15.850> sure<00:05:16.060> how<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:16.270> feel

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
hardwood but I'm not sure how I feel

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.590 
hardwood but I'm not sure how I feel
about<00:05:16.600> it<00:05:16.960> really<00:05:17.260> I<00:05:17.550> mean<00:05:18.550> it<00:05:18.789> could<00:05:18.970> work<00:05:19.240> if

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
about it really I mean it could work if

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.090 
about it really I mean it could work if
we<00:05:19.720> just<00:05:19.930> stay<00:05:20.200> in<00:05:20.260> this<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.500> different<00:05:20.770> color

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
we just stay in this a different color

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.340 
we just stay in this a different color
and<00:05:21.430> then<00:05:21.970> put<00:05:22.210> these<00:05:22.389> pieces<00:05:22.690> in<00:05:23.050> but<00:05:23.229> it's

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
and then put these pieces in but it's

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.439 
and then put these pieces in but it's
just<00:05:23.440> it's<00:05:23.650> not<00:05:23.770> proportional<00:05:24.520> although

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
just it's not proportional although

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.870 
just it's not proportional although
nothing<00:05:25.780> here<00:05:26.260> is<00:05:26.440> proportioned<00:05:27.250> really

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
nothing here is proportioned really

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.550 
nothing here is proportioned really
properly<00:05:28.360> but<00:05:29.110> um<00:05:29.880> yeah<00:05:30.880> I'm<00:05:31.240> gonna<00:05:31.450> go<00:05:32.260> sleep

properly but um yeah I'm gonna go sleep
