00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
shapes out of the fondant that I've

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.640 
shapes out of the fondant that I've
rolled<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:27.180> bowling<00:00:27.539> tool<00:00:27.960> I'll

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
rolled and then this bowling tool I'll

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.030 
rolled and then this bowling tool I'll
use<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.460> make<00:00:29.699> dents<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> eyes<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.590> then

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
use to make dents for the eyes and then

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.790 
use to make dents for the eyes and then
that's<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:32.759> I'll<00:00:32.880> add<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.480> pearls<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.559> them

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that's when I'll add the pearls for them

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.700 
that's when I'll add the pearls for them
and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.090> use<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.600> tool<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.530> other

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and then you can use this tool the other

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
and then you can use this tool the other
side<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> bigger<00:00:38.370> bowl<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.180> maybe

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
side the bigger bowl just to maybe

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.680 
side the bigger bowl just to maybe
flatten<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:40.800> edges<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:42.270> then

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
flatten out some of your edges and then

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.590 
flatten out some of your edges and then
I'll<00:00:42.809> use<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.320> tool<00:00:43.649> which<00:00:44.399> has<00:00:44.730> two<00:00:45.000> points

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
I'll use this tool which has two points

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
I'll use this tool which has two points
one<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> bit<00:00:46.530> thinner<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> bit

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
one is a bit thinner and one is a bit

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.330 
one is a bit thinner and one is a bit
thicker<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.120> I'll<00:00:48.809> also<00:00:49.079> use<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.980> tool<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
thicker so I'll also use this tool to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.930 
thicker so I'll also use this tool to
make<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.539> smiley<00:00:51.989> face<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.010> make<00:00:53.219> some

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
make the smiley face or just make some

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
make the smiley face or just make some
little<00:00:54.260> marks<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> animals

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
little marks into some of the animals

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.500 
little marks into some of the animals
instead<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.559> using<00:00:59.489> my<00:01:00.239> flat

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
instead of just you know using my flat

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.280 
instead of just you know using my flat
edged<00:01:00.780> tool<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:02.399> I'll<00:01:02.520> use<00:01:02.550> another

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
edged tool and then I'll use another

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.710

balling<00:01:04.290> tool<00:01:04.530> which<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.430> could<00:01:05.610> also<00:01:05.790> use<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
balling tool which I could also use to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.080 
balling tool which I could also use to
make<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> dents<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.650> I'll<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.610> the
