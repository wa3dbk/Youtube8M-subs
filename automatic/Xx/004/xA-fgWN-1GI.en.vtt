and then if you're able to on the set it

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.060

any<00:00:38.940> specific<00:00:39.210> part<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> research<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
any specific part from the research to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.270

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the actual image being produced it's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.979 
the actual image being produced it's
only<00:00:44.460> sort<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> part<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.690> find

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
only sort of part of that that you find

only sort of part of that that you find
the<00:00:46.140> most<00:00:46.320> enjoyable<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:47.100> rewarding<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> most

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the most enjoyable or rewarding the most

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010 
the most enjoyable or rewarding the most
terrifying<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.059> 25<00:00:51.420> minutes<00:00:51.690> before<00:00:51.930> you're

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
terrifying is 25 minutes before you're

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.299 
terrifying is 25 minutes before you're
actually<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.160> see

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
actually going to do it because you see

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.529 
actually going to do it because you see
if<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.670> works<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> lot

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
if this all works because there's a lot

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.819 
if this all works because there's a lot
of<00:00:54.690> people<00:00:54.899> involved<00:00:55.260> sometimes<00:00:55.500> there's<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
of people involved sometimes there's a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.020 
of people involved sometimes there's a
lot<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> money<00:00:56.070> world<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.520> really<00:00:59.670> depends

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
lot of money world and it really depends

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.130 
lot of money world and it really depends
on<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> context<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:05.869> think<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.080> think

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
on the context I think I think I think

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
on the context I think I think I think
the<00:01:07.500> most<00:01:07.650> fun<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> actually<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the most fun is to actually do the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.179 
the most fun is to actually do the
pictures<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.780> actual<00:01:09.869> scenes<00:01:10.290> yeah<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.100> think

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
pictures the actual scenes yeah I think

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.920 
pictures the actual scenes yeah I think
I<00:01:11.400> think<00:01:11.790> Hitchcock<00:01:12.119> had<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.420> kind<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.720> thing

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
I think Hitchcock had this kind of thing

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
I think Hitchcock had this kind of thing
that<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.409> know<00:01:13.530> he<00:01:13.680> hated<00:01:14.010> his<00:01:14.159> shoots

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that you know he hated his shoots

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
that you know he hated his shoots
because<00:01:14.850> he'd<00:01:15.150> drawn<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> lab<00:01:15.960> he<00:01:16.409> done<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
because he'd drawn it a lab he done the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
because he'd drawn it a lab he done the
screenplay<00:01:17.369> he<00:01:17.729> knew<00:01:17.850> exactly<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.450> was

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
screenplay he knew exactly what it was

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
screenplay he knew exactly what it was
going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> look<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.590> after<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
going to look like and after that it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.030 
going to look like and after that it
would<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.360> huge<00:01:22.110> disappointment

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
would just be one huge disappointment

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.380 
would just be one huge disappointment
because<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.340> could<00:01:23.520> never<00:01:23.759> actually<00:01:23.909> make<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
because he could never actually make it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.850 
because he could never actually make it
look<00:01:24.420> exactly<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:25.170> he<00:01:25.290> thought<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.680> should

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
look exactly what he thought it should

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
look exactly what he thought it should
look<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.390> well

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
look like I'm not like that at all well

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.749 
look like I'm not like that at all well
obviously<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.400> advertising

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
obviously if I do an advertising

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.100 
obviously if I do an advertising
campaign<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.240> want<00:01:30.420> people<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.780> respond

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
campaign I want people to respond

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
campaign I want people to respond
looking<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.619> oh<00:01:31.799> oh<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.159> god<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.610> looks<00:01:32.640> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
looking like oh oh my god that looks so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.810 
looking like oh oh my god that looks so
great<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.240> want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.960> buy<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
great I want to go out and buy that

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.160 
great I want to go out and buy that
that's<00:01:35.820> pretty<00:01:36.060> straight<00:01:36.450> forward<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that's pretty straight forward and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
that's pretty straight forward and
that's<00:01:37.320> why<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.579> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that's why we all do and that's that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.560 
that's why we all do and that's that
what<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.270> paid<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:40.040> when<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> comes<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.260 

editorial<00:01:45.570> work<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.610> think<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> more<00:01:47.759> complex

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
editorial work I think it's more complex

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
editorial work I think it's more complex
than<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.570> sometimes<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:49.649> people<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
than that sometimes you want people to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.920 
than that sometimes you want people to
identify<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> sometimes<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.689> want

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
react it in a different way I think it's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.530 
react it in a different way I think it's
like<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.459> don't<00:02:25.640> think<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.150> all<00:02:26.330> you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
like that I don't think you can all you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.220 
like that I don't think you can all you
know<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.780> don't<00:02:26.989> think<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.319> can<00:02:27.410> look<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.860> say

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
know I don't think you can look I say

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.080 
know I don't think you can look I say
but<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.319> think<00:02:30.530> maybe<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.250> lies<00:02:31.849> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
but I think maybe in that lies the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.490 
but I think maybe in that lies the
answer<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.450> your<00:02:32.480> question<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> way<00:02:33.319> that

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
answer to your question in the way that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.380 
answer to your question in the way that
I<00:02:33.560> want<00:02:33.890> people<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.370> react<00:02:34.670> in<00:02:34.940> different<00:02:34.970> ways

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
I want people to react in different ways

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.690 
I want people to react in different ways

then you meet people on another sheet

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.910 
then you meet people on another sheet
and<00:03:57.270> I<00:03:57.570> don't<00:03:58.080> think<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:58.350> what<00:03:58.530> do<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.650> think

about<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.340> would<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.670> really<00:03:59.910> think<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.330> very

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
about it would you really think and very

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.480 
about it would you really think and very
very<00:04:01.500> often<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.160> know<00:04:02.310> yourself<00:04:02.990> if<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.680> it's

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
very often you know yourself if you it's

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.320 
very often you know yourself if you it's
hard<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:06.030> be<00:04:06.210> honest<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.570> yourself<00:04:08.150> yeah<00:04:09.150> it's

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
hard to be honest to yourself but I

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.380 
hard to be honest to yourself but I

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
and look at stuff that I did two years

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.010 
and look at stuff that I did two years
ago<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.700> go<00:04:29.820> actually<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:30.330> didn't<00:04:30.750> like<00:04:30.870> that

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
ago and go actually I didn't like that

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.650 
ago and go actually I didn't like that
very<00:04:31.080> much<00:04:31.320> when<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.650> did<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:33.180> was

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
very much when I did it I was

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.630 
very much when I did it I was
disappointed<00:04:34.020> with<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.410> end<00:04:34.530> result<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:35.520> the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
disappointed with the end result you the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.070 
disappointed with the end result you the
process<00:04:35.880> might<00:04:36.180> have<00:04:36.300> been<00:04:36.419> fine<00:04:36.660> but<00:04:36.870> in<00:04:36.990> the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
process might have been fine but in the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.920 
process might have been fine but in the
end<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.320> not<00:04:38.000> feel<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.210> quite<00:04:39.540> managed

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
end you not feel that you quite managed

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.320 
end you not feel that you quite managed
to<00:04:40.050> do<00:04:40.200> what<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.470> wanted<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.830> do<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:42.150> guess

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
to do what you wanted to do and I guess

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.409 
to do what you wanted to do and I guess
I<00:04:42.480> feel<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.840> on<00:04:43.020> many<00:04:43.500> levels<00:04:44.150> not<00:04:45.150> because

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
I feel that on many levels not because

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.980 
I feel that on many levels not because
it's<00:04:45.600> not<00:04:45.930> good<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:46.470> because<00:04:46.710> if<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.430> want

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
it's not good but because if you want

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.650 
it's not good but because if you want
the<00:04:49.640> level<00:04:50.640> to<00:04:50.760> be<00:04:50.880> high<00:04:51.060> I<00:04:51.300> think<00:04:51.510> you'll<00:04:51.630> be

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
the level to be high I think you'll be

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.300 
the level to be high I think you'll be
disappointed<00:04:51.900> quite<00:04:52.440> often<00:04:52.800> like<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.100> don't

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
disappointed quite often like I don't

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.950 
disappointed quite often like I don't
think<00:04:53.610> that<00:04:53.730> I<00:04:53.910> don't<00:04:54.240> think<00:04:54.690> it's<00:04:54.840> something

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
think that I don't think it's something

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.150 
think that I don't think it's something
you<00:04:55.200> should<00:04:55.380> be<00:04:55.500> scared<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.130> be

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160

you should be scared of to be
disappointed<00:04:56.669> right<00:04:57.120> because<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:58.169> think<00:04:58.350> that

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
something you think actually i might not

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.719 
something you think actually i might not
be<00:05:16.530> happy<00:05:16.830> with<00:05:16.860> this<00:05:17.040> in<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.310> end<00:05:17.430> but<00:05:17.610> i'm

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
be happy with this in the end but i'm

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.520 
be happy with this in the end but i'm
really<00:05:17.970> curious<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.510> see<00:05:18.780> what<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.080> process

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
really curious to see what this process

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.890 
really curious to see what this process
leads<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.190> if<00:05:20.400> i<00:05:20.550> can<00:05:20.760> do<00:05:20.910> it<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.240> i<00:05:21.870> think

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
leads to and if i can do it and i think

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.990 
leads to and if i can do it and i think
it's<00:05:22.260> much<00:05:22.620> more<00:05:22.919> important<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.490> be<00:05:23.640> able<00:05:23.700> to

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000
