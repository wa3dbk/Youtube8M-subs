 go along the entire Premier League weekend 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.350
 show all highlights of course 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 from first to the tub at all 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.789
 eyes are focused on the plaisir 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.470
 it was not all beautiful but exciting 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.000

 equalizer against the ropes 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.379
 so it was close after and so on 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.050
 Also this shot of klaassen were essentially 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.309
 then Veldman followed the one in 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.680
 not the nicest goal me the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.809
 most beautiful turned out in the Rotterdam camp 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.879

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.619

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.479
 Visiting heracles went freeze 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.090
 men with two one and thus strengthen the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.710

 for sure to drag in veneer bio 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.630
 but there is nothing final there 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.970
 dusty 3 3a therefore ended in one 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.670
 one and daan has been haggling since the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.649
 head of fraser always under beats 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.850
 We are completely hand that was doing 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.770
 two faces 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.810
 don't start it cheekily but after 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.060
 a bonus choose from cocu but is 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.090
 a completely different psd on the field 2 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.520
 point was this falkenburg 130 header 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.520
 but shortly thereafter two through the bye 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.090

 roda jc that is red back again 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.539
 injured themselves and so the six 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.610
 and defeats in a row seemed like everything 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.220
 what could go wrong 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.870

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.640

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.299
 repeated in this clean-up work 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.549
 elvis way out of his concentration 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.530
 to make the equalizer 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.939
 az rkc may not have sounded nice 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.860
 bike but that was it eventually 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.750
 on the team of lawyers lashed out 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.019
