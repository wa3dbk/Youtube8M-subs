00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.500
 the girls welcome to Thursday's 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.080
 tutorial on your channel nh 85 this video is 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.930
 in collaboration with my friend sand and them 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 I leave the link here on the screen and if 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.500
 you're on a mobile device here in the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.100
 information box for you to go and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.949
 the checks I start my makeup and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.320
 you know with my first if you do not have first 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.420
 you can use a corrector that is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.399
 thick so that it helps you that the shadow 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.399
 adhere very well to your eyelid 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.810
 then with a flat brush I will take 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.820
 a matt beige tone and I'll put it on 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.980
 all my mobile eyelid where is the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.130
 eyelid mobile before you bend 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.130
 eyelid is where the little ball of your 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.840
 eye where is the almond after with 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.030
 a brush to blur I'll take 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.420
 that powerful orange and what I'm going to do 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.540
 is to mark my fold I'm going to give it a little 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.229
 of warmth in that area and if you look 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.360
 just touch the tip of my brush or 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.540
 of the bristles the fold so that 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.940
 that the application is very light and not 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.580
 finish with the makeup as if it were 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.970
 for there he quoted then try to do it 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.369
 little by little and the brush grabbed him 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.350
 only from the farthest part of the 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.770
 bristles so that the application as you 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.170
 I say be light you can go adding little 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.020
 to little until you like the result 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.150
 being the twilight you got excited and you put 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.509
 You can also take a clean brush and 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.640
 only correct or remove excess 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.540
 shadow that you have put then I'm going to 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.299
 take a grape or wine tone rather it's a 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.580
 tone also came with a brush 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.960
 blur and I will place it only in 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.729
 the external angle 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.460
 I will be adding little by little because it is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.010
 a very dark tone or very 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.020
 dominant then I need to go it 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.750
 adding little by little until it arrives 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.200
 the desired tone since I set the tone 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.420
 wanted 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.459
 I'm going to come back with the brush that I put the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.990
 orange shadow but without adding more 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.300
 orange shadow only what I'm going to 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.530
 to do is to try to blur any 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.530
 marked line 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.359
 since you finished this step now what 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.909
 I want to take is a golden shadow but 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:30.700
 it has a sub-orange tone that is going to 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.790
 help blur the union of the three 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.719
 shades of orange and wine beige 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.620
 I'm going to apply it in the form of circles of 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:43.599
 lines as required 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.780
 right away I put my eyeliner you know 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.120
 liquid with tail at the end and in the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.019
 part of the lower lashes I'm going to 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.659
 first take the wine tone I put it very 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.939
 well along the lashes and for 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.510
 last to blur that tone came I'll 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:05.699
 to use the old golden tone that 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.699
 I said because I showed them in the video 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.640
 I immediately placed my false eyelashes 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.569
 and I put several layers of mascara on lashes 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.349
 inferior as well as superior 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.569
 remember that the names of the 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.150
 products I leave in the box 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.700
 information now after having done 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.250
 all my makeup routine I used the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.650
 blush the blush if you notice them I kept them 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.959
 matte and in light tones because what 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.380
 I want to highlight in this makeup are 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.060
 my lips my lips right now 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.680
 autumn walks of much fashionable colors 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.680
 dark and in matte type then I used 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.620
 a cranberry tone I placed it very well in 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.280
 my lips so that it will stand out like 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.630
 I said is now the trend or the fashion of 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.000
