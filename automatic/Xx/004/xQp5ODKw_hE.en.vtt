00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.420
 Yes it is now in the chiller 3.0 premium comfort 3 liter v 6 now 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.639
 Loaded a supercharger 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.639
 Try to test drive the future to xf 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.830
 eh 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:29.940
 3.0 v6 with a supercharger attached 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 I am riding 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:41.700
 The biggest difference in comparison with the straight four is that after that the displacement is large then 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 It is to say there is still room due to the fact there are many cars of the dead 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.280
 The power is also strong from the lower side because it has a Pawawa supercharger. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.300
 Because 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.120
 Even when or trying to overtake 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.600
 I can pull out the effort instantly 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:06.619
 Heart it from no shortage was from barely 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.330
 Transmission is also here of matching at the same 8 series Eddie and went into the armed degree 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.790
 It is very good too 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 Asoku native is very 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.920
 Widely allowable range 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.229
 It is for this engine because it can be compatible with various engines 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.229
 I think it can be said that the matching is also good 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:36.780
 6 par basis Nyanmo waiting for you is Kedomo much climbing now you come to work has continued 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.760
 There is no problem with tags 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.520
 The effort and enough power in the need 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.540
 Says originally Which whether Tteyuu xf with respect to get it you can &amp; ring 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.540
 I hope sporty and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.820
 Even if you cut in with a woman 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.700
 Body many rolls 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:05.870
 There is almost no such thing that the body shakes a lot 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.020
 Just like the road surface and direction book parallel 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:14.160
 In the body is gradually turning while keeping 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.990
 Riding have been You can turn off the handle with confidence 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:24.490
 From now on, the transmission also has a director's paddle and I can do a manual shift. 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:28.000
 Even if it is running as it is in Dew mode, it is dark blue 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.830
 I think you can enjoy running 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.960
 In two to now go 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.040
 No problem to the 2-liter and 3 both-liter engine to power-related, which are stacked 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.270
 Though 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.270
 The difference between Naoshi and blog 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.880
 One is the sound of this engine after all if it is Jaguar's force 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.800
 That unique 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:57.380
 That without slipping as in we were the engine this speed increase 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.470
 It will be amplified in late volume 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.370
 This is a straight-forward engine and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:12.260
 It is quite good to say that the note is in a different place 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.260
 Driving of either of us liven up the atmosphere because it is continued sporty sound negative
