00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.349 

so<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.590> got<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:05.009> system<00:00:05.460> set<00:00:05.700> up<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.000> my<00:00:06.120> grow

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
so I got my system set up in my grow

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.560 
so I got my system set up in my grow
tent<00:00:06.689> now<00:00:07.490> last<00:00:08.490> time<00:00:08.639> we<00:00:08.790> just<00:00:09.330> had

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
tent now last time we just had

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.629 
tent now last time we just had
everything<00:00:09.960> sort<00:00:10.379> of<00:00:10.469> put<00:00:10.620> together<00:00:10.770> but<00:00:11.400> now

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
everything sort of put together but now

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.640 
everything sort of put together but now
I<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:14.540> tote<00:00:15.540> filled<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.380> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
I have the tote filled up with the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.850 
I have the tote filled up with the
nutrient<00:00:17.400> water

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.610 

and<00:00:20.950> you<00:00:21.730> can<00:00:21.910> see<00:00:22.210> that<00:00:22.450> the<00:00:22.630> bubbler<00:00:23.050> inside

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
and you can see that the bubbler inside

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.060 
and you can see that the bubbler inside
there<00:00:23.920> is<00:00:24.130> bubbling<00:00:24.640> away<00:00:24.760> quite<00:00:25.270> nicely<00:00:25.570> so

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
there is bubbling away quite nicely so

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.680 
there is bubbling away quite nicely so
we<00:00:27.070> have<00:00:27.280> we<00:00:27.880> have<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.120> system<00:00:28.450> up<00:00:28.600> and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
we have we have the system up and

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.990 
we have we have the system up and
running<00:00:28.780> now<00:00:29.200> and<00:00:29.470> I'm<00:00:30.190> ready<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.520> do<00:00:30.760> some

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
running now and I'm ready to do some

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.970 
running now and I'm ready to do some
planting<00:00:31.300> but<00:00:31.900> one<00:00:32.080> of<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.260> things<00:00:32.529> I<00:00:32.680> want<00:00:32.890> to

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
planting but one of the things I want to

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.630 
planting but one of the things I want to
do<00:00:33.100> first<00:00:33.610> is<00:00:33.850> I<00:00:34.540> have<00:00:34.810> a<00:00:34.840> little<00:00:36.480> thermometer

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
do first is I have a little thermometer

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.479 
do first is I have a little thermometer
that<00:00:39.640> I've<00:00:39.820> placed<00:00:40.090> in<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.480> water<00:00:40.690> just<00:00:41.170> to

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
that I've placed in the water just to

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.890 
that I've placed in the water just to
get<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.550> sense<00:00:42.850> of<00:00:42.970> where<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.239> temperature<00:00:43.780> is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
get a sense of where the temperature is

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.810 
get a sense of where the temperature is
at<00:00:44.080> so<00:00:44.530> we're<00:00:45.309> at<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:48.430> about<00:00:49.290> 65<00:00:50.290> degrees

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
at so we're at just about 65 degrees

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.110 
at so we're at just about 65 degrees
Fahrenheit

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.680 

and<00:00:58.120> about<00:00:59.790> 19<00:01:00.790> degrees<00:01:01.780> Celsius<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:03.690> that's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
and about 19 degrees Celsius so that's

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.990 
and about 19 degrees Celsius so that's
not<00:01:04.930> too<00:01:05.170> too<00:01:05.380> bad<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:06.070> I'm<00:01:06.160> going<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.399> leave

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
not too too bad so I'm going to leave

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.219 
not too too bad so I'm going to leave
that<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.479> there<00:01:09.300> we'll<00:01:10.300> go<00:01:10.450> ahead<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.750> put<00:01:11.050> the

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
that in there we'll go ahead and put the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:20.590 
that in there we'll go ahead and put the
top<00:01:12.040> back<00:01:12.070> on

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.500 

now<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:21.170> wanted<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.590> show<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.880> inside<00:01:23.000> of

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
now I wanted to show you the inside of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.710 
now I wanted to show you the inside of
the<00:01:23.690> pots<00:01:24.409> here<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:25.550> can<00:01:25.729> see<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:26.300> we<00:01:26.510> have

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
the pots here you can see that we have

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.620 
the pots here you can see that we have
the<00:01:27.170> water<00:01:27.440> level<00:01:27.920> inside<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.880> pots<00:01:29.120> coming

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the water level inside the pots coming

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.090 
the water level inside the pots coming
up<00:01:30.340> about<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.400> centimeter<00:01:32.090> or<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.140> up<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
up about a centimeter or so up to the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.000 
up about a centimeter or so up to the
top<00:01:34.310> or<00:01:34.670> up<00:01:34.880> from<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.390> bottom<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.900> pots<00:01:36.140> so

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
top or up from the bottom of the pots so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.130 
top or up from the bottom of the pots so
that's<00:01:37.580> going<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.910> just<00:01:38.090> help<00:01:38.210> wick<00:01:38.660> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
that's going to just help wick the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.400 
that's going to just help wick the
moisture<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.759> nutrients<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.540> through<00:01:42.259> the

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
moisture and nutrients up through the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.230 
moisture and nutrients up through the
hydrant<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.070> when<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:43.400> get<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.670> put<00:01:43.880> into<00:01:44.030> the

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
hydrant and when we get it put into the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.090 
hydrant and when we get it put into the
system<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:44.960> that's<00:01:45.290> going<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.619> be<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.890> next

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
system so that's going to be the next

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.410 
system so that's going to be the next
step<00:01:46.400> here<00:01:47.950> okay<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:48.979> in<00:01:49.400> my<00:01:49.430> bucket<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.180> have

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
step here okay so in my bucket I have

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.499 
step here okay so in my bucket I have
some<00:01:50.979> I'd<00:01:51.979> rotten<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.700> just<00:01:52.940> finished

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
some I'd rotten that I just finished

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.779 
some I'd rotten that I just finished
washing<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:54.860> want<00:01:55.039> to<00:01:55.130> make<00:01:55.220> sure<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.640> you

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
pots just sort of to where the water

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:28.980 
pots just sort of to where the water
level<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:11.019> coming<00:02:12.019> up

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.420 

okay<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:30.340> I'm<00:02:30.730> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.060> go<00:02:31.210> ahead<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:32.430> place

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
okay so I'm going to go ahead and place

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.930 
okay so I'm going to go ahead and place
my<00:02:35.790> seedlings<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:38.940> rockwool

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
my seedlings that I have in the rockwool

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.040 
my seedlings that I have in the rockwool
cubes<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.920> inside<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.130> pots<00:02:42.340> now

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.330
