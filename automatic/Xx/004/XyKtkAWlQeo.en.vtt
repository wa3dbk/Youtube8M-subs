00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
but what was Superman Returns

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.400 
but what was Superman Returns
it<00:02:12.860> was<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.190> character<00:02:13.640> study<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.720> god<00:02:15.020> man

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
it was a character study of a god man

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.050 
it was a character study of a god man
who<00:02:15.650> doesn't<00:02:15.920> know<00:02:16.220> his<00:02:16.400> place<00:02:16.460> in<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.910> world

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
who doesn't know his place in the world

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.450 
who doesn't know his place in the world
anyway<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.080> was<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.230> brand<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.800> thought<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> very

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
anyway it was a brand I thought a very

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.240 
anyway it was a brand I thought a very
clever<00:02:19.820> one<00:02:20.090> yes<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.630> had<00:02:20.900> its<00:02:21.250> weaknesses

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
clever one yes it had its weaknesses

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.520 
clever one yes it had its weaknesses
absolutely<00:02:23.210> but<00:02:23.990> if<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.140> take<00:02:24.290> away<00:02:24.350> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
absolutely but if you take away the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.290 
absolutely but if you take away the
comic<00:02:25.010> book<00:02:25.040> expectations<00:02:25.850> from<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.180> I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
comic book expectations from it I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.600 
comic book expectations from it I
thought<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.990> was<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.200> really<00:02:27.320> good<00:02:28.100> character

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
thought it was a really good character

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.370 
thought it was a really good character
study<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:29.030> this<00:02:29.150> guy<00:02:29.330> who<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.630> basically<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> God

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
study of this guy who is basically a God

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.080 
study of this guy who is basically a God
who<00:02:30.770> could<00:02:30.950> crush<00:02:31.190> mountains<00:02:31.460> with<00:02:31.790> his<00:02:31.910> bare

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
who could crush mountains with his bare

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.580 
who could crush mountains with his bare
hands<00:02:32.360> but<00:02:32.540> doesn't<00:02:33.050> know<00:02:33.110> how<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.290> interact

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
hands but doesn't know how to interact

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.470 
hands but doesn't know how to interact
with<00:02:33.890> with<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> simplest<00:02:34.670> levels<00:02:35.000> even<00:02:35.390> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
with with the simplest levels even the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.390 
with with the simplest levels even the
humans<00:02:35.810> were<00:02:35.900> closest<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.470> him<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.950> thought<00:02:37.340> it

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
humans were closest to him I thought it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.800 
humans were closest to him I thought it
was<00:02:37.490> really<00:02:37.580> fascinating<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:38.360> level<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.690> it

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
was really fascinating that level and it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.200 
was really fascinating that level and it
sounds<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.200> JJ<00:02:39.620> Abrams<00:02:39.980> had<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.730> exact<00:02:41.090> same

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
sounds like JJ Abrams had the exact same

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.300 
sounds like JJ Abrams had the exact same
kind<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.780> notion<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.410> tone<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.830> direction<00:02:43.130> you

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
kind of notion to tone the direction you

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.310 
kind of notion to tone the direction you
want<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.550> go<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:43.880> what<00:02:44.360> he<00:02:44.510> wanted<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.930> look<00:02:45.110> at

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
want to go in what he wanted to look at

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.490 
want to go in what he wanted to look at
but<00:02:45.890> in<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.160> same<00:02:46.460> vein<00:02:46.880> if<00:02:47.150> know<00:02:47.690> if<00:02:47.870> JJ<00:02:48.320> had

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
but in the same vein if know if JJ had

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.520 
but in the same vein if know if JJ had
done<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.220> think<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.330> mass<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.050> fans<00:02:51.350> would

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
done that I think on mass the fans would

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.930 
done that I think on mass the fans would
have<00:02:51.650> her<00:02:51.740> rejected<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.370> just<00:02:52.640> as<00:02:52.760> much<00:02:52.790> as

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
have her rejected it just as much as

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.580 
have her rejected it just as much as
they<00:02:53.150> do<00:02:53.210> Superman<00:02:53.600> Returns<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.320> i<00:02:54.410> think

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
they do Superman Returns and i think

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.020 
they do Superman Returns and i think
that's<00:02:54.800> that's<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.160> shame<00:02:55.370> because<00:02:55.700> i<00:02:55.880> don't

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
that's that's a shame because i don't

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.190 
that's that's a shame because i don't
think<00:02:56.240> superman<00:02:56.540> returns<00:02:56.660> gets<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:57.050> credit

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
think superman returns gets the credit

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.920 
think superman returns gets the credit
it<00:02:57.410> deserves<00:02:57.440> amy<00:02:58.010> rose<00:02:58.220> yeah<00:02:58.940> i<00:02:59.180> also<00:02:59.510> didn't

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it deserves amy rose yeah i also didn't

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.630 
it deserves amy rose yeah i also didn't
think<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.350> was<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.500> disaster<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.310> i<00:03:01.370> think<00:03:01.550> you

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
think it was a disaster and i think you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.310 
think it was a disaster and i think you
made<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.820> really<00:03:02.000> good<00:03:02.240> point<00:03:02.300> i<00:03:02.660> mean<00:03:02.810> look<00:03:03.200> at

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
made a really good point i mean look at

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.500 
made a really good point i mean look at
how<00:03:03.500> far<00:03:03.860> we've<00:03:04.160> come<00:03:04.190> with<00:03:04.760> these<00:03:05.300> type<00:03:05.480> of

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
think that you know again it's one of

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.080 
think that you know again it's one of
those<00:03:30.860> things<00:03:30.920> if<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.400> script<00:03:31.640> isn't<00:03:31.910> good<00:03:32.000> it

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
those things if the script isn't good it
