00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.620
 Chinese I kept that leaves and 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:13.160
 the small stems only at chiseled as 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:21.369
 that we will have to admit 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:21.369
 minced onions a chopped garlic clove 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.649
 if shelled shrimps and without the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.119

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.970
 in pet peeve if you want me and 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.710
 after if you master the chicken you 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.790
 can put chicken put you the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.190
 meat you ultimately want 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.479
 it's the same base we need here too 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:52.460
 a bowl of rice in a bowl of rice rice 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:54.619
 scented an egg milk salt pepper 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.649
 I do not know if we will use it how 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.950
 will use red soy sauce so 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.729
 according to the salinity tomorrow or the other 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.300
 we will add in function and also 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.819
 ketchup 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.649
 why ketchup because ketchup 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.930
 will bring a little bit of acidity a 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.370
 little bit of sugar is and las torres which 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:20.560
 will we need for the recipe with the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.360
 jumping always so well hot 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.870
 but the equivalent of a spoon bit 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.020
 close to soup 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.150
 according to the tastes of oil I will do 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.150
 return first shrimp 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.470
 then we add live 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.810
 onion and cook well 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.430
 at 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:18.010
 in shrimp have almost made that 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.010
 we add the Chinese police executioner 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.260
 have pepper 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:42.459
 and we take them off I'm going to put 9 to 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.459
 cook 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:08.450
 we will do hooligan maneuvers in 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:10.810
 do we add the rice and mix 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.810
 all 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.950
 it is necessary to mix well we add 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.519
 shrimp garlic the onion and the 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.519
 group of Chinese 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:40.599
 add soy sauce equivalent to 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:44.139
 about a tablespoon this is the 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:47.639
 famous ketje to start the equivalent 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:51.960
 of a teaspoon of ketchup 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.960
 after we have just 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:04.229
 so once it's well mix I 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.229
 think it's good to taste 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.830
 it seems not bad for me so after 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.180
 if he wanted more sugar acidity and 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.410
 all of this you can always add a 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.150
 little ketchup had some salt sugar 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:39.080
 or soy sauce in your mouth 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:40.640
 so for me it seems perfect so the 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.790
 sautéed rice with shrimps and fat that 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.320
 the Chinese I put a small neighborhood 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.720
 of lemon 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.200
 it's better with a little juice 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.960
 of lemon 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.550
 it's more fun so what it takes 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.990
 know 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.180
 ladjimi of Chinese broccoli but if you 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.660
 do not have Chinese broccoli 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.210
 could use duck or 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.490
 the carrot any vegetable in 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.780
 room counts the base its laurels the 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.700
 shrimp onions garlic ketchup and the 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.660
 small basic sauces 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.660
