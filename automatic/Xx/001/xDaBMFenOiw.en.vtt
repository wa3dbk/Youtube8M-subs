to the iphone 4 nearly identical there's

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.240 
to the iphone 4 nearly identical there's
only<00:00:14.509> one<00:00:14.629> small<00:00:15.320> difference<00:00:15.589> you'll<00:00:15.950> notice

only one small difference you'll notice
there's<00:00:16.430> a<00:00:16.490> line<00:00:16.760> on<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:17.150> top<00:00:17.360> of<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.780> top<00:00:17.930> of

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
there's a line on the top of the top of

the<00:00:18.140> middle<00:00:18.380> band<00:00:18.560> here<00:00:18.860> and<00:00:19.130> on<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:19.250> other

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
the middle band here and on the other

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.450 
the middle band here and on the other
side<00:00:19.790> that's<00:00:20.480> because<00:00:20.870> the<00:00:21.020> iphone<00:00:21.560> 4s<00:00:22.130> has

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460

two antennas and it can switch between

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.920 
two antennas and it can switch between
them<00:00:25.310> during<00:00:25.640> a<00:00:25.790> call<00:00:26.000> so<00:00:26.240> once<00:00:26.420> for<00:00:26.600> sending

even use it for if you need to do a

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.190 
even use it for if you need to do a
quick<00:03:34.510> conversion<00:03:34.930> for<00:03:35.320> example<00:03:36.959> how<00:03:37.959> many

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
quick conversion for example how many

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:47.280 
quick conversion for example how many
centimeters<00:03:38.769> in<00:03:39.370> 12<00:03:40.209> inches<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:47.200> it's

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
centimeters in 12 inches so it's

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.360 
centimeters in 12 inches so it's
thinking<00:03:47.590> about<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:47.980> about<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:51.690> thinking

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
thinking about it about that thinking

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.890 
thinking about it about that thinking
here<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.820> giving<00:03:55.060> us<00:03:55.150> an<00:03:55.239> answer<00:03:55.390> 12

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
here it is is giving us an answer 12

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.460 
here it is is giving us an answer 12
inches<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.320> centimeters<00:03:57.150> 30.4<00:03:58.150> 8<00:03:58.470> centimeters

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
inches to centimeters 30.4 8 centimeters

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.470 
inches to centimeters 30.4 8 centimeters
so<00:03:59.709> this<00:04:00.160> kind<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.519> conversion<00:04:01.030> can<00:04:01.180> be<00:04:01.269> used

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
so this kind of conversion can be used

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.850 
so this kind of conversion can be used
even<00:04:01.690> while<00:04:01.930> you're<00:04:02.080> traveling<00:04:02.260> safe<00:04:02.680> you

a<00:04:06.400> hundred<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:06.910> fifty<00:04:07.269> dollars<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:07.900> US

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
a hundred and fifty dollars in US

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:18.870 
a hundred and fifty dollars in US
currency<00:04:16.799> here<00:04:17.799> we<00:04:17.919> go<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.250> given<00:04:18.549> us<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
150 us Australian to us is $149 51 so

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.920 
150 us Australian to us is $149 51 so
it's<00:04:23.680> got<00:04:23.800> today's<00:04:24.160> currency<00:04:24.669> quote<00:04:25.030> based<00:04:25.660> on

it's got today's currency quote based on

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.720 
it's got today's currency quote based on
that<00:04:26.020> it's<00:04:26.200> given<00:04:26.470> us<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.740> answer

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
that it's given us that answer

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.880 
that it's given us that answer
so<00:04:27.820> it's<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.600> great<00:04:28.810> way<00:04:28.960> for<00:04:29.020> not<00:04:29.350> only<00:04:29.470> finding

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
so it's a great way for not only finding

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.500 
so it's a great way for not only finding
out<00:04:30.010> information<00:04:30.220> doing<00:04:30.640> conversions<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.390> the
