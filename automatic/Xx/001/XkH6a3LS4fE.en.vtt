00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.090
 I greet you friends with you lyudmila 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.390
 miller theme of our occupation 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.230
 how to create a banner for this we 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.980
 let's use the tucson service . 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.970
 no free online application service 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 and in order to create a banner 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.770
 we need to click on the create gif button 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.890
 animation 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 we have a field of 8 steps which 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 we will now go through step 1 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.649
 upload files I have prepared to my 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.200
 computer some pictures 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:57.989
 one size we use three and 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:02.010
 now we will upload all three pictures here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:09.140
 Load the first image is loaded 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.140
 next and one more 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:33.630
 so there are three pictures the next step 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:35.670
 give the name of the animation step 3 we have to 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.679
 enter the interval between frames in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.200
 milliseconds this field is 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.479
 compulsory 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.770
 that is, it is the rate of change of shift 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.819
 default pictures is 500 add 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.819
 let's put a thousand 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:57.200
 because our pictures have text 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.280
 and you need to have time to read it 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.789
 further step 4 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.700
 width height our pictures have size 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.220
 now if we hover we see sizes 125 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.060
 on 125 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.579
 let's put a little bit more introduce 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.209
 150 to 150 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.579
 step 5 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.609
 this parameter determines whether 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:31.230
 the animation is constantly repeated that is 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:35.190
 three pictures 123 changed if pass 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.440
 repetition goes then goes 123 123 123 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.730
 and so endlessly that is us 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.500
 it is necessary to put a tick if it is not 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.970
 step 6 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.600
 parameter determines whether the animation 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.670
 available for viewing in the gallery let 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.980
 people are watching 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.859
 step 7 you can choose the effect that you 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.370
 want to apply to this animation you can 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.620
 set flowers make shades 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.900
 gray hearts we do not need us 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.349
 need a simple option, that is, choose 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.930
 no effect and next step 8 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.930
 we press the create button 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.240
 and now we can see what we have 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.580
 it turned out in my 1000 milliseconds 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.150
 enough to read 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:30.460
 if you see that you are missing 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.580
 time we can go down below and 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.390
 make a change that is put here 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.630
 see changes in animation parameters 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:45.790
 name interval milliseconds can 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.790
 put let's say a thousand three hundred and 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.620
 save the changes and now our 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.730
 the picture will move a little bit 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:07.270
 faster than before 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.130
 in principle, everything can be read 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.620
 then we have to save the picture 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.700
 what can we do can we just 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.730
 download or take html code choose on 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.560
 your taste as I say this picture 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.860
 I download the form and we open it 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.150
 save 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:37.150
 let's see what we got in the end 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.150
 Here we have such a banner and 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:46.280
 so with the tucson service. no, us 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.580
 created our banner 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.960
 literally 5 minutes with you was lyudmila 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:57.730
