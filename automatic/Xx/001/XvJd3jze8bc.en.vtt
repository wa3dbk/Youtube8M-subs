use<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> hello<00:02:26.519> horn<00:02:26.790> relay<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.299> delete<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
use the hello horn relay and delete it

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.190 
use the hello horn relay and delete it
out<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.860> factory<00:02:29.670> fuse<00:02:30.269> box<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.989> i'm<00:02:31.079> going

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
out of the factory fuse box so i'm going

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.190 
out of the factory fuse box so i'm going
to<00:02:31.349> combine<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.420> relay<00:02:33.690> box<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.170> a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to combine the little relay box and a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.720 
to combine the little relay box and a
large<00:02:34.379> relay<00:02:34.709> box<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.159> not<00:02:35.280> only<00:02:35.370> mounts<00:02:35.700> in

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
large relay box that not only mounts in

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.710 
large relay box that not only mounts in
the<00:02:35.849> radiator<00:02:36.180> right<00:02:36.450> here<00:02:37.040> into<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:39.060> random

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
the radiator right here into just random

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.680 
the radiator right here into just random
relays<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.140> will<00:02:40.560> be<00:02:40.849> put<00:02:41.849> into<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.090> board<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
relays that will be put into a board and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.229 
relays that will be put into a board and
soldered<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.250> there's<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.579> to<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.700> a

soldered in so there's going to be a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.699 
soldered in so there's going to be a
little<00:02:45.540> tiny<00:02:45.720> board<00:02:46.049> it's<00:02:46.200> going<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.379> go<00:02:46.500> back

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
little tiny board it's going to go back

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.380 
little tiny board it's going to go back
there<00:02:46.739> somewhere<00:02:47.220> next<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.060> ABS<00:02:48.840> unit
