I'm explaining it you can get the idea

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.660 
I'm explaining it you can get the idea
from<00:01:53.820> there<00:01:54.090> um<00:01:54.420> also<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.310> listen<00:01:56.610> too

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
from there um also if you listen too

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.550 
from there um also if you listen too
closely<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:57.929> tell<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.289> I<00:01:58.380> wasn't

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
closely you can tell that I wasn't

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
closely you can tell that I wasn't
always<00:01:58.829> hitting<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.250> d-string<00:01:59.869> sometimes<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
always hitting the d-string sometimes I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.830 
always hitting the d-string sometimes I
was<00:02:01.200> hitting<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.270> d-string<00:02:03.600> by

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
was hitting the and the d-string by

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.809 
was hitting the and the d-string by
accident<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:10.410> couple<00:02:10.920> times<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.459> hit<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
accident a couple times I hit the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.840 
accident a couple times I hit the
g-string<00:02:12.269> max

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.160 

it<00:02:16.850> doesn't<00:02:17.090> really<00:02:17.180> matter<00:02:17.420> those<00:02:17.780> mistakes

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
it doesn't really matter those mistakes

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.930 
it doesn't really matter those mistakes
I<00:02:18.470> mean<00:02:18.590> they're<00:02:18.770> they're<00:02:19.070> really<00:02:19.490> minimal

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
I mean they're they're really minimal

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.610 
I mean they're they're really minimal
and<00:02:20.180> they<00:02:20.480> don't<00:02:20.630> affect<00:02:20.750> how<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.350> song<00:02:21.590> goes

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
and they don't affect how the song goes

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.730 
and they don't affect how the song goes
at<00:02:21.950> all<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:23.570> this<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.840> your<00:02:23.990> strum<00:02:24.260> pattern<00:02:24.590> for

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
at all so this is your strum pattern for

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.890 
at all so this is your strum pattern for
the<00:02:24.830> whole<00:02:24.980> thing<00:02:25.220> like<00:02:25.400> plug<00:02:25.820> down<00:02:26.150> up<00:02:26.690> down

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the whole thing like plug down up down

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.180 
the whole thing like plug down up down
down<00:02:28.090> down

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.920 

one<00:02:34.850> thing<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.330> when<00:02:35.450> you're<00:02:35.540> playing<00:02:35.660> the

song will start on just playing a G
chord

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.289 

sorry<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:15.860> this

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.849 

if

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
if

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.940 
if
I<00:04:20.889> don't<00:04:21.519> know<00:04:21.579> how<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:21.729> sing

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:34.960 

so<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.190> I'm<00:04:26.280> actually<00:04:26.490> playing<00:04:26.820> wrong

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:45.760 

how<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.150> goes<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.630> nurse<00:04:36.840> d<00:04:38.150> c<00:04:39.289> g<00:04:40.550> d<00:04:41.870> dina<00:04:43.220> c<00:04:44.509> g

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
how it goes the nurse d c g d dina c g

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:57.530 
how it goes the nurse d c g d dina c g
deep

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.360 

and<00:04:57.750> that's<00:04:57.900> basically<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.530> speed<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.160> song

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
and that's basically the speed the song

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.040 
and that's basically the speed the song
you<00:05:00.180> don't<00:05:00.330> need<00:05:00.420> to<00:05:00.480> lift<00:05:00.630> up<00:05:00.780> your<00:05:00.870> first

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
you don't need to lift up your first

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:09.010 
you don't need to lift up your first
finger<00:05:01.380> like<00:05:01.530> I'm<00:05:01.710> doing

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.870 

so<00:05:09.650> there's<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:09.950> and<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.160> only<00:05:10.190> other<00:05:10.490> part

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
so there's that and the only other part

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
so there's that and the only other part
is<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.840> chorus<00:05:12.050> which<00:05:12.590> then<00:05:12.950> I<00:05:13.750> gotta<00:05:14.750> think

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
is the chorus which then I gotta think

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:24.160 
is the chorus which then I gotta think
how<00:05:15.050> that<00:05:15.200> goes<00:05:18.760> okay<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.660> it<00:05:20.810> goes<00:05:22.930> okay<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:23.990> it

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
how that goes okay so it goes okay so it

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:31.540 
how that goes okay so it goes okay so it
starts<00:05:24.440> off<00:05:24.560> like<00:05:29.980> every<00:05:30.980> I<00:05:31.130> gotta<00:05:31.280> figure<00:05:31.460> out

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
starts off like every I gotta figure out

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.920 
starts off like every I gotta figure out
the<00:05:31.700> course<00:05:31.910> sure<00:05:32.240> that<00:05:32.390> see<00:05:32.510> it<00:05:32.600> but<00:05:32.690> anyway

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
the course sure that see it but anyway

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.450 
the course sure that see it but anyway
that's<00:05:33.050> plenty<00:05:33.410> to<00:05:33.500> work<00:05:33.650> on<00:05:33.830> if<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.070> get<00:05:34.190> that

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
that's plenty to work on if you get that

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.170 
that's plenty to work on if you get that
stuff<00:05:34.880> down<00:05:35.230> you<00:05:36.230> will<00:05:36.710> be<00:05:36.860> golden<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.880> chorus

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
stuff down you will be golden the chorus

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.640 
stuff down you will be golden the chorus
will<00:05:38.330> be<00:05:38.420> so<00:05:38.720> easy<00:05:38.750> after<00:05:39.200> that<00:05:39.320> because<00:05:39.530> it

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
will be so easy after that because it

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:48.680 
will be so easy after that because it
just<00:05:39.800> goes<00:05:39.920> like

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.230 

so<00:05:49.290> it's<00:05:49.440> either<00:05:49.680> it<00:05:49.800> goes<00:05:49.830> C<00:05:50.280> to<00:05:50.460> D<00:05:50.640> and<00:05:50.910> then<00:05:51.060> G

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
so it's either it goes C to D and then G

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.360 
so it's either it goes C to D and then G
to<00:05:51.360> D<00:05:51.510> or<00:05:51.890> G<00:05:52.890> to<00:05:53.010> D<00:05:53.160> and<00:05:53.490> then<00:05:53.580> C<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:53.940> D<00:05:55.220> so<00:05:56.220> that's

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
to D or G to D and then C to D so that's

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.150 
to D or G to D and then C to D so that's
that's<00:05:56.640> really<00:05:56.820> it<00:05:57.470> what<00:05:58.470> that<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:58.890> hardest

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
that's really it what that the hardest

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.120 
that's really it what that the hardest
part<00:05:59.250> I<00:05:59.700> think<00:05:59.760> is<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:01.200> strum<00:06:01.500> pattern<00:06:01.890> and

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
part I think is the strum pattern and

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.920 
part I think is the strum pattern and
you<00:06:02.610> already<00:06:02.880> nailed<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.240> last<00:06:03.450> time<00:06:03.630> you<00:06:03.840> were

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
you already nailed it last time you were

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.380 
you already nailed it last time you were
over<00:06:03.960> for<00:06:04.350> a<00:06:04.380> lesson<00:06:04.650> anyway<00:06:04.950> uh<00:06:05.390> yeah<00:06:06.390> so<00:06:08.390> keep
