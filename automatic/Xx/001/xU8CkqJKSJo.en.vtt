00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hi everyone, how are you? I know Jacomini. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.899
 Blog I'm not Amelia Dotcom and I'm 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.480
 A little while is supposed to be 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.599
 Finding something strange in this video, right? 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.500
 It's the scenery and this beautiful wall here. 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.780
 behind me 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.300
 That's what I did so I did not do the wall. 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 but I did the painting is just that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.310
 I'm going to teach you in the middle of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.740
 today 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.990
 What I can tell you is that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.939
 it really is not such an easy thing is 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.130
 The truth is that it is difficult but requires a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.869
 little patience understood but you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 does your time have a weekend 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.890
 or friend calls the dog's mother friend 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.649
 anyone who has ability 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 to help or else does not even 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.579
 in the chest and in the race turn night painting 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.070
 This woman is because we can then 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.510
 I know this is not a video for everything 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.280
 The world may be that there is someone I 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.320
 I only spoke here with my god, I do not have 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.780
 patience but it may be that someone has 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.030
 there on the other side that your 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.340
 money that wants to change the room but not 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.170
 can make a big investment or 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.770
 so you do not know how to do something 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.439
 O different then if you're with that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 thing in the head that video came to 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.900
 change your life 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.400
 Hey you keep insisting that I 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.400
 I'll teach you how to do it. 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.890
 we will need a basis for 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.040
 cut or anything that is 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.899
 resistant to a stiletto or 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.960
 cardboard can not be a line has to 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.009
 be a little fuller gouache paint 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.009
 the color of your preference 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:02:02.780
 tape crepe pencil pencil ruler 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.450
 rubber and a stiletto but the care 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.509
 huh 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.039
 Let's get started, let's get a bad one. 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.410
 this triangle is what we're going to 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.360
 use to make mold on the wall 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.459
 I took the cardboard paper and I made a 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.950
 base of 10 centimeters 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.200
 I marked the middle in the five centimeters and 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.269
 Then I did another straight of 10 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.200
 centimeters for me to do the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.450
 sides 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.370
 This was the model I used during 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:38.930
 whole wall 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:42.730
 it's just you every now and then 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.730
 then cut with a stylus 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.090
 Okay, now we'll make a dash. 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.070
 a ruler on the wall to mark the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.140
 where the triangles will start is 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.280
 important you see this is quite right 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.200
 not to get crooked 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.660
 then we'll get the triangle and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.120
 It will mark his tip're looking for 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.220
 mark the space he will occupy in 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.690
 Then we'll take the ruler and 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.630
 linking these dots that people 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.580
 scored and is making lines to the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.750
 down in this scheme as soon as you 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.030
 ends a line 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.860
 You take the triangle, mark the tip and 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.330
 make another line after still 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.130
 are ready, we will use a 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.050
 the next way we'll go 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.630
 place the triangle on the wall and 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.450
 side turns upside-down and 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.880
 stay on another side turn it again 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.280
 head down and scratching the other side 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.410
 and do this until the end 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.270
 so there is no space between them and 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.490
 right a tip will meet with the 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.010
 another and the sides will be making a 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.690
 losango in the end we will see that it goes 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.000
 It's much easier for us to paint and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.710
 way you do not even 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.110
 this throughout the space that you 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:53.390
 be painted in the end will look like this 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.010
 done that we will start painting the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.720
 People are going to use crepe tape on the triangles. 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.540
 which are all blank 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.070
 so we will delimit this part 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.440
 that we want separated where the people 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.300
 will paint and where it will not be painted and 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.740
 tightly fasten the crepe tape so that the 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.600
 Ink does not leak 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.709
 after that we start to paint the 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.140
 next truck 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.590
 We paint from the outside to the inside. 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.930
 without following the line on the crepe tape. 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.320
 people are making this move to 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.030
 that the ink does not drain with this 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.370
 between the crepe tape and the 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.650
 wall at the time you push that one 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.080
 ink finish understood leaked 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.360
 so always do it from the outside in on the 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.280
 opposite where the tape is 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.100
 There you will give your 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.370
 inside when you're ready 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.220
 removes the crepe tape immediately 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.900
 Wait, dry paint, okay, just finished painting. 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.900
 picks up and pulls crepe tape 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.630
 It's as I already told you from outside. 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.690
 inside 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.130
 this part that already has the ink in the case 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.570
 here is a black triangle 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.980
 You have to finish with the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.710
 hand has to have a little more 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.600
 careful you leave the final does all the 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.450
 part you need with the crepe tape 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.360
 and then with the firm brush 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.520
 You make a straight dash for power equal to 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.960
 this ink that you have now put with the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.960
 ink that was before 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.130
 But slowly, you do not have to hurry now. 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.990
 only you doing it all through 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.300
 wall according to what you have 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.250
 want to play leaving some pieces 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.600
 in white interleaving the colors because 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.820
 they stay in a legal way 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.930
 looking like a pattern and you do it the way 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.850
 what you want 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.280
 after it's all right, people 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.560
 It is to crack removing the mark in pencil 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.660
 that may have remained or image that does not 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.660
 was made suddenly and still ready 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.710
 Hmm 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:05.559
 now that you've seen the making off you do not 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.929
 it's worth serious you suddenly go 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:09.969
 have another way of doing you can 

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:13.209
 can do with ruler with tape 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:16.179
 metric with the one that 

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:18.189
 if the name and you do not need 

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:20.110
 necessarily do in the same pattern 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.119
 that mine I know is a mean thing 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.489
 It's hard for us to imagine the colors 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:26.739
 This I left my standard ready 

00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:28.779
 available for download so that you 

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:30.969
 download and analyze if you want 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.499
 do like the suddenly change one thing 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.649
 or another but you have more or less one 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:37.719
 notion of triangles arrangement ok 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:39.399
 the link to download down here is only 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:41.529
 download and be happy 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.899
 Good, I did with you, by the way. 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.939
 because it is more economical and is 

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:48.789
 a washable paint tomorrow after I 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:51.339
 nauseating it's probably going to happen 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.800
 It's much easier for me to take 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:56.199
 so you can do either with low or 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.779
 with the wall-specific paint as in the 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.909
 if you quoted more purplish by talking 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:03.550
 in this any information about the ink 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:04.990
 Precious tips on how to do everything 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.759
 explained in the blog 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.409
 but if you still have some 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.139
 doubt is just leave here in the comments
