00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.579
 daughter of railway granddaughter of

 railway and former railway employee 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.950

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 huge joy 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.440

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.630

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.850
 and then from neuquen station with 8 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.170
 añitos when my father had asked for the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.180
 vacancy of neuquen station chief 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.610
 yes yes yes yes because I am very excited 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 I'm very happy the train is a medium 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.140
 of transport that should never have been 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.960
 raised is what makes the people 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.670
 grow up in fact have the proof is the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.310
 neuquen station in the middle of the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.580
 city and the train has attracted the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.140
 growth of this area this and when 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.479
 they raised the branches many villages 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.550
 they emigrated because the only thing that arrives is 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.050
 on the train to many places more I 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.060
 jubilo in railways is very 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.890
 excited you are taxes in very function 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.900
 well very happy because I'm going to look for 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.550

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.369

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.230
 used when history was altered 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.170
 because there is no money I come with my lady 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.540
 I'm going to travel by train because 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.810
 would just mitigate rail so 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.510
 I'm going for a walk, come or come, come on 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.220
 we came and we came for a walk and good 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.110
 I hope that they so that the four 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.210
 we know they were taking the ups 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.100
 in advance as well as another one 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.110
 we really do not take it out let's take out the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.840
 nice up here proud to be the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.360
 first day on the first trip to be able 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.800
 come with my son with my sister- in- law to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.990
 know what is normal is that they have to go 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.240
 well we put so we go pallete to walk and 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.070
 we come back in the same train most of 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.870
 the people if you are opting to have it 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.940
 goes up as the ticket is cheaper 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.980
 It is a much cheaper option for 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.500
 the pocket friend passengers has to 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.660
 support the cards on the sensor and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.850
 Once you have marked him, he gives you the pass 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.290
 to be able to get on the train the service that 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.300
 it is provided with its services 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.030
 cipolletti if we are going to be running are 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.650
 20 daily services the most humid range 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.090
 six in the morning until ten 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.519
 middle of the night 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.990
 how long the trip will last the day you are 25 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.370
 hard minutes 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.560
 we were so many people to be first 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.370
 well the truth is that it did not surprise us 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.730
 everyone 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.710
 at the moment they are taking the census of 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.750
 the amount of their were already selling 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.690
 We were really surprised where he's going 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.860
 to cipoletti to walk with a mention 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.000
 for the pure pleasure of traveling then 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:27.510
 accept everything well because no 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.950
 I was traveling if I remember a couple of times 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.350
 plus 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.270
 I understand that I am a knight for life 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.640
 good if it's for people who listen 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.230
 that you have to have each one your card 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.270
 personal reason why no 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.430
 take health and friends because we are going 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.650
 as experiences and politics and travel 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:52.200
 just a visit they are doing a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:54.350
 ride has been the first trip of so much 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.350
 weather 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.920
 as what is seen here as what is 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.230
 what you have to be prepared for 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.260
 start will have the doors closed 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.370
 which has closed a promoter so 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.370
 when I after the guard 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.050
 disappear 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.590
 in the world 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.610
 as I a reality will not be up 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.370
 of the train the truth 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.289
 not like the expectation because a lot 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.960
 people that 246 were many people in the 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.840
 platform on the interlaced platform that 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.060
 they were of the three had but the truth 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.560
 exciting a tremendous emotion that if 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.389
 we work a lot 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.069
 without element scales tear in these 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.629
 moments are taking 15 second 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.060
 strength be cover barrier more or less 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.650
 more or less if it is very little time that 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.020
 the barrier is so low when the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.870
 passenger train with the bridge is 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.729
 they would kill it's like this quiet is passed by 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.340
 now we are going to 12 with the bridge 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.629
 there was a five play speed like that 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.819
 that will come convenient either 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:24.800
 because we have more time left for the 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:26.699
 travel there is a lot of people's time 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.710
 applauding 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.650
 also so I wish I wanted it 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.199
 be an alternative transport with him 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.320
 together with transportation 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.320
 automotive 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.590
 it came out there was still not a little bit of 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:52.290
 delay if a program and the return to 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.290
 cabin to see again what happens with the 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.710
 people are terrible the celebrations and 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.710
 first 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.850
 in that experience 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.220
 how many years the finished ones work 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.140
 for 35 years 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.810
 well that's the end of this first trip 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.820
 Historical train of the valley lasted about 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.290
 15 minutes there was talk of 25 lasted about 15 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.870
 minutes the people very excited 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.850
 applauding by celebrating here the terminal 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.890
 of cipoletti a world of people 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.450
 waiting for the train and waiting to go up and 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.960
 many passengers to continue traveling and 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.960
 empty them 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.300
 my mind 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.610
 m
