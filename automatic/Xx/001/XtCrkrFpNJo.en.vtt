00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
think a lot of the shedding know does

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.380 
think a lot of the shedding know does
have<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> fact<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.909> don't<00:01:24.240> wrap

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
have to do with the fact that don't wrap

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
have to do with the fact that don't wrap
my<00:01:24.540> hair<00:01:25.009> therefore<00:01:26.009> causing<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
my hair therefore causing it to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.590 
my hair therefore causing it to
interlock<00:01:27.150> causing<00:01:27.540> me<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.340> detangling<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
interlock causing me to detangling and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
interlock causing me to detangling and
detangle<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> certain<00:01:31.979> degree<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.549> wash

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
detangle it to a certain degree I wash

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
detangle it to a certain degree I wash
it<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.689> reason<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.079> say<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it the reason I say this is because I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.350 
it the reason I say this is because I
noticed<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:36.360> when<00:01:37.049> i<00:01:37.079> wrap<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.409> hair<00:01:38.360> this
