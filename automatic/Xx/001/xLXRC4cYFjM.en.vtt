00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
much snow mean I think so many is really

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.180 
much snow mean I think so many is really
good<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:39.200> that's<00:03:39.590> basically<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.920> the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
good but that's basically it the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.590 
good but that's basically it the
reasonable<00:03:40.580> it<00:03:40.640> went<00:03:40.790> really<00:03:40.940> well<00:03:41.060> i<00:03:41.390> think

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
reasonable it went really well i think

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.860 
reasonable it went really well i think
it<00:03:41.690> was<00:03:41.920> 560<00:03:42.920> players

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
