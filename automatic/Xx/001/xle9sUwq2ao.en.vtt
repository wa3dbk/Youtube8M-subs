00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
everyone I work with is the Arnold press

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.049 
everyone I work with is the Arnold press
now<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.580> honor

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
now the honor

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
Arnold shoulder press is a modified

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.810 
Arnold shoulder press is a modified
version<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.670> dumbbell<00:00:15.570> shoulder<00:00:15.839> press

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
version of the dumbbell shoulder press

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.890 
version of the dumbbell shoulder press
that<00:00:17.820> was<00:00:17.970> actually<00:00:18.270> invented<00:00:18.539> by<00:00:18.600> Arnold

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that was actually invented by Arnold

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.019 
that was actually invented by Arnold
Schwarzenegger<00:00:19.350> hence<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.830> name<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.939> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
Schwarzenegger hence the name what it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
Schwarzenegger hence the name what it
does<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> increases<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.170> range<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.560> motion

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
does is it increases the range of motion

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.269 
does is it increases the range of motion
by<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:23.970> lower<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:25.080> duration<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.980> engage

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
by going lower and a duration to engage

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.670 
by going lower and a duration to engage
all<00:00:26.490> three<00:00:26.880> heads<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> shoulder<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
all three heads of the shoulder the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.250 
all three heads of the shoulder the
front<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.279> anterior<00:00:29.789> deltoids<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.929> middle

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
front or anterior deltoids the middle

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.090 
front or anterior deltoids the middle
medial<00:00:31.710> deltoid<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.030> rear<00:00:33.719> deltoid<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
medial deltoid and the rear deltoid so a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.530 
medial deltoid and the rear deltoid so a
normal<00:00:35.309> shoulder<00:00:35.640> press<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.390> by<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
normal shoulder press is going to by a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.020 
normal shoulder press is going to by a
large<00:00:36.870> work<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.980> medial<00:00:38.340> deltoid<00:00:38.670> which<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
large work the medial deltoid which is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
large work the medial deltoid which is
what<00:00:39.210> most<00:00:39.390> people<00:00:39.660> want<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> work<00:00:39.960> anyway<00:00:40.379> but

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
what most people want to work anyway but

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
what most people want to work anyway but
if<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.149> three<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.690> similar

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
if you can get all three in a similar

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.540 
if you can get all three in a similar
motion<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.620> still<00:00:43.829> use<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> fairly<00:00:44.399> heavy

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
motion and still use a fairly heavy

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.209 
motion and still use a fairly heavy
weight<00:00:44.820> why<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> big<00:00:47.010> fan<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
weight why not do so so I'm a big fan of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.029 
weight why not do so so I'm a big fan of
this<00:00:47.370> motion<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.820> actually<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.149> lot<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> fun

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
this motion it's actually a lot of fun

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.200 
this motion it's actually a lot of fun
but<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.219> challenging<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.059> range

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
but it's challenging because the range

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.209 
but it's challenging because the range
of<00:00:51.300> motion<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.690> quite<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:52.110> longer<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:53.129> what

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of motion is quite a bit longer so what

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.510 
of motion is quite a bit longer so what
you're<00:00:53.340> gonna<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:55.010> grab<00:00:56.010> yourself<00:00:56.370> some

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you're gonna do grab yourself some

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
you're gonna do grab yourself some
dumbbells<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.899> any<00:00:58.109> shoulder<00:00:58.379> press

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
dumbbells just like any shoulder press

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.959 
dumbbells just like any shoulder press
or<00:00:58.829> any<00:00:58.949> kind<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.219> dumbbell<00:00:59.550> press<00:00:59.789> with

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
or any kind of dumbbell press with

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.430 
or any kind of dumbbell press with
significant<00:01:00.420> weight<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> rest<00:01:01.260> them

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
significant weight you want to rest them

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
significant weight you want to rest them
at<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.100> ends<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.430> your<00:01:02.579> thighs<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:03.059> your<00:01:03.149> knees

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
at the ends of your thighs at your knees

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
at the ends of your thighs at your knees
so<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> time<00:01:04.890> comes<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so that when the time comes in the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
so that when the time comes in the
weight<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.720> significantly<00:01:06.720> heavy<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
weight is significantly heavy for you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.670 
weight is significantly heavy for you
you<00:01:07.979> don't<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.580> take<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.970> arms<00:01:09.680> drag

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
you don't have to take your arms drag

those weights up and waste a lot of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330 
those weights up and waste a lot of
energy<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.689> any<00:01:12.810> position<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:14.010> could<00:01:14.220> be

leaning forward like this I see a lot of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.660 
leaning forward like this I see a lot of
people<00:01:43.770> make<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.040> problem<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.430> want<00:01:44.549> to
