than<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.760> go<00:02:24.209> hunting<00:02:24.569> these<00:02:24.690> quests<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.680> it's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
than to go hunting these quests and it's

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.550 
than to go hunting these quests and it's
kind<00:02:26.519> of<00:02:26.610> interesting<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.959> will<00:02:28.440> get

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
kind of interesting because you will get

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.270 
kind of interesting because you will get
level<00:02:28.860> 97<00:02:29.580> before<00:02:30.180> some<00:02:30.659> of<00:02:30.780> these<00:02:30.900> quests<00:02:31.280> but

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
level 97 before some of these quests but

they<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.489> give<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.060> blueprint<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:33.659> free

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
they do give you the blueprint for free

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.649 
they do give you the blueprint for free
so<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.340> could<00:02:35.670> skip<00:02:35.940> out<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.269> little<00:02:36.420> bit<00:02:36.599> of

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
so you could skip out on a little bit of

so you could skip out on a little bit of
gold<00:02:36.900> or<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.319> skip<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.829> little<00:02:38.040> bit

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
of legwork it's completely up to you so

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.350 
of legwork it's completely up to you so
that<00:02:40.860> will<00:02:41.099> give<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.310> access<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.849> everything

that will give you access to everything
at<00:02:42.810> level<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.319> simply<00:02:44.010> get<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.190> level<00:02:44.610> 97<00:02:45.329> if

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
at level to simply get to level 97 if

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.690 
at level to simply get to level 97 if
you<00:02:46.410> want<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> get<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.769> most<00:02:46.950> functionality

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
you want to get the most functionality

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.190 
you want to get the most functionality
out<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.209> garrison<00:02:48.510> building<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.109> you're

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
out of your garrison building so you're

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.630 
out of your garrison building so you're
going<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.410> need<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.620> take<00:02:49.769> them<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.069> level<00:02:50.340> 3

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
going to need to take them to level 3

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.210 
going to need to take them to level 3
that<00:02:50.879> means<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.859> considerable<00:02:52.859> amount<00:02:53.160> of

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
that means a considerable amount of

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.819 
that means a considerable amount of
legwork<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.849> gold<00:02:54.480> isn't<00:02:54.780> gonna<00:02:55.109> quite<00:02:55.470> cut

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
legwork and gold isn't gonna quite cut

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:56.030 
legwork and gold isn't gonna quite cut
it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
it

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.640 
it
so<00:02:56.670> level<00:02:57.030> 3<00:02:57.359> are<00:02:57.480> all<00:02:57.629> tied<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.079> achievements

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
so level 3 are all tied to achievements

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.399 
so level 3 are all tied to achievements
and<00:02:58.859> these<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.459> based<00:03:00.000> around<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.959> building

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
and these are based around the building

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.940 
and these are based around the building
or<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.650> profession<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> building<00:03:02.730> suits<00:03:03.329> so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
or the profession the building suits so

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.009 
or the profession the building suits so
mining<00:03:04.950> if<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.549> want<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.879> get<00:03:06.090> your<00:03:06.390> level<00:03:06.780> 3

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
mining if you want to get your level 3

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.550 
mining if you want to get your level 3
mine<00:03:07.319> you'll<00:03:07.769> need<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.310> mine<00:03:09.060> 500<00:03:10.019> draining

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
mine you'll need to mine 500 draining

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.280 
mine you'll need to mine 500 draining
stone<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.549> can<00:03:11.819> be<00:03:11.970> done<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.569> Gatton<00:03:12.989> so

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
stone that can be done in the Gatton so

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.410 
stone that can be done in the Gatton so
you<00:03:13.349> can<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:14.010> without<00:03:14.220> mining<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:15.209> it's

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
you can do this without mining but it's

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.420 
you can do this without mining but it's
also<00:03:15.599> available<00:03:15.959> through<00:03:16.620> all<00:03:16.890> mining<00:03:17.310> nodes

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
also available through all mining nodes

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.729 
also available through all mining nodes
and<00:03:17.669> ran<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:17.910> meaning<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.780> miner<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.440> gonna<00:03:19.620> get

herb garden to get to level 3 you need

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.309 
herb garden to get to level 3 you need
to<00:03:24.930> get<00:03:25.250> 500<00:03:26.250> drain<00:03:26.459> exceeds<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.359> same<00:03:28.290> deal

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
to get 500 drain exceeds so same deal

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.619 
to get 500 drain exceeds so same deal
you<00:03:28.889> can<00:03:29.099> do<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.340> without<00:03:29.430> herbalism<00:03:29.879> just<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
you can do it without herbalism just a

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.119 
you can do it without herbalism just a
herbalism<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.410> gonna<00:03:31.919> do<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.310> far<00:03:32.940> faster

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
herbalism is gonna do it far faster

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.089 
herbalism is gonna do it far faster
