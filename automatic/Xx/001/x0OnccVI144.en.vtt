people know it consists mostly of the
bowel<00:00:27.300> 27<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> mean<00:00:28.439> if<00:00:28.560> you're<00:00:28.740> not

using the battle 27 well um good luck to
you<00:00:34.440> anyways<00:00:35.219> um<00:00:35.719> so<00:00:36.719> basically<00:00:36.750> I've<00:00:37.620> based

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you anyways um so basically I've based

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.889 
you anyways um so basically I've based
all<00:00:38.219> my<00:00:38.370> classes<00:00:38.640> off<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.149> first<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
all my classes off this first one and

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.110 
all my classes off this first one and
I've<00:00:40.590> kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.010> changed<00:00:41.309> each<00:00:41.489> individual<00:00:42.059> one

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
I've kind of changed each individual one

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.850 
I've kind of changed each individual one
with<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> sniper<00:00:42.750> class<00:00:43.079> which<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
with the sniper class which is more of a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670 
with the sniper class which is more of a
Search<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.160> Destroy<00:00:45.140> class<00:00:46.140> more<00:00:46.530> than

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
Search and Destroy class more than

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290 
Search and Destroy class more than
anything<00:00:46.860> else<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> rest<00:00:48.000> could<00:00:48.180> be

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
anything else but the rest could be

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
anything else but the rest could be
pretty<00:00:48.600> much<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.930> anything<00:00:49.110> mostly<00:00:49.559> respawn

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
pretty much for anything mostly respawn

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
pretty much for anything mostly respawn
though<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> first<00:00:51.600> class<00:00:51.780> i<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
though so for the first class i have the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
though so for the first class i have the
bal<00:00:52.379> 27<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.250> pretty<00:00:53.699> much<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.940> my

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
bal 27 with pretty much all my

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
bal 27 with pretty much all my
attachments<00:00:55.230> are<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.190> same<00:00:56.430> except<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
attachments are the same except for the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.810 
attachments are the same except for the
red<00:00:57.210> dot<00:00:57.390> sight<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> rd<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.550> BS

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
red dot sight which is rd so the BS

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
red dot sight which is rd so the BS
stands<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.300> blast<00:01:00.539> suppressor<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
stands for blast suppressor because the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.689 
stands for blast suppressor because the
only<00:01:01.559> something<00:01:01.890> different<00:01:02.280> from<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.640> one

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
only something different from this one

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.000 
only something different from this one
is<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:04.979> has

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
is and this one is that this one has

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.560 
is and this one is that this one has
blast<00:01:05.400> oppressor<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.390> has

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
blast oppressor and this one has

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
blast oppressor and this one has
hardwired<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.920> anyways<00:01:08.189> I'll<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.520> through

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
hardwired but anyways I'll get through

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.600 
hardwired but anyways I'll get through
the<00:01:08.880> class<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.500> battle<00:01:10.830> 27<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the class now it's the battle 27 with a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
the class now it's the battle 27 with a
stock<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.360> grip<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.750> quick<00:01:13.020> draw<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.470> feel

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
stock for grip and quick draw I feel

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.289 
stock for grip and quick draw I feel
like<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.400> make<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.760> gun<00:01:14.939> kind<00:01:15.210> of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
like it you can make the gun kind of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.690 
like it you can make the gun kind of
more<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.750> fast<00:01:16.140> paced<00:01:16.500> SMG<00:01:17.130> type<00:01:17.340> gun<00:01:17.549> with

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
more of a fast paced SMG type gun with

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.280 
more of a fast paced SMG type gun with
those<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> attachments<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.110> there

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
those kind of the attachments on there

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
those kind of the attachments on there
so<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.430> why<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.580> feel<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so that's why I feel like that's the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
so that's why I feel like that's the
best<00:01:21.330> way<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.799> perk<00:01:22.950> 1<00:01:23.159> slot<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
best way to go and for the perk 1 slot I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.190 
best way to go and for the perk 1 slot I
have<00:01:23.700> lightweight<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.210> flak<00:01:24.479> jacket<00:01:24.960> just

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
have lightweight and flak jacket just

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289 
have lightweight and flak jacket just
because<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.680> kind<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> necessary<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:27.000> helps

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
because it's kind of necessary it helps

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.090 
because it's kind of necessary it helps
out<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> lot<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.930> no<00:01:28.110> /<00:01:28.320> 2<00:01:28.500> slot<00:01:28.799> because<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
out a lot with no / 2 slot because I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.890 
out a lot with no / 2 slot because I
don't<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.430> any<00:01:29.640> necessity<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.540> any<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.750> those

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
don't see any necessity for any of those

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200 
don't see any necessity for any of those
with<00:01:31.770> perk<00:01:32.070> 3<00:01:32.369> toughness<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.000> blast

one which is the only difference is the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.490 
one which is the only difference is the

hardwired instead of the blast
suppressor<00:01:43.680> kind<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.640> mentioned

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
suppressor kind of like I mentioned

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.429 
suppressor kind of like I mentioned
before<00:01:45.000> we're<00:01:45.479> done<00:01:45.509> means<00:01:45.810> exactly<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
before we're done means exactly what I

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.950 
before we're done means exactly what I
just<00:01:46.649> mentioned<00:01:46.979> before<00:01:47.240> but<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.540> okay<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
just mentioned before but the okay the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.859 
just mentioned before but the okay the
only<00:01:49.140> difference<00:01:49.320> between<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
only difference between this one and the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
only difference between this one and the
blast<00:01:51.869> oppressor<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.310> has

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
blast oppressor one is that this one has

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
blast oppressor one is that this one has
trophy<00:01:54.030> system<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.570> its<00:01:54.689> XO<00:01:54.930> ability<00:01:55.290> instead

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
assault rifle I'll switch to this one

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.570 
assault rifle I'll switch to this one
because<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.120> feel<00:02:12.300> like

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
because I feel like

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.520 
because I feel like
put<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> lot<00:02:13.030> slower<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.690> zoom<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> lot<00:02:14.470> more

put a lot slower and zoom in a lot more

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.830 
put a lot slower and zoom in a lot more
and<00:02:15.190> just<00:02:15.310> play<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> lot<00:02:15.730> slower<00:02:16.090> pace<00:02:16.390> instead

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and just play a lot slower pace instead

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.330 
and just play a lot slower pace instead
of<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.020> fast<00:02:17.260> pace<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.680> can<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> quick

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
of the fast pace I can with the quick

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.910 
of the fast pace I can with the quick
draw<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:19.360> then<00:02:19.510> finally<00:02:19.750> I'm<00:02:20.200> ending<00:02:20.500> with<00:02:20.680> my

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
draw and then finally I'm ending with my

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.010 
draw and then finally I'm ending with my
sniper<00:02:21.310> class<00:02:21.610> for<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.910> bell<00:02:22.030> 27<00:02:22.540> with<00:02:22.870> the

Atlas as my sniper with the ballistics
cpu<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.710> chose<00:02:26.710> this<00:02:26.740> one<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.100> because<00:02:27.270> it's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
cpu I chose this one just because it's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.970 
cpu I chose this one just because it's
really<00:02:28.360> powerful<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.140> I've<00:02:29.530> done<00:02:29.680> very<00:02:29.920> well

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
really powerful and I've done very well

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.800 
really powerful and I've done very well
quick<00:02:30.340> scoping<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.910> everything<00:02:31.240> else<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.660> it

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
quick scoping and everything else and it

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.420 
quick scoping and everything else and it
has<00:02:31.930> four<00:02:32.200> bolts<00:02:32.530> instead<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.220> one

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
has four bolts instead of this the one

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.210 
has four bolts instead of this the one
but<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.780> could<00:02:34.930> really<00:02:35.200> use<00:02:35.350> either<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.740> one

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
but you could really use either the one

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.800 
but you could really use either the one
