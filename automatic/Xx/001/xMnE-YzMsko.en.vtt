sex<00:00:05.759> mascara<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.629> recently<00:00:07.200> got<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.099> I

sex mascara I recently got it and I
haven't<00:00:08.790> tried<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.120> yet<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.540> decided<00:00:09.929> why

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
haven't tried it yet so I decided why

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.810 
haven't tried it yet so I decided why
not<00:00:10.469> do<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> first<00:00:10.980> impression<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.639> can

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
not do a first impression so I can

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.089 
not do a first impression so I can
include<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.599> my<00:00:12.719> future<00:00:13.139> video<00:00:13.500> reviewing

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
include it in my future video reviewing

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.700 
include it in my future video reviewing
all<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.280> mascaras<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.929> from<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
all the mascaras so here it is from the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.349 
all the mascaras so here it is from the
box<00:00:16.980> basically<00:00:17.550> said<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.029> supposed<00:00:18.270> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
box basically said that is supposed to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.939 
box basically said that is supposed to
curl<00:00:18.690> your<00:00:18.750> lashes<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.470> supposed<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.770> give

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
curl your lashes it's supposed to give

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.300 
curl your lashes it's supposed to give
you<00:00:19.980> dramatic<00:00:20.939> volume<00:00:21.150> longer<00:00:21.750> lashes<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.650> of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
you dramatic volume longer lashes all of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.769 
you dramatic volume longer lashes all of
that<00:00:23.460> would<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.880> win<00:00:24.000> mascara<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.600> that's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
that would just win mascara so that's

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.240 
that would just win mascara so that's
what<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> test<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
what we're going to test out so this is

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.920 
what we're going to test out so this is
my<00:00:26.369> lashes<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.789> no<00:00:27.029> mascara<00:00:27.539> they're

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
my lashes with no mascara they're

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.330 
my lashes with no mascara they're
actually<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.560> long<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:28.980> they're<00:00:29.099> really

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
actually pretty long but they're really

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
actually pretty long but they're really
going<00:00:29.490> downwards<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> need<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.289> curl<00:00:31.529> but

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
going downwards so I need that curl but

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.959 
going downwards so I need that curl but
I'm<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> curl<00:00:32.279> my<00:00:32.369> lashes<00:00:32.399> because

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
I'm not going to curl my lashes because

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
I'm not going to curl my lashes because
it<00:00:33.300> does<00:00:33.690> say<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.200> should<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.860> by

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it does say that it should do it by

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.670 
it does say that it should do it by
itself<00:00:35.280> why<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.820> forgot<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.630> show<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.020> one

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
itself why do I forgot to show you one

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.229 
itself why do I forgot to show you one
I've<00:00:37.739> never<00:00:37.980> tried<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.309> before<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.030> that's

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I've never tried it before so that's

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.580 
I've never tried it before so that's
what<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.510> looks<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.110> basically<00:00:40.410> like

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
what it looks like it's basically like

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.160 
what it looks like it's basically like
an<00:00:41.040> hourglass<00:00:41.640> shape<00:00:41.760> which<00:00:42.719> I've<00:00:42.989> never

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
an hourglass shape which I've never

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.810 
an hourglass shape which I've never
tried<00:00:43.410> something<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.520> doesn't

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
tried something like this and it doesn't

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:54.980 
tried something like this and it doesn't
seem<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.210> at<00:00:45.450> official-official<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.500> yeah

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.480 

so<00:00:55.990> this<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.290> what<00:00:56.440> one<00:00:56.620> cook<00:00:56.830> looks<00:00:57.070> like<00:00:57.280> it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
so this is what one cook looks like it

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.000 
so this is what one cook looks like it
basically<00:00:58.030> gives<00:00:58.240> me<00:00:58.480> just<00:00:58.800> natural<00:00:59.800> looking

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
basically gives me just natural looking

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.340 
basically gives me just natural looking
lashes<00:01:00.190> nothing<00:01:00.850> special<00:01:01.180> it's<00:01:01.900> usually<00:01:02.050> the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
lashes nothing special it's usually the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.450 
lashes nothing special it's usually the
second<00:01:02.650> coat<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:02.950> makes<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.250> difference

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
second coat that makes the difference

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.330 
second coat that makes the difference
but<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.239> far<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.570> looks<00:01:04.600> pretty<00:01:05.560> now<00:01:05.950> second

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
but so far it looks pretty now second

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.160 
but so far it looks pretty now second
coat<00:01:06.520> let's<00:01:06.790> see<00:01:06.970> how<00:01:07.120> big<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.540> can<00:01:07.570> get<00:01:10.170> ass

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
coat let's see how big it can get ass

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.230 
coat let's see how big it can get ass
kereta<00:01:11.560> it's<00:01:11.710> freshly<00:01:11.979> open<00:01:12.550> I'm<00:01:12.729> kind<00:01:13.180> of

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
kereta it's freshly open I'm kind of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.600 
kereta it's freshly open I'm kind of
impressed<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.720> doesn't<00:01:14.229> seem<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.650> make

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
impressed that it doesn't seem to make

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.540 
impressed that it doesn't seem to make
my<00:01:15.790> lashes<00:01:15.970> stick<00:01:16.479> together<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:21.100> impression

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
my lashes stick together this impression

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.859 
my lashes stick together this impression
I<00:01:21.700> have<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.000> say<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.360> middle<00:01:22.630> part

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
I have to say that the middle part

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.420 
I have to say that the middle part
because<00:01:23.110> it's<00:01:23.260> shorter<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:23.920> feel<00:01:24.160> like<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.340> have

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
because it's shorter I feel like I have

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.330 
because it's shorter I feel like I have
trouble<00:01:24.790> getting<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.540> my<00:01:26.470> middle<00:01:26.649> lashes<00:01:27.160> to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
trouble getting to my middle lashes to

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.650 
trouble getting to my middle lashes to
make<00:01:27.490> them<00:01:27.640> separate<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.210> feel<00:01:28.390> like<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
make them separate so I feel like the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.690 
make them separate so I feel like the
they're<00:01:29.080> not<00:01:29.200> really<00:01:29.380> stuck<00:01:29.800> together<00:01:29.979> but<00:01:30.490> a

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
they're not really stuck together but a

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.639 
they're not really stuck together but a
little<00:01:31.060> bit<00:01:31.210> like<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:32.259> know<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.380> can't

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
little bit like you know I can't

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:33.990 
little bit like you know I can't
separate<00:01:33.070> them<00:01:33.190> properly<00:01:33.580> because<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:33.850> the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
separate them properly because of the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.630 
separate them properly because of the
brush<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.630> like<00:01:34.810> go<00:01:35.560> back<00:01:35.740> with<00:01:36.009> one<00:01:36.520> of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
brush I have to like go back with one of

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.240 
brush I have to like go back with one of
the<00:01:36.820> either<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.330> bottom<00:01:37.780> under<00:01:38.050> top<00:01:38.229> part<00:01:38.470> so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
the either the bottom under top part so

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.440 
the either the bottom under top part so
it<00:01:39.369> seems<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.670> have<00:01:39.759> done<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.910> really<00:01:40.149> great<00:01:40.330> job

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
it seems to have done a really great job

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.330 
it seems to have done a really great job
with<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:40.960> one<00:01:41.020> but<00:01:41.410> not<00:01:41.440> with<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:41.979> one<00:01:42.190> so

I'm<00:01:42.430> going<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.610> try<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:42.790> separate<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.300> little

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
I'm going to try to separate a little

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.719 
I'm going to try to separate a little
bit<00:01:43.660> my<00:01:43.810> lashes<00:01:44.050> with<00:01:44.229> just<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.830> little<00:01:45.340> calm<00:01:45.610> or

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
bit my lashes with just a little calm or

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.130 
bit my lashes with just a little calm or
something<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.539> it<00:01:46.750> doesn't<00:01:46.780> look<00:01:47.080> too

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
something just so it doesn't look too

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.249 
something just so it doesn't look too
crazy<00:01:47.590> but<00:01:48.039> I'm<00:01:49.000> letting<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.869> know<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.020> it

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
crazy but I'm letting you know that it

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.290 
crazy but I'm letting you know that it
tends<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.619> do<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.460> assumed<00:01:51.759> you<00:01:51.910> in<00:01:52.119> a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
tends to do that so I assumed you in a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.240 
tends to do that so I assumed you in a
lot<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.930> can<00:01:53.050> really<00:01:53.259> really<00:01:53.470> see<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:54.009> feel

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
lot so you can really really see I feel

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.980 
lot so you can really really see I feel
like<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.520> did<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> great<00:01:54.910> job<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:55.149> this<00:01:55.420> one<00:01:55.690> but

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
like it did a great job on this one but

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.300 
like it did a great job on this one but
not<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:56.380> much<00:01:56.500> on<00:01:56.649> this<00:01:56.770> one<00:01:56.950> it's<00:01:57.069> a<00:01:57.130> little

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
not so much on this one it's a little

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.609 
not so much on this one it's a little
clumpy<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:57.880> like<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.929> more<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.110> was<00:01:59.229> trying<00:01:59.500> to

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
clumpy and like the more I was trying to

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.590 
clumpy and like the more I was trying to
make<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.860> better<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.700> words<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.119> kind<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.390> got

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
make it better the words it kind of got

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.590 
make it better the words it kind of got
it's<00:02:02.350> not<00:02:02.530> bad<00:02:02.770> but<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.459> feel<00:02:03.520> like<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.360> could<00:02:04.569> be

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
it's not bad but I feel like it could be

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.270 
it's not bad but I feel like it could be
a<00:02:04.810> little<00:02:04.959> bit<00:02:05.110> more<00:02:05.289> separated<00:02:05.770> in<00:02:05.979> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
a little bit more separated in the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.430 
a little bit more separated in the
middle<00:02:06.580> lashes<00:02:07.030> but<00:02:07.240> overall<00:02:07.599> I<00:02:07.929> think<00:02:08.200> it

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
middle lashes but overall I think it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.050 
middle lashes but overall I think it
looks<00:02:08.590> good<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:09.099> will<00:02:09.369> update<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.670> at<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:09.910> end

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
close-ups it's much a little bit more

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.470 
close-ups it's much a little bit more
and<00:03:36.249> there<00:03:36.430> was<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.579> little<00:03:36.700> bit<00:03:36.879> more<00:03:37.060> of<00:03:37.329> a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
and there was a little bit more of a

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.839 
and there was a little bit more of a
flakiness<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:38.980> overall<00:03:39.340> I'm<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.639> little

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
flakiness so overall I'm a little

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.429 
flakiness so overall I'm a little
disappointed<00:03:40.090> about<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.139> price

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
disappointed about that for that price

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.860 
disappointed about that for that price
you<00:03:41.769> would<00:03:41.889> expect<00:03:42.310> mascara<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:43.060> be<00:03:43.419> pretty

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
you would expect mascara to be pretty

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.409 
you would expect mascara to be pretty
much<00:03:43.959> perfect<00:03:44.019> at<00:03:44.799> least<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.129> would<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.699> the

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
much perfect at least I would and the

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.659 
much perfect at least I would and the
only<00:03:46.750> other<00:03:46.959> thing<00:03:47.199> that<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.439> really<00:03:47.739> wasn't<00:03:48.400> a

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
only other thing that I really wasn't a

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.459 
only other thing that I really wasn't a
complete<00:03:48.939> fan<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.449> is<00:03:49.719> the<00:03:49.930> brush<00:03:50.199> just

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:50.469 
complete fan of is the brush just

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.099 
complete fan of is the brush just
because<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.489> hourglass<00:03:52.120> shape<00:03:52.449> actually<00:03:52.659> is

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
because the hourglass shape actually is

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.229 
because the hourglass shape actually is
not<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.560> easiest<00:03:53.889> one<00:03:54.129> to<00:03:54.400> grab<00:03:54.730> D<00:03:54.909> middle

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
not the easiest one to grab D middle

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.619 
not the easiest one to grab D middle
lashes<00:03:55.719> which<00:03:56.159> they<00:03:57.159> did<00:03:57.340> tend<00:03:57.699> to<00:03:57.939> clump<00:03:58.359> as

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
lashes which they did tend to clump as

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.720 
lashes which they did tend to clump as
you<00:03:59.169> saw<00:03:59.349> in<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.530> beginning<00:03:59.769> of<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.189> video<00:04:00.340> I

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
you saw in the beginning of the video I

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.050 
you saw in the beginning of the video I
do<00:04:01.120> like<00:04:01.659> how<00:04:01.870> my<00:04:02.019> lashes<00:04:02.260> look<00:04:02.680> but<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.639> think<00:04:03.699> I

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
do like how my lashes look but I think I

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.879 
do like how my lashes look but I think I
would<00:04:04.239> not<00:04:04.480> repurchase<00:04:04.689> this<00:04:05.199> mascara<00:04:05.620> and

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
would not repurchase this mascara and

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.309 
would not repurchase this mascara and
not<00:04:06.069> really<00:04:06.430> recommend<00:04:06.909> it<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.689> because<00:04:08.019> of

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
not really recommend it just because of

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.289 
not really recommend it just because of
