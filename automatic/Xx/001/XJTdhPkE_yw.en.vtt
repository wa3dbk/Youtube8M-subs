00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
my team came to me and said Bob I think

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.910 
my team came to me and said Bob I think
the<00:00:47.420> quote<00:00:47.660> was<00:00:47.690> you're<00:00:48.140> hemorrhaging<00:00:48.320> cash

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
and we're going to have to do something

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.690 
and we're going to have to do something
to<00:00:51.590> turn<00:00:51.740> this<00:00:51.950> around<00:00:52.100> because<00:00:52.430> we<00:00:52.580> were

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
to turn this around because we were

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.040 
to turn this around because we were
looking<00:00:52.970> for<00:00:53.090> every<00:00:53.420> available<00:00:53.450> dollar

looking for every available dollar

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.660 
looking for every available dollar
that's<00:00:54.410> out<00:00:54.620> there<00:00:54.800> truly<00:00:55.600> our<00:00:56.600> budgets<00:00:57.110> have

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670

private the last five years each year
there's<00:01:04.100> some<00:01:04.309> subsequent<00:01:04.760> cut<00:01:07.360> then<00:01:08.360> we

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
there's some subsequent cut then we

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.540 
there's some subsequent cut then we
started<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.990> implement<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.410> software<00:01:09.979> in<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
started to implement the software in the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.340 
started to implement the software in the
middle<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:10.940> those<00:01:11.150> very<00:01:11.660> beginning<00:01:12.050> of<00:01:12.200> those

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
middle of those very beginning of those

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.620 
middle of those very beginning of those
cuts<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.580> start<00:01:13.910> thinking<00:01:14.060> will<00:01:14.390> do

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
cuts and so you start thinking will do

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.590 
cuts and so you start thinking will do
is<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:15.410> worth<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:15.950> investment<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.700> spend<00:01:17.119> to

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
is it worth that investment to spend to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.870 
is it worth that investment to spend to
try<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:17.900> obtain<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.380> better<00:01:18.650> software<00:01:19.160> how<00:01:19.820> is

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
try to obtain a better software how is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.460 
try to obtain a better software how is
that<00:01:19.970> going<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.360> twist<00:01:20.720> them<00:01:20.990> that's<00:01:21.229> out<00:01:21.440> in

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
that going to twist them that's out in

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.350 
that going to twist them that's out in
the<00:01:21.680> field<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.160> how<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.880> fix

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
cases so looking at the pain points for

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.639 
cases so looking at the pain points for
president<00:01:32.630> state<00:01:32.869> obviously<00:01:33.200> work

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
process in a way that would make it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.749 
process in a way that would make it
either<00:01:40.580> interact<00:01:41.710> with<00:01:42.710> PeopleSoft<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
either interact with PeopleSoft the

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.700 
either interact with PeopleSoft the

everything was being built off to work
orders<00:02:15.049> correctly<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:15.769> could<00:02:15.890> get<00:02:16.010> the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
backtrack and figure out what happens

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.740 
backtrack and figure out what happens
the<00:04:55.010> accuracy<00:04:55.729> of<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:55.880> data<00:04:55.910> just<00:04:56.300> improved

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
the accuracy of the data just improved

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.200 
the accuracy of the data just improved
twofold<00:04:57.289> so<00:04:58.130> we<00:04:58.280> looked<00:04:58.460> at<00:04:58.580> all<00:04:58.700> of<00:04:58.729> that<00:04:59.000> we

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
twofold so we looked at all of that we

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.060 
twofold so we looked at all of that we
did<00:04:59.360> some<00:04:59.479> analysis<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.260> we<00:05:00.349> found<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.860> I

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
did some analysis and we found that I

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.890 
did some analysis and we found that I
desk<00:05:01.460> paid<00:05:01.700> for<00:05:01.910> itself<00:05:02.150> in<00:05:02.360> four<00:05:02.539> point<00:05:02.750> six

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
desk paid for itself in four point six

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.140 
desk paid for itself in four point six
months<00:05:03.229> under<00:05:03.620> five<00:05:03.860> months<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.639> investment

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
months under five months the investment

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.330 
months under five months the investment
we<00:05:05.240> made<00:05:05.419> in<00:05:05.450> I<00:05:05.720> desk<00:05:05.990> had<00:05:06.560> already<00:05:06.800> paid<00:05:07.130> for

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
we made in I desk had already paid for

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.250 
we made in I desk had already paid for
itself<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.849> as<00:05:08.330> far<00:05:08.479> as<00:05:08.539> we're<00:05:08.840> concerned<00:05:08.870> the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
itself and as far as we're concerned the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.580 
itself and as far as we're concerned the
rest<00:05:09.410> of<00:05:09.530> it's<00:05:09.650> just<00:05:09.860> great

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.770 

we've<00:05:15.550> just<00:05:15.610> seen<00:05:15.910> year<00:05:16.150> over<00:05:16.390> year<00:05:16.420> we've

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
we've just seen year over year we've

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.180 
we've just seen year over year we've
seen<00:05:17.020> no<00:05:17.170> less<00:05:17.410> than<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.650> twenty<00:05:17.920> percent

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
seen no less than a twenty percent

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.850 
seen no less than a twenty percent
increase<00:05:19.060> in<00:05:19.090> billable<00:05:19.900> services<00:05:20.410> here<00:05:20.590> over

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
increase in billable services here over

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.890 
increase in billable services here over
here<00:05:21.010> and<00:05:21.300> that's<00:05:22.300> taking<00:05:22.750> into

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
here and that's taking into

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.930 
here and that's taking into
consideration<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.590> fact<00:05:23.680> that<00:05:24.010> we<00:05:24.820> have

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
consideration the fact that we have

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.060 
consideration the fact that we have
fewer<00:05:25.240> employees<00:05:25.450> we<00:05:26.230> have<00:05:26.260> fewer<00:05:26.560> requests

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
fewer employees we have fewer requests

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.060 
fewer employees we have fewer requests
coming<00:05:27.250> in<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:28.330> really<00:05:29.290> we've<00:05:29.440> got<00:05:29.620> increased

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
coming in so really we've got increased

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.370 
coming in so really we've got increased
revenues<00:05:30.520> coming<00:05:30.790> in<00:05:30.970> when<00:05:31.270> there's<00:05:31.450> really

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
revenues coming in when there's really

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.560 
revenues coming in when there's really
less<00:05:32.680> work<00:05:32.950> to<00:05:32.980> be<00:05:33.220> done<00:05:33.370> which<00:05:33.760> is<00:05:33.790> just<00:05:34.390> huge

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
less work to be done which is just huge

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.380 
less work to be done which is just huge
so<00:05:35.290> it's<00:05:36.010> been<00:05:36.130> a<00:05:36.160> big<00:05:36.370> selling<00:05:36.730> point<00:05:36.970> for<00:05:37.060> the

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
so it's been a big selling point for the

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.630 
so it's been a big selling point for the
staff<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.110> because<00:05:38.860> where<00:05:39.040> we<00:05:39.160> had<00:05:39.310> a<00:05:39.340> lot<00:05:39.610> of

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
staff to because where we had a lot of

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.000 
staff to because where we had a lot of
trade<00:05:40.030> workers<00:05:40.300> supervisors<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:41.950> managers

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
trade workers supervisors and managers

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.240 
trade workers supervisors and managers
who<00:05:42.460> were<00:05:42.700> not<00:05:42.910> open<00:05:43.090> to<00:05:43.420> the<00:05:43.450> idea<00:05:43.810> of<00:05:44.250> any

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
who were not open to the idea of any

activities they were made to understand

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.870 
activities they were made to understand
pretty<00:05:49.540> quickly<00:05:49.840> that<00:05:50.070> if<00:05:51.070> we<00:05:51.280> got<00:05:51.460> an<00:05:51.580> extra

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
pretty quickly that if we got an extra

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.190 
pretty quickly that if we got an extra

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
there were people there we could look

customer service requests online and
then<00:06:39.479> it<00:06:40.479> just<00:06:40.810> gets<00:06:40.990> moved<00:06:41.319> right<00:06:41.560> into<00:06:41.740> a

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
then it just gets moved right into a

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.749 
then it just gets moved right into a
work<00:06:42.159> order<00:06:42.599> that<00:06:43.599> rate<00:06:43.960> that<00:06:44.259> that<00:06:45.099> traffic

work order that rate that that traffic

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.760 
work order that rate that that traffic
is<00:06:45.879> just<00:06:46.060> dropped<00:06:46.389> off<00:06:46.599> dramatically<00:06:47.199> and

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
is just dropped off dramatically and

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.679 
is just dropped off dramatically and
then<00:06:48.129> instead<00:06:48.430> of<00:06:48.550> it<00:06:48.669> going<00:06:48.699> out<00:06:49.120> on<00:06:49.330> a<00:06:49.360> radio

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:49.689 
then instead of it going out on a radio

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:54.330 
then instead of it going out on a radio
call<00:06:50.139> it<00:06:50.650> gets<00:06:50.919> distributed<00:06:51.310> out<00:06:52.740> on<00:06:53.740> ink<00:06:54.039> and

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
call it gets distributed out on ink and
