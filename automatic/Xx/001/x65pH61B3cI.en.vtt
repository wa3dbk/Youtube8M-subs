radiant energy so disappointed I

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.980 
radiant energy so disappointed I
couldn't<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.710> any<00:00:53.090> actual<00:00:54.090> raid<00:00:54.420> gear<00:00:54.660> for

alright<00:00:56.580> my<00:00:57.150> warlock<00:00:57.540> did<00:00:57.810> get<00:00:57.960> some<00:00:58.140> good

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
alright my warlock did get some good

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.500 
alright my warlock did get some good
stuff<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.890> hopping<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.490> first<00:00:59.850> part<00:01:00.150> we

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
stuff so hopping into the first part we

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
stuff so hopping into the first part we
got<00:01:00.720> shards<00:01:01.200> which<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> obviously<00:01:02.130> what<00:01:02.220> you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
got shards which is obviously what you

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
got shards which is obviously what you
need<00:01:02.700> energy<00:01:02.970> in<00:01:03.330> my<00:01:03.540> opinion<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.110> less

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
need energy in my opinion is less

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.249 
need energy in my opinion is less
valuable<00:01:05.100> than<00:01:05.280> shards<00:01:06.149> but<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
valuable than shards but this was the

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:08.870 
valuable than shards but this was the
good<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.469> that<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.340> happy<00:01:08.640> about

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
good one that I was really happy about

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.539 
good one that I was really happy about
so<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.899> took<00:01:10.109> him<00:01:10.289> out<00:01:10.439> right<00:01:10.649> here<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.399> got

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
so we took him out right here and I got

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.490 
so we took him out right here and I got
to<00:01:11.670> death<00:01:11.969> singers<00:01:12.450> mantle<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
to death singers mantle which is the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.770 
to death singers mantle which is the
Warlock<00:01:14.009> chest<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.359> pretty<00:01:15.509> cool

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
even though ahead strike that made me

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.230

the<00:01:47.159> ship<00:01:47.399> isn't<00:01:47.639> very<00:01:47.999> valuable<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.869> my

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the ship isn't very valuable in my

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.450
