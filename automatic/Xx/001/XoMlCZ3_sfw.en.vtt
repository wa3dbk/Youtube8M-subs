quadcopter and I got this from your best
and<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.430> purchased<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.119> own<00:00:15.150> money<00:00:15.420> and

and I purchased it with my own money and
I<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.930> want<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> say<00:00:16.350> um<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:17.160> um<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.789> thought

I just want to say um that um I thought

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.540 
I just want to say um that um I thought
this<00:00:18.330> would<00:00:18.510> take<00:00:18.779> over<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.740> month<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.189> get<00:00:20.340> here

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
yeah so that the instruction manual see

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.940 
yeah so that the instruction manual see
the<00:03:46.890> English<00:03:47.190> looks<00:03:47.490> like<00:03:48.950> mm<00:03:51.770> yeah<00:03:52.770> it

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950

the English looks like mm yeah it
doesn't<00:03:53.160> look<00:03:53.370> like<00:03:53.400> too<00:03:53.850> good<00:03:54.090> at<00:03:54.330> English

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
doesn't look like too good at English

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.110 
doesn't look like too good at English
but<00:03:54.660> there's<00:03:55.170> quite<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.800> few<00:03:55.860> diagrams<00:03:56.520> so<00:03:56.790> it

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
but there's quite a few diagrams so it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.730 
but there's quite a few diagrams so it
might<00:03:57.300> be<00:03:57.450> an<00:03:57.540> okay<00:03:57.780> man<00:03:57.959> you'll<00:03:58.110> have<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.440> read

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
out what it is it is a 350 million power

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.500 
out what it is it is a 350 million power
and<00:04:50.490> battery<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.540> it<00:04:51.660> uses<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.580> little<00:04:53.580> micro

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
and battery and it uses the little micro

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.900 
and battery and it uses the little micro
jst<00:04:55.020> or<00:04:55.169> low<00:04:55.350> C<00:04:55.560> plug<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.100> thing<00:04:56.729> that<00:04:56.760> I

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
jst or low C plug and thing that I

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.460 
jst or low C plug and thing that I
notice<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.450> that<00:04:57.630> actually<00:04:57.960> has<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.169> little

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
notice is that actually has a little

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.870 
notice is that actually has a little
heat<00:04:58.680> shrink<00:04:59.130> um<00:04:59.490> a<00:05:00.260> heat<00:05:01.260> shrink<00:05:01.620> on<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.979> most

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
heat shrink um a heat shrink on it most

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.240 
heat shrink um a heat shrink on it most
of<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.470> other<00:05:04.470> plugs<00:05:06.530> they<00:05:07.530> don't<00:05:07.770> come<00:05:08.070> with

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
of the other plugs they don't come with

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.490 
of the other plugs they don't come with
this<00:05:08.490> little<00:05:08.729> heat<00:05:08.910> shrink<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.479> it's<00:05:10.229> easy<00:05:10.410> to

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
this little heat shrink so it's easy to

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.960 
this little heat shrink so it's easy to
break<00:05:10.770> but<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.160> is<00:05:11.310> nice<00:05:11.490> because<00:05:11.669> it'll

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
break but this is nice because it'll

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.440 
break but this is nice because it'll
make<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.450> lot<00:05:12.960> more<00:05:12.990> durable<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:14.419> like<00:05:15.419> I

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
make it a lot more durable and like I

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.530 
make it a lot more durable and like I
said<00:05:15.690> it's<00:05:15.840> 350<00:05:16.290> million<00:05:16.979> bowers<00:05:17.419> and<00:05:18.419> now

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
said it's 350 million bowers and now

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.540 
said it's 350 million bowers and now
let's<00:05:18.750> look<00:05:18.870> at<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.140> quad<00:05:19.350> this<00:05:20.070> is<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.220> pretty

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
let's look at the quad this is a pretty

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.670 
let's look at the quad this is a pretty
pretty<00:05:21.000> nice-looking<00:05:21.270> quadcopter<00:05:22.169> you<00:05:22.290> got

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
pretty nice-looking quadcopter you got

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.610 
pretty nice-looking quadcopter you got
I<00:05:22.970> think<00:05:23.970> there's<00:05:24.180> yeah<00:05:24.600> there's<00:05:24.630> some<00:05:25.320> lights

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
I think there's yeah there's some lights

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.030 
I think there's yeah there's some lights
in<00:05:25.860> there<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:27.630> frame<00:05:27.930> looks<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.380> be<00:05:28.530> a<00:05:28.560> little

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
in there the frame looks to be a little

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.760 
in there the frame looks to be a little
bit<00:05:29.310> flimsy<00:05:29.880> on<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.180> edges<00:05:30.600> like<00:05:31.229> out<00:05:31.410> here

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
bit flimsy on the edges like out here

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.890 
bit flimsy on the edges like out here
but<00:05:32.010> like<00:05:32.700> up<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.120> down<00:05:33.180> movement<00:05:33.780> but

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
but like up and down movement but

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.360 
but like up and down movement but
inwards<00:05:34.380> movement<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:34.890> don't<00:05:35.040> think<00:05:35.250> it's

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
inwards movement I don't think it's

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.370 
inwards movement I don't think it's
going<00:05:35.640> anywhere

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
going anywhere

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.339 
going anywhere
says<00:05:37.380> forward<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:38.010> backwards<00:05:38.430> on<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.849> blades

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
says forward and backwards on the blades

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:42.800 
says forward and backwards on the blades
I'm<00:05:40.349> not<00:05:40.530> sure<00:05:40.830> if<00:05:41.240> this<00:05:42.240> was<00:05:42.419> supposed<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.720> be

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
I'm not sure if this was supposed to be

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.340 
I'm not sure if this was supposed to be
like<00:05:42.990> that

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
like that

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.320 
like that
but<00:05:43.470> there's<00:05:43.680> looks<00:05:44.400> like<00:05:44.550> that<00:05:44.730> paint<00:05:45.000> or

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
but there's looks like that paint or

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.000 
but there's looks like that paint or
whatever<00:05:45.720> it's<00:05:46.200> paint<00:05:46.470> along<00:05:46.620> with<00:05:46.680> or

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
whatever it's paint along with or

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.430 
whatever it's paint along with or
whatever<00:05:47.370> is<00:05:47.490> wearing<00:05:47.850> off<00:05:48.080> but<00:05:49.080> that<00:05:49.230> doesn't

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
whatever is wearing off but that doesn't

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.660 
whatever is wearing off but that doesn't
really<00:05:49.500> matter<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:49.980> you<00:05:50.070> got<00:05:50.220> your<00:05:50.340> circuit
