00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
just about the same even though there's

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.110 
just about the same even though there's
been<00:03:41.200> rumors<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.770> they<00:03:42.310> were<00:03:42.370> had<00:03:42.760> different

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.220 
been rumors that they were had different
quality<00:03:43.480> control<00:03:43.870> when<00:03:44.050> they<00:03:44.140> were

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
quality control when they were

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.610 
quality control when they were
manufactured<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.600> hope<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.810> puts<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.380> rest

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
manufactured so hope that puts the rest

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.680 
manufactured so hope that puts the rest
the<00:03:47.890> myth<00:03:48.130> do<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:48.910> know<00:03:49.030> which<00:03:49.180> years<00:03:49.510> these

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
the myth do you know which years these

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.590 
the myth do you know which years these
are<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:50.680> believe<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.370> marshal<00:03:51.790> governor<00:03:52.180> was

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
are I believe the marshal governor was

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.430 
are I believe the marshal governor was
what<00:03:53.410> late<00:03:53.620> 80s<00:03:54.150> mid<00:03:55.150> late<00:03:55.360> 80s<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.050> UK

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
what late 80s mid late 80s and in the UK

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.950 
what late 80s mid late 80s and in the UK
I<00:03:56.710> mean<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.070> Korea<00:03:57.370> one<00:03:57.760> was<00:03:58.000> afterwards<00:03:58.870> I

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
I mean the Korea one was afterwards I

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.480 
I mean the Korea one was afterwards I
guess<00:03:59.140> they<00:03:59.410> moved<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.830> shipping<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.280> cool

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
guess they moved the shipping to cool

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.040 
guess they moved the shipping to cool
manufacturing<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.540> Korea<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:01.810> don't<00:04:01.960> know

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
manufacturing the Korea I don't know

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.740 
manufacturing the Korea I don't know
what<00:04:02.200> year<00:04:02.380> was<00:04:02.590> exactly<00:04:03.270> they<00:04:04.270> look<00:04:04.510> slightly

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
what year was exactly they look slightly

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.180 
what year was exactly they look slightly
different<00:04:05.320> but<00:04:05.680> that's<00:04:05.830> about<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.100> only

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
different but that's about the only

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.380 
different but that's about the only
difference<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:06.850> sounds<00:04:07.120> pretty<00:04:07.330> much

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
difference this sounds pretty much

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.130 
difference this sounds pretty much
exactly<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.930> same<00:04:08.130> yep
