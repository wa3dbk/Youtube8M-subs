hey we're Justin to Mary and today we're

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.669 
hey we're Justin to Mary and today we're
going<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.360> talk<00:00:12.509> about<00:00:12.540> how<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.049> photograph<00:00:13.530> a

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
going to talk about how we photograph a

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.609 
going to talk about how we photograph a
night<00:00:13.860> shot<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> venue<00:00:15.199> this<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> shot

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
night shot of the venue this is a shot

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.019 
night shot of the venue this is a shot
we<00:00:16.740> really<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> get<00:00:17.340> especially<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
we really like to get especially for the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.880 
we really like to get especially for the
couple's<00:00:18.330> album<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:19.050> also<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.590> venue

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
couple's album but also for the venue

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.189 
couple's album but also for the venue
the<00:00:20.670> way<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.939> approach<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.539> inspired<00:00:21.990> by<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the way we approach it is inspired by a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.590 
the way we approach it is inspired by a
project<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.920> used<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.250> at<00:00:23.340> RIT<00:00:23.640> with

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
project that we used to do at RIT with

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.390 
project that we used to do at RIT with
my<00:00:24.750> professors<00:00:25.199> Bill<00:00:25.500> Dubois<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> Michael

Perez<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:27.210> used<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.750> architectural

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
Perez we used to do a architectural

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.310 
Perez we used to do a architectural
scene<00:00:29.250> photographed<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.449> night<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> long

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
scene photographed at night with a long

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.470 
scene photographed at night with a long
exposure<00:00:31.650> now<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> lighting<00:00:33.120> from<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
exposure now all the lighting from that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.330 
exposure now all the lighting from that
scene<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.110> light<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> building<00:00:34.860> would

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
scene to light up the building would

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.889 
scene to light up the building would
come<00:00:35.579> from<00:00:35.730> hundreds<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.360> thousands<00:00:36.780> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
come from hundreds or thousands of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
come from hundreds or thousands of
people<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.770> handheld<00:00:38.040> flashes<00:00:38.550> or

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
people with handheld flashes or

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
people with handheld flashes or
flashlights<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:40.170> start<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> base

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
flashlights to start we get a base

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.500 
flashlights to start we get a base
exposure<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.820> what's<00:00:42.030> happening<00:00:42.420> with

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
exposure to see what's happening with

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
exposure to see what's happening with
the<00:00:42.600> ambient<00:00:42.809> light<00:00:43.100> once<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.399> base

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the ambient light once we have that base

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
the ambient light once we have that base
exposure<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.600> time<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> play<00:00:46.020> in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
exposure and then it's time to play in

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.860 
exposure and then it's time to play in
this<00:00:46.980> case<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.399> brought<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.629> heads

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this case we brought out to be one heads

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.779 
this case we brought out to be one heads
one<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> magnum<00:00:49.800> reflector<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:50.610> with

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
one with a magnum reflector and one with

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.819 
one with a magnum reflector and one with
a<00:00:50.820> zoom<00:00:51.030> reflector<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:52.079> during<00:00:52.289> our<00:00:52.469> exposure

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
a zoom reflector now during our exposure

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.770 
a zoom reflector now during our exposure
which<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.399> 30<00:00:53.670> seconds<00:00:54.090> long<00:00:54.239> we're

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
which is about 30 seconds long we're

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
which is about 30 seconds long we're
continuously<00:00:55.260> firing<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.949> flash<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
continuously firing the flash and in

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.340 
continuously firing the flash and in
this<00:00:57.120> case<00:00:57.329> we're<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.629> using<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> test

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this case we're just using the test

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.410 
this case we're just using the test
button<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> back<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> head<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.699> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
button on the back of the head and so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
button on the back of the head and so
during<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> exposure<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.350> entire<00:01:01.620> time<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
during the exposure the entire time the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.500 
during the exposure the entire time the
shutter<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> open<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.180> important<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
shutter is open it's really important to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.090 
shutter is open it's really important to
keep<00:01:03.600> moving<00:01:03.960> we've<00:01:04.379> probably<00:01:04.530> fired<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
keep moving we've probably fired the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.440 
keep moving we've probably fired the
flash<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.549> 30<00:01:05.820> times<00:01:06.030> during<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
flash about 30 times during that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
flash about 30 times during that
exposure<00:01:06.869> we're<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.770> make<00:01:07.979> sure<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
exposure we're gonna make sure that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
exposure we're gonna make sure that
we're<00:01:08.400> hitting<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.880> top<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.630> three<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.049> four

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
we're hitting up top about three or four

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.719 
we're hitting up top about three or four
times<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.010> hitting<00:01:11.189> lower<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
times more than we hitting lower on the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
times more than we hitting lower on the
building<00:01:12.030> because<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.540> light<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.869> top<00:01:13.080> has

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
building because that light up top has

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
exposure Mary and I probably fired each

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:44.730 
exposure Mary and I probably fired each
