bag<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:42.560> guess<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.709> hold<00:02:43.890> his<00:02:44.040> pumpkin<00:02:44.459> bombs<00:02:44.640> or

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
bag I guess to hold his pumpkin bombs or

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.520 
bag I guess to hold his pumpkin bombs or
whatever<00:02:46.470> he<00:02:46.650> carries<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.290> there's<00:02:49.290> his

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
whatever he carries and there's his

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.420 
whatever he carries and there's his
glider<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.900> base<00:02:54.680> now<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.709> guess<00:02:55.980> there's<00:02:56.160> two

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
glider on a base now I guess there's two

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.750 
glider on a base now I guess there's two
ways<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.870> could<00:02:58.110> have<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.680> I've<00:02:59.400> got

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
ways you you could have this I've got

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760 
ways you you could have this I've got
mine<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> base<00:03:00.480> which<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.560> way<00:03:01.739> that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
mine on a base which is the way that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.170 
mine on a base which is the way that
with<00:03:02.670> which<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.030> way<00:03:03.209> he's<00:03:03.360> pictured<00:03:05.180> you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
with which is the way he's pictured you

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.250 
with which is the way he's pictured you
could<00:03:06.480> opt<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.140> have<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:08.459> base<00:03:08.700> left<00:03:09.540> off<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
could opt to have the base left off and

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.160 
could opt to have the base left off and
and<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.310> glider<00:03:11.820> on<00:03:12.060> its<00:03:12.239> own<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:13.020> only

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
and just the glider on its own the only

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.640 
and just the glider on its own the only
problem<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.920> would<00:03:14.280> suggest<00:03:14.520> if<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> do<00:03:15.300> it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
problem is I would suggest if you do it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.490 
problem is I would suggest if you do it
I<00:03:17.090> wouldn't<00:03:18.090> take<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.720> off<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.140> put<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.380> on

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
I wouldn't take this off and put it on

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.530 
I wouldn't take this off and put it on
too<00:03:19.709> many<00:03:19.830> times<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.400> think<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.730> probably<00:03:21.420> will

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
too many times I think it probably will

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.710 
too many times I think it probably will
break<00:03:22.040> at<00:03:23.040> some<00:03:23.370> point<00:03:23.700> I'm<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:24.330> going<00:03:24.660> to

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
break at some point I'm just going to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.199 
break at some point I'm just going to
leave<00:03:24.900> mine<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.950> mean<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.700> I'm<00:03:27.120> just

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
leave mine like that I mean it I'm just

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.120 
leave mine like that I mean it I'm just
going<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.420> only<00:03:27.570> have<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:27.959> display<00:03:28.590> anyways

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
going to only have it on display anyways

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:37.900 
going to only have it on display anyways

pleasantly surprised with how long the
the<00:03:48.000> hat<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:49.110> very<00:03:49.140> nice<00:03:51.170> now<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.380> is

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
the hat is it's very nice now this is

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.130

the<00:03:52.650> second<00:03:53.390> green<00:03:54.390> goblin<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.019> was

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
the second green goblin that was

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.840 
the second green goblin that was
released<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.769> Marvel<00:03:56.070> Legends<00:03:56.430> there<00:03:56.670> was<00:03:56.820> a

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
released for Marvel Legends there was a

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.710 
released for Marvel Legends there was a
first<00:03:57.709> Goblin<00:03:58.940> which<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.060> think<00:04:00.269> was<00:04:00.420> part<00:04:00.660> of

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
first Goblin which I think was part of

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.310 
first Goblin which I think was part of
the<00:04:00.840> sinister<00:04:01.380> six<00:04:02.060> pack<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:04.880> have<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.320> but

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
the sinister six pack and I have it but

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.020 
the sinister six pack and I have it but
the<00:04:07.560> only<00:04:07.620> problem<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.100> had<00:04:08.310> with<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:08.610> was<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
the only problem I had with it was the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.220 
the only problem I had with it was the
fact<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.480> his<00:04:10.410> eyes<00:04:10.910> are<00:04:11.910> are<00:04:12.690> like<00:04:13.200> a

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
fact that his eyes are are like a

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.800 
fact that his eyes are are like a
see-through<00:04:13.890> plastic<00:04:14.489> so<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.540> can<00:04:15.690> actually

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
see-through plastic so you can actually

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.530 
see-through plastic so you can actually
see<00:04:16.140> is<00:04:16.260> human<00:04:16.530> eyes<00:04:16.829> underneath

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
see is human eyes underneath

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.719 
see is human eyes underneath
I<00:04:18.600> guess<00:04:19.350> similar<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.010> way<00:04:20.040> of<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> Spider

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
I guess similar in the way of the Spider

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.900 
I guess similar in the way of the Spider
Man<00:04:20.970> Green<00:04:21.450> Goblin<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.910> live-action

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
Man Green Goblin is the live-action

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.540 
Man Green Goblin is the live-action
movie<00:04:24.180> spider-man<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.840> always<00:04:25.770> was<00:04:25.919> a<00:04:25.950> big<00:04:26.160> fan

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
movie spider-man I always was a big fan

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.610 
movie spider-man I always was a big fan
the<00:04:26.610> Green<00:04:26.789> Goblin<00:04:27.030> with<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.599> with<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.590> more

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
the Green Goblin with the with the more

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.189 
the Green Goblin with the with the more
cartoon<00:04:29.190> eyes<00:04:29.569> where<00:04:30.569> it<00:04:30.659> just<00:04:30.810> looks<00:04:31.020> like<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
cartoon eyes where it just looks like a

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.050 
cartoon eyes where it just looks like a
mask<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.770> doesn't<00:04:32.039> look<00:04:32.220> like<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.729> can<00:04:32.879> see

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
mask it doesn't look like you can see

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.779 
mask it doesn't look like you can see
his<00:04:33.150> eyes<00:04:33.300> underneath<00:04:33.949> so<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:34.979> mean<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.580> in

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
his eyes underneath so I mean this is in

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.749 
his eyes underneath so I mean this is in
my<00:04:36.060> opinion<00:04:36.479> this<00:04:36.569> is<00:04:36.629> the<00:04:36.780> more<00:04:37.050> superior

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
my opinion this is the more superior

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.480 
my opinion this is the more superior

hand<00:05:06.449> or<00:05:06.690> you<00:05:07.229> can<00:05:07.379> take<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.800> off<00:05:08.069> but<00:05:09.000> the

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
hand or you can take this off but the

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.709 
hand or you can take this off but the
way<00:05:09.930> his<00:05:10.139> hands<00:05:10.530> are<00:05:10.650> positioned<00:05:11.159> I<00:05:11.449> don't<00:05:12.449> I

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
way his hands are positioned I don't I

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.920 
way his hands are positioned I don't I
mean<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.949> could<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.639> mean<00:05:15.599> that<00:05:15.750> his

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
mean you you could I mean that his

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.110 
mean you you could I mean that his
fingers<00:05:16.349> are<00:05:16.560> articulated<00:05:16.819> but<00:05:17.819> I<00:05:17.849> don't

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
fingers are articulated but I don't

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.580 
fingers are articulated but I don't
think<00:05:18.360> it's<00:05:18.659> enough<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.020> you'd<00:05:19.289> be<00:05:19.379> able<00:05:19.530> to

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
think it's enough that you'd be able to

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.689 
think it's enough that you'd be able to
hold<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.889> bomb<00:05:20.539> so<00:05:21.539> I<00:05:21.569> mean<00:05:21.750> for<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.020> reason

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
hold the bomb so I mean for that reason

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.890 
hold the bomb so I mean for that reason
yeah<00:05:23.699> for<00:05:23.909> that<00:05:24.000> reason<00:05:24.389> I'm<00:05:24.479> just<00:05:24.629> I<00:05:24.840> think

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
yeah for that reason I'm just I think

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.300 
yeah for that reason I'm just I think
I'll<00:05:25.110> just<00:05:25.229> leave<00:05:25.500> it<00:05:25.530> as<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:26.629> but<00:05:28.219> see<00:05:29.219> the

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
I'll just leave it as is but see the

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.600 
I'll just leave it as is but see the
scales<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.620> scales<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.830> his<00:05:31.919> costume<00:05:32.190> are

very nice nicely detailed and of course
the<00:05:35.580> Goblin<00:05:36.090> boots<00:05:38.150> can<00:05:39.150> have<00:05:39.300> a<00:05:39.330> goblin<00:05:39.779> of

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
the Goblin boots can have a goblin of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.659 
the Goblin boots can have a goblin of

very<00:05:44.099> nice<00:05:44.310> figure<00:05:44.550> I<00:05:44.909> mean<00:05:45.449> I<00:05:45.569> think<00:05:45.960> they

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
very nice figure I mean I think they

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.050 
very nice figure I mean I think they
really<00:05:46.380> captured<00:05:46.889> the<00:05:46.949> idea<00:05:47.219> of<00:05:47.699> the<00:05:47.849> Green

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
really captured the idea of the Green

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.129 
really captured the idea of the Green
Goblin<00:05:49.039> excellent<00:05:50.039> sculpt<00:05:50.490> I<00:05:50.750> will<00:05:51.750> say<00:05:51.960> this

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
Goblin excellent sculpt I will say this

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.059 
Goblin excellent sculpt I will say this
though<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.979> figure<00:05:53.310> itself<00:05:54.020> seems<00:05:55.020> small<00:05:55.710> I

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
though the figure itself seems small I

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.490 
though the figure itself seems small I
don't<00:05:56.520> know<00:05:56.610> I<00:05:56.879> really<00:05:57.539> wish<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.080> had<00:05:58.199> had<00:05:58.469> a

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
don't know I really wish I had had a

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.219 
don't know I really wish I had had a
figure<00:05:58.800> with<00:05:59.099> me<00:05:59.310> here<00:05:59.699> that<00:05:59.849> I<00:05:59.879> could<00:06:00.199> do<00:06:01.199> a

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
figure with me here that I could do a

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.200 
figure with me here that I could do a
size<00:06:01.500> comparison<00:06:01.529> but<00:06:02.310> it<00:06:02.699> just<00:06:02.849> seems<00:06:03.090> like

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
size comparison but it just seems like

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.670 
size comparison but it just seems like
this<00:06:03.360> goblins<00:06:03.779> a<00:06:03.840> little<00:06:04.050> shorter<00:06:04.409> than<00:06:04.590> he

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
this goblins a little shorter than he

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.089 
this goblins a little shorter than he
should<00:06:04.710> be

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
should be

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:10.219 
should be
I<00:06:05.750> don't<00:06:06.750> know<00:06:06.810> maybe<00:06:07.050> it's<00:06:07.229> just<00:06:07.289> me<00:06:07.879> um<00:06:09.229> you

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
I don't know maybe it's just me um you

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:16.670 
I don't know maybe it's just me um you

can take his his glider here and slide
his<00:06:16.830> feet<00:06:17.159> in<00:06:17.340> I<00:06:18.860> have<00:06:19.860> to<00:06:19.919> do<00:06:20.069> this<00:06:20.219> off<00:06:20.370> film

glider<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:38.490> one<00:06:39.490> nice<00:06:39.700> thing<00:06:39.730> I<00:06:40.060> like<00:06:40.270> about

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
glider the one nice thing I like about

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.210 
glider the one nice thing I like about
the<00:06:40.630> glider<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:41.050> they<00:06:41.380> really<00:06:41.650> fought<00:06:41.920> it<00:06:42.100> out

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
the glider and they really fought it out

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.630 
the glider and they really fought it out
was<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:42.940> fact<00:06:43.150> that<00:06:43.240> they<00:06:43.390> put<00:06:44.340> they<00:06:45.340> actually

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640 
was the fact that they put they actually

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.090 
was the fact that they put they actually
put<00:06:45.820> in<00:06:45.940> a<00:06:46.030> platform<00:06:46.780> for<00:06:46.990> his<00:06:47.140> feet<00:06:47.440> instead

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
further out and it just being a loop on

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.910
