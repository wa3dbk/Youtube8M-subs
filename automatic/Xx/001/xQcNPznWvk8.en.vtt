00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.219
 Hello everyone, Ivan, we are still today 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.230
 let's talk about micro pumping what is 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.869
 micro pumping and why they are needed and how 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.090
 right micro swing on what you can 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.390
 save and generally as a process 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.250
 pumping the tank do not stay without pants on 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.520
 these and other important questions 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.700
 detailed answers do n't you think 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.320
 what for opening each subsequent 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.200
 modifications of your favorite body and 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.000
 guns fill the experience and save up crystals 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.280
 takes too long 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.740
 actually for this and need and micro 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.580
 pumping micro improving basic 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.130
 characteristics 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.170
 game items micro pumping 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.160
 allow you to diversify the process of pumping 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.890
 your tank 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.710
 Now you can pump there often and 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.020
 cheap and fully pump all branches 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.780
 pumping get a good discount on 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.910
 purchase of the next modification 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.800
 pumped hull or gun when 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.350
 this is the influence of every single step 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.210
 microprose glasses is almost negligible 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.600
 but all together they give 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.729
 tangible advantage in all battles 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.009
 shells and eat displayed raise 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.899
 characteristics that can now be micro 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.119
 it is possible to pump over paints 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.020
 pump only already sewn into the paint 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.240
 defense 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.789
 so inexpensive paint flora is available 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.250
 protection only from looking and only her in 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.979
 this paint they can be pumped then 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.289
 Picasso ends are sewn with protection from 4 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.469
 eat and in the game you can pump protection 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.600
 from all four guns we will analyze the process 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.119
 about a car on the example of the hunter hull 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.299
 which is issued to all players at the beginning 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.329
 the games in my example are the year hunter m0 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.149
 election hunter pressing the button to torture you 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.520
 get into the improvement menu by the way in 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.220
 difference from guns and paints and about improving 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.670
 all cases are the same in tanks 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.679
 online 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.349
 all enclosures have the same set 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.229
 pumped characteristics differ 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.220
 just as many steps as you do 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.250
 see on the screen 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.920
 armor branch at hunter m0 first line in 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.650
 the menu has twenty five leveling steps 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.690
 after completing the first step we will be able to 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.640
 just one crystal enlarge facet 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.160
 6 units from 90 to 96 units sounds like 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.019
 good deal isn't it when we 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.720
 we move the cursor on the improve button 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.590
 opposite armor appears on the left 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.310
 inscription 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.190
 1 m this means that after the start of pumping 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.889
 hunter timer will be activated for a while 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.950
 pump over blocked our case 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:42.489
 for one minute while trying to go on 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.840
 a blocked building in the subway will appear 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.109
 no item alerts can be 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.430
 use by children during completion 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.400
 install other weapons or 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.859
 complete and improve ahead of time so 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.319
 way to enter the battle you need either 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.190
 wait until the completion of the metro pumping either 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.200
 take another body if you have one 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.209
 micro pumping was designed so that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.609
 players could not immediately pump up to 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.010
 maximum tank developers online 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.859
 suggest that players will be started 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.470
 gradually of course the most impatient 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.450
 can speed up pumping and unlock 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.150
 game item just by pressing the button 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.669
 accelerate however the cost of accelerating in 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.370
 times the cost of pumping itself 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.910
 This option is mainly focused on 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.950
 players 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.350
 purchasing crystals for real 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.570
 money it does not give a direct advantage 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.669
 in battles however allows essentially 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.940
 save time when pumping your 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:40.459
 micro pumping tank arranged so that 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.769
 time of blocking the pumped game 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.070
 subject as well as the cost of pumping 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.030
 acceleration of pumping with each step 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.040
 increase while 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.799
 pumping efficiency is the opposite 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.900
 gradually reduced first steps 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.160
 pumping is always inexpensive and gives 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.640
 greatest effect 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.920
 while the final steps 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.890
 not effective relatively expensive 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.319
 take a long time that's all on 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.390
 Today the continuation of the review in which I 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.730
 I will talk about how to pump 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.980
 crowds on what you can save see in 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.200
 The following video link to which you can 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.959
 look in the description under the video or 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.150

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.460
 pumping and what do you think about them
