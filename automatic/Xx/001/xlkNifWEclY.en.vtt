i believe and obviously prices can
change<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> first<00:00:58.890> place<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> seventy

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
change the first place is seventy

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.150 
change the first place is seventy
percent<00:00:59.670> of<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.629> however<00:01:01.350> many<00:01:01.530> how<00:01:02.070> much

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
percent of like however many how much

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
percent of like however many how much
money<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.730> raised<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.809> depending<00:01:04.229> how

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
like i don't know what other game can

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
like i don't know what other game can

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
top it it's just so much skill involved

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.370 
top it it's just so much skill involved
in<00:01:32.280> gears<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> only<00:01:32.939> thing<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.900> gal<00:01:34.079> 3

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
in gears the only thing is with gal 3

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
in gears the only thing is with gal 3
where<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.619> went<00:01:34.799> wrong<00:01:34.909> for<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> competitive

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
where they went wrong for a competitive

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
where they went wrong for a competitive
is<00:01:36.810> well<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> swaps<00:01:37.560> were<00:01:37.740> bad<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.159> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
is well the swaps were bad but that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
is well the swaps were bad but that
doesn't<00:01:38.549> matter<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:40.170> real

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380

talk<00:01:42.390> about<00:01:42.509> real<00:01:42.689> competitive<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
talk about real competitive where you

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.960 
talk about real competitive where you
have<00:01:43.890> swaps<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.579> doesn't<00:01:44.820> totally

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
have swaps know so it doesn't totally

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.350 
have swaps know so it doesn't totally
matter<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.439> lancer<00:01:47.159> does<00:01:47.610> matter<00:01:47.880> that's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
matter but the lancer does matter that's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.179 
matter but the lancer does matter that's
the<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.780> thing<00:01:48.990> they<00:01:49.140> did<00:01:49.350> wrong<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.920> needed

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the one thing they did wrong they needed

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.179 
the one thing they did wrong they needed
to<00:01:50.220> lower<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.299> lancer<00:01:51.840> um<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.920> stopping

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to lower the lancer um like stopping

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.440 
to lower the lancer um like stopping
power<00:01:53.399> thing<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.820> talking<00:01:53.850> power<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
power thing I was talking power that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.020 
power thing I was talking power that
would<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.899> huge<00:01:55.259> boost<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
would just be a huge boost in the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
would just be a huge boost in the
competitive<00:01:57.479> community<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.740> if

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
competitive community and I think if

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
competitive community and I think if
they<00:01:59.250> either<00:01:59.399> lowered<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.450> damage<00:02:00.899> or<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
they either lowered the damage or the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
they either lowered the damage or the
clip<00:02:01.530> size<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.040> might<00:02:02.189> help<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.210> at

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
clip size that might help more to but at

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.609 
clip size that might help more to but at
least<00:02:03.509> your<00:02:03.810> word<00:02:03.899> stopping<00:02:04.259> power<00:02:04.409> that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
least your word stopping power that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.929 
least your word stopping power that
would<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.799> amazing<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.579> might<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.880> able

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
would be amazing and that might be able

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:06.760 
would be amazing and that might be able
to<00:02:06.060> bring<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.479> bunch

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
to bring a bunch

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.710 
to bring a bunch
people<00:02:07.009> back<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.369> gears<00:02:07.609> oh<00:02:07.850> wait<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:08.569> see
