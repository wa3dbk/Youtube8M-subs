00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.119

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.460
 me it's a call to adventure 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.960
 why because you have to capture 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.550
 the emerald caught in the basket of 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.070
 cobras are caught by the horn 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.120
 So it's a mega game is blue 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.680
 for ages 5 and up 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.269

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.930

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.170
 an emerald a green emerald a 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.720
 beautiful green road that we place up to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.799
 the front of the basket there like that it's 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.000
 besides this same road that we 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.280
 we'll have to catch up 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.290
 while some will threaten us 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.900
 dance company so I slip the snake 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.299
 in his first there is a stern hole the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.909
 slide I'll have to snap it with 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.850

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:30.159
 find the button on / off point of view he 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.560
 there are three levels of difficulty for 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.770
 start the tape part pressed on this 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.990
 taste 3 it is obviously not necessary to forget 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.329
 to put the batteries there are four 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.740
 classic stacks and that's it I believe I 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.119
 did everything said for the moment so I 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.770
 invite you to join immediately 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.950
 fancy to do a grand test 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.950
 nature 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.120
 we invest in company this time two 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.370
 Slots a good boy born in his room 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.550
 and we have the cobras basket 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.640
 attack so I'm going to beat on own pif 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.020
 we will put a difficulty level 2 1 and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.000
 border to put himself at the end of his 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.770
 room there and I'm staying next 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.130
 from the basket to monitor that everything is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.310
 goes well 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.900
 to the point that we have it we fight yes for 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.650
 launch in moment we launch the game 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 we must bring their fate of coma and its 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.750
 football games you are bruno 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.790
 wiel me I stay here beside the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.100
 cobra and I pressed the button 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.750
 play attention epr is in position 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.780
 I launch the analyzes on small 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.580
 not music but it's not part of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.860
 red eyes his sides does that blink 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.920
 on the curve has continually 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 fixed red you are leaving now rest 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:54.200
 motionless sicre to his eyes are poured the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.200
 candle we must not run I call him 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:08.740
 to his wife if what 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.540
 so there then the snake sprang 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.120
 because to detect it anyway 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.300
 fanta will move a little he had done 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.920
 two small ones to prevent that attention 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.870
 huh did you see him move 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.850
 there we will start again hand I put back the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.590
 snake and can shock but by 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.370
 against we are not allowed to run that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.500
 Its very important 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.920
 it's step by step because if we run 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.080
 it's not a little too easy maybe 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.720
 must give him time to snakes 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.230
 to analyze a little late ok it's gone again 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.540
 cast the cobra again and I tell them 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.060
 positions its place in hues and the 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.860
 to do yes one thing that I tell you this is 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.100
 that we have to wait until the red eyes 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.780
 be fixed 1 so that the game starts 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.110
 and it starts with obviously eyes 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.880
 red 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.230
 fantasy you do not see any change when the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.520
 eyes are red when the green managements 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.230
 I remember it is at that moment 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.340
 simply that we can move but at 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.970
 very early there is a little music 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.140
 this is the time that the device 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.850
 finally it's a bit of a recognition of 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.850
 space is gone I position it 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.850
 full 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:46.640
 show his new label necessarily the 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.950
 move despite we saw it at pyla la 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.210
 move like that so the snake has sprung 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.020
 1 of his basket and ben he was costing 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.470
 child what do you think of 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:03.740
 joy I like to see here look this is 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:07.040
 well these detectives say good here is the gold 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.510
 pure fantasy that's good enough so I 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.190
 remember it requires a piece of four 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.170
 out of four I think it's happening 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.180
 much better on a piece like this 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.420
 it let go we're going to be a bit too much 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.669
 the narrow and the e3 and if in fact there is 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.000
 many players it can be pretty good 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.880
 as well 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.350
 in any case I give you an appointment 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.650
 for other demos others were playing 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.650
 sure 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:38.549
 and 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:38.549
