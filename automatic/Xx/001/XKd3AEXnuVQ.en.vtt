00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
whenever we work out we just extend our

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.100 
whenever we work out we just extend our
cones<00:03:27.190> back<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> little<00:03:27.670> bit<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:28.060> little<00:03:28.930> bit

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110

even<00:03:29.290> deeper<00:03:29.620> than<00:03:29.709> NBA<00:03:29.890> 3<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.519> just<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.150> get<00:03:31.269> it

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
even deeper than NBA 3 so just to get it

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.720 
even deeper than NBA 3 so just to get it
used<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.049> guess<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.590> uh<00:03:32.620> it's<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.250> lot<00:03:33.430> big

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
used to it I guess and uh it's a lot big

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.729 
used to it I guess and uh it's a lot big
difference<00:03:34.090> from<00:03:34.150> college<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:35.349> that<00:03:35.409> nice

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
difference from college so is that nice
