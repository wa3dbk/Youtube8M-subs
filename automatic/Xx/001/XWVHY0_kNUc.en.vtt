00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960 

hello<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.589> kind<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.250> an<00:00:02.429> update<00:00:02.610> video

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hello this is kind of an update video

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.400 
hello this is kind of an update video
for<00:00:03.540> progress<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.380> claws<00:00:05.930> sadly<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.170> only

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
for progress of the claws sadly I only

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.870 
for progress of the claws sadly I only
have<00:00:08.150> one<00:00:09.150> partial<00:00:09.719> prototype<00:00:10.440> done<00:00:10.790> taking<00:00:11.790> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
have one partial prototype done taking a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.910 
have one partial prototype done taking a
long<00:00:12.090> time<00:00:14.750> I've<00:00:15.750> been<00:00:16.049> trying<00:00:16.440> around<00:00:16.770> with

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
long time I've been trying around with

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.179 
long time I've been trying around with
different<00:00:17.070> mechanisms<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:19.010> different<00:00:20.010> lock

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
different mechanisms and different lock

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.189 
different mechanisms and different lock
designs<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.480> things<00:00:22.039> and<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> far<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.869> is

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
designs and things and so far this is

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.990 
designs and things and so far this is
the<00:00:25.980> prototype<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.920> us<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> double

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the prototype I have us for a double

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200 
the prototype I have us for a double
action<00:00:30.740> mechanism<00:00:31.740> where<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.579> go<00:00:32.610> out<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
action mechanism where it can go out and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
action mechanism where it can go out and
it<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:33.960> back<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.989> gravity-powered<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it can go back in and gravity-powered is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.340 
it can go back in and gravity-powered is
the<00:00:37.980> easiest<00:00:38.430> version<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.180> rake<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the easiest version you can rake and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.860 
the easiest version you can rake and
I'll<00:00:41.129> show<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> mean<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I'll show you what I mean so this is the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.180 
I'll show you what I mean so this is the
mechanism<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:47.100> far<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> backlash<00:00:49.190> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
mechanism so far I have the backlash and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.360 
mechanism so far I have the backlash and
it<00:00:50.340> holds<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> release<00:00:52.680> this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it holds it in and when you release this

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.139 
it holds it in and when you release this
latch<00:00:53.840> mechanism<00:00:54.840> slide<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:55.969> this<00:00:56.969> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
latch mechanism slide down this is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.260 
latch mechanism slide down this is
gravity<00:00:57.629> power<00:00:58.550> this<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> gravity

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
gravity power this is what a gravity

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.310 
gravity power this is what a gravity
power<00:01:00.559> weapon<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.670> let<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.320> gravity

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
power weapon is when you let go gravity

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.870 
power weapon is when you let go gravity
pulls<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> blades<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.790> be

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
pulls it down and the blades will be

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.090 
pulls it down and the blades will be
attached<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.450> piece<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> when<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
attached to this piece and when it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.380 
attached to this piece and when it
extends

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.180 

the<00:01:11.840> blades<00:01:12.320> will<00:01:12.620> extend<00:01:13.340> out<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> front

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
the blades will extend out the front

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.970 
the blades will extend out the front
to<00:01:15.820> retract<00:01:16.210> it<00:01:16.540> you<00:01:17.140> would<00:01:17.320> take<00:01:17.530> your<00:01:17.740> arm

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
to retract it you would take your arm

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.330 
to retract it you would take your arm
and<00:01:18.280> lift<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.670> like<00:01:18.790> this

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and lift it like this

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:31.750 
and lift it like this
so<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> turn<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.659> miss<00:01:22.579> it<00:01:23.579> retracts

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.090 

so<00:01:32.390> that's<00:01:32.510> what<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.690> have<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.050> far<00:01:33.080> it's<00:01:33.440> taking

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
so that's what I have so far it's taking

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.800 
so that's what I have so far it's taking
a<00:01:34.190> long<00:01:34.370> time<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.700> get<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.060> prototype<00:01:35.570> done

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
a long time to get a prototype done

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.040 
a long time to get a prototype done
because<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.350> materials<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:37.010> have<00:01:37.220> but<00:01:38.150> now<00:01:38.870> that

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
because of materials I have but now that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.370 
because of materials I have but now that
I<00:01:39.080> have<00:01:39.260> one<00:01:39.560> partial<00:01:40.160> piece<00:01:40.610> done<00:01:41.140> making<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
I have one partial piece done making the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.860 
I have one partial piece done making the
second<00:01:43.220> version<00:01:43.460> from<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.120> same<00:01:44.360> material

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
second version from the same material

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.710 
second version from the same material
will<00:01:45.140> be<00:01:45.260> a<00:01:45.290> lot<00:01:45.530> faster<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.270> biggest<00:01:47.570> issue

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
will be a lot faster the biggest issue

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.930 
will be a lot faster the biggest issue
right<00:01:47.870> now<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.230> getting<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.950> front<00:01:49.340> lock<00:01:49.610> and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
right now is getting the front lock and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.560 
right now is getting the front lock and
the<00:01:50.000> blades<00:01:51.040> that's<00:01:52.040> making<00:01:52.400> blades<00:01:52.640> not<00:01:53.390> out

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
the blades that's making blades not out

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.430 
the blades that's making blades not out
of<00:01:53.600> metal<00:01:54.080> is<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.310> little<00:01:56.060> bit<00:01:56.150> difficult

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
of metal is a little bit difficult

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.610 
of metal is a little bit difficult
so<00:01:58.160> I'll<00:01:58.490> try<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.060> get<00:01:59.690> done<00:02:00.050> as<00:02:00.170> quick<00:02:00.410> as<00:02:00.530> I

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
so I'll try to get done as quick as I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.380 
so I'll try to get done as quick as I
can<00:02:00.680> and<00:02:01.010> i'll<00:02:01.130> keep<00:02:01.600> making<00:02:02.600> updates<00:02:02.810> for<00:02:03.200> you
