00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
are considered to be the best 2

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
submachine guns and Call of Duty ghosts

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.689 
submachine guns and Call of Duty ghosts
these<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> vector<00:00:24.960> CRB<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.039> mtar<00:00:26.490> X

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
these are the vector CRB and the mtar X

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.000 
these are the vector CRB and the mtar X
I<00:00:27.000> personally<00:00:27.779> think<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> mtar<00:00:28.590> X<00:00:28.830> is

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
I personally think that the mtar X is

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.980 
I personally think that the mtar X is
the<00:00:29.160> better<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> two<00:00:29.760> weapons<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.630> lots

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the better of the two weapons but lots

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.540 
the better of the two weapons but lots
of<00:00:31.109> people<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.529> been<00:00:31.619> saying<00:00:31.679> otherwise<00:00:32.160> so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
of people have been saying otherwise so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.860 
of people have been saying otherwise so
what<00:00:32.730> better<00:00:32.850> thing<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.540> compare

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
what better thing to do then compare

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
what better thing to do then compare
them<00:00:34.020> head-to-head<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.890> without<00:00:35.250> further<00:00:35.430> ado

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
them head-to-head so without further ado

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:46.340 
them head-to-head so without further ado
let's<00:00:36.090> jump<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:36.360> into<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> video<00:00:45.140> first<00:00:46.140> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
let's jump right into the video first of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.930 
let's jump right into the video first of
all<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> vector<00:00:46.950> CRB<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.610> one<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
all the vector CRB is one of the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
all the vector CRB is one of the
cheapest<00:00:48.300> submachine<00:00:48.719> guns<00:00:48.899> costing<00:00:49.379> 6<00:00:49.680> squad

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
cheapest submachine guns costing 6 squad

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
cheapest submachine guns costing 6 squad
points<00:00:50.190> whereas<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> mtar<00:00:51.120> X<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> most

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
points whereas the mtar X is the most

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.229 
points whereas the mtar X is the most
expensive<00:00:52.230> costing<00:00:52.890> 9<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.640> isn't<00:00:53.940> too<00:00:54.090> big

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
expensive costing 9 this isn't too big

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.490 
expensive costing 9 this isn't too big
of<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> deal<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:54.989> definitely<00:00:55.170> something

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
of a deal but it's definitely something

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.330 
of a deal but it's definitely something
to<00:00:55.890> consider

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
to consider

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.670 
to consider
next<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.239> mtar<00:00:57.600> X<00:00:57.809> actually<00:00:58.079> has<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
next up the mtar X actually has the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
next up the mtar X actually has the
advantage<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> vector<00:00:59.820> with<00:00:59.969> magazine

are<00:03:02.799> at<00:03:02.920> long<00:03:03.190> range<00:03:03.519> rather<00:03:03.819> than<00:03:04.060> short

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
are at long range rather than short

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.509 
are at long range rather than short
range<00:03:04.569> on<00:03:04.900> maps<00:03:05.440> like<00:03:05.560> strike<00:03:05.950> zone<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.370> would

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
range on maps like strike zone I would

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.069 
range on maps like strike zone I would
definitely<00:03:06.940> recommend<00:03:07.060> using<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.750> vector

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
definitely recommend using the vector

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.600 
definitely recommend using the vector
it's<00:03:08.290> closer<00:03:08.590> range<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.220> vector<00:03:09.459> will<00:03:09.579> be

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
it's closer range and the vector will be

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's closer range and the vector will be
more<00:03:09.879> effective<00:03:10.360> but<00:03:10.750> all<00:03:10.900> in<00:03:11.049> all<00:03:11.140> if<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.440> had

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
more effective but all in all if I had

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.990 
more effective but all in all if I had
to<00:03:11.680> pick<00:03:11.829> just<00:03:11.860> one<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.310> these<00:03:12.400> weapons<00:03:12.640> it

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
to pick just one of these weapons it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.089 
to pick just one of these weapons it
would<00:03:13.180> be<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.510> mtar<00:03:13.840> X<00:03:14.049> now<00:03:14.620> before<00:03:14.920> we<00:03:15.040> end

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
would be the mtar X now before we end

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.589 
would be the mtar X now before we end
these<00:03:15.280> comparisons<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.000> always<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.480> give

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
these comparisons I always like to give

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.300 
these comparisons I always like to give
you<00:03:16.720> at<00:03:16.870> least<00:03:16.900> one<00:03:17.110> recommended<00:03:17.829> class<00:03:18.069> for

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
you at least one recommended class for

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.949 
you at least one recommended class for
each<00:03:18.370> weapon<00:03:18.639> so<00:03:19.000> for<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.239> vector<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.540> like<00:03:19.840> to

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
each weapon so for the vector I like to

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.479 
each weapon so for the vector I like to
use<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.200> suppressor<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:20.920> extended<00:03:21.280> mags

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
use the suppressor and the extended mags

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.970 
use the suppressor and the extended mags
as<00:03:21.700> iron<00:03:22.120> sights<00:03:22.389> are<00:03:22.510> okay<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.109> for<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.620> mtar

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
as iron sights are okay and for the mtar

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.559 
as iron sights are okay and for the mtar
I<00:03:24.100> like<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.430> use<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.670> suppressor<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.359> red

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
I like to use the suppressor and the red

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.970 
I like to use the suppressor and the red
dot<00:03:25.750> since<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.109> has<00:03:26.230> pretty<00:03:26.440> poor<00:03:26.739> iron

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
dot since that has pretty poor iron

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.920 
dot since that has pretty poor iron
sights<00:03:27.370> at<00:03:28.000> this<00:03:28.180> point<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.540> really<00:03:28.780> don't

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
sights at this point I really don't

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.509 
sights at this point I really don't
think<00:03:28.989> equipment<00:03:29.590> or<00:03:29.680> secondaries<00:03:30.220> are<00:03:30.250> worth

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
think equipment or secondaries are worth

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.220 
think equipment or secondaries are worth
using<00:03:30.760> but<00:03:31.150> for<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.329> vector<00:03:31.630> I<00:03:31.660> use<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.049> perk

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
using but for the vector I use the perk

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.050 
using but for the vector I use the perk
sleight<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.560> hand<00:03:32.889> off<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.310> grid<00:03:33.489> scavenger

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
sleight of hand off the grid scavenger

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.030 
sleight of hand off the grid scavenger
ICU<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.720> focus<00:03:35.170> because<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.709> more<00:03:35.859> of<00:03:35.950> a

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
ICU and focus because this is more of a

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.680 
ICU and focus because this is more of a
rushing<00:03:36.370> class<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:36.940> these<00:03:37.030> are<00:03:37.150> very<00:03:37.329> rush

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
rushing class and these are very rush

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.960 
rushing class and these are very rush
happy<00:03:38.049> perks<00:03:38.380> whereas<00:03:39.010> with<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.310> mtar<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.700> use

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
happy perks whereas with the mtar I use

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.460 
happy perks whereas with the mtar I use
it<00:03:40.090> at<00:03:40.180> longer<00:03:40.420> range<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:40.989> I'm<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.109> little<00:03:41.380> bit

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
it at longer range so I'm a little bit

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.990 
it at longer range so I'm a little bit
more<00:03:41.620> conservative<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.459> like<00:03:42.669> to<00:03:42.760> use<00:03:42.849> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
more conservative so I like to use the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.849 
more conservative so I like to use the
dead<00:03:43.209> silent<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.780> amplify<00:03:44.139> set<00:03:44.380> up<00:03:44.530> along

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
dead silent and amplify set up along

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.280 
dead silent and amplify set up along
with<00:03:44.889> off<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.370> grid<00:03:45.549> scavenger<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.299> focus<00:03:46.750> so

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
with off the grid scavenger and focus so

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.659 
with off the grid scavenger and focus so
guys<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.709> looks<00:03:47.739> like<00:03:47.950> we're<00:03:48.160> almost<00:03:48.370> done

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
guys it looks like we're almost done

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.190 
guys it looks like we're almost done
with<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:48.940> comparison<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:49.840> really<00:03:50.079> hope

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
with this comparison and I really hope

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.449 
with this comparison and I really hope
it's<00:03:50.380> helped<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.739> out<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.069> kind<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.310> showed

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
it's helped you out and kind of showed

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.339 
it's helped you out and kind of showed
you<00:03:51.609> why<00:03:51.849> I<00:03:51.880> think<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.359> mtar<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.750> better<00:03:53.079> it's

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
you why I think the mtar is better it's

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.960 
you why I think the mtar is better it's
not<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:53.680> much<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:54.010> guns<00:03:54.190> but<00:03:54.430> more<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.730> maps

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
not so much the guns but more the maps

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.729 
not so much the guns but more the maps
be<00:03:55.569> sure<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.840> tell<00:03:56.019> me<00:03:56.049> in<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.380> comments
