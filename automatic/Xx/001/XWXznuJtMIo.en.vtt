00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 formatting is the only way 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.069
 we have to be able to restore ours 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.319
 computer when it becomes obsolete e 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.389
 especially wind formatting 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.309
 is to install a new one 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.410
 operating system delete all 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.330
 existing files and then delete 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.619
 any viruses or corrupt files that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.990
 they could also cause a slowdown 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 of your computer in this tutorial 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.080
 We will give you some tips on how to do it 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.080
 format your computer 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.930
 before you can install a new one 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.430
 operating system and then to format 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.100
 a little more then we must make sure 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.940
 to have our operating system up 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.680
 a disk or on usb that once that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.510
 we have our usb stick or the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.370
 our disk with our system 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.480
 operating within we can proceed 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.809
 with the installation 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.390
 but first an important step is recovery 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.590
 of leiber and what drivers are drivers 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.060
 are the details the drivers are from 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.760
 special software that allows us 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.950
 to use the hardware components of the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.390
 our computer for example we have the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.710
 video card that allows us to 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.780
 watch videos but without video drivers 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.970
 video we cannot access precisely to 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.000
 this resource and being able to look at ours 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.509
 movie or whatever it is on ours 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.460
 computer 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.070
 so the drivers are very important 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.790
 because otherwise our computer does not 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.670
 would make a bat would be a computer 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.659
 totally 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.280
 useless then to make backups of 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.140
 driver we recommend a utility that 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.049
 especially liked what it's called 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.170
 drivermax drivermax is a software that 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.750
 allows backup and you later 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.530
 restoring the drivers we have in the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.149
 our computer 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.520
 be careful though before doing this 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.110
 we need to make sure the drivers are 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.119
 compatible with the operating system that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.220
 we are installing now here we have a 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.080
 computer with windows 95 and we want 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.440
 install windows 7 stuff on it from 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.720
 crazy 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.510
 we need to make sure the drivers are 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.209
 compatible with windows 7 is of course 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:22.660
 a car just because windows 95 anticoli 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:25.090
 and 18 years ago so we don't have to 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.400
 install an operating system too 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.769
 new or we can but in case 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.480
 the drivers are compatible 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.760
 this can be done nice in the case 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.190
 where the computer we're going to 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.810
 to install an operating system either 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.769
 still accessible or you can 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.470
 turn on you can install 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.540
 programs in the event that ours 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.730
 operating system is completely dead 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.799
 which among other things the reason for which of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.390
 Usually computers are formed and we must 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.200
 go look for the driver later 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.579
 subsequently how to do this is necessary 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.970
 access computer information 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.010
 and and view all the drivers in the pairs 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.930
 which we have in the case of computers 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.790
 typhoons also for stationary computers 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.230
 however, we can not be assembled 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.750
 go directly to the website of 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.230
 computer manufacturer that is acer than 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.609
 both hp asus etc. and so on and try 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.780
 directly the model of ours 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.100
 computer and download automatically 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.540
 all drivers 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.609
 if instead we have an assembled computer 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.470
 as well as a computer and older flora than 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.750
 not 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.740
 does not appear on the internet page of the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.210
 of the producer 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.280
 we have to go and do a search 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.290
 manual of all the drivers we have 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.580
 installed on our beautiful computer e 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.010
 recognize and use for vi 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.960
 I recommend a program like east level 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.950
 or same but I'm not sure of 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.780
 the latter 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.430
 r if it still allows you to access 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.470
 all your information of yours 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.650
 computer will in fact give you the names of the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.200
 drivers in the name of us drivers but names 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.690
 of the devices they will use 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.490
 these drivers make sure once c 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.650
 to be able to take the driver for 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.080
 any part or by March 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.700
 or through websites we can 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.500
 proceed to format our 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.360
 good computer that the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.100
 formatting of course will make you 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.180
 lose all the data you have on 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.430
 your computer 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.900
 so if you have important data 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.490
 etc if your computer 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.830
 of course it allows you 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.209
 backup this data first in the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.190
 in case the computer does not allow it 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.870
 you can also format the computer e 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.390
 then restore data later 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.970
 but later a tutorial on how 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.500
 recover important data too 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.000
 after formatting the computer 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.470
 today he did the tutorial written on 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.060
 blog that I recommend you read 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.130
 directly click the link here 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.419
 later as already mentioned but 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.100
 will come the video tutorial that you 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.310
 will explain how to recover 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.500
 this data even after passing 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.870
 years and years after having beaten us 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.510
 reformatted the disc etcetera 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.130
 once you have secured the drivers 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.960
 of their data there is from etcetera 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.700
 we can proceed with the formatting 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.810
 real from the computer to 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.070
 format the computer 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.620
 we need as already mentioned 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.110
 at the beginning of the disc or usb if 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.890
 we have a usb flash drive 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.690
 put them in the computer 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.550
 turn off the computer and ascension 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.229
 before the rate on chile asked for 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.419
 enter the keys to press in the bios 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.550
 vary according to the manufacturer of 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.430
 computer can be taken as it can 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.140
 being f2 can also be given is that the 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.940
 enter button etcetera 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.819
 will appear anyway at the beginning when 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.860
 turn on the computer press 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.110
 hicks for example to access the bios 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.150
 once you have logged in to 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.970
 bios we need to move to a tab 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.509
 which has as its name and face or something of the 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.520
 gender 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.919
 in this tab we will find the various 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.990
 partitions from which we can start 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.060
 our our operating system the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.919
 our computer so if we have 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.780
 once the disc is inserted we will select the 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.250
 partition of the disk while if we have 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.979
 installed our operating system 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.970
 on fb we will select as peripheral of 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:48.810
 USB boot once the computer is turned on or 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.690
 the usual will appear from cd or usb 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.550
 windows or installation screen 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.319
 of the operating system that you are anyway 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.780
 going to install here of course 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.280
 no need to explain how 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.250
 to install because it is a procedure 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.870
 rather automatic it will be anyway 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.240
 always guided on the screen then 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.949
 just click next enter a name 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.569
 user and a password in case of 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.460
 please always proceed with 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.259
 installation to the finished installation 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.440
 your computer was correctly 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.699
 form state and now you are ready for 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.830
 reuse it but before doing all that 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.810
 we need to reset the drivers in the case 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.969
 where we have driver backups with 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.849
 drivermax we have to reinstall 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.130
 drivermax so maybe get yourself a 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.630
 beretta with inside the file 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.639
 executables of dyer max because 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.860
 of course we will not be able to connect to 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.080
 network and we could not download it 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.909
 put the drivermax file on one 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.190
 key insert which key on the 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:43.529
 computers installed at drivermax and after 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.509
 which you can restore all 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:47.130
 drivers who had prior if Thebes capped 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.539
 for when your computer was not 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.250
 working so you couldn't 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.349
 back appears of the network with drivermax 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.630
 you have to look for drivers from another 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.699
 computer because your computer does not 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.229
 you can even connect to the internet in 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.120
 as clear as the card driver 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.949
 and is therefore but we are on another 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.750
 computer we download all the i 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.529
 our drivers put them on a nice one 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.500
 USB pendrive 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:08.960
 we then go back one by one the drivers there 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.690
 they come there 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.400
 united that we have downloaded and once 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.100
 done that we restart the computer and the 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.960
 our computer will be perfectly 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.340
 working if you have questions or questions 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.080
