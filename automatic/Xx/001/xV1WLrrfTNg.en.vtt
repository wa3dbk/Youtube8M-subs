going to line yourself with anybody but
they're<00:04:28.280> bad<00:04:28.460> guys<00:04:28.490> they<00:04:29.030> rolled<00:04:29.240> in<00:04:29.419> they

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
they're bad guys they rolled in they

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.120 
they're bad guys they rolled in they
burn<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.960> town<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.290> ground<00:04:30.470> they

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
burn the town of the ground they

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.950 
burn the town of the ground they
crucified<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.940> NCR<00:04:32.300> officers<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.810> were

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.550 

so<00:04:39.180> real-time<00:04:39.510> mode<00:04:39.690> really<00:04:39.960> does<00:04:40.110> work<00:04:40.290> a<00:04:40.410> lot

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
so real-time mode really does work a lot

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.990 
so real-time mode really does work a lot
better<00:04:40.680> now<00:04:40.920> we<00:04:40.980> have<00:04:41.160> iron<00:04:41.400> sights<00:04:41.760> for<00:04:41.940> all

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
better now we have iron sights for all

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.760 
better now we have iron sights for all
our<00:04:42.150> guns<00:04:44.660> we've<00:04:45.660> redone<00:04:45.990> all<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.380> attack<00:04:46.620> and
