00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
drives me to doing this is the fact that

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.720

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
carved a niche for himself or herself

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
carved a niche for himself or herself
into<00:01:24.000> an<00:01:24.119> industry<00:01:24.360> which<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:24.930> probably<00:01:25.140> not

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
into an industry which was probably not

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.399 
into an industry which was probably not
traversed<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> past<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.930> far<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.170> I'm

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
traversed in the past and as far as I'm

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.310 
traversed in the past and as far as I'm
concerned<00:01:28.439> well<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:30.000> report<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.689> sports<00:01:31.049> on

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
concerned well I I report on sports on

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
concerned well I I report on sports on
television<00:01:31.799> sports<00:01:32.369> anchor<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
television sports anchor and this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
television sports anchor and this
industry<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.549> dominated<00:01:36.150> by

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
industry is not really dominated by

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.390 
industry is not really dominated by
women<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> think<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.799> selected<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
women so I think I was selected to be a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.190 
women so I think I was selected to be a
Mercedes<00:01:39.060> a-class

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
Mercedes a-class

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
I have in a way I guess carved a niche

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.940 
I have in a way I guess carved a niche
for<00:01:42.960> myself

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.649
