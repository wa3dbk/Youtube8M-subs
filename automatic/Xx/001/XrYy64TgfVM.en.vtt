in<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.110> front<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.740> says<00:01:10.950> professional

condenser<00:01:12.510> then<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.130> going

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
condenser then here I think it's going

condenser then here I think it's going
to<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.760> microphone<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> don't<00:01:15.900> think

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
to be the microphone but I don't think

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.390 
to be the microphone but I don't think
this<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.620> actual<00:01:16.800> picture

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.290 
the microphone itself and I like the
combination<00:02:03.870> of<00:02:04.260> blue<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.800> gold<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.850> makes<00:02:06.150> it

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
combination of blue and gold it makes it

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.660 
combination of blue and gold it makes it
look<00:02:06.420> very<00:02:06.450> very<00:02:07.050> fancy<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.800> here<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.489> see

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
look very very fancy and here we can see

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.020 
look very very fancy and here we can see
that<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> has<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.479> model<00:02:09.899> PM<00:02:10.610> 800<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.790> then

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that it has the model PM 800 and then

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.559 
that it has the model PM 800 and then
this<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> brand<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.940> Hangu<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.269> don't

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
this is the brand is a Hangu I don't

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.570 
this is the brand is a Hangu I don't
know<00:02:15.660> how<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.810> pronounce<00:02:16.019> that<00:02:16.379> but<00:02:16.560> here<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
know how you pronounce that but here you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.899 
know how you pronounce that but here you
guys<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.970> read<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.680> mean<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.670> quite

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
guys can read it so I mean it is quite

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.729 
guys can read it so I mean it is quite
heavy<00:02:21.269> already<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.930> then<00:02:22.019> here<00:02:22.230> we<00:02:22.319> have<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
heavy already and then here we have the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.680 
heavy already and then here we have the
connector<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.489> bottom<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.480> pretty

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
connector at the bottom so it's pretty

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.050 
connector at the bottom so it's pretty
much<00:02:24.810> standard<00:02:25.110> nothing<00:02:25.680> fancy<00:02:26.129> here<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:26.610> I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
much standard nothing fancy here and I

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.360 
much standard nothing fancy here and I
think<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.510> does<00:02:27.720> require<00:02:28.110> batteries<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
think it does require batteries so I

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.710 
think it does require batteries so I
think<00:02:29.490> we<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.970> open<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.360> here<00:02:30.450> at<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
think we have to open it here at the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.470 
think we have to open it here at the
bottom<00:02:31.080> I'm<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:31.740> quite<00:02:32.010> sure<00:02:32.040> yet<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
bottom I'm not quite sure yet and it

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.620 
bottom I'm not quite sure yet and it
only<00:02:33.600> requires<00:02:33.750> one

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
only requires one

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.080 
only requires one
battery<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.350> it's<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:36.010> double-a<00:02:36.430> battery<00:02:36.790> so

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
battery so it's a double-a battery so

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.450 
battery so it's a double-a battery so
that's<00:02:37.270> very<00:02:37.510> nice<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.080> for<00:02:39.010> now<00:02:39.100> let's<00:02:39.370> just

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
that's very nice and for now let's just

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.360 
that's very nice and for now let's just
leave<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:40.090> aside<00:02:40.770> because<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.980> does<00:02:42.130> come

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
leave this aside because it does come

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.770 
leave this aside because it does come
with<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.550> battery<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.210> can<00:02:43.360> see<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.660> right

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
with a battery and we can see it right

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.140 
with a battery and we can see it right
here<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.200> double-a<00:02:44.590> cheap<00:02:45.130> battery<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:46.120> I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
here it's a double-a cheap battery so I

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.760 
here it's a double-a cheap battery so I
would<00:02:46.450> recommend<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.080> know<00:02:47.110> just<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.650> be

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
would recommend you know just to be

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.880 
would recommend you know just to be
secure<00:02:48.220> put<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> good<00:02:49.330> branded<00:02:49.780> battery<00:02:50.140> like<00:02:50.860> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
secure put a good branded battery like a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.610 
secure put a good branded battery like a
Doris<00:02:51.340> L<00:02:51.580> or<00:02:51.880> energizer<00:02:52.570> then<00:02:53.080> here<00:02:53.320> we<00:02:53.410> have

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
Doris L or energizer then here we have

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.620 
Doris L or energizer then here we have
the<00:02:54.010> thing<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:54.790> called<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.300> sponge

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
the thing this is called the sponge

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.730 
the thing this is called the sponge
cover<00:02:56.020> then<00:02:56.890> here<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.300> shock<00:02:58.900> mount

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
cover then here we have the shock mount

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.100 
cover then here we have the shock mount
and<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.660> put<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.960> on<00:03:02.080> a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
and this is so that you can put it on a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.190 
and this is so that you can put it on a
tripod<00:03:02.580> now<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.970> already<00:03:04.360> noticed<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.870> this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
tripod now I already noticed that this

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.110 
tripod now I already noticed that this
type<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.710> connector<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.460> don't<00:03:06.640> think<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:06.940> fits

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
type of connector I don't think it fits

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.060 
type of connector I don't think it fits
on<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.330> regular<00:03:07.750> tripod<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> will<00:03:08.770> have<00:03:08.890> to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
on a regular tripod so I will have to

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.370 
on a regular tripod so I will have to
you<00:03:09.670> know<00:03:09.820> work<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.240> it<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.570> see<00:03:10.630> how<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.110> works

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
you know work on it and see how it works

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.110 
you know work on it and see how it works
but<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.710> guys<00:03:11.890> are<00:03:12.190> actually<00:03:12.670> going<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:12.910> hear

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
but you guys are actually going to hear

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.570 
but you guys are actually going to hear
me<00:03:13.300> on<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.260> next<00:03:14.500> video<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:15.040> think<00:03:15.400> I'm<00:03:15.460> going

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
me on the next video I think I'm going

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.980 
me on the next video I think I'm going
to<00:03:15.640> be<00:03:15.790> using<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.240> and<00:03:16.450> I'm<00:03:16.540> going<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.750> try<00:03:16.930> to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
to be using this and I'm going to try to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.290 
to be using this and I'm going to try to
you<00:03:17.440> know<00:03:17.470> test<00:03:17.800> it<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.490> see<00:03:18.730> how<00:03:18.760> well<00:03:19.120> it

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
you know test it now and see how well it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.650 
you know test it now and see how well it
does<00:03:19.500> then<00:03:20.500> here<00:03:20.920> last<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:21.490> not<00:03:21.580> least<00:03:21.850> we

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
does then here last but not least we

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.110 
does then here last but not least we
have<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.990> actual<00:03:23.350> connector<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.190> then<00:03:25.000> this

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
have the actual connector and then this

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.570 
have the actual connector and then this
is<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:25.390> one<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.720> goes<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.770> camcorder<00:03:26.980> or

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
is the one that goes to the camcorder or

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.400 
is the one that goes to the camcorder or
whatever<00:03:28.060> device<00:03:28.240> you're<00:03:28.570> connecting<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.200> to

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
whatever device you're connecting it to

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.620 
whatever device you're connecting it to
and<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.670> connector<00:03:31.270> that<00:03:31.420> goes

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
and this is the connector that goes

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.500 
and this is the connector that goes
directly<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.590> microphone<00:03:33.130> alright<00:03:33.790> so

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
directly to the microphone alright so

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.000 
directly to the microphone alright so
there's<00:03:34.720> nothing<00:03:34.960> else<00:03:35.170> inside<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.770> box

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
there's nothing else inside the box

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.460 
there's nothing else inside the box
let's<00:03:36.940> get<00:03:37.180> here<00:03:37.390> back<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> microphone

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
let's get here back to the microphone

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.030 
let's get here back to the microphone
and<00:03:38.760> let's<00:03:39.760> put<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.240> battery<00:03:40.570> so<00:03:41.230> let's

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
and let's put on the battery so let's

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.510 
and let's put on the battery so let's
take<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.370> out<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.860> can<00:03:44.890> already<00:03:45.190> see<00:03:45.490> I

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
take this out and you can already see I

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.280 
take this out and you can already see I
mean<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.850> quality<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.540> looks<00:03:46.870> very<00:03:47.050> nice

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
mean the quality of it looks very nice

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.980 
mean the quality of it looks very nice
so<00:03:47.590> far<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.850> let<00:03:49.240> me<00:03:49.270> go<00:03:49.450> ahead<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.690> put<00:03:49.870> the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
so far so let me go ahead and put the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.730 
so far so let me go ahead and put the
battery<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.500> here<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.490> comes<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.740> little

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
battery on here it comes in a little

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.330 
battery on here it comes in a little
seal<00:03:54.340> cover<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:56.200> I<00:03:56.890> think<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.370> goes<00:03:57.580> like<00:03:58.300> this

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
seal cover and I think it goes like this

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.949 
seal cover and I think it goes like this
yep<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.610> now<00:04:01.540> let's<00:04:02.110> put<00:04:02.380> this<00:04:02.500> back<00:04:02.740> on<00:04:02.980> here

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
yep and now let's put this back on here

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.670 
yep and now let's put this back on here
and<00:04:05.160> here<00:04:06.160> we<00:04:06.280> have<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:07.300> I<00:04:07.690> think<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.530> does

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
and here we have it so I think it does

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.860 
and here we have it so I think it does
go<00:04:08.890> like<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.580> got<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.150> work<00:04:10.300> on<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:10.810> see

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
go like this I got to work on it and see

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.040 
go like this I got to work on it and see
how<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.500> works<00:04:11.770> completely<00:04:12.459> but<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.420> far<00:04:13.720> I

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
how it works completely but so far I

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.070

has like some sort of equalizer on the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.910 
has like some sort of equalizer on the
screen<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.600> hand<00:04:43.110> quarter<00:04:43.350> of<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.530> Canon

screen of the hand quarter of the Canon
and<00:04:44.100> it's<00:04:44.220> actually<00:04:44.550> very<00:04:44.760> cool<00:04:45.030> because<00:04:45.240> as<00:04:45.510> I

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
and it's actually very cool because as I

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.320
