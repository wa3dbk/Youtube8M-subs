the<00:03:01.770> time<00:03:01.920> when<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.610> told<00:03:02.910> everyone<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.180> just

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the time when I told everyone to just

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.570 
the time when I told everyone to just
download<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.959> game<00:03:04.140> plays<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.250> would<00:03:05.400> take

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
download the game plays and I would take

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.310 
download the game plays and I would take
him<00:03:05.700> down<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.150> kinda<00:03:06.630> was<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:06.900> looking<00:03:07.110> at<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
him down I kinda was just looking at the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.500 
him down I kinda was just looking at the
easiest<00:03:07.860> decision<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.820> make<00:03:09.000> honestly

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
easiest decision to make honestly

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.090 
easiest decision to make honestly
because<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.750> don't<00:03:10.020> have<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.230> do<00:03:10.410> any<00:03:10.620> work<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:11.010> I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
because I don't have to do any work if I

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.800 
because I don't have to do any work if I
just<00:03:11.250> tell<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.430> guys<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> download<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.390> but<00:03:12.570> I

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
just tell you guys to download it but I

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.290 
just tell you guys to download it but I
figured<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.440> kind<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.890> wasn't<00:03:14.070> fair<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.730> read

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
figured it kind of wasn't fair I read

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.610 
figured it kind of wasn't fair I read
