like<00:00:38.300> this<00:00:38.510> was<00:00:38.690> one<00:00:38.870> of<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:39.080> techniques<00:00:39.470> we

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
like this was one of the techniques we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.080 
like this was one of the techniques we
learned<00:00:40.240> it's<00:00:41.240> called<00:00:41.510> reverse<00:00:41.840> applique<00:00:42.320> and

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
learned it's called reverse applique and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.700 
learned it's called reverse applique and
what<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:44.210> do<00:00:44.330> is<00:00:44.360> you<00:00:44.630> take<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.870> stencil<00:00:45.500> like

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
what you do is you take a stencil like

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.320 
what you do is you take a stencil like
this<00:00:45.950> I<00:00:46.220> actually<00:00:46.370> did<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:46.850> on<00:00:47.030> them<00:00:47.150> and

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
this I actually did this on them and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.780 
this I actually did this on them and
then<00:00:47.810> you've<00:00:48.020> drew<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.380> on<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.920> then<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.640> put

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
then you've drew it on and then you put

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.610 
then you've drew it on and then you put
some<00:00:50.000> fabric<00:00:50.390> behind<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:50.900> and<00:00:51.050> sewed<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.470> on

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
some fabric behind it and sewed it on

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.690 
some fabric behind it and sewed it on
and<00:00:52.520> then<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:54.200> cut<00:00:54.560> it<00:00:54.680> out<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:55.520> you've

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
and then you cut it out and so you've

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.790 
and then you cut it out and so you've
got<00:00:55.730> this<00:00:55.970> cool<00:00:56.450> shaped<00:00:56.960> piece<00:00:57.170> of<00:00:57.290> fabric<00:00:57.440> and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
got this cool shaped piece of fabric and

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.560 
got this cool shaped piece of fabric and
then<00:00:58.040> you've<00:00:58.220> got<00:00:58.400> this<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:59.060> lot<00:00:59.450> of<00:00:59.540> different

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
then you've got this a lot of different

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.430 
then you've got this a lot of different
forms<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.230> manual<00:01:00.590> stitching<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.660> well<00:01:02.660> now

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
forms of manual stitching and well now

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.350 
forms of manual stitching and well now
can<00:01:03.770> basically<00:01:03.950> like<00:01:04.250> use<00:01:04.520> that<00:01:04.550> along<00:01:05.330> with

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
can basically like use that along with

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.640 
can basically like use that along with
the<00:01:06.080> assumption<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.160> have<00:01:07.460> at<00:01:07.580> home<00:01:07.760> and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
the assumption that have at home and

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.170 
the assumption that have at home and
well<00:01:09.650> that'll<00:01:09.950> just<00:01:10.130> add<00:01:10.340> on<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.760> like<00:01:10.910> you

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
well that'll just add on to like you
