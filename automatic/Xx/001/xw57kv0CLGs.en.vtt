00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:12.540
 The game of Baystars vs. Hawks at Yokohama Stadium is over 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:19.700
 Softbank Hawks win over 11 times 4 to 2 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.700
 Now I'm looking back on the game, but first won Fukuoka Softbank 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.990
 protection of were i willow also it it was amazing 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.590
 I had a goose bumps on my home run today 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.040
 Well as its home run also look back later 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.640
 Though it is Kenichi Nakata who is a starter 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.809
 Is it characteristic of curry or taste? 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.170
 Start the lead batter suddenly in the form of a straight foreball 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:52.610
 Though it is a familiar sight 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:57.890
 It's not so good, though, as a reflection material 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:02.870
 Strong BayStars ask you where you Well I like that I'm Nakata players to 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.890
 I wonder if you Oite seven times during the two runs to a strong lineup 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:12.979
 He showed me great pitching content 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.390
 After all, it is an impression that today was a lot of sharpness of the ball was outstanding 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.700
 of course 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:24.890
 Although the in the straight I throw a ball of about ne 145 km 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.880
 After all, what was the best thing today was that folk balls were firmly decided 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.560
 I wonder where it was 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.290
 3 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.979
 It is Nakata pitcher who has 4 wins in a row, but I will not make a game firmly in the future 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.330
 Kana 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:42.000
 Because of you is to suppress the lineup by Tara After all now the base 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:48.150
 Meanwhile, it is unreasonable but today 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:55.320
 Japan pitcher raised in a pinch of 1 out of full swing 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:56.220
 Hey this year it is big growth but I use the director in a really good scene and meet the expectation 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.990
 Isn't it 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:08.960
 Against Japan with Naa Mr. shells set upper of the needle Otsu is destroy the tone 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:14.600
 It was today's throwing contents that came into the lower set upper frame 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:18.740
 2-out bases loaded 3 balls 2 strikes last suppresses the Barudirisu in the form of a slider 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.140
 But i really experienced 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.540
 Such shallow Among them, 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.550
 Without the ball and fork from the great ball strike to the ball 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.290
 Pitcher sail is throwing a slider 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:40.739
 It is a good scene from now on 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.900
 Esett showed me a throw that there might not be a closer in the future 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.650
 The 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.349
 Now 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:55.120
 Up to 2 Well Kedomo is the mackerel hand of dyed there is a place called have peace of mind to see the 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:59.049
 Come on now, but Uchikawa players 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:04.910
 It is a senior of former US SARS but from Miura Daisuke pitcher 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:11.030
 The huge one- shot slider was covered abundantly Today Uchikawa player hit 3 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.200
 From now on, the engine has been fully open 30% too much, so it has exceeded a part so much Uchikawa 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.250
 Though it is a player 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.380
 It is safe to look at, but I hit a good Deho player 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.070
 Well hit line is not quite hit in timely form, but really 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.070
 Great 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.790
 I think that I showed you how to take points today 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:39.250
 Though it is Akashi player who decided squeeze in that 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:43.540
 In the previous at-bat, half swing, half-hearted swing is shook and called a strikeout 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:51.069
 I it was thought Bekitto return the borrowed 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:52.280
 It is also a good vote for the evidence investment that decided the squeeze ball that the ramping of Kuniyoshi investment in the squeeze 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.010
 Ne 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:02.409
 And let's look back 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.409
 It is Iki Yanagida who was the player of today's attention but it is two home run Japan 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:14.300
 The first home run was on the far top of the back screen of Yokohama Stadium 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:21.040
 It is about that a bulletin board has a pepper for a while 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:22.639
 It was a great hit, but it feels good to see if the bat shakes that much 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.530
 truly 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:33.469
 I can't throw in the strike zone I 'm afraid I can't collect pitchers 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:37.210
 And one shot of Todome throws with a liner to a light stand 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:43.210
 One player who is protecting the light 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.710
 It is also home to know that it was moving or not moving at the moment it was really struck with a liner 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:54.010
 Car by run 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:57.300
 Will I still be able to score points with a single offensive around the Hawks battering line after tomorrow ? 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.300
 Your calibration E tomorrow
