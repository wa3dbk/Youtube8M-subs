noticeable that's the toe box the toe
box<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> bit<00:00:17.670> slimmer<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> Authentics

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.840 
box is a bit slimmer on the Authentics
but<00:00:19.140> that's<00:00:19.410> really<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> big<00:00:20.070> deal<00:00:20.279> because

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
but that's really not a big deal because

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.189 
but that's really not a big deal because
people<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.449> staying<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:22.160> or<00:00:23.160> from<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.609> angle

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
translucent because I have seen some
horrible<00:01:55.950> replicas<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.360> straight<00:01:57.750> up

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
horrible replicas to have a straight up

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.080 
horrible replicas to have a straight up
solid<00:01:58.500> baby<00:01:58.680> blue<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.610> did<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.790> work

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
solid baby blue and that did not work

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
solid baby blue and that did not work
for<00:02:00.299> me<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> called<00:02:00.750> them<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.710> really

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
for me I called them out really really

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.620 
for me I called them out really really
quick

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
quick

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.280 
quick
the<00:02:03.630> transition<00:02:04.259> from<00:02:04.469> blue<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.979> purple<00:02:05.189> is

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
the transition from blue to purple is

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.779 
the transition from blue to purple is
spectacular<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:08.009> believe<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
spectacular it I believe on the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.839 
spectacular it I believe on the
Authentics<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.720> around<00:02:10.020> right<00:02:10.560> here

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
Authentics it's more around right here

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.920 
Authentics it's more around right here
but<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.000> know<00:02:12.090> no<00:02:12.239> one's<00:02:12.420> really<00:02:12.540> gonna<00:02:12.750> know

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
but you know no one's really gonna know

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.490 
but you know no one's really gonna know
the<00:02:13.080> exact

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the exact

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.190 
the exact
so<00:02:13.980> let's<00:02:14.160> get<00:02:14.250> into<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.640> surface<00:02:15.090> design<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
so let's get into the surface design it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.300 
so let's get into the surface design it
should<00:02:16.350> be<00:02:16.500> scrolled<00:02:16.770> down<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.950> little<00:02:17.160> bit

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
should be scrolled down a little bit

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
should be scrolled down a little bit
more<00:02:17.490> that's<00:02:17.880> really<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:20.610> too<00:02:20.850> up<00:02:21.000> it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
more that's really it it's too up it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.290 
more that's really it it's too up it
should<00:02:21.540> only<00:02:21.630> be<00:02:21.750> showing<00:02:22.050> about<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:24.060> much

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
should only be showing about that much

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.660 
should only be showing about that much
the<00:02:25.290> same<00:02:25.530> goes<00:02:25.800> with<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.100> one<00:02:26.160> about<00:02:26.460> that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
the same goes with this one about that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.840 
the same goes with this one about that
much<00:02:27.800> other<00:02:28.800> than<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.190> everything<00:02:29.520> else<00:02:29.610> is

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
much other than that everything else is

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.530 
much other than that everything else is
pretty<00:02:30.000> good

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
pretty good

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.630 
pretty good
the<00:02:30.630> tongue<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.230> printed<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.459> not<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
the tongue is printed on this is not a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.300 
the tongue is printed on this is not a
lace<00:02:32.880> wound<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.900> there<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:35.040> just

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
lace wound this is just there it's just

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.480 
lace wound this is just there it's just
there<00:02:35.490> it's<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.910> lace<00:02:36.120> hole<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:37.400> think<00:02:38.400> I

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
there it's not a lace hole I think I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.390 
there it's not a lace hole I think I
basically<00:02:38.940> covered<00:02:39.270> all<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> left<00:02:40.080> shoe

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
basically covered all of the left shoe

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.320 
basically covered all of the left shoe
the<00:02:41.400> carbon<00:02:41.760> fiber<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.240> not<00:02:42.300> carbon<00:02:42.840> fiber

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
the carbon fiber is not carbon fiber

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.110 
the carbon fiber is not carbon fiber
let's<00:02:45.330> see<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.440> right<00:02:46.620> shoe<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.640> design<00:02:47.970> is

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
let's see the right shoe the design is

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.760 
let's see the right shoe the design is
on<00:02:48.209> point<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> bit<00:02:49.140> lighter<00:02:49.410> than<00:02:49.620> it's

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
on point it is a bit lighter than it's

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.250 
on point it is a bit lighter than it's
supposed<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.580> bit<00:02:51.570> more<00:02:51.720> cartoonish

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
supposed to be a bit more cartoonish

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.640 
supposed to be a bit more cartoonish
looking<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.970> fabric<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.959> texture<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.410> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
looking the fabric the texture of the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.110 
looking the fabric the texture of the
shoe<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.100> lot<00:02:56.430> different<00:02:56.580> than<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
shoe is a lot different than the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.850 
shoe is a lot different than the
authentic<00:02:57.810> scuzz<00:02:57.989> all<00:02:58.170> Authentics<00:02:58.739> have

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
authentic scuzz all Authentics have

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.660 
authentic scuzz all Authentics have
engineered<00:02:59.310> mesh<00:02:59.580> this<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.330> more<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:01.670> fabric

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
engineered mesh this is more of a fabric

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.729 
engineered mesh this is more of a fabric
just<00:03:02.850> fabric<00:03:04.730> but<00:03:05.730> yeah<00:03:05.850> that's<00:03:06.030> basically<00:03:06.150> it

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
just fabric but yeah that's basically it

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.949 
just fabric but yeah that's basically it
even<00:03:08.550> if<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.730> guys<00:03:08.850> can't<00:03:09.090> afford<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.570> actual

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
even if you guys can't afford the actual

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.540 
even if you guys can't afford the actual
with<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.200> Kobe's<00:03:10.560> then<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.130> go<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> jump

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
with the Kobe's then just go to jump

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.280 
with the Kobe's then just go to jump
