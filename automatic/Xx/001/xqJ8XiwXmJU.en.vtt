00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
single day and you know that single day

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.280 
single day and you know that single day
it<00:02:39.010> has<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.610> capacity<00:02:39.850> for<00:02:40.360> each<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.720> us<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.140> make

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
it has a capacity for each of us to make

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.040 
it has a capacity for each of us to make
us<00:02:41.440> either<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.890> little<00:02:42.160> larger<00:02:42.640> as<00:02:43.360> humans<00:02:43.810> are

us either a little larger as humans are

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.680 
us either a little larger as humans are
a<00:02:44.080> little<00:02:44.500> smaller<00:02:44.950> go<00:02:45.700> separated<00:02:46.450> from<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
a little smaller go separated from the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.920 
a little smaller go separated from the
tour<00:02:46.900> yes<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.910> felt<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.270> character<00:02:49.780> was

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
tour yes I felt that this character was

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.900 
tour yes I felt that this character was
sort<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.709> caught<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:50.920> like<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.459> weight<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
sort of caught in like the weight the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.420 
sort of caught in like the weight the
vortex<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.630> Edith<00:02:53.320> which<00:02:53.500> was<00:02:53.680> her<00:02:53.920> character

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
vortex of Edith which was her character

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.460 
vortex of Edith which was her character
machine<00:02:54.790> blows<00:02:55.090> into<00:02:55.300> his<00:02:55.510> life<00:02:55.750> again<00:02:56.140> he

machine blows into his life again he
kind<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.860> gets<00:02:56.980> sucked<00:02:57.489> into<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:57.970> energy<00:02:58.209> and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
kind of gets sucked into this energy and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.320 
kind of gets sucked into this energy and
he's<00:02:59.200> just<00:02:59.410> like<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.980> know<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.130> he<00:03:01.090> can't

help but follow and he gets so engaged

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.380 
help but follow and he gets so engaged
so<00:03:04.180> quickly<00:03:04.830> because<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:06.070> this<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.820> energy

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
so quickly because of this this energy

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.509 
so quickly because of this this energy
that<00:03:07.420> he<00:03:07.630> hasn't<00:03:07.959> felt<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.440> his<00:03:08.560> life<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:09.010> many
