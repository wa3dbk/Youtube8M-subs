they<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.850> way<00:02:56.030> for<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.360> yeah<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.930> think

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
they have the way for it yeah I think

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.750 
they have the way for it yeah I think
that's<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.410> smart<00:02:57.530> decision<00:02:57.830> as<00:02:58.160> well<00:02:58.310> can

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
that's a smart decision as well can

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.490 
that's a smart decision as well can
depend<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.180> if<00:02:59.420> candy<00:02:59.810> panel<00:03:00.110> almost<00:03:00.290> get<00:03:00.410> the
