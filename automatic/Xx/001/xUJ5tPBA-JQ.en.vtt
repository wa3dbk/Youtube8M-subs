there<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.020> another<00:00:01.290> way<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.979> specify<00:00:02.250> a

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
there is another way to specify a

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.269 
there is another way to specify a
complex<00:00:02.970> number<00:00:03.650> for<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:04.710> other<00:00:04.920> way<00:00:05.069> we

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
complex number for this other way we

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.570 
complex number for this other way we
have<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.520> know<00:00:05.640> two<00:00:05.819> things<00:00:06.319> number<00:00:07.319> one<00:00:07.589> we

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
have to know two things number one we

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.150 
have to know two things number one we
need<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.849> know<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.510> distance<00:00:09.780> between<00:00:10.440> zero

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
need to know the distance between zero

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.709 
need to know the distance between zero
and<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.759> complex<00:00:12.120> number<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.660> are

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
and the complex number that we are

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.990 
and the complex number that we are
interested<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.230> expressing<00:00:13.639> let's<00:00:14.639> take<00:00:14.790> that

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
interested in expressing let's take that

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.510 
interested in expressing let's take that
for<00:00:15.240> example<00:00:15.859> so<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:17.010> need<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> know<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
for example so we need to know the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
for example so we need to know the
distance<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.289> distance<00:00:19.650> of

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
distance of this and the distance of

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.070 
distance of this and the distance of
this<00:00:20.010> line<00:00:20.279> segment<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.760> simply<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.570> modulus

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
this line segment is simply the modulus

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.730 
this line segment is simply the modulus
of<00:00:22.230> Z<00:00:23.359> now<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.930> need<00:00:25.140> another<00:00:25.470> piece<00:00:25.680> of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
of Z now we need another piece of

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.970 
of Z now we need another piece of
information<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.990> angle<00:00:28.140> let's

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
information and that is the angle let's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.669 
information and that is the angle let's
measure<00:00:29.279> from<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.970> positive<00:00:30.240> real<00:00:30.570> axis<00:00:30.869> to

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
measure from the positive real axis to

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.880 
measure from the positive real axis to
this<00:00:31.830> line<00:00:32.070> segment<00:00:32.550> which<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.210> call<00:00:33.239> theta

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
this line segment which we call theta

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.410 
this line segment which we call theta
now<00:00:34.890> notice<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.520> once<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
now notice that once you have the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.130 
now notice that once you have the
modulus<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.020> Z<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.370> angle<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.989> can

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
modulus of Z and this angle here you can

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290 
modulus of Z and this angle here you can
then<00:00:40.379> tell<00:00:40.649> me<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> exact<00:00:41.219> location<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.850> Z<00:00:42.120> on

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
then tell me the exact location of Z on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.369 
then tell me the exact location of Z on
the<00:00:42.510> complex<00:00:42.899> plane<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> let's<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.230> can

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the complex plane so let's see if we can

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.190 
the complex plane so let's see if we can
work<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.950> angle<00:00:47.340> theta<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:48.200> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
work out this angle theta here the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.560 
work out this angle theta here the
modulus<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.100> Z<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> not<00:00:50.940> difficult<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.360> obtain

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
modulus of Z is not difficult to obtain

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
modulus of Z is not difficult to obtain
because<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.920> already<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.670> number<00:00:54.180> here

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
because we already have the number here

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.639 
because we already have the number here
is<00:00:54.449> minus<00:00:54.989> 2<00:00:55.230> plus<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.239> modulus<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.930> Z<00:00:58.020> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
is minus 2 plus I so the modulus of Z is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.180 
is minus 2 plus I so the modulus of Z is
going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.480> square<00:01:00.750> root<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> minus<00:01:01.890> 2

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
going to be the square root of minus 2

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.899 
going to be the square root of minus 2
squared<00:01:03.120> plus<00:01:03.510> 1<00:01:03.930> squared<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
squared plus 1 squared and that is the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.920 
squared plus 1 squared and that is the
square<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> 5<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:08.220> calculate<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> angle<00:01:09.390> what

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
square of 5 to calculate the angle what

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.539 
square of 5 to calculate the angle what
we're<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> we're<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.250> work

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
we're going to do is we're going to work

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.020 
we're going to do is we're going to work
with<00:01:11.659> this<00:01:12.659> angle<00:01:13.290> instead<00:01:13.640> within<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
with this angle instead within this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.530 
with this angle instead within this
triangle<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.390> angle

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
triangle so this is a right angle

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.109 
triangle so this is a right angle
triangle<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:20.009> height<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.580> triangle<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
triangle the height of this triangle is

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.980 
triangle the height of this triangle is
1<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.990> base<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.439> triangle<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.920> 2<00:01:23.189> so

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
1 the base of this triangle is 2 so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.179 
1 the base of this triangle is 2 so
tangent<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.110> alpha<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:26.420> equal<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.450> 1/2<00:01:28.189> now

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
tangent of alpha is equal to 1/2 now

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.010 
tangent of alpha is equal to 1/2 now
once<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.850> alpha<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.780> calculate

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
once you have alpha you can calculate

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
once you have alpha you can calculate
theta<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:31.950> theta<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.909> given<00:01:33.840> by<00:01:34.040> pi

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
theta because theta is given by pi

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.899 
theta because theta is given by pi

minus<00:01:36.810> alpha<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> take<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.170> your

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
minus alpha so if you take out your

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.289 
minus alpha so if you take out your
calculator<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.950> complete<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> arctangent

of 1/2

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.880 
of 1/2
you'll<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.670> roughly<00:01:45.149> zero<00:01:45.540> point<00:01:45.960> four<00:01:46.409> six

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890

three six four seven six and so on and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.740 
three six four seven six and so on and
so<00:01:53.509> data<00:01:54.509> would<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.500> roughly<00:01:55.950> two<00:01:56.399> point<00:01:56.790> six

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750

so data would be roughly two point six
seven<00:01:58.409> seven<00:01:59.009> nine<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:01.070> we<00:02:02.070> usually

seven seven nine and so on we usually

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.639 
seven seven nine and so on we usually
use<00:02:02.850> our<00:02:03.149> L<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.630> denote<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.990> modulus<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
use our L to denote the modulus and

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.589 
use our L to denote the modulus and
we'll<00:02:05.399> write<00:02:05.700> Z<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.149> our<00:02:06.780> x<00:02:07.310> cos<00:02:08.310> theta<00:02:08.670> plus<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
we'll write Z as our x cos theta plus I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.520 
we'll write Z as our x cos theta plus I
