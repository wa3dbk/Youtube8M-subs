00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 especially great at my work 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.890
 me that I do not really 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.929
 knows what me of the day awaits you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.340
 See that the plant ran well all over 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.950
 Days were then you usually go with 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.410
 the good feeling home 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.810
 I could not even think just live constantly 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.010
 to do the same work 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.010
 but I need the challenge 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.860
 my name is all loks i am a 30 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.550
 years old and continued in the area 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.680
 injection 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.670
 I'm fascinated by the way the brand does that 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.670
 the quality 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.890
 was created especially at bmw he is 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.880
 responsible that the machine 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.770
 runs smoothly 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.540
 when somehow the machine stand a 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.940
 I have to be halfway through 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.160
 lift and everything connected with it 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.030
 the whole robot animation with it 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.030
 production continues 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.130
 my name is alexandra fischbach me 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.900
 I'm 24 years old in 2005 I have the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.390
 training at bmw golf as 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.720
 electronic engineer for industrial engineering since 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.380
 In 2009 I work in the bmw group in the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.369
 area maintenance be electric 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.869
 so far biggest highlight 1 2 knights 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.700
 stay abroad at the bmw plant in china 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.830
 I was allowed to work there as well 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.310
 Private really great experiences 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.310
 collect 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:47.080
 another motto fresher I am 24 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.580
 years old and working since 2005 at bmw 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.740
 100 very versatile tasks as 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.050
 systems lead because the presses plant 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.119
 very big and very extensive and that 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.390
 always something new is added what 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:03.650
 one also does not know my own yet 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.159
 main task is actually the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.380
 troubleshooting and troubleshooting 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.070
 and I personally think it's very 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.690
 varied because we have so many 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.260
 various technologies in use 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.769
 to have 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.890
 It never gets boring, I am also to 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.420
 better tinkerer and then as 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.250
 error sources makes the attempt the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.209
 so that the mistakes do not improve 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.209
 can occur again 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.820
 who me in the integrated carousel 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.570
 press shop body shop paintwork 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.910
 2000 robot changed control of the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.360
 supervise picture one of the central 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.170
 partner or capable of doing so is the in 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.490
 our stand holder is an essential 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.080
 point in the attitude plays 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.810
 of course the communication without 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.160
 ultimately nothing is running 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.740
 it is also responsible for that 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.830
 that in series 200 vehicles 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:02.380
 Working-day five will get you 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.300
 actually get a lot of recognition 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.520
 often times romand plant and say 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.450
 you done well in something heavy 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.450
 keep it or something 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.120
 I like the working environment very well 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.640
 at bmw so I have rarely company 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.070
 so we see that is pronounced 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.710
 help each other and generally the 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.580
 mood is very good too with the 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.900
 superiors 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.900
 that harmonizes easily 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.709
 I think that as an employer very much 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.500
 attractive because we paid very well 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.430
 will come as special payments 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.200
 I have the rule of working hours 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.030
 Among other things , bmw also supports us 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.900
 in our development or 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.900
 further education 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.220
 We are working on a product and me 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.500
 It is very important to keep finished product in 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.870
 to have a hand what quality stands for 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.709
 what I have produced myself and that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.599
 makes me proud 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.660
 everyone contributes to that 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.400
 end a premium product turntable factory hall 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.080
 leaves and that is actually one 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.530
 nice feeling i am glad that i am 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.530
 to lose
