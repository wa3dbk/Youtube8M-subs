 [music] 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.859
 mobile congress passed and the memory is not 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 almost nothing left to agree 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.980
 there were practically no outstanding devices 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.049
 but her 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.980
 and the same dozens but one smartphone 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.980
 so I remember 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.920
 with us sincerely and honestly practically 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.260
 all that recently did and honor 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.300
 and I didn't really like the backlash and creaking and 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.870
 obsolete iron is small and resolution 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.610
 display 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.680
 and dig even further there and delay with 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.070
 updates but everything quickly became his 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.650
 places 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.810
 htc one x almost perfect smartphone 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.700
 on android and other marchons poems 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.570
 one of the first to receive updates 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.190
 give cream sandwich 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.869
 the casing is as solid as 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.760
 it can only be imagined 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.040
 all go just a piece of polycarbonate 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.200
 a piece of glass and it is all assembled very 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.890
 cool but really every little hole 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.080
 each item 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.090
 well thought out where slurred 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.490
 volume key no she 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.619
 there is quite a convenient lock key on 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.300
 its right place top right and 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.530
 general Corgan of Miethe smartphone has 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.930
 only 12 all the same three questions this 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.000
 no camera key camera itself 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.500
 she's a little bulging muscles not at all 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.050
 recessed and the appearance of small 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.090
 Saratov and also connector micro usb hubs 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.619
 it would be better done from the bottom of course you can 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.600
 it would be carp for missing sauce 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.500
 for expanding micro sd memory cards on 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.319
 it is in this model unlike the van and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.729
 internal memory already 32 gigabytes + 25 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.619
 gigabytes of free space on 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.780
 fraction god which are given to all 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.390
 users of new smartphones htc on 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.819
 two years by simple reasoning 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.120
 and thinking one can easily guess what 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.720
 I now have these 25 gigabytes 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.370
 iphone 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.550
 if i were a little supply on 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.520
 Duller I would call the display of the new x 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.849
 a gem he is really cool on 4 and 7 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.240
 inches placed a resolution of 1280 by 720 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.250
 points 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.200
 like the widows of the nexus but the buttons here 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.510
 malnourished part of the display they are rendered 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.340
 there is no separate air gap at all 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.140
 and here it is not just the words picture 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.750
 really lies right under your fingers 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.200
 looks very cool glass burned voice 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.880
 2 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.160
 one more amazing thing about this 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.690
 his camera is installed here 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.360
 8 megapixel module with 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.130
 integrated processing processor 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.739
 images and poems and mouse chip first 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.140
 one more x takes a picture of me 7 seconds 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.630
 and the focus is triggered in 0 2 seconds 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.300
 maximum frame rate 4 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.319
 frames per second 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.000
 video is shot at the maximum 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.850
 1080p resolution 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.080
 you can take pictures while shooting 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.400
 camera interface is really serious 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.870
 finalized you no longer need 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.060
 switch between photo and video 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.800
 everything is on one screen 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.480
 photos themselves as video 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.060
 turn out really cool 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.239
 battery quality is not removed by its capacity 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.530
 is 1800 milliamps per hour and 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.360
 the autonomy of the smartphone should say no 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.400
 very good but the design itself 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.470
 certainly benefits from it to what 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.420
 did not think of an engineer from Tony dacheva yet 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.760
 sony engineers did not think so 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.800
 separate slot for sim cards or micro 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.390
 sim in this case, that is, you do not need 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.010
 disassemble the smartphone into three separate 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.870
 parts to insert a sim card 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.480
 The smartphone has a processor based on 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 nvidia tegra 3 but besides marketing in it 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.530
 nothing is the same interface is not always 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.290
 smooth differences in speed of work so 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.380
 same single core sensation xl practically 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.670
 not in games and performance tests 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.340
 Another thing here I am Darcy Veles 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.019
 RAM 1 gigabyte fourth 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.730
 sense version pleased me however 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.160
 I was always happy with me until 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.660
 released a third version and and hadron 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.370
 desktop collider 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.049
 now all obsession is removed and 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.480
 left only good for poverty and 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.970
 beauty fellows unlike samsung 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.970
 look not spoiled android which are here 4 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.890
 versions my personal opinion htc one x is 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.690
 the best android smartphone which is 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.640
 This moment is generally on the market 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.919
 great display pretty powerful iron 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.050
 and the nicest body were in my life 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.960
 smartphones that I liked more 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.000
 for sure they were but now I can't remember 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.920
 none of them 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.920
