can<00:00:00.510> i<00:00:00.599> generator<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.589> in<00:00:02.280> there<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:03.560> i<00:00:04.560> think

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
can i generator is in there and i think

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.530 
can i generator is in there and i think
i'm<00:00:04.890> going<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.190> take<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.549> advice<00:00:05.640> wander

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
i'm going to take the advice wander

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.980 
i'm going to take the advice wander

and Gary from lookout vehicles and turn
this<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.440> for<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.740> while<00:00:10.830> because<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.309> bought

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
this on for a while because I bought

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.230 
this on for a while because I bought
this<00:00:12.259> RV<00:00:13.259> from<00:00:13.769> some<00:00:13.980> old<00:00:14.160> people<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:15.000> been

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
this RV from some old people it been

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.779 
this RV from some old people it been
sitting<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.750> long<00:00:15.870> time<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.560> obviously

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
sitting for a long time so obviously

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.310 
sitting for a long time so obviously
they<00:00:17.789> didn't<00:00:18.060> run<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> generator<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:19.080> years

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
they didn't run the generator for years

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.300 
they didn't run the generator for years
and<00:00:19.560> years<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:22.320> ran<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.800> little<00:00:23.039> bit

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and years and I just ran it a little bit

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.200 
and years and I just ran it a little bit
when<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> first<00:00:24.090> got<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:25.050> few<00:00:25.760> months<00:00:26.760> ago

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
when I first got it a few months ago

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.470 
when I first got it a few months ago
so<00:00:27.420> we'll<00:00:28.410> try<00:00:28.590> turning<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.699> also<00:00:30.359> I'll

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
so we'll try turning it on and also I'll

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
so we'll try turning it on and also I'll
take<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> look<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:31.500> about<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.369> know

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
take a look at and think about you know

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.400 
take a look at and think about you know
changing<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.940> oil<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.480> giving<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.930> tune-up

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
changing the oil and giving it a tune-up

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.870 
changing the oil and giving it a tune-up
and<00:00:34.590> stuff<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.340> don't<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.760> what

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and stuff like that I don't know what

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.380 
and stuff like that I don't know what
I'm<00:00:36.000> doing<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.540> we'll<00:00:36.780> we'll<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.680> anyways

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
I'm doing but we'll we'll do it anyways

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
I'm doing but we'll we'll do it anyways
okay<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.450> here's<00:00:39.780> my<00:00:39.870> generator<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.860> an<00:00:41.010> Onan

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
okay so here's my generator it's an Onan

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.910 
okay so here's my generator it's an Onan
micro<00:00:41.700> quiet<00:00:41.940> 4000<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.020> no<00:00:43.320> idea<00:00:43.649> how<00:00:43.860> many

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
micro quiet 4000 I have no idea how many

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.150 
micro quiet 4000 I have no idea how many
hours<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.850> has<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> but

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
hours this thing has on it but

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.430 
hours this thing has on it but
considering<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> RV<00:00:48.000> only<00:00:48.239> had<00:00:48.440> 14,000

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
considering that the RV only had 14,000

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
considering that the RV only had 14,000
when<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> bought<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
when I bought it and there was like a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.139 
when I bought it and there was like a
couple<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.300> people<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.620> probably

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
couple little people it's probably

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.270 
couple little people it's probably
barely<00:00:54.149> got<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.110> three<00:00:55.680> hours<00:00:55.860> on

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
barely got you know like three hours on

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
barely got you know like three hours on
it<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.610> something<00:00:57.079> because<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.379> sure<00:00:58.590> they

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
it or something because I'm sure they

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.819 
it or something because I'm sure they
stayed<00:00:59.100> at<00:00:59.250> nice<00:00:59.460> parks<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.239> I'm<00:01:01.170> gonna<00:01:01.320> I'll

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
stayed at nice parks but I'm gonna I'll

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.149 
stayed at nice parks but I'm gonna I'll
open<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.309> says<00:01:02.550> open<00:01:02.969> right<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.159> let's

open it says open right there so let's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.620 
open it says open right there so let's
open<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.119> looks<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.360> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
open it up and see what it looks like in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
open it up and see what it looks like in
there<00:01:06.780> okay<00:01:07.680> well<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.460> looks

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
totally clean let as if it has never

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
totally clean let as if it has never
ever<00:01:11.369> been<00:01:11.520> run<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> gas<00:01:16.080> generator<00:01:17.689> okay

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
ever been run it's a gas generator okay

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.010 
ever been run it's a gas generator okay
there's<00:01:18.930> an<00:01:19.229> oil<00:01:19.850> thing<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.240> see

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
there's an oil thing so see

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.910 
there's an oil thing so see
that<00:01:26.590> thinks<00:01:26.890> house

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that thinks house

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.990 
that thinks house
stuck<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:31.700> work<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.850> getting

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
stuck on there I have to work on getting

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.350 
stuck on there I have to work on getting
that<00:01:33.180> off<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.590> oil<00:01:37.799> looks<00:01:38.070> totally<00:01:38.820> clean

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that off so the oil looks totally clean

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
that off so the oil looks totally clean
you<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.170> bet<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.649> I'll<00:01:40.860> bet<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.280> this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you know I bet you I'll bet you this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.679 
you know I bet you I'll bet you this
thing<00:01:41.729> has<00:01:41.850> never<00:01:41.970> been<00:01:42.210> run

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
thing has never been run

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.200 
thing has never been run
I'll<00:01:42.780> bet<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.070> got<00:01:44.250> an<00:01:44.430> hour<00:01:44.670> three

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
I'll bet that it's got an hour three

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.960 
I'll bet that it's got an hour three
hours<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.930> tops<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.860> anyways<00:01:47.190> I'll<00:01:47.430> run<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
hours on it tops so anyways I'll run it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
hours on it tops so anyways I'll run it
now<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.479> we'll<00:01:48.810> try<00:01:48.990> turning<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> air

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
now and we'll try turning on the air

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.310 
now and we'll try turning on the air
conditioner<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.149> yeah<00:01:51.360> yeah<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.289> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
conditioner so yeah yeah I got like a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.179 
conditioner so yeah yeah I got like a
brand<00:01:52.649> new<00:01:52.740> generator<00:01:54.439> okay<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.680> generator

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
brand new generator okay so my generator

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.870 
brand new generator okay so my generator
has<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:57.240> switch<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> dashboard

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
has a switch on the dashboard

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.340 
has a switch on the dashboard
the<00:02:00.360> music<00:02:01.100> symbol<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.780> turn<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.170> when

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the music symbol is turn that on when

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.570 
the music symbol is turn that on when
the<00:02:04.440> engines<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.950> running<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:05.550> the

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
the engines not running and then the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.059 
the engines not running and then the
lightning<00:02:06.119> bolt<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:06.569> for<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> generator<00:02:07.470> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
lightning bolt is for the generator and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.100 
lightning bolt is for the generator and
that<00:02:08.130> does<00:02:08.850> have<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> cigarette<00:02:09.810> lighter<00:02:09.989> that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
that does have a cigarette lighter that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.900 
that does have a cigarette lighter that
goes<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> keep<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
goes in there but I keep it out so that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.570 
goes in there but I keep it out so that
I<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.209> plug<00:02:12.959> an<00:02:13.140> inverter<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.430> let's

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
I can plug an inverter in there so let's

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:25.459 
I can plug an inverter in there so let's
see<00:02:14.670> what<00:02:14.819> happens

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:41.750 

it's<00:02:26.469> kind<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.769> sputtering

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.610 

okay<00:02:42.760> there's<00:02:42.970> running<00:02:43.270> now<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.840> can<00:02:44.260> hear<00:02:44.470> it

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
okay there's running now I can hear it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.830 
okay there's running now I can hear it
okay<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:46.240> we<00:02:46.330> go

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
okay so here we go

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.500 
okay so here we go
cool

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
cool

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.420 
cool
all<00:02:50.049> right

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
all right

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.729 
all right
it's<00:02:51.760> not<00:02:52.000> going<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:52.840> not<00:02:52.930> going<00:02:53.049> with<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
it's not going it's not going with the

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.330 
it's not going it's not going with the
generator<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.519> air-conditioner

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.470 

okay<00:03:01.350> let<00:03:02.350> me<00:03:02.470> try

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.839 

okay<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.260> my<00:03:08.530> air<00:03:08.709> conditioner<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.430> not<00:03:09.459> going

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
okay so my air conditioner is not going

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:20.010 
okay so my air conditioner is not going
to<00:03:09.910> run<00:03:10.150> with<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.230> generator

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.930 

okay<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.140> here<00:03:21.320> this<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:21.890> plug<00:03:22.550> into<00:03:22.760> the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
okay and here this is a plug into the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.740 
okay and here this is a plug into the
wall<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.630> oh<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:26.090> know<00:03:26.210> what<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:26.360> think<00:03:26.630> there's

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
wall so oh you know what I think there's

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.800 
wall so oh you know what I think there's
a<00:03:26.870> switch<00:03:27.640> yeah<00:03:28.640> there's<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.970> switch<00:03:29.270> that<00:03:29.300> I<00:03:29.570> oh

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
a switch yeah there's a switch that I oh

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.960 
a switch yeah there's a switch that I oh
that's<00:03:30.290> right<00:03:30.710> okay<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.130> forgot<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.820> do

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
that's right okay I forgot to do

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.610 
that's right okay I forgot to do
something<00:03:32.000> I'll<00:03:32.630> be<00:03:32.840> right<00:03:33.020> back

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
something I'll be right back

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.890 
something I'll be right back
good<00:03:34.550> thing<00:03:34.760> I'm<00:03:34.880> running<00:03:35.210> through<00:03:35.450> all<00:03:35.660> this

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
good thing I'm running through all this

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.940 
good thing I'm running through all this
but<00:03:37.210> in<00:03:38.210> order<00:03:38.570> to<00:03:38.690> get<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.170> work<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.740> got

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
but in order to get it to work you got

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.640 
but in order to get it to work you got
to<00:03:40.070> take<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.490> power<00:03:41.360> cord<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:41.990> usually<00:03:42.440> goes

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
to take the power cord that usually goes

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.380 
to take the power cord that usually goes
into<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.160> power<00:03:43.400> box<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.530> plug<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.680> in<00:03:45.890> to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
into the power box and plug it in to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.830 
into the power box and plug it in to
there<00:03:47.390> there's<00:03:47.990> a<00:03:48.400> plug<00:03:49.400> inside<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.330> place

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
there there's a plug inside the place

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.220 
there there's a plug inside the place
where<00:03:51.110> your<00:03:51.230> eyes<00:03:51.440> store<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.430> wires<00:03:52.990> this<00:03:53.990> is

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
where your eyes store the wires this is

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.840 
where your eyes store the wires this is
an<00:03:54.350> 800<00:03:54.860> watt<00:03:55.040> inverter<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:56.510> just<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:56.959> case

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
an 800 watt inverter like just in case

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.250 
an 800 watt inverter like just in case
so<00:03:58.850> anyways<00:03:59.209> I'll<00:03:59.420> plug<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.690> in<00:03:59.900> there<00:04:00.080> and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
so anyways I'll plug it in there and

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.510 
so anyways I'll plug it in there and
let's<00:04:00.440> see<00:04:00.530> if<00:04:00.709> we<00:04:00.830> get<00:04:00.980> some<00:04:01.220> my<00:04:01.340> air

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
let's see if we get some my air

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.290 
let's see if we get some my air
conditioning

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
conditioning

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.500 
conditioning
okay<00:04:03.020> so<00:04:03.080> sure<00:04:03.470> power<00:04:03.890> is<00:04:04.310> plugged<00:04:04.820> in<00:04:05.060> there

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
okay so sure power is plugged in there

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.930 
okay so sure power is plugged in there
with<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.080> generator<00:04:06.620> running<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.370> let's<00:04:07.760> go

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
with the generator running and let's go

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.900 
with the generator running and let's go
see<00:04:07.970> for<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.390> air<00:04:08.510> conditioner<00:04:09.020> work<00:04:09.230> now

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
see for the air conditioner work now

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.970 
see for the air conditioner work now
okay<00:04:10.910> ah<00:04:11.890> okay<00:04:12.890> there<00:04:13.160> are<00:04:13.340> fan

my fellow full-time our beers on YouTube
run<00:04:32.009> my<00:04:32.160> generator<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:33.000> get<00:04:33.090> some<00:04:33.240> practice

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
run my generator and get some practice

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.279 
run my generator and get some practice
in<00:04:33.810> here

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289
