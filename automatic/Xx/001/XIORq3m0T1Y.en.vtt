00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
notification on my phone and I looked up

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.289 
notification on my phone and I looked up
my<00:01:09.810> IP<00:01:10.380> camera<00:01:10.890> app<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.610> saw<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> was

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
my IP camera app and I saw that it was

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.210 
my IP camera app and I saw that it was
my<00:01:12.570> mother<00:01:12.810> coming<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> house<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.159> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
my mother coming into the house and I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.789 
my mother coming into the house and I
did<00:01:14.400> actually<00:01:14.549> cut<00:01:14.970> her<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:15.840> granted<00:01:16.439> she<00:01:16.650> was

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
did actually cut her now granted she was

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
did actually cut her now granted she was
carrying<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.280> lot<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> cleaning<00:01:17.850> supplies<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
carrying a lot of cleaning supplies and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.570 
carrying a lot of cleaning supplies and
that<00:01:18.750> takes<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.200> little<00:01:19.380> bit<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.619> time<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.430> it's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that takes a little bit of time so it's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.429 
that takes a little bit of time so it's
not<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.180> unusual<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:22.049> I'd<00:01:22.170> catch

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
not really that unusual that I'd catch

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
not really that unusual that I'd catch
her<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.310> doesn't<00:01:23.640> necessarily<00:01:24.299> mean<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
her and it doesn't necessarily mean that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
her and it doesn't necessarily mean that
the<00:01:24.780> alert<00:01:25.049> was<00:01:25.170> instantaneous<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.520> she

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the alert was instantaneous because she

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.310 
the alert was instantaneous because she
could<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.000> been<00:01:27.180> sitting<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.600> jogging<00:01:28.170> in

have taken in a couple of minutes to get
my<00:02:49.630> text<00:02:50.200> but<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.590> would<00:02:50.860> say<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.190> that's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
my text but I would say that that's

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.390 
my text but I would say that that's
pretty<00:02:51.970> instant<00:02:52.600> if<00:02:52.810> you're<00:02:53.410> using<00:02:53.890> these

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
pretty instant if you're using these

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.340 
pretty instant if you're using these
smart<00:02:54.760> things<00:02:54.970> open<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.420> close<00:02:55.720> sensors<00:02:55.990> for

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
smart things open and close sensors for

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.380 
smart things open and close sensors for
home<00:02:56.500> security<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:57.160> really<00:02:57.760> think<00:02:57.970> that's<00:02:58.060> good

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
home security I really think that's good

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.229 
home security I really think that's good
enough<00:02:58.480> now<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.230> can't<00:02:59.830> test<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.430> again<00:03:00.940> in<00:03:01.150> an

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
enough now I can't test it again in an

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.420 
enough now I can't test it again in an
area<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.690> doesn't<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:02.080> 4G<00:03:02.620> Wireless<00:03:03.100> but<00:03:03.400> I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
area that doesn't have 4G Wireless but I

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.420 
area that doesn't have 4G Wireless but I
will<00:03:03.760> leave<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.000> up<00:03:04.060> for<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.570> up<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.739> I

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
will leave it up for you up to you and I

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.580 
will leave it up for you up to you and I
hope<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.030> demonstration<00:03:07.420> out<00:03:08.290> here<00:03:08.500> in

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
hope that this demonstration out here in

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.740 
hope that this demonstration out here in
the<00:03:08.709> cemetery<00:03:08.890> makes<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.970> feel<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.239> little<00:03:10.540> bit

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
the cemetery makes you feel a little bit

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.290 
the cemetery makes you feel a little bit
better<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.320> maybe<00:03:12.130> perhaps<00:03:12.640> even<00:03:12.850> gets<00:03:13.180> you

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300
