that's it moving back a bit
moving<00:02:16.060> forward<00:02:19.230> now<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:20.500> look<00:02:20.590> at<00:02:20.739> the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
moving forward now we can look at the

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.170 
moving forward now we can look at the
secondary<00:02:21.250> functions<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.849> each<00:02:21.939> of<00:02:22.090> these

secondary functions of each of these

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.479 
secondary functions of each of these
buttons<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.840> access<00:02:23.349> these<00:02:23.829> again<00:02:24.219> you<00:02:24.370> hold

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
buttons to access these again you hold

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.910 
buttons to access these again you hold
down<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.760> shift<00:02:25.090> key<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.230> at<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.439> bottom<00:02:26.590> we
