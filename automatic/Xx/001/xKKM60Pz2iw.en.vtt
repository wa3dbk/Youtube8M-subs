00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:06.008
 Wonderfully level and prepare the skin for the foundation, 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.116
 be it mineral or traditional. 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:14.172
 It's great for those who only need a cream 

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:17.247
 and delicate, transpirable powder. 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.709
 It is also ideal for those who need a product 

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:26.598
 to finish and give the final touch to make-up. 

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:41.078
 Powder Primer Glow - because of it - 

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:46.112
 is a really useful and very simple cosmetic to do at home.

00:00:48.975 --> 00:00:55.279
 I will show you how to prepare such a powder from a ready-made kit in a really trivial way. 

00:00:55.793 --> 00:00:59.852
 The set contains a few useful things. 

00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:07.211
 First of all, a simple and clear instruction manual. 

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:13.661
 Two packs. 

00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:18.120
 One to be kept without problems in the home of our powder. 

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:22.974
 The second smaller, if you need to take it with you. 

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:24.180
 For example, in a purse. 

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.968
 We will also find two string bags, 

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:34.697
 which will make it easier for us to mix and prepare our cosmetics. 

00:01:35.052 --> 00:01:40.642
 And a small bag in which there are four ingredients of our powder. 

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:42.751
 You will find mica here. 

00:01:44.018 --> 00:01:46.654
 You will find here magnesium stearate. 

00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:49.735
 You will find silica here. 

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:57.584
 And you will find an extender here. So, among other things, titanium dioxide, 

00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:00.972
 which works great in this product. 

00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:04.662
 The exact composition you will find, now on the screen 

00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.789
 and I invite you to work! 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.985
 According to the instruction manual, all ingredients 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.189
 we should pour and mix in a string bag. 

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:32.416
 But I will give you a little simpler solution. 

00:02:32.973 --> 00:02:35.938
 All ingredients, as in the instructions, 

00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:38.713
 I just pour it into the jar. 

00:03:34.323 --> 00:03:37.805
 I twist the jar and shaker ... 

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:43.953
 ... I mix. 

00:03:44.521 --> 00:03:48.915
 After about 30 seconds of intense mixing 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.252
 our product is ready. 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.821
 Just pour it into the enclosed package. 

00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:58.570
 It's enough, 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.355
 that you will surely still have some more in the jar, 

00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:04.883
 in which you mixed. 

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:07.751
 If you do not have anything to store in it, 

00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:11.964
 you can store it in a zip bag attached by the manufacturer. 

00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:15.528
 I think that this amount will be enough here. 

00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:20.417
 We put on a sieve 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.323
 and our powder is ready! 

00:04:27.178 --> 00:04:32.199
 As you have already seen, the preparation of our primer is really simple. 

00:04:32.636 --> 00:04:34.700
 For the usefulness date of this cosmetic 

00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:36.699
 you also do not have to worry too much. 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.638
 Because it does not contain any substances, 

00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:44.449
 on which mushrooms or bacteria will breed. 

00:04:44.857 --> 00:04:46.341
 Be other microorganisms. 

00:04:46.517 --> 00:04:49.346
 So you calmly use it. 

00:04:49.517 --> 00:04:53.845
 Mine is valid until June 2016. 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.801
 And if you do not look at it, we have only the beginning of 2014. 

00:04:59.283 --> 00:05:01.605
