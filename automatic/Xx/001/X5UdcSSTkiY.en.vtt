and<00:01:58.369> again<00:01:59.369> i<00:01:59.670> really<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.240> things<00:02:00.509> are

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and again i really think things are

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.610 
that could become tropical storm Hannah
this<00:03:30.599> is<00:03:30.660> out<00:03:30.900> there<00:03:31.139> around<00:03:31.549> 53<00:03:32.549> west<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.620> 20

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
this is out there around 53 west and 20

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.620 
this is out there around 53 west and 20
North<00:03:34.859> that's<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.280> higher<00:03:35.519> latitude<00:03:36.180> system

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
North that's a higher latitude system

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.440 
North that's a higher latitude system
and<00:03:36.750> accordingly<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.380> modeling<00:03:38.269> takes<00:03:39.269> that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
and accordingly the modeling takes that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.659 
and accordingly the modeling takes that
northwest<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.410> again<00:03:40.950> at<00:03:41.069> that<00:03:41.190> point<00:03:41.519> it's

northwest and again at that point it's

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.280 
northwest and again at that point it's
got<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.970> option<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.419> bending<00:03:42.810> back<00:03:42.989> toward

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
got the option of bending back toward

the weakness that was in the ridge is
really<00:05:08.610> not<00:05:08.820> there<00:05:10.160> we've<00:05:11.160> got<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.460> big

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
really not there we've got that big

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.920 
really not there we've got that big
trough<00:05:11.910> coming<00:05:12.240> into<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.510> North<00:05:12.690> Central

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
trough coming into the North Central

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.540 
trough coming into the North Central
States<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.560> ultimately<00:05:13.920> that<00:05:14.040> should<00:05:14.340> begin

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
States and ultimately that should begin

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.820 
States and ultimately that should begin
to<00:05:14.700> bend<00:05:14.910> Gustav<00:05:15.600> northward<00:05:16.170> didn't<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.680> when

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
to bend Gustav northward didn't and when

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.410 
to bend Gustav northward didn't and when
that<00:05:17.010> happens<00:05:17.040> obviously<00:05:17.550> this<00:05:18.030> early<00:05:18.360> stage

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
that happens obviously this early stage

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.840 
that happens obviously this early stage
of<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.870> game<00:05:18.990> we<00:05:19.200> don't<00:05:19.410> know<00:05:19.590> if<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.460> surface

in the Gulf it doesn't show is developed

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.250 
in the Gulf it doesn't show is developed
here<00:05:31.770> but<00:05:31.950> more<00:05:32.160> than<00:05:32.280> likely<00:05:32.340> it<00:05:32.730> will<00:05:32.880> be<00:05:33.260> now
