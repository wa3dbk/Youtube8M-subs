00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
stick to the window we don't want so you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.960 
stick to the window we don't want so you
can<00:01:56.810> move<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.110> around<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.409> little<00:01:57.440> bit<00:01:57.970> exactly

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
can move it around a little bit exactly

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.700 
can move it around a little bit exactly
it's<00:01:59.119> not<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.570> get<00:01:59.899> my<00:02:00.049> cell<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.470> very

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
it's not going to get my cell is very

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.510 
it's not going to get my cell is very
aggressive<00:02:00.860> even<00:02:01.759> though<00:02:01.820> we're<00:02:03.520> very

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
aggressive even though we're very

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.580 
aggressive even though we're very
aggressive<00:02:06.550> more<00:02:07.550> than<00:02:07.869> most<00:02:08.869> films<00:02:09.229> typical

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
aggressive more than most films typical

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.520 
aggressive more than most films typical
window<00:02:09.920> films<00:02:10.340> okay<00:02:10.900> okay<00:02:11.900> now<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:12.440> I'm

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
window films okay okay now what I'm

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.259 
window films okay okay now what I'm
going<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.709> do<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.370> intentionally<00:02:14.060> cut

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
going to do is this is intentionally cut

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.270 
going to do is this is intentionally cut
slightly<00:02:14.690> small<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.680> I'm<00:02:15.739> going<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.920> split<00:02:16.100> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
slightly small so I'm going to split the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.490 
slightly small so I'm going to split the
gap<00:02:16.459> if<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.760> look<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.300> gap<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:17.900> gap<00:02:18.110> is

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
gap if you look this gap and that gap is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.040 
gap if you look this gap and that gap is
roughly<00:02:19.090> three<00:02:20.090> eighths<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.420> an<00:02:20.540> inch<00:02:20.660> each

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
roughly three eighths of an inch each

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.000 
roughly three eighths of an inch each
side<00:02:21.380> uh-huh<00:02:22.360> we<00:02:23.360> call<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.569> justification

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.770 

then<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.489> window<00:02:28.760> again<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:29.450> needs<00:02:29.630> to

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
then what the window again it needs to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.960 
then what the window again it needs to
be<00:02:29.920> essentially<00:02:30.920> lubricated<00:02:31.580> for<00:02:31.819> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
be essentially lubricated for the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.000 
be essentially lubricated for the
squeegee<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.569> run<00:02:32.840> over<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.200> real<00:02:33.440> easy<00:02:33.590> and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
squeegee to run over it real easy and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.910 
squeegee to run over it real easy and
why<00:02:34.790> do<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.910> run<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.269> squeegee<00:02:35.660> over<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.650> push

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
why do you run the squeegee over to push

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.530 
why do you run the squeegee over to push
the<00:02:37.100> water<00:02:37.280> that's<00:02:37.549> behind<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.299> need<00:02:38.450> to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the water that's behind it we need to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.140 
the water that's behind it we need to
push<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.930> out<00:02:39.430> okay<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:40.700> we're<00:02:40.940> good<00:02:41.030> news

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
push that out okay so we're good news

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.670 
push that out okay so we're good news
we're<00:02:41.299> going<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.480> start<00:02:41.690> here<00:02:41.989> in<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.320> center

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
we're going to start here in the center

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.530 
we're going to start here in the center
remove<00:02:43.190> out

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.780 

t<00:02:47.540> write<00:02:47.780> down<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.200> then<00:02:48.290> oh<00:02:48.590> okay<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.640> put

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
t write down and then oh okay so you put

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.460 
t write down and then oh okay so you put
a<00:02:49.820> tea<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.330> go<00:02:50.450> out<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:51.020> say<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.320> again

a tea so you go out so say that again

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.620 
a tea so you go out so say that again
you<00:02:51.590> went<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:51.980> top<00:02:52.160> out<00:02:52.430> tom<00:02:53.350> uh-huh<00:02:55.630> then

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
you went to the top out tom uh-huh then

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.390 
you went to the top out tom uh-huh then
we<00:02:56.750> went<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.960> all<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.260> down<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.560> center<00:02:57.920> okay

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
we went to all be down the center okay

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.520 
we went to all be down the center okay
like<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.810> now<00:02:59.960> we're<00:03:00.080> going<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.230> work<00:03:00.350> our

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
like so and now we're going to work our

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.520 
like so and now we're going to work our
way<00:03:00.560> down<00:03:01.070> one<00:03:01.640> side<00:03:01.940> we're<00:03:02.870> use<00:03:03.080> overlapping

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
way down one side we're use overlapping

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.650 
way down one side we're use overlapping
strokes<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.610> what<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.270> you<00:03:05.420> using

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
strokes and you what is that you using

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.930 
strokes and you what is that you using
that<00:03:05.690> blue<00:03:05.990> we're<00:03:06.590> using<00:03:06.770> up<00:03:06.950> smooches<00:03:07.220> blue

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
that blue we're using up smooches blue

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.180 
that blue we're using up smooches blue
max<00:03:08.180> it's<00:03:08.420> called<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.720> same<00:03:08.930> handle<00:03:09.380> as<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
max it's called the same handle as the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.980 
max it's called the same handle as the
tea<00:03:10.460> squeeze<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.150> saw<00:03:11.330> before<00:03:11.360> a

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
tea squeeze you that you saw before a

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.520 
tea squeeze you that you saw before a
man's<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.800> polymer<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.760> actually<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:15.410> can

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
man's of polymer so it actually you can

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.370 
man's of polymer so it actually you can
get<00:03:15.650> different<00:03:15.860> densities<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:17.380> these

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
get different densities of these

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.080 
get different densities of these
polymers<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:19.220> is<00:03:19.370> one<00:03:19.550> that<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.760> like<00:03:19.910> for

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
polymers and this is one that I like for

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.670 
polymers and this is one that I like for
window<00:03:20.360> film<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.900> works<00:03:21.080> good<00:03:21.320> for<00:03:21.350> buying

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
window film and it works good for buying

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.590 
window film and it works good for buying
let's<00:03:21.950> go<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:22.850> pick<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.030> up<00:03:23.180> for

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
out on the other side make sure that

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.640 
out on the other side make sure that
that's<00:03:39.590> all<00:03:41.080> we're<00:03:42.080> gonna<00:03:42.140> come<00:03:42.380> down<00:03:42.500> this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
that's all we're gonna come down this

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.420 
that's all we're gonna come down this
side

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.429 

and<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.180> that's<00:03:47.299> all<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:47.599> view<00:03:47.810> you're<00:03:48.230> just

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
and so that's all you view you're just

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.140 
and so that's all you view you're just
squeezing<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.129> get<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.400> liquid<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:50.000> you

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
squeezing it to get the liquid that you

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.929 
squeezing it to get the liquid that you
put<00:03:50.420> on<00:03:50.450> there<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.379> allow<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.739> slip<00:03:52.099> to<00:03:52.579> get

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
put on there to allow it to slip to get

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.660 
put on there to allow it to slip to get

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
then just slowly squeegees out and we'll

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.759 
then just slowly squeegees out and we'll
take<00:03:58.790> pic<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.150> camera<00:03:59.510> up<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.900> hot<00:04:00.230> an<00:04:00.379> angle

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
come around this other side take a cab

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.110 
come around this other side take a cab
look<00:04:04.909> over<00:04:05.120> here<00:04:05.319> now<00:04:06.319> look<00:04:06.590> ahead<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:07.310> you'll

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
look over here now look ahead and you'll

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.920 
look over here now look ahead and you'll
see<00:04:08.420> an<00:04:09.139> actual<00:04:09.500> wave<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:11.060> now<00:04:11.329> look<00:04:11.629> it's

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
see an actual wave and now look it's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.619 
see an actual wave and now look it's
kind<00:04:12.170> of<00:04:12.200> hard<00:04:12.379> to<00:04:12.409> see<00:04:12.650> is<00:04:12.829> the<00:04:13.420> on<00:04:14.420> this

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
kind of hard to see is the on this

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.599 
kind of hard to see is the on this
camera<00:04:14.900> but<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.500> think<00:04:15.799> you<00:04:15.859> get<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.039> idea<00:04:16.130> if

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
camera but I think you get the idea if

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.779 
camera but I think you get the idea if
you<00:04:16.699> do<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.910> yourself<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.509> always<00:04:17.840> of

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
you do it yourself it always of

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.249 
you do it yourself it always of
accumulation<00:04:19.789> of<00:04:20.000> water<00:04:20.269> that's<00:04:20.599> pushing<00:04:21.109> out

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
accumulation of water that's pushing out

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.680 
accumulation of water that's pushing out
the<00:04:21.590> edge<00:04:22.340> every<00:04:22.759> time<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.300> let<00:04:23.389> me<00:04:23.479> show<00:04:23.660> it

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
the edge every time and let me show it

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.210 
the edge every time and let me show it
here<00:04:23.870> so<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.169> water<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.590> actually<00:04:24.770> being

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
here so the water is actually being

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.080 
here so the water is actually being
pushed<00:04:25.550> out<00:04:25.789> of<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.979> side<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.610> then<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.940> just

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
pushed out of the side and then it just

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.270 
pushed out of the side and then it just
drains<00:04:29.419> out<00:04:29.780> now<00:04:30.289> that<00:04:30.380> water<00:04:30.800> then<00:04:31.130> that

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
drains out now that water then that

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.909 
drains out now that water then that
comes<00:04:31.699> out<00:04:31.940> it's<00:04:32.210> just<00:04:32.270> soapy<00:04:32.690> water<00:04:32.900> so<00:04:33.259> water

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
comes out it's just soapy water so water

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.640 
comes out it's just soapy water so water
doesn't<00:04:34.280> prompt<00:04:34.849> in<00:04:35.449> size<00:04:35.870> wipe<00:04:36.139> it<00:04:36.349> up<00:04:36.440> we

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
doesn't prompt in size wipe it up we

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.260 
doesn't prompt in size wipe it up we
would<00:04:36.800> use<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:36.949> little<00:04:37.250> towel<00:04:37.430> just<00:04:37.759> to<00:04:37.849> stop<00:04:38.090> it

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
would use a little towel just to stop it

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.830 
would use a little towel just to stop it
up<00:04:38.389> out<00:04:38.539> here<00:04:38.620> we<00:04:39.620> don't<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:39.949> to<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.840> see

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
up out here we don't have to I see

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.689 
up out here we don't have to I see
Sophie<00:04:42.169> if<00:04:42.259> you<00:04:42.620> do<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.919> film<00:04:43.190> on<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.370> inside

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
Sophie if you do it film on the inside

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.129 
Sophie if you do it film on the inside
then<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:46.190> want<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.630> put<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.660> towel<00:04:47.900> underneath

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
then you want to put a towel underneath

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.950 
then you want to put a towel underneath
because<00:04:48.349> the<00:04:48.560> soapy<00:04:48.830> water<00:04:48.979> will<00:04:49.190> drain<00:04:49.370> down

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
because the soapy water will drain down

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.450 
because the soapy water will drain down
okay<00:04:50.960> now<00:04:51.560> I'm<00:04:51.680> gonna<00:04:51.740> go<00:04:51.949> over<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.159> edges

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
okay now I'm gonna go over the edges

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.159 
okay now I'm gonna go over the edges
with<00:04:52.520> what<00:04:52.880> we<00:04:53.000> call<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.210> hard<00:04:53.479> card<00:04:53.780> which<00:04:54.020> is

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
just a harder piece of plastic it almost

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.899 
just a harder piece of plastic it almost
is<00:04:57.320> like<00:04:57.349> a<00:04:57.500> credit<00:04:57.800> card<00:04:57.979> huh<00:04:58.130> very<00:04:58.729> much

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
the edges let me try to focus better and

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.469 
the edges let me try to focus better and
what<00:05:15.169> does<00:05:15.259> that<00:05:15.380> do<00:05:15.560> that<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:15.919> it<00:05:16.669> sue<00:05:17.060> us

what does that do that that it sue us

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.350 
what does that do that that it sue us
really<00:05:18.050> seals<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.770> edges<00:05:19.190> seals<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.240> edge

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
really seals the edges seals the edge

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.689 
really seals the edges seals the edge
puts<00:05:20.599> more<00:05:20.810> pressure<00:05:21.099> why<00:05:22.099> is<00:05:22.159> it<00:05:22.340> more<00:05:22.550> to

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
puts more pressure why is it more to

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.350 
puts more pressure why is it more to
seal<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.090> edges<00:05:24.039> because<00:05:25.039> the<00:05:25.550> edges<00:05:26.150> are

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
seal the edges because the edges are

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.409 
seal the edges because the edges are

you<00:05:41.840> look<00:05:42.050> back<00:05:42.259> corners<00:05:42.650> down<00:05:42.800> very<00:05:43.130> nice

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
you look back corners down very nice

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.790 
you look back corners down very nice
that's<00:05:45.000> what<00:05:45.150> we're<00:05:45.270> going<00:05:45.360> to<00:05:45.449> do<00:05:45.540> okay<00:05:46.020> we're

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
that's what we're going to do okay we're

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.290 
that's what we're going to do okay we're
going<00:05:46.889> to<00:05:46.980> do<00:05:47.070> this<00:05:47.220> several<00:05:47.460> more<00:05:47.730> times<00:05:47.940> on

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
going to do this several more times on

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.490 
going to do this several more times on
them<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:48.690> there's<00:05:48.840> three<00:05:48.990> more<00:05:49.199> windows

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
them and there's three more windows

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.360 
them and there's three more windows
we're<00:05:49.620> going<00:05:49.740> to<00:05:49.800> do<00:05:49.860> we're<00:05:49.980> going<00:05:50.100> to<00:05:50.160> do<00:05:50.280> in

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
we're going to do we're going to do in

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.310 
we're going to do we're going to do in
the<00:05:50.490> exact<00:05:50.790> same<00:05:51.060> way<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.540> you<00:05:51.900> take<00:05:52.139> that

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
the exact same way and you take that

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.260 
the exact same way and you take that
what<00:05:52.949> you<00:05:53.040> call<00:05:53.160> again<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.460> cars<00:05:53.699> on<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.030> hard

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
what you call again the cars on the hard

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.210 
what you call again the cars on the hard
part<00:05:54.630> a<00:05:54.810> hard<00:05:55.080> card<00:05:55.410> it's<00:05:55.710> harder<00:05:56.040> plastic

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
part a hard card it's harder plastic

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.990 
part a hard card it's harder plastic
puts<00:05:57.150> more<00:05:57.360> pressure<00:05:57.660> for<00:05:58.340> per<00:05:59.340> unit<00:05:59.639> area<00:05:59.790> per

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
puts more pressure for per unit area per

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.379 
puts more pressure for per unit area per
square<00:06:00.780> inch<00:06:00.810> on<00:06:01.290> that<00:06:02.010> edge<00:06:02.190> really<00:06:03.000> pushes

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
square inch on that edge really pushes

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.439 
square inch on that edge really pushes
it<00:06:03.540> down<00:06:03.720> okay<00:06:04.680> okay<00:06:04.919> and<00:06:05.310> so<00:06:06.060> you<00:06:06.120> just<00:06:06.330> have

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
it down okay okay and so you just have

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.760 
it down okay okay and so you just have
to<00:06:06.540> go<00:06:06.630> over<00:06:06.660> once<00:06:07.020> with<00:06:07.199> the<00:06:07.229> hard<00:06:07.440> carton

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
to go over once with the hard carton

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.770 
to go over once with the hard carton
yeah<00:06:08.220> gimme<00:06:08.669> once<00:06:08.880> or<00:06:09.060> twice<00:06:09.210> we've<00:06:09.630> got<00:06:09.750> a

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
yeah gimme once or twice we've got a

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.900 
yeah gimme once or twice we've got a
good<00:06:09.900> twice<00:06:10.229> it's<00:06:10.500> a<00:06:10.590> double<00:06:10.860> chatter<00:06:11.400> okay

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
good twice it's a double chatter okay

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.090 
good twice it's a double chatter okay
especially<00:06:12.870> if<00:06:13.199> you're<00:06:13.290> having<00:06:13.590> an<00:06:13.680> area<00:06:14.040> that

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
especially if you're having an area that

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.159 
especially if you're having an area that
doesn't<00:06:14.310> want<00:06:14.790> to<00:06:14.910> go<00:06:15.030> down<00:06:15.210> sometimes<00:06:16.050> it

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
doesn't want to go down sometimes it

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.990 
doesn't want to go down sometimes it
needs<00:06:16.260> to<00:06:16.380> dry<00:06:16.560> out<00:06:16.889> a<00:06:16.919> little<00:06:17.070> more<00:06:17.460> before

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
needs to dry out a little more before

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.270 
needs to dry out a little more before
it'll<00:06:18.389> really<00:06:18.510> set<00:06:18.870> down<00:06:19.110> I<00:06:19.380> see<00:06:19.830> so<00:06:20.040> if<00:06:20.130> I'm

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
it'll really set down I see so if I'm

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.650 
it'll really set down I see so if I'm
worried<00:06:20.610> about<00:06:20.760> what<00:06:21.000> I'll<00:06:21.090> do<00:06:21.240> is<00:06:21.330> I'll<00:06:21.419> go
