00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.010 
had to divest some of their resources
and<00:02:04.110> works<00:02:04.259> by<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.590> Hitachi<00:02:05.390> hard<00:02:06.390> drive<00:02:06.659> line

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and works by the Hitachi hard drive line

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.279 
and works by the Hitachi hard drive line
and<00:02:08.599> essentially<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.720> she<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.020> already

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and essentially to she was already

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.559 
and essentially to she was already
making<00:02:10.560> laptop<00:02:11.310> hard<00:02:11.550> drives<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.000> 2.5

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
making laptop hard drives it's a 2.5

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.400 
making laptop hard drives it's a 2.5
inch<00:02:12.599> drive

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
inch drive

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.550

so<00:02:14.010> W<00:02:14.850> Western<00:02:15.570> Digital<00:02:15.720> ended<00:02:16.110> up<00:02:16.200> trading

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so W Western Digital ended up trading

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.830 
so W Western Digital ended up trading
some<00:02:17.280> patents<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.820> technologies<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:18.630> need

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
some patents and technologies they need

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.560 
some patents and technologies they need
to<00:02:19.020> Toshiba<00:02:19.410> for<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.220> Sheba's<00:02:20.490> flooded<00:02:20.940> 2.5

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
inch hard drive factory in Thailand so

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.840 
inch hard drive factory in Thailand so
you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.630> see<00:02:24.780> Toshiba<00:02:25.460> gotten<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.550> market

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
you can see Toshiba gotten the market

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850 
you can see Toshiba gotten the market
really<00:02:27.030> quick<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.570> not<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> brand<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.710> would

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
really quick it's not a brand you would

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.250 
really quick it's not a brand you would
have<00:02:29.010> really<00:02:29.790> expected<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.360> see<00:02:30.450> having

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260

internal hard drives and that's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.010

essentially<00:02:34.410> how<00:02:34.680> they<00:02:35.040> now<00:02:36.020> manufacture

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
essentially how they now manufacture

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.310 
essentially how they now manufacture

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
got a really good deal I mean that they

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.390 
got a really good deal I mean that they
treated<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.819> flooded<00:03:27.180> out<00:03:27.269> factory<00:03:27.810> for

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.789 
and it's probably a good deal for them
I<00:03:38.819> think<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.750> got<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.019> for<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.230> good<00:03:40.260> price<00:03:40.410> as

this<00:03:45.870> drive<00:03:46.140> open<00:03:46.640> okay<00:03:47.640> first<00:03:47.940> thing<00:03:48.120> I've

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
this drive open okay first thing I've

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.089 
this drive open okay first thing I've
noticed<00:03:48.390> when<00:03:48.720> opening<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.290> you'll<00:03:50.010> see

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
noticed when opening it up you'll see

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.380 
noticed when opening it up you'll see
there<00:03:50.609> is<00:03:50.640> foam<00:03:51.629> here<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.290> lot<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.069> foam<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.640> think

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
there is foam here a lot of foam I think

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.280 
there is foam here a lot of foam I think
that's<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.690> good<00:03:54.840> sign<00:03:55.109> let's<00:03:55.799> move<00:03:56.489> on

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
that's a good sign let's move on

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.420 
that's a good sign let's move on
essentially<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.560> hard<00:03:58.739> drive<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.190> foam

you'd<00:04:03.359> call<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:03.629> foam<00:04:03.930> padding<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:05.280> okay

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
you'd call it foam padding but okay

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.050 
you'd call it foam padding but okay

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
we can actually find how to enter let's

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.599 
we can actually find how to enter let's
say<00:04:15.269> we<00:04:15.629> have<00:04:15.900> ourselves<00:04:16.169> some<00:04:16.620> warranty<00:04:17.280> form

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
say we have ourselves some warranty form

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.270 
say we have ourselves some warranty form
now<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.329> we're<00:04:18.479> inside<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.950> do<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:19.979> little

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
now that we're inside I do a little

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.560 
now that we're inside I do a little
cover<00:04:20.519> up<00:04:20.700> there<00:04:20.849> so<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.120> can<00:04:21.209> see<00:04:21.389> all<00:04:21.479> the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
cover up there so you can see all the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.480 
cover up there so you can see all the
serial<00:04:21.900> numbers<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.440> can<00:04:23.070> see<00:04:23.280> that

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
serial numbers I can see that

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.110

point out it is fully sealed so you have

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.390 
point out it is fully sealed so you have
to<00:04:44.910> actually<00:04:45.210> cut<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.510> open<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.620> expose<00:04:47.190> the

so<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.099> can<00:04:53.250> see<00:04:53.400> here<00:04:53.610> is<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:54.380> lower<00:04:55.380> end<00:04:55.680> of

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
so you can see here is the lower end of

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.760 
so you can see here is the lower end of
the<00:04:55.889> drive<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.430> three<00:04:57.330> terabyte<00:04:57.720> capacity<00:04:58.289> made

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
the drive a three terabyte capacity made

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.390 
the drive a three terabyte capacity made
in<00:04:58.919> China<00:04:59.190> Toshiba<00:04:59.760> Corporation<00:05:01.370> now<00:05:02.370> I

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
in China Toshiba Corporation now I

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.610 
in China Toshiba Corporation now I
believe<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.360> will<00:05:03.510> be<00:05:03.539> time<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:04.139> get<00:05:04.440> this

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
believe it will be time to get this

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.300 
believe it will be time to get this
drive<00:05:05.010> installed<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:06.500> let's<00:05:07.500> see<00:05:07.889> what

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
drive installed and let's see what

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.420 
drive installed and let's see what
happens<00:05:08.699> I'm<00:05:09.180> hoping<00:05:09.449> for<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.660> best<00:05:10.310> as<00:05:11.310> you

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
happens I'm hoping for the best as you

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.920 
happens I'm hoping for the best as you
can<00:05:11.520> see<00:05:11.729> we<00:05:12.000> do<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.270> little<00:05:12.479> bit<00:05:12.599> of<00:05:12.630> tight

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
can see we do a little bit of tight

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.360 
can see we do a little bit of tight
formation<00:05:13.440> with<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.590> hard<00:05:13.830> drives<00:05:14.099> that's

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
formation with the hard drives that's

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.330 
formation with the hard drives that's
why<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.580> fan<00:05:14.880> is<00:05:15.090> there<00:05:15.270> always<00:05:15.720> on<00:05:16.340> this

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
why the fan is there always on this

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.339 
why the fan is there always on this
drive<00:05:17.639> will<00:05:17.760> be<00:05:17.849> the<00:05:17.970> middle<00:05:18.150> drive<00:05:18.479> and

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
drive will be the middle drive and

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.529 
drive will be the middle drive and
let's<00:05:20.740> uh<00:05:21.629> see<00:05:22.629> what<00:05:22.750> happens<00:05:23.970> as<00:05:24.970> you<00:05:25.030> can<00:05:25.389> see

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
let's uh see what happens as you can see

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.360 
let's uh see what happens as you can see
we<00:05:25.720> will<00:05:25.810> have<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.050> switched<00:05:26.289> over<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.650> GPT

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
we will have to switched over to GPT

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.719 
we will have to switched over to GPT
because<00:05:28.360> this<00:05:28.539> is<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.780> larger<00:05:29.319> Drive<00:05:29.680> so<00:05:30.520> we

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
because this is a larger Drive so we

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.550 
because this is a larger Drive so we
will<00:05:30.879> do<00:05:31.060> that<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.599> continue<00:05:32.020> with<00:05:32.530> the

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
will do that and continue with the

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.820 
will do that and continue with the
format<00:05:33.150> so<00:05:34.150> now<00:05:34.270> that<00:05:34.330> we<00:05:34.629> finished<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:35.199> long

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
format so now that we finished a long

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.670 
format so now that we finished a long
generic<00:05:36.370> test<00:05:36.639> with<00:05:36.879> a<00:05:36.909> pass<00:05:37.240> this<00:05:37.930> is<00:05:38.110> using<00:05:38.440> C

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
generic test with a pass this is using C

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.839 
generic test with a pass this is using C
tools<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:40.270> guess<00:05:41.259> it's<00:05:41.440> time<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.789> you<00:05:42.789> know

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
tools I guess it's time to you know

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.990 
tools I guess it's time to you know
transfer<00:05:43.210> some<00:05:43.419> data<00:05:43.599> see<00:05:43.840> how<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.139> does<00:05:44.879> so<00:05:45.879> my

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
transfer some data see how it does so my

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.210 
transfer some data see how it does so my
final<00:05:46.180> thoughts<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:47.259> size<00:05:47.740> of<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:47.979> drive

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
final thoughts the size of the drive

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.159 
final thoughts the size of the drive
after<00:05:48.699> formatting<00:05:49.030> end<00:05:49.300> up<00:05:49.419> being<00:05:49.629> two<00:05:49.870> point

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
after formatting end up being two point

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.320 
after formatting end up being two point
seven<00:05:50.470> two<00:05:50.590> terabytes<00:05:51.099> and<00:05:51.370> has<00:05:51.849> functioned

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.240 
seven two terabytes and has functioned
well<00:05:52.449> so<00:05:52.719> far<00:05:52.900> I've<00:05:53.050> transferred<00:05:53.500> well<00:05:53.919> over<00:05:54.219> a
