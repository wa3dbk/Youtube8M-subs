a great grasp of what they're doing

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.579 
a great grasp of what they're doing
offensively<00:01:02.609> he<00:01:02.940> showed<00:01:03.149> his<00:01:03.270> mobility<00:01:03.589> which

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
offensively he showed his mobility which

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
offensively he showed his mobility which
is<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.580> his<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.030> best

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is really is one of his you know best

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.370 
is really is one of his you know best
strengths<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.869> terms<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.140> being<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
strengths in terms of being a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.600 
strengths in terms of being a
quarterback<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.890> ability<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> move<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> get

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
quarterback the ability to move and get

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
quarterback the ability to move and get
out<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> pocket<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.630> he<00:01:09.689> made<00:01:09.869> plays<00:01:10.020> down

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
out of the pocket and he made plays down

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
out of the pocket and he made plays down
the<00:01:10.409> field<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.130> good<00:01:11.400> day<00:01:11.700> from

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the field so it's really a good day from

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.370 
the field so it's really a good day from
a<00:01:12.240> quarterback<00:01:12.540> standpoint<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.260> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
a quarterback standpoint from all of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.960 
a quarterback standpoint from all of
them<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> running<00:01:14.430> backs<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:14.790> well

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
them and then the running backs as well

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520 
them and then the running backs as well
I<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.119> thought<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.960> say<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> offense

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.630 
yet when he gets a little bit stronger
he's<00:02:04.590> gonna<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.829> tough<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.040> deal<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
