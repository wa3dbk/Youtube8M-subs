00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.160
 the Portuguese since the 19th century and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.869
 register in dictionaries and grammars 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.590

 the standard language rules and also 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.830
 to digest all briefly the following 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.350
 hello my name is joel melo the jolley value 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.470

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.550
 president's story 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.800
 according to the teacher miriam rita 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.719
 mondongo university mother is rumored the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.489
 mini now do not know the university 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.140
 federal paraná 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.860
 in Portuguese there are the participles 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.050
 assets as low 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.160
 example the active participle of the verb 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.009

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.570
 to sing is a singer where there is 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.789

 the active participle of the verb ser é ente 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.920
 so when we want to appoint someone 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 to exercise the action that expresses a 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.819
 verb to disappoint in the esmal suffix 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.899
 santi in having or inter 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:33.110
 therefore the person who presides is 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:37.490
 president and not president 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.490
 regardless of the fetus 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.430
 the credit of having many thanks 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.940
 teacher 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.280
 from now on, so to speak 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.570
 President instead of President becomes 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.570
 to be ignorant 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.150
 according to the laws if you charge 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 marina baird ferreira and cassia renata 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.920
 menezes da silva 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.990
 substitution of the thematic vowel and 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.960
 formation of the feminine in 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.880
 Portuguese is the present from the 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.270
 beginnings of the Portuguese language in 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:20.300
 13th century in words like infanta chief 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.830
 40 giant elephant and housekeeper 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.820
 spelling dictionary and dictionaries 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.280
 the two forms of president 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.540
 therefore both forms 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.950
 correct if the two forms are 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.680
 grammatically correct 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.980
 So why so much discussion for one? 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.650
 This is a simple recognition since the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.300
 woman fought so hard and came to power 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.780
 why hide it so by saying 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.690
 president 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.570
 would be a display of power would leave 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.000
 clear transparent power of not being able 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.250
 Women are very strange but they are 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.190
 things of our language is from her and 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.860
 that the other that comes there will be all 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.010
 very normal 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.450
 Maria, I hope you have others, you answered. 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.450
