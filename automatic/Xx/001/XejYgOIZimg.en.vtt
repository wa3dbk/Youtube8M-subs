00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.969 
says torque tube side so this is the way
you<00:01:43.430> want<00:01:43.609> your<00:01:43.850> gasket<00:01:44.240> set<00:01:44.479> up<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:45.649> can<00:01:45.770> see

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
you want your gasket set up you can see

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.520 
you want your gasket set up you can see
that<00:01:46.030> there's<00:01:47.030> big<00:01:47.240> variances<00:01:47.780> here<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.289> as

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
that there's big variances here so as

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.980 
that there's big variances here so as
the<00:01:49.070> reason<00:01:49.369> why<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:49.909> wet<00:01:50.420> sanded<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:50.929> down

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
the reason why I wet sanded it down

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.990 
the reason why I wet sanded it down
because<00:01:51.380> you're<00:01:51.469> gonna<00:01:51.619> get<00:01:51.740> carbon<00:01:52.219> buildup

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
because you're gonna get carbon buildup

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.910 
because you're gonna get carbon buildup
a<00:01:53.329> around<00:01:53.420> here<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.960> pop<00:01:54.380> nook<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.710> seal

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
a around here and pop nook I seal

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.120 
a around here and pop nook I seal
that<00:01:55.100> well<00:01:55.310> but<00:01:55.630> enough<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.929> BS<00:01:57.259> let's<00:01:57.950> get

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
that well but enough of the BS let's get

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.969 
that well but enough of the BS let's get
the<00:01:58.219> headers<00:01:58.490> put<00:01:58.700> on<00:01:59.380> here's<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.469> shot<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:00.799> the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
the headers put on here's a shot of the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.550 
the headers put on here's a shot of the
headers<00:02:01.280> on<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.670> engine<00:02:02.030> intake<00:02:02.899> not<00:02:03.109> on<00:02:03.350> I

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
headers on the engine intake not on I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.380 
headers on the engine intake not on I
just<00:02:04.249> want<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.520> show<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:04.909> piece<00:02:05.119> here

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
just want to show you this piece here

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.690 
just want to show you this piece here
looks<00:02:05.719> nice<00:02:06.070> looks<00:02:07.070> real<00:02:07.369> good<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:10.369> second

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
looks nice looks real good the second

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.160 
looks nice looks real good the second
thing<00:02:10.820> I'm<00:02:10.940> doing<00:02:11.210> now<00:02:11.240> that<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.750> got<00:02:12.050> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
thing I'm doing now that I got the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.380 
thing I'm doing now that I got the
headers<00:02:12.409> I<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.739> gently<00:02:13.310> tighten<00:02:14.209> these

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
headers I just gently tighten these

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.830 
headers I just gently tighten these
bolts<00:02:14.569> up<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.900> little<00:02:15.080> bit<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.920> generally

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
bolts up a little bit just generally

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.509 
bolts up a little bit just generally
the<00:02:17.840> reason<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.250> don't

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
the reason for that is is that you don't

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:20.800 
the reason for that is is that you don't
want<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> torque<00:02:20.000> them<00:02:20.120> down<00:02:20.180> right<00:02:20.510> off<00:02:20.659> the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
want to torque them down right off the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.330 
want to torque them down right off the
back<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.290> case<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.620> got<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.860> adjust<00:02:22.069> it

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
back of the case you got to adjust it

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.979 
back of the case you got to adjust it
and<00:02:22.519> they<00:02:22.670> fail<00:02:22.970> because<00:02:23.000> once<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.540> put<00:02:23.810> an

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
and they fail because once you put an

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.259 
and they fail because once you put an
imprint<00:02:24.680> in<00:02:24.829> that<00:02:24.980> gasket<00:02:25.220> you're<00:02:25.939> going<00:02:26.209> to

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
imprint in that gasket you're going to

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.819 
imprint in that gasket you're going to
create<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.540> point<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.079> exhaust<00:02:27.409> and

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
create a point for the exhaust and

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.740 
create a point for the exhaust and
everything<00:02:28.129> else<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.430> leak<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:29.599> want

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
everything else to leak so you just want

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.539 
everything else to leak so you just want
to<00:02:29.780> just<00:02:29.959> lightly<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:30.799> kind<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.099> snug<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.430> up

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
to just lightly just kind of snug it up

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.759 
to just lightly just kind of snug it up
that<00:02:32.000> way<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.390> opted<00:02:32.720> remove<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.200> or<00:02:33.500> do

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
that way if you opted remove it or do

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.410 
that way if you opted remove it or do
whatever<00:02:33.920> else<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.459> can<00:02:34.489> without<00:02:34.940> damaging

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
whatever else you can without damaging

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.089 
whatever else you can without damaging
it

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
sure you here's the intake side you can

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.449 
sure you here's the intake side you can
see<00:02:39.170> it's<00:02:39.440> all<00:02:39.560> dirty<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.040> I'm<00:02:40.099> going<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.310> wet

the actual o2 sensor part itself it may
damage<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.529> so<00:04:35.529> I'm<00:04:35.979> going<00:04:36.129> to<00:04:36.219> put<00:04:36.370> these<00:04:36.490> in
