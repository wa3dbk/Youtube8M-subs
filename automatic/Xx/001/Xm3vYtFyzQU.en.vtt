00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.899
 Episode 2 

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:06.430
 On the third day weddings were held in canada and galilea and the 

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:08.119
 Mother of jesus 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.119
 and they were also invited to the wedding Jesus and his disciples 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.529
 and missing the wine the mother of jesus told him 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.070
 they have no money 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.380
 Jesus told him 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.239
 what do you have with me woman 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.689
 still no viper has come 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.479
 your mother said to those who served do everything I told you 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.339
 and there were six stone jars for water there 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.280
 according to the rite of purification of the Jews 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.840
 in each of which there were two or three pitchers 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.880
 Jesus told them full of these jars of water 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.950
 and they filled them up 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.170
 Then he said take them out now and take them to the magister 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.970
 and they took him 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.900
 when the steward tried the water made wine without knowing where it was from 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.050
 although the servants who had taken it out of the water knew it 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.010
 He called the husband and said 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.660
 Every man serves good wine first and when they have drunk a lot then the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.500
 inside 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.820
 more all reserved the good wine so far 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.360
 this sign principle made Jesus in canÃ¡ de galilea and manifested his 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.010
 glory 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.960
 and his disciples believed in him 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.420
 after this they descended to capernaum his mother his brothers and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.610
 his disciples and they were there not many days 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 It was near the Passover of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and it 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.820
 the temple to those who sold oxen, sheep and pigeons and the money changers there 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.180
 seated 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.830
 and making a whip of cords he cast out of the temple all and the sheep and 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.090
 the oxen and scattered the money changers and overturned the tables 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.730
 and said those who sold pigeons 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.490
 they remove from here I am not do from the house of my father 'market house 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.760
 then his disciples remembered that this writing 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.800
 the zeal of your house consumes me 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.120
 and the Jews responded and told him what to sign the signs for as he does 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.940
 this 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.950
 Jesus answered and told them to destroy this temple and in three days do not lift 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.839
 the 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.699
 said the Jews later 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.489
 in 46 years this temple was built and you raised it in three days 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.899
 but he talked about the temple of his body 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:23.659
 therefore when he rose from the dead his disciples remembered that 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:24.789
 had said this 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.889
 and they believed scripture and the word that Jesus had said 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:33.319
 being in Jerusalem at the Easter party many believed in his name 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.539
 seeing the signs that he was doing 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.070
 but Jesus himself did not trust them 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.160
 because he knew everyone and had no need for anyone to give him 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.200
 testimony of the man because he knew what was in him
