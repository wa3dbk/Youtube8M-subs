hi<00:00:10.400> my<00:00:10.730> name<00:00:10.910> is<00:00:10.940> Anna<00:00:11.180> Yves<00:00:11.450> and<00:00:11.660> we're<00:00:11.990> here

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
hi my name is Anna Yves and we're here

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.470 
hi my name is Anna Yves and we're here
at<00:00:12.380> bounce<00:00:12.710> bag<00:00:13.040> we<00:00:13.610> will<00:00:13.790> be<00:00:13.910> learning<00:00:14.090> how<00:00:14.450> a

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
at bounce bag we will be learning how a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.540 
at bounce bag we will be learning how a
basketball<00:00:15.110> bounces<00:00:15.680> what<00:00:16.130> we<00:00:16.279> have<00:00:16.430> right

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
basketball bounces what we have right

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.179 
basketball bounces what we have right
here<00:00:16.730> is<00:00:16.940> exactly<00:00:17.750> that<00:00:17.930> a<00:00:18.170> basketball<00:00:18.740> and

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
here is exactly that a basketball and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.130 
here is exactly that a basketball and
what's<00:00:19.400> going<00:00:19.670> on<00:00:19.790> is<00:00:19.970> that<00:00:20.180> right<00:00:20.570> here<00:00:20.840> right

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
what's going on is that right here right

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.900 
what's going on is that right here right
now<00:00:21.290> when<00:00:21.470> I'm<00:00:21.590> holding<00:00:21.800> it<00:00:22.099> that's<00:00:22.340> potential

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
now when I'm holding it that's potential

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.390 
now when I'm holding it that's potential
energy<00:00:23.330> which<00:00:23.480> means<00:00:23.750> stored<00:00:24.170> energy<00:00:24.529> when<00:00:25.369> I

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
energy which means stored energy when I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.640 
energy which means stored energy when I
bounce<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:26.060> ball<00:00:26.239> and<00:00:26.660> move<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.200> that's

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
bounce the ball and move it that's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.560 
bounce the ball and move it that's
kinetic<00:00:28.160> energy<00:00:28.700> we're<00:00:29.029> going<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.239> learn<00:00:29.360> on

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
kinetic energy we're going to learn on

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.300 
kinetic energy we're going to learn on
how<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.779> energy<00:00:30.320> transfers<00:00:30.829> to<00:00:31.040> make<00:00:31.189> the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
how the energy transfers to make the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.490 
how the energy transfers to make the
basketball<00:00:31.730> bounce<00:00:31.970> so<00:00:32.480> my<00:00:32.720> energy<00:00:33.230> is<00:00:33.290> gonna

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
basketball bounce so my energy is gonna

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.319 
basketball bounce so my energy is gonna
be<00:00:33.649> transferred<00:00:34.100> on<00:00:34.250> to<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.489> ball<00:00:34.640> from<00:00:35.180> the

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
be transferred on to the ball from the

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.240 
be transferred on to the ball from the
ball<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:35.930> floor<00:00:36.200> and<00:00:36.530> then<00:00:36.950> from<00:00:37.160> the

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
ball to the floor and then from the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.860 
ball to the floor and then from the
floor<00:00:37.520> up<00:00:37.640> back<00:00:37.880> onto<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.329> ball<00:00:38.480> so<00:00:38.720> what's

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
floor up back onto the ball so what's

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.360 
floor up back onto the ball so what's
happening<00:00:39.290> when<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:39.500> ball<00:00:39.710> hits<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.070> floor

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
happening when the ball hits the floor

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.299 
happening when the ball hits the floor
is<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.510> ball's<00:00:41.750> energy<00:00:42.559> is<00:00:43.100> being

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
is that the ball's energy is being

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.729 
is that the ball's energy is being
transferred<00:00:43.699> onto<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.449> floor<00:00:44.719> that<00:00:45.379> same

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
transferred onto the floor that same

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.860 
transferred onto the floor that same
energy<00:00:46.039> is<00:00:46.399> being<00:00:46.609> reflected<00:00:46.879> back<00:00:47.359> onto<00:00:47.660> the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
energy is being reflected back onto the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.470 
energy is being reflected back onto the
ball<00:00:48.050> which<00:00:48.320> pushes<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:49.460> then<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.269> ball

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
ball which pushes it and then the ball

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.060 
ball which pushes it and then the ball
wants<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.839> return<00:00:51.140> back<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.440> its<00:00:51.679> normal<00:00:51.859> shape

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
wants to return back to its normal shape

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.790 
wants to return back to its normal shape
that<00:00:52.489> Springs<00:00:52.879> right<00:00:53.179> back<00:00:53.449> up<00:00:53.750> Hey<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:54.710> the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
that Springs right back up Hey so the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.680 
that Springs right back up Hey so the
same<00:00:54.980> thing<00:00:55.129> ever<00:00:55.309> did<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.579> soccer<00:00:55.820> ball<00:00:56.120> my

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
same thing ever did the soccer ball my

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.619 
same thing ever did the soccer ball my
foot<00:00:57.019> is<00:00:57.199> gonna<00:00:57.350> kick<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.769> ball<00:00:57.980> its<00:00:58.969> energy

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
foot is gonna kick the ball its energy

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.250 
foot is gonna kick the ball its energy
going<00:00:59.929> into<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:00.620> ball<00:01:00.829> causing<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.789> squish

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
going into the ball causing it to squish

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.290 
going into the ball causing it to squish
then<00:01:03.260> springing<00:01:03.800> back<00:01:03.829> out<00:01:04.190> and<00:01:04.460> propelling

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
then springing back out and propelling

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.110 
then springing back out and propelling
into<00:01:05.510> motion<00:01:06.310> same<00:01:07.310> thing<00:01:07.550> happens<00:01:07.940> with<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
into motion same thing happens with the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.149 
into motion same thing happens with the
volley<00:01:08.390> ball<00:01:08.600> whenever<00:01:09.230> I<00:01:09.409> hit<00:01:09.620> my<00:01:09.860> arms

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
volley ball whenever I hit my arms

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.250 
volley ball whenever I hit my arms
against<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.640> volleyball<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:11.659> was<00:01:11.900> squished

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
against the volleyball it was squished

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.249 
against the volleyball it was squished
then<00:01:12.950> pop<00:01:13.370> back<00:01:13.610> into<00:01:13.820> shape<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:14.299> hopefully

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
then pop back into shape and hopefully

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.520 
then pop back into shape and hopefully
sending<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.740> ball<00:01:15.890> up<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.430> over<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.119> net<00:01:17.530> now

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
sending the ball up and over the net now

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.800 
sending the ball up and over the net now
let's<00:01:18.799> learn<00:01:19.040> how<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> ball<00:01:19.909> bounces<00:01:20.299> on<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.479> soft

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
let's learn how a ball bounces on a soft

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.080 
let's learn how a ball bounces on a soft
surface<00:01:21.020> now<00:01:21.860> when<00:01:22.009> I<00:01:22.040> throw<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.310> ball<00:01:22.549> will

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
surface now when I throw the ball will

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.950 
surface now when I throw the ball will
it<00:01:23.210> bounce<00:01:23.299> back<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.810> me<00:01:23.899> let's<00:01:24.200> see

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
it bounce back to me let's see

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.750 
it bounce back to me let's see
it<00:01:26.140> doesn't<00:01:26.440> really<00:01:26.530> bounce<00:01:26.770> back<00:01:27.100> right<00:01:27.310> let

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
it doesn't really bounce back right let

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.370 
it doesn't really bounce back right let
me<00:01:27.790> so<00:01:28.240> what's<00:01:28.420> happening<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:28.990> some<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.260> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
me so what's happening in some of the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.050 
me so what's happening in some of the
ball<00:01:29.560> hits<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.920> soft<00:01:30.190> surface<00:01:30.460> is<00:01:30.880> that

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
ball hits the soft surface is that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.760 
ball hits the soft surface is that
instead<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.930> energy<00:01:32.409> being<00:01:32.650> reflected

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
instead of the energy being reflected

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.190 
instead of the energy being reflected
back<00:01:33.340> onto<00:01:33.549> the<00:01:33.760> ball<00:01:33.970> most<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.080> is

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
back onto the ball most of it is

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.950 
back onto the ball most of it is
absorbed<00:01:35.770> by<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.100> soft<00:01:36.460> surface<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.270> instead

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
absorbed by the soft surface so instead

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.810 
absorbed by the soft surface so instead
of<00:01:38.020> swishing<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.590> ball<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:39.159> compressing<00:01:39.700> it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
of swishing the ball and compressing it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.390 
of swishing the ball and compressing it
it<00:01:40.390> squishes<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:41.049> floor<00:01:41.320> causing<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:42.009> not<00:01:42.040> to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
it squishes the floor causing it not to

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.910 
it squishes the floor causing it not to
foul<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.580> our<00:01:43.060> amenities<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.380> thanks<00:01:44.830> for
