years<00:00:31.950> I<00:00:32.160> had<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> opportunity<00:00:33.270> shortly

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
years I had the opportunity shortly

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.220 
years I had the opportunity shortly
after<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:35.180> experiment<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.540> sort<00:00:36.810> of<00:00:36.900> was

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
after that to experiment it sort of was

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.170 
after that to experiment it sort of was
one<00:00:37.650> of<00:00:37.740> those<00:00:37.800> life-changing<00:00:38.130> moments<00:00:41.180> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
one of those life-changing moments the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.440 
one of those life-changing moments the
first<00:00:42.210> time<00:00:42.510> he<00:00:42.630> played<00:00:42.870> no.1<00:00:43.970> he<00:00:44.970> called<00:00:45.300> me

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
first time he played no.1 he called me

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.670 
first time he played no.1 he called me
and<00:00:45.570> said<00:00:45.690> look<00:00:45.810> we<00:00:45.930> got<00:00:46.050> played<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.560> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and said look we got played you know I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.500 
and said look we got played you know I
want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> use<00:00:47.160> these<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:47.579> said<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.970> my<00:00:48.030> rig<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
want to use these now said in my rig and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.960 
want to use these now said in my rig and
it's<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.840> well<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.920> had<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> column

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
it's like well you know I had a column

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.940 
it's like well you know I had a column
with<00:00:51.090> three<00:00:51.300> hand<00:00:51.450> speakers<00:00:51.900> come<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.200> out<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
with three hand speakers come on out and

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.440 
with three hand speakers come on out and
he<00:00:53.040> said<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> first<00:00:53.790> time<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.270> life

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
he said it's the first time in my life

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.479 
he said it's the first time in my life
it<00:00:54.750> sounds<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.710> I've<00:00:55.890> been<00:00:55.920> hearing<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it sounds the way I've been hearing it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.920 
it sounds the way I've been hearing it
in<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.670> head

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.799 

suddenly<00:01:01.930> it<00:01:02.350> was<00:01:02.410> like<00:01:02.530> wow<00:01:03.070> okay<00:01:03.750> there's<00:01:04.750> a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
suddenly it was like wow okay there's a

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.460 
suddenly it was like wow okay there's a
clarity<00:01:05.530> here<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.430> will<00:01:06.820> let<00:01:07.060> me<00:01:07.600> take<00:01:07.870> my

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
clarity here that will let me take my

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.840 
clarity here that will let me take my
whole<00:01:09.870> sort<00:01:10.870> of<00:01:10.930> sense<00:01:11.290> of<00:01:11.530> Sonic's<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.550> sound

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
whole sort of sense of Sonic's and sound

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.540 
whole sort of sense of Sonic's and sound
tool<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.660> new<00:01:13.900> place<00:01:14.200> everything<00:01:15.070> I<00:01:15.190> do<00:01:15.250> that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
tool to a new place everything I do that

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.040 
tool to a new place everything I do that
has<00:01:15.700> anything<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:16.060> do<00:01:16.240> with<00:01:16.270> acoustic<00:01:16.750> guitar

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
has anything to do with acoustic guitar

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.770 
has anything to do with acoustic guitar
and<00:01:17.440> part<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.160> electric<00:01:18.610> sound<00:01:18.880> all<00:01:19.240> comes

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
and part of the electric sound all comes

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.410 
and part of the electric sound all comes
through<00:01:19.900> Bo's<00:01:20.530> l1<00:01:21.160> systems<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.270> was

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
through Bo's l1 systems as I was

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.690 
through Bo's l1 systems as I was
developing<00:01:25.690> this<00:01:26.140> project<00:01:26.440> I<00:01:27.010> knew<00:01:27.460> that

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
developing this project I knew that

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.460 
developing this project I knew that
there<00:01:27.850> were<00:01:27.970> gonna<00:01:28.090> be<00:01:28.330> some<00:01:28.600> sonic

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
there were gonna be some sonic

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.219 
there were gonna be some sonic
challenges<00:01:30.400> I've<00:01:30.760> always<00:01:31.390> had<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.630> little<00:01:31.990> bit

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
challenges I've always had a little bit

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.580 
challenges I've always had a little bit
of<00:01:32.290> problem<00:01:33.130> with<00:01:33.300> speakers<00:01:34.300> anyway<00:01:35.050> because

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
of problem with speakers anyway because

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.380 
of problem with speakers anyway because
to<00:01:35.740> me<00:01:35.830> that's<00:01:36.010> always<00:01:36.280> been<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.790> weak<00:01:37.060> link

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
to me that's always been the weak link

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.990 
to me that's always been the weak link
in<00:01:37.570> things<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.229> output<00:01:38.710> side<00:01:38.950> for<00:01:39.220> me<00:01:39.369> has<00:01:39.670> has

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
in things the output side for me has has

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.680 
in things the output side for me has has
never<00:01:40.360> really<00:01:40.780> been<00:01:40.900> that<00:01:40.960> satisfying<00:01:42.690> the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
never really been that satisfying the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.680 
never really been that satisfying the
truth<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.500> amount<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.310> sonic<00:01:45.910> complexity

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
truth is the amount of sonic complexity

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.609 
truth is the amount of sonic complexity
that<00:01:46.869> happens<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.619> air<00:01:47.800> is<00:01:48.570> truly

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that happens in the air is truly

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.790 
that happens in the air is truly
infinitely<00:01:51.030> exponentially<00:01:52.030> more

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
infinitely exponentially more

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.410 
infinitely exponentially more
complicated<00:01:53.800> than<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:54.400> happens<00:01:55.060> when<00:01:55.270> you

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
complicated than what happens when you

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.090 
complicated than what happens when you
cram<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:55.900> bunch<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.259> stuff<00:01:56.470> into<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.800> couple

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
cram a bunch of stuff into a couple

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.280 
cram a bunch of stuff into a couple
speakers<00:01:57.520> because<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.300> me<00:01:58.450> two<00:01:58.660> speakers<00:01:59.050> is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
speakers because to me two speakers is

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.410 
speakers because to me two speakers is
just<00:01:59.560> not<00:01:59.770> enough

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.080 

with<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.170> project<00:02:04.440> my<00:02:05.010> idea<00:02:05.400> was<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.790> try<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
with this project my idea was to try to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.370 
with this project my idea was to try to
keep<00:02:06.570> as<00:02:06.870> much<00:02:07.039> discrete<00:02:08.450> sonic<00:02:09.450> stuff<00:02:09.959> going

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
keep as much discrete sonic stuff going

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.490 
keep as much discrete sonic stuff going
on<00:02:10.560> as<00:02:10.740> possible<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.490> this<00:02:12.330> idea<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.260> using

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
on as possible and this idea of using

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
on as possible and this idea of using
Bose<00:02:13.890> speakers<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.940> around<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> stage

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
Bose speakers all around the stage

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.230 
Bose speakers all around the stage
getting<00:02:16.590> sort<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.980> discrete<00:02:17.459> individual

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
getting sort of discrete individual

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.460 
getting sort of discrete individual
elements<00:02:18.900> working<00:02:19.530> together<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.520> air<00:02:20.700> is

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
elements working together in the air is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.650 
elements working together in the air is
the<00:02:22.470> goal<00:02:22.650> here<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.880> essentially<00:02:27.510> what's

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the goal here so essentially what's

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.949 
the goal here so essentially what's
going<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.470> kind<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.270> buried<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.510> here<00:02:30.750> you

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
going on is kind of buried in here you

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.600 
going on is kind of buried in here you
can<00:02:31.110> sort<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.739> them<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.070> wait<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.580> a

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
sort of physically here but then I can

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.880 
sort of physically here but then I can
monitor<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.700> from<00:02:59.910> right<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:00.180> also<00:03:00.890> it's

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
monitor it from right there also it's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.150 
monitor it from right there also it's
just<00:03:02.810> incredibly<00:03:03.810> stimulating<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
just incredibly stimulating and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.310 
just incredibly stimulating and

inspiring it's standing in the middle of
this<00:03:07.410> every<00:03:07.769> night<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.400> heaven<00:03:08.700> it's

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
this every night is like heaven it's

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.780 
this every night is like heaven it's
just<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.930> greatest<00:03:10.590> sound<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:11.130> can<00:03:11.310> possibly

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
just the greatest sound you can possibly

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
just the greatest sound you can possibly
imagine

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.800 
musician my ideal remains acoustic music
I<00:03:22.720> think<00:03:23.350> whatever<00:03:24.040> success<00:03:24.490> I've<00:03:25.060> had<00:03:25.120> in

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
I think whatever success I've had in

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.170 
I think whatever success I've had in
this<00:03:25.960> area<00:03:26.190> has<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.460> do<00:03:27.640> with<00:03:27.850> sort<00:03:28.120> of

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
this area has to do with sort of

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.140 
this area has to do with sort of
applying<00:03:28.720> an<00:03:29.160> acoustic<00:03:30.160> sensibility<00:03:30.940> to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
applying an acoustic sensibility to

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.420 
applying an acoustic sensibility to
electric<00:03:31.780> instruments<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.830> Bose<00:03:33.070> stuff

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
electric instruments and the Bose stuff

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.640 
electric instruments and the Bose stuff
is<00:03:33.700> central<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.720> all<00:03:34.840> we<00:03:35.020> could<00:03:35.200> never<00:03:35.530> have

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
is central to it all we could never have

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.820 
is central to it all we could never have
done<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:35.950> without<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.520> I<00:03:37.590> can't<00:03:38.590> think<00:03:38.650> of

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
done it without it I can't think of

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.470 
done it without it I can't think of
anything<00:03:39.040> else<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.430> would<00:03:39.520> do<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.880> the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
anything else that would do it the

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.290 
anything else that would do it the
coverage<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.860> more<00:03:42.400> instrument<00:03:43.150> like

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
coverage of it is more instrument like

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.600 
coverage of it is more instrument like
in<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.990> sense<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:45.100> don't<00:03:45.310> get<00:03:45.430> any

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
in a sense is that you don't get any

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.670 
in a sense is that you don't get any
sense<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.270> it's<00:03:46.450> coming<00:03:46.810> out<00:03:46.990> of<00:03:47.020> a

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
sense of that it's coming out of a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.430 
sense of that it's coming out of a
speaker<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.520> that's<00:03:48.910> what<00:03:49.240> they<00:03:49.840> do<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.230> no

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
speaker and that's what they do that no

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.580 
speaker and that's what they do that no
other<00:03:50.620> speaker<00:03:51.130> I've<00:03:51.280> used<00:03:51.520> can<00:03:51.730> do

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.220 

you've<00:03:55.040> done<00:03:55.250> concerts<00:03:56.030> all<00:03:56.569> over<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:57.020> world

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
you've done concerts all over the world

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.680 
you've done concerts all over the world
and<00:03:57.560> will<00:03:57.980> continue<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.520> do<00:03:58.640> more<00:03:58.849> and<00:03:59.150> every

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
and will continue to do more and every

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.809 
and will continue to do more and every
day<00:03:59.870> they've<00:04:00.140> just<00:04:00.380> performed<00:04:00.890> perfectly<00:04:01.250> and

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
day they've just performed perfectly and

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.000 
day they've just performed perfectly and
of<00:04:02.239> course<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.720> ease<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:02.989> setup<00:04:03.380> for<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.800> crew

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
of course the ease of setup for the crew

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.430 
of course the ease of setup for the crew
in<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.430> midst<00:04:04.670> of<00:04:04.730> all<00:04:04.910> this<00:04:05.090> just<00:04:05.989> I<00:04:06.230> think

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
in the midst of all this just I think

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.809 
in the midst of all this just I think
probably<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> highlight<00:04:07.190> of<00:04:07.489> their<00:04:07.580> day<00:04:07.640> that

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
probably the highlight of their day that

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.990 
probably the highlight of their day that
they<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.270> just<00:04:08.420> go<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:09.349> it's<00:04:09.500> done<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:10.580> mean

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
they can just go and it's done I mean

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.180 
they can just go and it's done I mean
we've<00:04:11.120> got<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.360> lot<00:04:11.540> of<00:04:11.569> them<00:04:11.840> they<00:04:12.380> go<00:04:12.860> up<00:04:13.040> so

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
we've got a lot of them they go up so

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.589 
we've got a lot of them they go up so
fast<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.550> they<00:04:13.670> disappear<00:04:14.209> at<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.390> end<00:04:14.510> of

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
fast and they disappear at the end of

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.270 
fast and they disappear at the end of
the<00:04:14.660> night<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.590> terms<00:04:15.860> of<00:04:16.010> everything

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
the night and in terms of everything

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.970 
the night and in terms of everything
we've<00:04:16.970> brought<00:04:17.600> with<00:04:17.989> us<00:04:18.169> you<00:04:18.560> serve<00:04:18.739> don't
