00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
nearly forgot all right now obviously

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
nearly forgot all right now obviously
we've<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.579> nice<00:00:41.820> green<00:00:42.120> foliage<00:00:42.390> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
we've got all this nice green foliage to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750 
we've got all this nice green foliage to
begin<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:43.890> rather<00:00:44.129> than<00:00:44.309> kind<00:00:44.579> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
begin with now rather than kind of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.299 
begin with now rather than kind of
fluffing<00:00:45.120> around<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.379> stuff<00:00:46.440> best

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
fluffing around with this stuff best

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.799 
fluffing around with this stuff best
thing<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:48.559> get<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> knife<00:00:49.829> or<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.789> trail<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
thing to do get a knife or a trail and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
thing to do get a knife or a trail and
just<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.170> rid<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.640> back<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
just get rid of this so go right back to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.779 
just get rid of this so go right back to
the<00:00:54.120> bottom<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.520> you<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.989> hack<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.170> off

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
the bottom and you can just hack it off

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.540 
the bottom and you can just hack it off
and<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.030> move<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.770> put<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> bed

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and just move on put all that in the bed

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.870 
and just move on put all that in the bed
next<00:01:02.760> door<00:01:04.040> it's<00:01:05.040> probably<00:01:05.189> easier<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
next door it's probably easier just to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.700 
next door it's probably easier just to
break<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:07.640> because<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:08.850> quite<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.710> but

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
break it because there's quite a bit but

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
break it because there's quite a bit but
this<00:01:10.860> will<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.159> into<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> compost

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.580 

so<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:22.090> this<00:01:22.210> coming<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.720> side<00:01:25.560> now<00:01:26.560> I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
so all this coming on this side now I

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.680 
so all this coming on this side now I
think<00:01:26.740> it's<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.040> be<00:01:27.100> easier<00:01:27.310> just<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
think it's going to be easier just to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.920 
think it's going to be easier just to
snap<00:01:33.690> these<00:01:33.900> off<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.700> pull<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> few<00:01:36.720> up

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
snap these off you can pull a few up

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.150 
snap these off you can pull a few up
I'll<00:01:37.740> move<00:01:37.980> that<00:01:38.010> is<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.550> drip<00:01:38.790> tray<00:01:38.820> drip<00:01:39.750> line

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
I'll move that is a drip tray drip line

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.100 
I'll move that is a drip tray drip line
well<00:01:41.160> there<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.370> go<00:01:44.060> there's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.180> spud

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
well there we go there's a spud

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.180 
well there we go there's a spud
there's<00:01:47.530> another<00:01:47.860> one<00:01:47.980> a<00:01:49.560> few<00:01:50.560> more<00:01:50.710> on<00:01:50.950> that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
there's another one a few more on that

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.720 
there's another one a few more on that
little<00:01:51.460> ones<00:01:51.730> I<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.490> main<00:01:57.700> thing

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
little ones I think the main thing

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.620 
little ones I think the main thing
initially<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:58.510> just<00:01:58.870> not<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.320> dig<00:02:00.360> too<00:02:01.360> much

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
initially is just not to dig too much

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.930 
initially is just not to dig too much
you<00:02:02.470> don't<00:02:02.500> want<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.800> split<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.280> potatoes<00:02:03.729> in

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
you don't want to split the potatoes in

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.050 
you don't want to split the potatoes in
half<00:02:04.920> yeah<00:02:07.890> I'll<00:02:08.890> just<00:02:08.920> pop<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.250> aside<00:02:09.729> just

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
half yeah I'll just pop that aside just

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.220 
half yeah I'll just pop that aside just
for<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.330> time<00:02:10.479> bein<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:13.410> look<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.110> is

for the time bein a look then this is

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.550 
for the time bein a look then this is
much<00:02:17.410> better<00:02:17.590> than<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:18.010> other<00:02:18.190> oh<00:02:19.290> wow<00:02:20.290> look

that<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.489> only<00:02:57.760> started<00:02:58.120> with<00:02:58.450> like<00:02:59.160> this<00:03:00.160> I

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
that so I only started with like this I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.600 
that so I only started with like this I
put<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.480> three<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.280> even<00:03:03.280> if<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.430> take

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
put the three in and even if you take

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.400 
put the three in and even if you take
those<00:03:03.760> three<00:03:04.090> initial<00:03:04.450> ones<00:03:04.630> aside<00:03:05.140> I've

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
those three initial ones aside I've

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.590 
those three initial ones aside I've
already<00:03:05.560> got<00:03:05.799> that<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:09.299> that's<00:03:10.299> pretty<00:03:10.480> cool

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
already got that so that's pretty cool

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.030 
already got that so that's pretty cool
they<00:03:11.290> just<00:03:11.470> dig<00:03:11.590> around<00:03:11.709> with<00:03:11.980> your<00:03:12.040> hands

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
they just dig around with your hands

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.380 
they just dig around with your hands
most<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.190> them<00:03:15.310> will<00:03:15.430> be<00:03:15.610> because<00:03:16.120> i<00:03:16.209> haven't

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
most of them will be because i haven't

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.070 
most of them will be because i haven't
earth<00:03:16.630> stood<00:03:16.840> up<00:03:18.120> there<00:03:19.120> won't<00:03:19.330> be<00:03:19.630> many

true

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.780 

just<00:03:26.819> give<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.090> good<00:03:27.209> search<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.610> there's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
just give it a good search and there's

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.540 
just give it a good search and there's
another<00:03:29.970> little<00:03:30.120> i<00:03:30.860> think<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.069> pink<00:03:32.310> fur

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
another little i think that the pink fur

another little i think that the pink fur
that<00:03:33.300> i<00:03:33.420> put<00:03:33.660> in<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.430> by<00:03:35.970> earthing<00:03:36.480> up<00:03:38.090> that's

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that i put in so by earthing up that's

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.729 
that i put in so by earthing up that's
an<00:03:39.209> old<00:03:39.300> technique<00:03:41.330> that<00:03:42.330> by<00:03:42.600> at<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.350> potato

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
an old technique that by at the potato

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:52.660 
an old technique that by at the potato
grows<00:03:44.190> now<00:03:44.670> let<00:03:44.970> me<00:03:45.000> get<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.590> plan

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.020 

alright<00:03:53.330> says<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.290> plant<00:03:54.530> grows<00:03:54.760> rub<00:03:55.760> didn't

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
alright says the plant grows rub didn't

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.460 
alright says the plant grows rub didn't
have<00:03:56.150> all<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:56.569> stuff<00:03:56.810> up<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.110> top<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.440> was

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
have all this stuff up the top I was

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.699 
have all this stuff up the top I was
pretty<00:03:57.800> lazy<00:03:58.099> with<00:03:58.400> mine<00:03:58.700> as<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.720> grows<00:03:59.959> if<00:04:00.620> you

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
pretty lazy with mine as it grows if you

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.559 
pretty lazy with mine as it grows if you
have<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:00.950> at<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.099> lower<00:04:01.310> level<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.420> see

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
have it at a lower level and you see

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.520 
have it at a lower level and you see
these<00:04:02.630> little<00:04:02.810> nodules<00:04:03.819> on<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:05.000> sides<00:04:05.530> they

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
these little nodules on the sides they

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.920 
these little nodules on the sides they
will<00:04:06.709> actually<00:04:07.069> stem<00:04:07.940> out<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.390> grow<00:04:08.630> more

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
will actually stem out and grow more

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.410 
will actually stem out and grow more
potatoes<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:10.190> by<00:04:10.520> kind<00:04:10.880> of<00:04:11.000> rather<00:04:11.239> than

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
potatoes so by kind of rather than

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.610 
potatoes so by kind of rather than
having<00:04:11.630> this<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.550> ending<00:04:13.550> up<00:04:13.640> with<00:04:13.700> nothing

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
having this and ending up with nothing

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.610 
having this and ending up with nothing
literally<00:04:15.620> as<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:16.730> name<00:04:16.910> suggests<00:04:17.320> earth<00:04:18.320> it

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
literally as the name suggests earth it

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.580 
literally as the name suggests earth it
up<00:04:18.799> so<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.519> keep<00:04:19.940> like<00:04:20.359> basically<00:04:20.900> burying

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
up so you keep like basically burying

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.010 
up so you keep like basically burying
those<00:04:22.250> little<00:04:22.580> nodules<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.210> they'll<00:04:23.720> sprout

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
those little nodules and they'll sprout

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.379 
those little nodules and they'll sprout
out<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.410> you'll<00:04:24.500> get<00:04:24.650> more<00:04:24.830> potatoes<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:26.150> it's

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
out and you'll get more potatoes so it's

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.990 
out and you'll get more potatoes so it's
a<00:04:26.450> great<00:04:26.600> way<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:28.090> increase<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:30.430> harvest<00:04:31.430> that

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
a great way to increase the harvest that

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.170 
a great way to increase the harvest that
you<00:04:32.150> get<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.919> might<00:04:34.100> be<00:04:34.370> how<00:04:34.880> many<00:04:35.030> we

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
you get and that might be how many we

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.150 
you get and that might be how many we
get<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.600> few<00:04:35.660> more<00:04:36.580> got<00:04:37.580> those<00:04:37.729> little<00:04:37.820> numbers

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
get a few more got those little numbers

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:48.010 
get a few more got those little numbers
they're<00:04:40.160> cool<00:04:41.770> no<00:04:42.770> one<00:04:43.070> oh<00:04:45.639> there's<00:04:46.639> have<00:04:47.020> 12

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.290 
they're cool no one oh there's have 12
more<00:04:48.880> different<00:04:49.880> varieties<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.389> I<00:04:50.570> put<00:04:50.810> in

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
more different varieties that I put in

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.600 
more different varieties that I put in
things

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.939 

that<00:04:57.210> is<00:04:57.449> it

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.920

there's<00:05:11.760> always<00:05:12.000> one<00:05:12.210> more<00:05:15.320> now<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:16.350> think<00:05:16.620> that

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
there's always one more now I think that

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.140 
there's always one more now I think that
is<00:05:17.360> come<00:05:18.360> on<00:05:18.480> one<00:05:18.660> more
