decals I find they're a bit overkill and

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.570 
decals I find they're a bit overkill and
detract<00:00:58.559> from<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.799> look<00:00:58.979> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.159> kit<00:00:59.339> so<00:00:59.549> I

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
detract from the look of the kit so I

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.729
