00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.510
 hello how about friends we place wang in the 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.150
 Today's video we are going to learn 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.390
 how to accelerate what is the ignition and 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.430
 the shutdown of the windows 7 system because 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.190
 comes the last video we saw how it 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.199
 did in what was xp so the day of 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.539
 today as we'll see how it is done in 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.850
 windows 7 well firstly for 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.640
 accelerate what is the ignition of 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.230
 our windows 7 operating system 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.070
 let's go to our keyboard and go 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.960
 to press the windows + erre key and 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.230
 we will come out what is the window of 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.030
 run once already being here in what 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.710
 what is to execute let's write ms 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.340
 config which are the configurations of 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.230
 microsoft we are going to give enter or accept and 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.810
 we will get the next window that is 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 System Configuration 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.800
 first here in the general tab 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.110
 let's see what we have 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.449
 selected this option that says start 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.790
 selective and once we have it 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.949
 selected we will load what they are 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.229
 system services and load 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.229
 also the starting elements ie 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.630
 let's select these two options 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.430
 I do not recommend that you select 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.899
 this is the boot configuration 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 initial because this the only thing that's going to 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.520
 make it take longer for the system 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 operative ie it's going to take longer in 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.899
 start so let's leave it as 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.270
 go here ok 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.660
 well after this we're going to go to the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.039
 tab that says start here we 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.810
 will come out what is the operating system 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.060
 what are we using 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.070
 first what we are going to do here 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.740
 let's select this that says without 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.990
 boot of we who is this interface 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.720
 graphic that starts with our system 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 operative if you do not know what this is good 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.460
 It is these little lights that appear at 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.920
 moment that we turn on our 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.289
 operating system that start to move 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.259
 they come together and form the logo of windows 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.350
 this is then this graphical interface as well 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.509
 that what we are going to do then is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.660
 select it so that this does not come out 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.519
 and then start immediately with what 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.459
 is the blue screen of the system 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.230
 operative ok if you want me to start 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.840
 with this good so kind of hash and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.500
 how are they ok here in waiting time 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.989
 by default it comes 30 seconds us 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.180
 we're going to put it to 15 which is the optimal 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.470
 to not have any mistakes your 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.390
 operating system , you can leave it like this 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.010
 Once this is done, let's go to 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.110
 advanced options 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.810
 here we are going to select the number of 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.060
 processors you will have it like this and 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.819
 they will have number one here so what 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.640
 we are going to select in case that 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.260
 you have two or more processors so you 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.690
 are going to come out here in this tab in my 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.909
 case I have two processors so 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.069
 I'm going to select the two 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.019
 processors to boot with my 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.120
 system using these two then 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.640
 ok kernels are not the processors very 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.200
 ok your two-core processor if you 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.269
 you have a good one because it's not going to happen to you 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.650
 this option will only give you the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.959
 processor that you have is the number of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.240
 nuclei we are going to select what is the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.260
 maximum amount of memory 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:20.210
 we select them and we put them to the maximum 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.760
 Once this is done we are going to accept 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.670
 then we are going to go here this tab 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.040
 that says windows start and here we 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.980
 all the programs that start 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.570
 with our operating system in my case 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.910
 Well then I have very few because 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.770
 erase many for a long time that 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.870
 I have it and so my system only with 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.820
 what I need but good to you 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.660
 are going to leave for example the ares you can 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.120
 leave the tuna or utilities you can leave 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.670
 sing, you can leave the messenger on 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.320
 the mere wisp loader in order and sometimes 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.730
 are programs that do not necessarily 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.410
 run when you start your system 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.190
 operative is not going to open 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.500
 but they do have the ability to 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.450
 start with your operating system to 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.450
 search for updates immediately 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.580
 that you wear your computer so 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.770
 good you're going to have to disable these 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.500
 programs that you do not need for example 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.840
 If I did not want to start the re al tec 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.840
 Well, just what was removed here 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.580
 the selection popcorn and ready with 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.100
 this is no longer going to start what is real 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.430
 tech but then if I need it so what 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.800
 I will leave 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.190
 and once this is done simply going 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 to give in applying and accepting we will 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.720
 ask us to restart the system I do not 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.729
 I restart it because it would be cutting 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.860
 what is the video but good you 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.220
 Ok, so I'm going to 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.910
 put out if restart 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.940
 well in this way we have accelerated what 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.100
 what is the ignition of our system 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.680
 operative I also recommend that 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.170
 leave only the icons that you 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.630
 they use because there are people who have 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.210
 your desk full of icons and believe me 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.570
 that all this also contributes to 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.280
 the start of the operating system be it 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.010
 slower ok with this we have done 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.570
 we can see that our desktop to 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.460
 moment that we turn on our 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.090
 system will be displayed more 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.570
 Quick 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.330
 ok now let's see how to optimize or 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.820
 how to accelerate what is the shutdown of 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.160
 windows 7 system well to do this 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.169
 let's go again to what 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.220
 is our keyboard and we are going to press 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.960
 the windows key 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.410
 acr and here we are going to write refer that 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.090
 that is the king and log window 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.850
 that once we 're here we 're going to go 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.870
 here at txiki local machine we are going to 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:48.440
 open we're going to go to system let's 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:51.030
 open it let's look for a control set 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.030
 let's unfold it 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.140
 and we're going to go here to the folder 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.080
 control 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.480
 we click and on the right side we go to 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.540
 look for the key that says useful white 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.510
 services time out and if you look here in 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.610
 the data comes 12,000 which are the 12 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.100
 seconds that our system takes 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.710
 operative in killing the processes and close 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.270
 the system so we're going to 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.480
 modify let's double-click 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:22.650
 about it and here in the value that says 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:27.270
 12,000 we will only change it for 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.740
 8000 ok this is the optimal value with this 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.230
 it will not affect anything to your system 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.330
 operative are not going to have any 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.390
 complication or anything I recommend them 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.340
 that you put less because if you can 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.990
 have some problem then this is 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.540
 so the least you can put 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.180
 because to kill the processes and not 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.540
 have errors then configuration 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.820
 system that keeps its configuration well 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.600
 all your boot ok so you do not have 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.020
 problems 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.930
 then 8000 is optimal already once 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.889
 done this because we simply accept and 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.680
 we close what is 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.690
 then the registry editor 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.449
 and once done this because 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.729
 we reset what is our system 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.919
 operative so that effects arise 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.770
 changes once done this is going to 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:18.070
 notice a very good improvement in what is 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:21.270
 the off or rather the ignition and 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:23.370
 the shutdown of your operating system 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.140
 Well, with this I finish what is the 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.660
 today's video waiting for you 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.670
 liked you have served you already know that 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.860
 Any doubt or clarification I can 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.910
 follow what is the Swedish channel most 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.910
 one we are in contact until next 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.910
 video
