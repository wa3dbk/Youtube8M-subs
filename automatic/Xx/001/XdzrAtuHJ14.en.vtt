hi<00:00:10.590> I'm<00:00:10.920> Drex<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> fourth<00:00:12.630> video

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
hi I'm Drex and this is the fourth video

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.419 
hi I'm Drex and this is the fourth video
in<00:00:13.019> my<00:00:13.230> tutorial<00:00:13.799> series<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.250> linear

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
in my tutorial series on linear

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.880 
in my tutorial series on linear
extensions<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:16.049> far<00:00:16.320> we've<00:00:16.500> covered<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
extensions so far we've covered the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.800 
extensions so far we've covered the
basics<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> linear<00:00:17.940> extension<00:00:18.240> is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
basics of what a linear extension is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.779 
basics of what a linear extension is
some<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.740> shapes<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.160> can<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.430> made<00:00:20.609> out

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
some of the shapes that can be made out

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.390 
some of the shapes that can be made out
of<00:00:20.820> them<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> how<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.590> use<00:00:22.800> timing<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
of them and how we can use timing and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.220 
of them and how we can use timing and
direction<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.060> create<00:00:24.420> these<00:00:24.570> shapes<00:00:24.869> using

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
direction to create these shapes using

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.950 
direction to create these shapes using
both<00:00:25.410> hands<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.789> video<00:00:27.150> we'll<00:00:27.750> cover

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
both hands in this video we'll cover

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.439 
both hands in this video we'll cover
cases<00:00:28.320> where<00:00:28.980> each<00:00:29.160> hand<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.699> performing<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
cases where each hand is performing a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
cases where each hand is performing a
different<00:00:30.810> shape<00:00:31.019> you'll<00:00:31.529> want<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> start<00:00:32.040> out

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
different shape you'll want to start out

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.370 
different shape you'll want to start out
just<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.730> did<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> single<00:00:33.630> hand<00:00:33.840> by

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
just like we did with a single hand by

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.139 
just like we did with a single hand by
performing<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> standard<00:00:35.370> butterfly<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
performing a standard butterfly and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.660 
performing a standard butterfly and
seeing<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:36.930> far<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.530> stretch<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
seeing how far you can stretch it up and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.180 
seeing how far you can stretch it up and
down<00:00:39.090> when<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.200> point<00:00:40.500> move<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.800> your

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
down when you're point move up your

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
down when you're point move up your
hands<00:00:41.430> move<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.879> when<00:00:42.540> you're<00:00:42.690> point<00:00:42.960> move

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
hands move up when you're point move

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.130 
hands move up when you're point move
down<00:00:43.320> well<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> idea<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:45.140> let's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
down well you get the idea now let's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
down well you get the idea now let's
switch<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.649> split<00:00:46.980> time<00:00:47.160> opposites<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
switch to split time opposites and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760 
switch to split time opposites and
you'll<00:00:48.270> practice<00:00:48.690> moving<00:00:48.840> your<00:00:49.110> hands<00:00:49.500> back

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you'll practice moving your hands back

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
you'll practice moving your hands back
and<00:00:49.950> forth<00:00:50.039> horizontally<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.239> straight

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and forth horizontally in a straight

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.770 
and forth horizontally in a straight
line

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
line

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959

this<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> bit<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> challenge<00:00:53.820> at

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
this can be a bit of a challenge at

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
this can be a bit of a challenge at
first<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.840> you've<00:00:55.079> ever<00:00:55.260> spent<00:00:55.440> time<00:00:55.770> double

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
first if you've ever spent time double

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
first if you've ever spent time double
dutch<00:00:56.309> jump<00:00:56.640> roping<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.149> may<00:00:57.660> find<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> feels

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
dutch jump roping you may find it feels

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.099 
dutch jump roping you may find it feels
similar<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.710> turning<00:00:58.890> ropes<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.550> hobby

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
similar to turning ropes in this hobby

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.330 
similar to turning ropes in this hobby
now<00:01:01.109> let's<00:01:01.350> practice<00:01:01.530> switching<00:01:02.219> between

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
now let's practice switching between

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.969 
now let's practice switching between
these<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.030> timings<00:01:03.500> one<00:01:04.500> way<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> ease<00:01:04.949> into

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
these two timings one way to ease into

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.160 
these two timings one way to ease into
it<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.580> similar<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.180> transition<00:01:06.600> exercise

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it is similar to the transition exercise

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.980 
it is similar to the transition exercise
from<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> first<00:01:07.799> video<00:01:08.390> practice<00:01:09.390> performing

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
from the first video practice performing

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
from the first video practice performing
a<00:01:10.110> vertical<00:01:10.650> line<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:12.380> diagonal<00:01:13.380> line

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
a vertical line a diagonal line

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.080 
a vertical line a diagonal line
then<00:01:15.570> horizontal<00:01:16.320> line<00:01:16.530> before<00:01:17.310> returning<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
then horizontal line before returning to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.070 
then horizontal line before returning to
the<00:01:18.210> vertical<00:01:18.479> line<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> likely<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the vertical line so this is likely the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.749 
the vertical line so this is likely the
hardest<00:01:22.530> exercise<00:01:22.619> I've<00:01:23.159> given<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> yet

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
hardest exercise I've given you yet

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
hardest exercise I've given you yet
here's<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.600> way<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> could<00:01:25.110> simplify

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
here's one way that you could simplify

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
here's one way that you could simplify
it<00:01:25.790> imagine<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.299> three

that you're going to swat those

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.649 
that you're going to swat those
mosquitoes<00:01:56.399> by<00:01:56.670> trapping<00:01:56.970> them<00:01:57.240> between<00:01:57.479> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
the hips will be a little harder but our

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.610 
the hips will be a little harder but our

the basic tools you'll need to make it
work<00:02:55.620> start<00:02:56.620> by<00:02:56.740> doing<00:02:56.920> two<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.400> four<00:02:57.640> beats

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
work start by doing two to four beats

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.540 
work start by doing two to four beats
along<00:02:58.210> each<00:02:58.630> line<00:02:58.920> then<00:02:59.920> work<00:03:00.190> your<00:03:00.340> way<00:03:00.400> down

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
along each line then work your way down

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.680 
along each line then work your way down
to<00:03:01.150> moving<00:03:01.450> along<00:03:01.660> each<00:03:01.900> line<00:03:02.230> only<00:03:02.560> once<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
to moving along each line only once the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.570 
to moving along each line only once the
result<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> trick<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.710> is<00:03:06.070> sometimes

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
result is a trick that is sometimes

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.180 
result is a trick that is sometimes
called<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.330> Mercedes<00:03:07.960> because<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.980> full

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
called the Mercedes because the full

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.310 
called the Mercedes because the full
pattern<00:03:09.490> somewhat<00:03:10.090> resembles<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.720> logo<00:03:11.080> for

pattern somewhat resembles the logo for
mercedes-benz<00:03:12.210> we<00:03:13.210> would<00:03:13.390> call<00:03:13.600> this<00:03:13.780> type<00:03:13.990> of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
mercedes-benz we would call this type of

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.070 
mercedes-benz we would call this type of
