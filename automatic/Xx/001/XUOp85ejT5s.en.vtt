here it's like expose like I said but
the<00:01:45.700> applications<00:01:46.540> are<00:01:46.750> grouped<00:01:47.110> together<00:01:47.320> so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
the applications are grouped together so

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.640 
the applications are grouped together so
they're<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:49.030> top<00:01:49.360> right<00:01:49.659> area<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.409> can

and they're grouped together and another
new<00:01:57.040> cool<00:01:57.759> feature<00:01:58.119> of<00:01:58.600> Mission<00:01:59.470> Control<00:01:59.770> is

then you can access this thing called
versions<00:02:40.799> which<00:02:41.340> show<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.989> all<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:44.010> versions

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
versions which show you all the versions

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.500 
versions which show you all the versions
of<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.609> document<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.450> had<00:02:46.430> before

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
of that document that you had before

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.899 
of that document that you had before
right<00:02:48.510> before<00:02:48.540> each<00:02:49.170> autosave<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.700> good

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
right before each autosave and the good

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.509 
right before each autosave and the good
thing<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:52.200> doesn't<00:02:52.859> take<00:02:53.099> up<00:02:53.129> too<00:02:53.280> much

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
thing is it doesn't take up too much

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.250 
thing is it doesn't take up too much
space<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:54.209> your<00:02:54.239> hard<00:02:54.359> drive<00:02:54.659> because<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
space on your hard drive because it

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.949 
space on your hard drive because it
doesn't<00:02:55.980> save<00:02:56.280> every<00:02:57.060> single<00:02:57.480> separate

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
doesn't save every single separate

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.140 
doesn't save every single separate
document<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.829> says<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.340> change<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.909> made

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
document it just says the change is made

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.770 
document it just says the change is made
between<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:01.400> documents<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:03.389> I'm<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.720> to

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
between the documents now I'm going to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.699 
between the documents now I'm going to
talk<00:03:03.959> about<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.530> feature<00:03:04.920> called<00:03:05.329> resume<00:03:06.329> and

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
talk about a feature called resume and

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.309 
talk about a feature called resume and
I'm<00:03:07.709> not<00:03:08.010> sure<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.760> i<00:03:08.939> will<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:09.689> this<00:03:09.900> or<00:03:10.170> not

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
I'm not sure if i will like this or not

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.679 
I'm not sure if i will like this or not
but<00:03:10.590> basically<00:03:11.370> every<00:03:11.970> time<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.299> quit<00:03:12.540> an

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
but basically every time you quit an

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.800 
but basically every time you quit an
application<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.709> then<00:03:13.889> reopen<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.329> will

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
application and then reopen it it will

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.500 
application and then reopen it it will
open<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.010> exact<00:03:17.519> same<00:03:17.730> place<00:03:18.090> where<00:03:18.359> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
open to the exact same place where you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.649 
open to the exact same place where you
were<00:03:18.750> before<00:03:19.439> and<00:03:19.769> they<00:03:20.129> say<00:03:20.510> quote<00:03:21.510> unquote

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
were before and they say quote unquote

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.140 
were before and they say quote unquote
this<00:03:22.079> can<00:03:22.319> get<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.769> working<00:03:23.099> again<00:03:23.699> quicker

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
this can get you working again quicker

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.740 
this can get you working again quicker
but<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.349> think<00:03:25.980> if<00:03:26.160> you're<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.970> might<00:03:27.510> actually

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
but I think if you're it might actually

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.319 
but I think if you're it might actually
slow<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.620> down<00:03:28.949> to<00:03:29.340> start<00:03:29.609> new<00:03:29.760> work<00:03:29.940> because

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
slow you down to start new work because

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.180 
slow you down to start new work because
generally<00:03:31.199> when<00:03:31.230> i<00:03:31.470> open<00:03:31.919> an<00:03:32.010> application

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
generally when i open an application

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.080 
generally when i open an application
again<00:03:32.910> like<00:03:33.449> word<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.169> photoshop<00:03:34.799> i<00:03:35.489> open<00:03:36.030> it

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
again like word or photoshop i open it

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.240 
again like word or photoshop i open it
so<00:03:36.269> i<00:03:36.329> can<00:03:36.540> create<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.900> new<00:03:37.290> document<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.069> this

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
so i can create a new document so this

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.819 
so i can create a new document so this
might<00:03:38.629> save<00:03:39.629> time<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:39.989> some<00:03:40.169> cases<00:03:40.379> but<00:03:40.530> also

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
might save time in some cases but also

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.970 
might save time in some cases but also
lose<00:03:41.190> time<00:03:41.519> in<00:03:41.669> some<00:03:41.849> cases<00:03:42.500> now<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.560> next

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
lose time in some cases now the next

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.069 
lose time in some cases now the next
feature<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.609> not<00:03:44.849> something<00:03:45.359> they<00:03:45.629> actually

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
feature is not something they actually

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.379 
feature is not something they actually
mentioned<00:03:46.620> or<00:03:46.829> talk<00:03:47.099> about<00:03:47.129> but<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.150> just

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
mentioned or talk about but it's just

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.089 
mentioned or talk about but it's just
something<00:03:48.750> i<00:03:48.900> noticed<00:03:48.959> while<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.650> was<00:03:49.859> watching

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
something i noticed while I was watching

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.240 
something i noticed while I was watching
the<00:03:50.430> keynote<00:03:50.729> I<00:03:51.150> noticed<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.739> scrolling

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
the keynote I noticed that the scrolling

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.909 
the keynote I noticed that the scrolling
is<00:03:53.340> actually<00:03:53.849> reversed<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.169> it<00:03:55.440> would

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
is actually reversed just like it would

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.750 
is actually reversed just like it would
be<00:03:55.979> on<00:03:56.310> an<00:03:56.519> ipod<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.629> when<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.829> scrolling<00:03:59.549> down
