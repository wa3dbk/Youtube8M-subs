00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello welcome if you are watching this 

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.680
 video is because you're interested in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.930
 know the basic care you have 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.370
 to have once you have a child or 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.260
 a little pig deposits dt how to throw them 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.650
 the basic care first of all 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.050
 I want to tell you that these animals do not 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.939
 they can regulate their own temperature 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.650
 when they are young and when they grow up 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.029
 they already have more fat deposits and 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.610
 They can regulate but not at first 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.009
 It costs a lot of work then it's very 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.809
 important that you bear in mind that your 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.489
 around can not do much cold 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.380
 not much heat with either of the two 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.630
 things you can die then you have 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.160
 that have a lot of attention something of what 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.950
 What is recommended is that you have 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.649
 example in water bags and water 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.690
 boiling over the bag and with it the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.539
 you keep warm in fact this 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.940
 I have down here that is a hammock 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.239
 in 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.640
 this council has a plastic bag 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.050
 that has boiling water 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.399
 then I kept it inside the cow 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.320
 that can instead of the cow can be 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.239
 a flannel any washcloth that you 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.340
 put around so she feels 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.960
 hot about that is that she's going to 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.470
 can be 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.060
 another one of the things is diet the system 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.159
 digestive that these animals have is 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.380
 very long it is spiral and it is very long 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.330
 so if you leave them the food 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.490
 anywhere available all the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.409
 time will be eating all the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.600
 time and suddenly you're going to wake up 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.159
 with an animal that is very fat and 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.170
 that will not be able to walk or that will 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.820
 be tired all the time not because 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.530
 be a pig means you have 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.000
 than being fat or having to be 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.100
 fat you can handle a good 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.690
 food and make it healthy what 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.369
 you have to do is feed him three 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.229
 times a day or five times a day 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.270
 depending on the stage in which you are 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.160
 in some other video we will explain 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.750
 what are the stages and what is the 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.640
 specific feeding that you have to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.170
 have for example at the beginning as soon as 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.929
 we got the first month 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.729
 we had to give it a little bit of 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.520
 Regina which is like alfalfa in 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.200
 croquettes with food that is called 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.440
 missouri that is special food for 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.320
 little pigs and a little of all bran fiber and 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.569
 some corn flakes all the gifts 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.489
 in a little dish and that's what they eat in 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.290
 the second stage already with us already 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.000
 they are eating vegetables and eating 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.560
 fruits all scrambled 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.060
 Later, you will be given the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 fruits and vegetables in pieces 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.870
 complete so you can use your 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.330
 teeth 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.500
 and I'll tell you later they 're going to come 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.540
 other videos where I'm going to tell you 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.530
 exactly what happens at each stage of 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.480
 input what I think is super 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.900
 important to you is that the temperature 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.849
 always keep it always calibrated not 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.650
 you think it's just as easy as with a 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.900
 cat like with a dog you have to have 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.720
 much more care but it's worth a lot 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.409
 sorry I see you in the next video and 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.409
 see you later
