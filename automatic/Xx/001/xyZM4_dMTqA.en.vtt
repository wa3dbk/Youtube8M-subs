with Pepsi some of you might be

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.750 
with Pepsi some of you might be
surprised<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.650> reason<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:23.070> take<00:00:23.220> off<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.460> lid

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
surprised the reason we take off the lid

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
surprised the reason we take off the lid
and<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.269> take<00:00:24.449> off<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.630> caption<00:00:25.109> some<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and we take off the caption some of

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.779 
and we take off the caption some of
these<00:00:25.410> tests<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.310> could<00:00:26.519> see

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
these tests is so that you could see

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.080 
these tests is so that you could see
that<00:00:27.090> even<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.140> fluid<00:00:28.710> tilts<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.880> were<00:00:30.000> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
that even the fluid tilts if I were to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.240 
that even the fluid tilts if I were to
break<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.480> example<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.170> did<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.980> if

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
break for example like I just did or if

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
break for example like I just did or if
I<00:00:32.399> were<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.809> drive<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.200> we're<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I were to drive like this we're back and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
I were to drive like this we're back and
forth<00:00:35.160> lids<00:00:35.730> aren't<00:00:36.059> even<00:00:36.239> always<00:00:36.540> relevant

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
forth lids aren't even always relevant

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.250 
forth lids aren't even always relevant
for<00:00:37.530> example<00:00:37.920> let's<00:00:38.070> say<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.250> pop<00:00:38.550> off<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:39.260> cap

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
for example let's say you pop off a cap

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.549 
for example let's say you pop off a cap
with<00:00:41.160> an<00:00:41.309> aluminum<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.570> soda<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:43.170> now

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
with an aluminum can of soda right now

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
with an aluminum can of soda right now
just<00:00:43.770> how<00:00:43.890> smooth<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:44.610> precise<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.539> we

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
just how smooth and how precise it is we

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.950 
just how smooth and how precise it is we
are<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> spill<00:00:46.920> proof<00:00:47.670> cup<00:00:48.329> holder<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.840> are

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
are not a spill proof cup holder we are

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.100 
are not a spill proof cup holder we are
a<00:00:48.989> spill<00:00:49.379> preventing<00:00:49.980> device<00:00:50.309> let's<00:00:50.820> say<00:00:51.110> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
a spill preventing device let's say that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.000 
a spill preventing device let's say that
I<00:00:52.379> wanted<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.190> drink<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.239> two-liter<00:00:55.230> bottle<00:00:55.980> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I wanted to drink a two-liter bottle of

speed<00:01:11.369> bump<00:01:11.700> test<00:01:13.010> here<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.130> go

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
speed bump test here we go

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.980 
speed bump test here we go
first<00:01:16.170> speed<00:01:16.560> bond<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.070> second<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.990> third

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
first speed bond a second one third

speed bump this fourth speed bump fifth
speed<00:01:22.740> bump<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.909> let's<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.600> one<00:01:24.780> more

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
speed bump and let's just do one more

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
speed bump and let's just do one more
just<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> heck<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> nothing<00:01:26.280> lost
