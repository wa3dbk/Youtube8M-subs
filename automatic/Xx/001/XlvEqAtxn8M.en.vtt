one that Hannah was wearing in the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.420 
one that Hannah was wearing in the
picture<00:04:58.720> so<00:04:59.170> I<00:04:59.200> did<00:04:59.710> have<00:04:59.860> this<00:05:00.070> mint<00:05:00.370> green

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
picture so I did have this mint green

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.190 
picture so I did have this mint green
tank<00:05:00.910> top<00:05:00.970> though<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.750> found<00:05:02.050> this

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
tank top though and that I found this

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.590 
tank top though and that I found this
scarf<00:05:02.560> which<00:05:02.980> is<00:05:03.100> also<00:05:03.430> a<00:05:03.460> really<00:05:03.970> pretty<00:05:04.330> kind

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
scarf which is also a really pretty kind

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.850 
scarf which is also a really pretty kind
of<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:04.810> it's<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.050> little<00:05:05.230> bit<00:05:05.380> darker<00:05:05.740> than

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
I saw it in like every picture that I

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.920 
I saw it in like every picture that I
saw<00:05:23.920> of<00:05:24.130> her<00:05:24.580> fashion<00:05:25.090> when<00:05:25.240> I<00:05:25.270> was<00:05:25.480> looking<00:05:25.780> it

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
saw of her fashion when I was looking it

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.690 
saw of her fashion when I was looking it
up<00:05:26.020> she<00:05:26.590> was<00:05:26.740> basically<00:05:26.950> wearing<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.460> cropped

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700

black<00:05:28.000> blazer<00:05:28.450> in<00:05:28.780> every<00:05:29.470> picture<00:05:29.800> thus<00:05:30.400> I

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
black blazer in every picture thus I

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.280 
black blazer in every picture thus I
decided<00:05:30.670> that<00:05:30.910> I<00:05:31.030> had<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.270> include<00:05:31.420> that<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:31.990> I

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
decided that I had to include that and I

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.960 
decided that I had to include that and I
did<00:05:32.770> have<00:05:32.950> one<00:05:33.130> this<00:05:33.250> one's<00:05:33.460> from<00:05:33.610> each<00:05:33.790> of

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
that looks like this

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.820 
that looks like this
and<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.750> rolled<00:05:37.960> up<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.140> sleeves<00:05:38.260> about<00:05:38.680> as

plain black pencil skirt

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.240 
plain black pencil skirt
sounds<00:05:48.180> like<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.330> miniskirt<00:05:48.780> but<00:05:49.590> I<00:05:49.620> may<00:05:49.890> find<00:05:50.130> a

and<00:06:19.980> they<00:06:20.670> just<00:06:20.850> look<00:06:20.970> like<00:06:21.000> this<00:06:21.270> they're<00:06:21.480> a

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
and they just look like this they're a

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.120 
and they just look like this they're a
little<00:06:21.630> peep<00:06:21.900> toe<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.530> they<00:06:22.740> are<00:06:22.890> a<00:06:22.920> little

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
little peep toe and they are a little

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.860 
little peep toe and they are a little
bit<00:06:23.310> more<00:06:23.340> summery<00:06:23.850> but<00:06:24.120> if<00:06:24.300> you<00:06:24.420> weren't<00:06:24.630> with

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
bit more summery but if you weren't with

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.450 
bit more summery but if you weren't with
black<00:06:25.230> tights<00:06:25.470> I<00:06:25.740> think<00:06:26.010> it<00:06:26.100> would<00:06:26.190> still<00:06:26.370> be

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
black tights I think it would still be

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.830 
black tights I think it would still be
fine<00:06:26.610> since<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:27.060> shoes<00:06:27.240> are<00:06:27.390> black<00:06:27.570> and<00:06:27.750> it

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
fine since the shoes are black and it

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.540 
fine since the shoes are black and it
would<00:06:27.960> blend<00:06:28.140> well<00:06:28.410> or<00:06:28.920> you<00:06:29.130> could<00:06:29.280> just<00:06:29.310> wear

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
would blend well or you could just wear

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.060 
would blend well or you could just wear
like<00:06:29.730> a<00:06:29.910> plain<00:06:30.210> black<00:06:30.600> flat<00:06:31.080> or<00:06:31.410> anything<00:06:31.740> like

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
like a plain black flat or anything like

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.370 
like a plain black flat or anything like
that<00:06:32.130> would<00:06:32.550> match<00:06:32.760> really<00:06:33.060> good<00:06:33.330> so<00:06:33.930> she<00:06:33.990> had

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
that would match really good so she had

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.200 
that would match really good so she had
on<00:06:34.500> a<00:06:34.530> chocolate<00:06:35.160> brown<00:06:35.370> bag<00:06:35.640> in<00:06:35.850> the<00:06:35.940> picture

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
on a chocolate brown bag in the picture

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.300 
on a chocolate brown bag in the picture
it<00:06:36.330> was<00:06:36.420> basically<00:06:36.750> this<00:06:37.050> size<00:06:37.290> and<00:06:37.590> this<00:06:38.070> is

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
it was basically this size and this is

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.890 
it was basically this size and this is
the<00:06:38.460> darkest<00:06:38.820> brown<00:06:39.030> bag<00:06:39.240> that<00:06:39.450> I<00:06:39.480> own<00:06:39.660> and

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
the darkest brown bag that I own and

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.360 
the darkest brown bag that I own and
it's<00:06:40.020> just<00:06:40.170> from<00:06:40.320> Target<00:06:40.710> actually<00:06:41.130> recently

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
it's just from Target actually recently

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.550 
it's just from Target actually recently
got<00:06:41.670> it<00:06:42.030> and<00:06:42.510> so<00:06:42.750> this<00:06:42.870> is<00:06:42.930> what<00:06:43.170> it<00:06:43.260> looks<00:06:43.410> like

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
got it and so this is what it looks like

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.440 
got it and so this is what it looks like
it's<00:06:43.680> from<00:06:43.770> Target<00:06:44.070> online<00:06:44.640> and<00:06:45.120> I<00:06:45.240> really

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
it's from Target online and I really

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.180 
it's from Target online and I really
like<00:06:45.690> it<00:06:45.870> and<00:06:45.960> I<00:06:46.050> think<00:06:46.080> it's<00:06:46.470> kind<00:06:46.950> of<00:06:46.980> one<00:06:47.160> of

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
like it and I think it's kind of one of

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.410 
like it and I think it's kind of one of
those<00:06:47.340> bags<00:06:47.580> that<00:06:47.760> matches<00:06:48.120> with<00:06:48.240> everything

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
those bags that matches with everything

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.180 
those bags that matches with everything
so<00:06:49.080> I<00:06:49.140> think<00:06:49.200> that<00:06:49.470> that<00:06:49.620> kind<00:06:49.830> of<00:06:49.920> ties

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
so I think that that kind of ties

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.130 
so I think that that kind of ties
together<00:06:50.460> the<00:06:50.670> whole<00:06:50.970> look<00:06:51.240> and<00:06:51.570> that<00:06:51.870> it

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140 
together the whole look and that it

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.690 
together the whole look and that it
matches<00:06:52.320> even<00:06:52.800> though<00:06:52.920> this<00:06:53.100> is<00:06:53.220> black<00:06:53.460> and

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
matches even though this is black and

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.340 
matches even though this is black and
the<00:06:54.120> bag<00:06:54.300> is<00:06:54.330> brown<00:06:54.600> I<00:06:54.630> feel<00:06:54.960> like<00:06:55.050> it<00:06:55.170> still

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
the bag is brown I feel like it still

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.410 
the bag is brown I feel like it still
kind<00:06:55.560> of<00:06:55.620> brings<00:06:55.830> the<00:06:55.950> outfit<00:06:56.400> together<00:06:56.610> okay

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
kind of brings the outfit together okay

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.240 
kind of brings the outfit together okay
so<00:06:57.480> here's<00:06:57.780> a<00:06:57.840> pretty<00:06:58.110> full<00:06:58.500> look<00:06:58.830> at<00:06:59.040> the
