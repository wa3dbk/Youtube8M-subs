00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.110 
this is a nice feature for two reasons
one<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.110> creates<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.530> ski/walk<00:02:21.890> feature<00:02:22.120> for

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
one is it creates a ski/walk feature for

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.700 
one is it creates a ski/walk feature for
