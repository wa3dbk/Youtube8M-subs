00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
enough to say that a lot of times in

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
enough to say that a lot of times in
Bollywood<00:01:30.810> actresses<00:01:31.590> where<00:01:31.860> Western<00:01:32.280> Cloud

Bollywood actresses where Western Cloud

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.670 
Bollywood actresses where Western Cloud
fits<00:01:32.880> outside<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> theme<00:01:34.380> has

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
fits outside because it the theme has

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.740 
fits outside because it the theme has
become<00:01:35.100> such<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.549> know<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.180> truth<00:01:36.420> or<00:01:36.600> do

become such you know is the truth or do

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.240 
become such you know is the truth or do
you<00:01:36.840> feel<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.320> break<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.159> know

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you feel like we break and you know

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.800 
you feel like we break and you know
we're<00:01:38.430> more<00:01:38.579> Indian<00:01:38.850> close<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> parties

we're more Indian close out to parties

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.090 
we're more Indian close out to parties
now<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.409> she<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.740> wear

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
now I think it's not that she can wear

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.700 
now I think it's not that she can wear
entire<00:01:44.520> lynchin<00:01:44.939> clothes<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:46.259> can

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
entire lynchin clothes but you can

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.130 
entire lynchin clothes but you can
definitely<00:01:47.369> mix<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:48.000> up<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.930> bit
