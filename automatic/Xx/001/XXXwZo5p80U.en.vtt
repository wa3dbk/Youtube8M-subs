00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330

his<00:02:56.540> performance<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.410> can't<00:02:57.650> believe<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:58.520> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
his performance I can't believe it's the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.400 
his performance I can't believe it's the
same<00:02:58.760> guy<00:02:59.090> who<00:02:59.150> played<00:02:59.420> Jackie<00:02:59.660> Robinson<00:03:00.290> in

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
same guy who played Jackie Robinson in

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.370 
same guy who played Jackie Robinson in
42<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.310> he<00:03:01.520> was<00:03:01.670> very<00:03:01.819> good<00:03:02.030> in<00:03:02.180> 42<00:03:02.720> but<00:03:03.230> this

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
42 and he was very good in 42 but this

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.790 
42 and he was very good in 42 but this
is<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.590> whole<00:03:03.830> new<00:03:04.040> level<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:04.940> acting<00:03:05.450> -<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.560> mean

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
is a whole new level of acting - I mean

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.320 
is a whole new level of acting - I mean
Jackie<00:03:07.069> Robinson<00:03:07.670> was<00:03:07.760> more<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.030> guess<00:03:08.239> you

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
Jackie Robinson was more I guess you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.990 
Jackie Robinson was more I guess you
could<00:03:08.480> say<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.140> normal<00:03:09.560> individual<00:03:10.250> faced

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
could say of a normal individual faced

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.210 
could say of a normal individual faced
with<00:03:11.209> extraordinary<00:03:12.010> circumstances<00:03:13.010> but

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
with extraordinary circumstances but

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.770 
with extraordinary circumstances but
here<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.489> clearly<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:13.940> an<00:03:14.120> extraordinary

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
here you clearly have an extraordinary

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.259 
here you clearly have an extraordinary
individual<00:03:15.549> faced<00:03:16.549> with<00:03:16.730> extraordinary

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
individual faced with extraordinary

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.960 
individual faced with extraordinary
circumstances<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.319> like<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:19.549> about<00:03:19.819> the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
circumstances and I like that about the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.370 
circumstances and I like that about the
film<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.330> like<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.900> doesn't<00:03:21.049> shy<00:03:21.350> away

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
film I like that it doesn't shy away

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.759 
film I like that it doesn't shy away
from<00:03:21.819> James<00:03:22.819> Brown's<00:03:23.530> eccentricities<00:03:24.530> I

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
from James Brown's eccentricities I

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.320 
from James Brown's eccentricities I
think<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.280> would<00:03:25.370> be<00:03:25.489> easy<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.910> say<00:03:26.060> oh<00:03:26.090> that

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
think it would be easy to say oh that

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.870 
think it would be easy to say oh that
was<00:03:26.450> just<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.750> stage<00:03:27.049> persona<00:03:27.560> he<00:03:28.430> really<00:03:28.700> was

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
was just a stage persona he really was

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.300 
was just a stage persona he really was
you<00:03:29.390> know<00:03:29.420> just<00:03:30.140> like<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.160> instead

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
you know just like you but instead

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.860 
you know just like you but instead
they're<00:03:31.610> like<00:03:31.730> no<00:03:31.910> James<00:03:32.269> Brown<00:03:32.510> was<00:03:32.540> like

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
they're like no James Brown was like

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.449 
they're like no James Brown was like
this<00:03:33.049> on<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.440> off<00:03:33.560> stage<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.190> that's<00:03:34.250> what

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
this on and off stage and that's what

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.750 
this on and off stage and that's what
made<00:03:34.610> him<00:03:34.700> special<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.420> unique<00:03:35.720> however
