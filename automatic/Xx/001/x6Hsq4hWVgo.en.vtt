hey guys tiny Tom Logan back with

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.279 
hey guys tiny Tom Logan back with
another<00:00:16.949> video<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.630> my<00:00:18.630> name<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.960> oh<00:00:19.080> just

another video for you my name is oh just
outside<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> window<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.130> think<00:00:20.369> they're

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
outside the window so I think they're

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.939 
outside the window so I think they're
gonna<00:00:20.670> think<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.060> mental<00:00:21.539> but<00:00:21.869> maybe<00:00:22.710> that's

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
gonna think I'm mental but maybe that's

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.890 
gonna think I'm mental but maybe that's
because<00:00:23.130> i<00:00:23.369> am<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:23.760> anyway<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.510> we've<00:00:24.689> already

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
because i am now anyway so we've already

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.490 
because i am now anyway so we've already
taken<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.500> look<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> x<00:00:26.160> 99<00:00:26.640> deluxe<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.500> like

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
taken a look at the x 99 deluxe and like

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.050 
taken a look at the x 99 deluxe and like
i<00:00:28.680> said<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:29.160> probably<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
i said it's probably one of the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 
i said it's probably one of the
prettiest<00:00:30.689> boards<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.410> i've<00:00:31.500> seen<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.099> far

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
prettiest boards that i've seen so far

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
prettiest boards that i've seen so far
and<00:00:32.640> I've<00:00:33.000> seen<00:00:33.270> pictures<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:34.020> pretty<00:00:34.290> much

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
and I've seen pictures from pretty much

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.900 
and I've seen pictures from pretty much
every<00:00:34.649> manufacturer<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> one

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
every manufacturer and this is the one

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.209 
every manufacturer and this is the one
that's<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.180> stuck<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.660> teeth<00:00:36.860> but<00:00:37.860> what

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that's really stuck in my teeth but what

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.760 
that's really stuck in my teeth but what
I<00:00:38.250> did<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.790> recently<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.930> away<00:00:40.620> in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
I did do recently when I was away in

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.830 
I did do recently when I was away in
London<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> look<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.300> x99

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
London to have a look at all the x99

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.190 
London to have a look at all the x99
boards<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.309> did<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.610> some<00:00:44.820> bear<00:00:45.180> PCB<00:00:45.930> ones

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
boards was it did see some bear PCB ones

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.319 
boards was it did see some bear PCB ones
and<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.500> might<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:48.200> possibly<00:00:49.200> may<00:00:49.530> be

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
and I might have just possibly may be

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.850 
and I might have just possibly may be
removed<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.820> essentially<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
removed one so this is essentially a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.439 
removed one so this is essentially a
completely<00:00:55.860> naked<00:00:57.230> PCB<00:00:58.489> for<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> x<00:00:59.760> 99<00:01:00.059> deluxe

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
completely naked PCB for the x 99 deluxe

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.639 
completely naked PCB for the x 99 deluxe
know<00:01:00.629> essentially<00:01:00.989> what's<00:01:01.260> happened<00:01:01.590> as

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
know essentially what's happened as

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.229 
know essentially what's happened as
they've<00:01:01.800> taken<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.280> off<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> production

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
they've taken this off of the production

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
they've taken this off of the production
line<00:01:03.270> before<00:01:03.989> they've<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.500> anything<00:01:04.920> on

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
line before they've put anything on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.880 
line before they've put anything on
there<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.630> silicon<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there is just the the silicon and the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
there is just the the silicon and the
copper<00:01:08.189> trials<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.760> everything<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.750> i<00:01:09.780> find

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
copper trials and everything now i find

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.050 
copper trials and everything now i find
this<00:01:10.500> type<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> stuff<00:01:11.010> personally<00:01:11.430> quite

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
this type of stuff personally quite

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.570 
this type of stuff personally quite
fascinating<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:12.930> i<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.500> love<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.400> see

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
fascinating because i just love to see

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.179 
fascinating because i just love to see
the<00:01:14.760> intricate<00:01:15.390> pneus<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:16.049> these<00:01:16.560> before<00:01:16.770> they

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the intricate pneus of these before they

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.179 
the intricate pneus of these before they
get<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.500> components<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.040> then

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
get all the components and then

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.700 
get all the components and then
obviously<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.299> matte<00:01:21.720> black<00:01:21.990> film<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.560> get

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
obviously the matte black film to get

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.609 
obviously the matte black film to get
rid<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.860> all<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> copper<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.610> everything<00:01:24.619> so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
rid of all that copper and everything so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.460 
rid of all that copper and everything so
I<00:01:25.890> thought<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> lot<00:01:27.960> would<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
I thought you lot would like to have a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.390 
I thought you lot would like to have a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
literally is just going to be a look

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
literally is just going to be a look
around<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> look<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.540> bit

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
around it we can have a look at this bit

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.390 
around it we can have a look at this bit
you<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.560> mean<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.100> look<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.369> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you know I mean we can have a look at it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.359 
you know I mean we can have a look at it
we'll<00:01:36.060> look<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> other<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.689> around<00:01:37.369> also

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
we'll look at the other way around also

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.840 
we'll look at the other way around also
you<00:01:38.939> get<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.770> naked<00:01:41.340> asus

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
you get to see the the naked asus

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
you get to see the the naked asus
overclocked<00:01:42.420> socket<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.079> all<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> extra

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
overclocked socket with all the extra

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.060 
overclocked socket with all the extra
pins<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.369> well<00:01:45.200> but<00:01:46.200> don't<00:01:46.530> forget<00:01:46.710> if

pins in it as well but don't forget if

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.789 
pins in it as well but don't forget if
you<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.930> have<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.500> in

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you want to have a look at this in

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.020 
you want to have a look at this in
detail<00:01:50.659> then<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.079> pause<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.030> what

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
detail then you can just pause and what

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.370 
detail then you can just pause and what
you<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.659> way<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:55.020> we'll<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.320> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you can do it that way what we'll do is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.109 
you can do it that way what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:55.530> zoom<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.280> let<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> get<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> better

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
we'll zoom in just let you get a better

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
look I'm going to try and keep the light

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.709 
look I'm going to try and keep the light
from<00:01:59.460> reflecting<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.299> much<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.509> I

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
from reflecting on it as much as I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.530 
from reflecting on it as much as I
possibly<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.369> then<00:02:02.909> obviously<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
possibly can and then obviously up this

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.980 
possibly can and then obviously up this
area<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.290> your<00:02:04.560> IO<00:02:04.710> area<00:02:05.689> these<00:02:06.689> will<00:02:06.869> be

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
area is here your IO area these will be

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.529 
area is here your IO area these will be
like<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.350> MOSFETs<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.819> here<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.420> is

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
like little MOSFETs down here this is

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.170 
like little MOSFETs down here this is
quite<00:02:09.780> close<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> RAM<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.830> you've<00:02:10.950> got

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
quite close to the RAM and you've got

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.520 
quite close to the RAM and you've got
the<00:02:11.269> cover<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:11.780> goes<00:02:11.930> over<00:02:12.079> this<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:12.439> you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the cover that goes over this so you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.030 
the cover that goes over this so you
won't<00:02:12.680> see<00:02:12.859> it<00:02:13.129> if<00:02:13.969> we<00:02:14.090> go<00:02:14.239> around<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.629> way

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
won't see it if we go around this way

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.500 
won't see it if we go around this way
you've<00:02:16.040> got<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.250> MOSFETs<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.239> chokes

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
you've got the MOSFETs and the chokes

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.990 
you've got the MOSFETs and the chokes
and<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.959> caps<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.469> everything<00:02:18.829> for<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.730> top

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and the caps and everything for the top

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
and the caps and everything for the top
this<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.510> your<00:02:20.689> 8<00:02:20.840> pin<00:02:21.230> cable<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.099> is<00:02:22.219> your

this is your 8 pin cable this is your
fan<00:02:22.730> connectors<00:02:23.269> up<00:02:23.480> here<00:02:23.689> obviously<00:02:24.319> we've

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
fan connectors up here obviously we've

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.990 
fan connectors up here obviously we've
got<00:02:25.189> the<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.670> deer<00:02:25.939> am<00:02:26.209> down<00:02:26.569> both<00:02:26.840> sides<00:02:28.000> this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
got the the deer am down both sides this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.479 
got the the deer am down both sides this
is<00:02:29.150> where<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:29.510> x99<00:02:30.349> chipset<00:02:32.290> sit<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:34.340> have

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
is where the x99 chipset sit you have

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.940 
is where the x99 chipset sit you have
all<00:02:34.639> your<00:02:34.819> Satan<00:02:35.299> memory<00:02:35.629> down<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:36.260> these

all your Satan memory down here these

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.089 
all your Satan memory down here these

let me keep this there that kind of like

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.580 
let me keep this there that kind of like
funny<00:03:01.400> about<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.989> but<00:03:02.989> then<00:03:03.109> we've<00:03:03.200> got<00:03:03.230> round

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
funny about it but then we've got round

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.289 
funny about it but then we've got round
the<00:03:03.680> back<00:03:03.859> of<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.040> board<00:03:04.189> again<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:05.000> wouldn't

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
the back of the board again you wouldn't

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.750 
the back of the board again you wouldn't
normally<00:03:05.419> get<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.810> see<00:03:05.959> this<00:03:06.739> much<00:03:07.069> copper<00:03:07.609> it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
normally get to see this much copper it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.250 
normally get to see this much copper it
would<00:03:07.849> normally<00:03:07.969> be<00:03:08.180> coated<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:08.900> everything

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
would normally be coated and everything

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.490 
would normally be coated and everything
as<00:03:09.379> well<00:03:10.569> like<00:03:11.569> I<00:03:11.689> said<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.930> just<00:03:12.139> find<00:03:12.349> it

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
as well like I said I just find it

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.539 
as well like I said I just find it
personally<00:03:14.169> fascinating<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> point

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
personally fascinating to the point

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.569 
personally fascinating to the point
where<00:03:16.729> I<00:03:16.970> thought<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.659> would<00:03:17.900> share<00:03:18.169> my<00:03:18.579> nerdy

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
where I thought I would share my nerdy

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:32.660 
where I thought I would share my nerdy
joy<00:03:20.859> with<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:21.889> guys

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.160 

so<00:03:33.510> there<00:03:34.020> we<00:03:34.200> go<00:03:35.569> you've<00:03:36.569> seen<00:03:36.840> something

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
so there we go you've seen something

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.440 
so there we go you've seen something
that<00:03:37.770> not<00:03:38.010> many<00:03:38.250> people<00:03:38.550> will<00:03:39.000> ever<00:03:39.150> really

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
that not many people will ever really

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.540 
that not many people will ever really
get<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.930> see<00:03:40.140> but<00:03:40.620> I'd<00:03:40.770> like<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.250> said<00:03:41.430> I'd

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
get to see but I'd like I said I'd

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.190 
get to see but I'd like I said I'd
properly<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.360> I'd<00:03:42.510> love<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.900> turn<00:03:43.050> it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
properly like this I'd love to turn it

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.809 
properly like this I'd love to turn it
into<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.410> clock<00:03:43.739> or<00:03:43.770> something<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.520> go<00:03:44.640> on<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
into a clock or something it's go on the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.670 
into a clock or something it's go on the
wall<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> office<00:03:45.510> or<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.410> said<00:03:46.650> just

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
wall in the office or like I said just

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.740 
wall in the office or like I said just
in<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.069> nice<00:03:47.280> frame<00:03:47.790> maybe<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.209> should<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:48.480> not

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
in a nice frame maybe I should just not

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.740 
in a nice frame maybe I should just not
send<00:03:49.020> it<00:03:49.140> back<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.970> put<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.090> up<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.420> office

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
send it back and put it up in the office

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.600 
send it back and put it up in the office
I<00:03:51.959> think<00:03:52.890> they<00:03:52.980> think<00:03:53.190> I'm<00:03:53.310> going<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.489> like

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
I think they think I'm going to like

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.850 
I think they think I'm going to like
send<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.330> their<00:03:55.020> competitors<00:03:55.709> or

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
send it to their competitors or

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.470 
send it to their competitors or
something<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.489> mean<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.730> think<00:03:56.970> this<00:03:57.030> stupid

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
something and I mean I think this stupid

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.790 
something and I mean I think this stupid
all<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.930> keep<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.410> but<00:04:00.470> anyway<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:02.459> put<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.730> down

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
all to keep it but anyway we put it down

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.050 
all to keep it but anyway we put it down
