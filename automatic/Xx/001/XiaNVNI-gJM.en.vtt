 namely the model train and larches 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.070
 that's a little highlight because of me 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.780
 think that the modellbahnfreunde the in 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.940

 will be happy about it 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.449
 Of course this is a development 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.280
 now has news of last 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.379
 year we have for the trail 0 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.530

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.210
 brought as novelty and also the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.820
 lark to that one color the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.350
 start the system a bit 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.810
 can contribute color play with 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.090
 apropos farbspiel a very special 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.549
 color are, after all, also the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.950
 Mediterranean trees in any case that 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.330
 is something completely new this year 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.330
 last year with the cypresses 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:31.280
 starting the olive trees and the 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.509
 Lines are now in this year 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.150
 area the novelties 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.320
 I think that we are a whole new 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.810
 gone in 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.950
 now has southern european space 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.920
 China 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.909
 we promise some of that 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.829
 Last year, they also had one 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.960
 small highlight brought to the market 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.179
 they became quite autumnal though we did 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.009
 now as winter have how are you 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.509
 further on the autumnal rails 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.579
 we have this autumnal stand 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.560
 year our leaves bushes that's one 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.110
 smaller pack with smaller bits 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.270
 also suitable for a z and is something 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.640
 be cheaper wg large packs 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.890
 then there is another development in 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.969
 area city ​​annen 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.299
 yes, we have one too 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.890
 low priced parts are developing this 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.660
 flocked in two colors and then in the 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.989
 Both pack are delivered and then 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.120
 different sized fir trees in 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.269
 the pack trend for the very cheap 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.329
 price I have to imagine 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.340
 under the development of leaves floor 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.220
 weather corridor that is our proven 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.790
 material that is planned and very popular 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.150
 there are now the grazing green and 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.769
 pines green and there you can 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.480
 The trees themselves can be done as 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.130
 use ground cover and is one 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.500
 Supplement away action existing 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.420
 assortment deciduous trees autumnal and 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.970
 deciduous trees normally he also in 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.859
 you production program the track-wide 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.540
 there is the yes that is now for 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.880
 december we also brought something 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.829
 this year these are the trees in 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.750
 autumnal and in the green area 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.139
 now has eight pieces in the pack for 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.600
 the gauge z and yes, before we go now 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.069
 the novelties to finish with them is yes 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.000
 my little highlight at the booth of 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.590
 hacky the beautiful models you 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.690
 build which model do you have? 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.250
 This time this year we have something completely 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.700
 Other times we are away from the castles 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.220
 went 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.940
 We have copied these from the words 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.870
 Leave a very impressive building 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.410
 they will see it afterwards it would be one 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.660
 highlight 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.489
 It would certainly be wood in the bush now 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.829
 born of course to mention that 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.639
 all parts are from the house heeke are 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.139
 this dom is built how much 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.540
 Hours needed new 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.849
 staff there so this time 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.549
 he needed about 1300 hours 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.890
 May started under pressure 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.569
 set because it was something this time 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.329
 more work as he thought so 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.030
 had just finished it though 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.110
 Once again, it has worked quite well 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.680
 think that also an absolute eye-catcher 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.209
 on 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.409
 I told you a while ago 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.409
 We look forward to everytime we go here 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.150
 come if then this huge 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.430
 replica stands and say something he has 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.840
 this year again are the same 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.180
 Wish you the rest of the fair 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.469
 All the best, good business and me 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.000
