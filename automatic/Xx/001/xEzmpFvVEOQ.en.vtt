00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 the fact that the Slavs were drunkards is a myth 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.950
 it is scientifically proven 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.110
 for example the words vodka appeared quite 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.089
 Recently, vodka on piled herbal 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.710
 infusions on water and they were taken as 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.080
 healing drinks for what we call 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.630
 tea, while tea is not a word was 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.869
 called decoction 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 but when came 1 merchants to sell 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.830
 Alcohol on Russia they long thought and as 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.230
 name hard liquor and someone 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 God knows who came to mind is probably 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.500
 some kind of fields was served first 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.510
 came shopkeeper from Poland 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.629
 I think that they were not indigenous 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 the Poles and they said from the Slavs very 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.590
 is modern language brand words 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.050
 in the boat it is healing drinks 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.809
 let 's call here koneva to think that healing and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840
 so when the Slavs began to drink this one 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.780
 new boat they became the utmost suckers and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:13.890
