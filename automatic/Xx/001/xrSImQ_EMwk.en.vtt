00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.590 
over that it's going to refine the edge
of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> mask<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.490> me<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
of the mask for me and it's going to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
of the mask for me and it's going to
bring<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.320> little<00:01:43.680> bit<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.950> warmth<00:01:44.310> back

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
bring just a little bit of warmth back

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.700 
bring just a little bit of warmth back
right<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.140> take<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> look<00:01:46.560> at

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
right there and when we take a look at

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.920 
right there and when we take a look at
the<00:01:46.799> mask<00:01:47.009> again<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.880> done<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> great<00:01:48.450> job<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the mask again it's done a great job of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.410 
the mask again it's done a great job of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
transparency there as you can see with

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.789 
transparency there as you can see with
the<00:01:54.329> help<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> quick<00:01:54.899> mask<00:01:55.110> tool<00:01:55.530> it's

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the help of the quick mask tool it's

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.380 
the help of the quick mask tool it's
going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> lot<00:01:56.670> easier<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.119> faster

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
going to be a lot easier and faster
