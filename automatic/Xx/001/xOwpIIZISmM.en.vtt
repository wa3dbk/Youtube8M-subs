00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
and this is Mike's first experience with

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.810 
and this is Mike's first experience with
one<00:00:17.689> so<00:00:17.930> I<00:00:18.279> didn't<00:00:19.279> really<00:00:19.460> know<00:00:19.579> what<00:00:19.789> to

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
one so I didn't really know what to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.729 
one so I didn't really know what to
expect<00:00:20.329> so<00:00:20.449> this<00:00:20.749> might<00:00:20.960> be<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.169> little<00:00:21.470> bit<00:00:21.650> on

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:21.739 
expect so this might be a little bit on

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.439 
expect so this might be a little bit on
the<00:00:21.859> vague<00:00:22.039> side<00:00:22.339> but<00:00:22.849> pretty<00:00:23.089> much<00:00:23.239> I've<00:00:23.419> been

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
the vague side but pretty much I've been

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.499 
the vague side but pretty much I've been
using<00:00:23.749> it<00:00:24.019> for<00:00:24.069> being<00:00:25.069> 3<00:00:25.999> months<00:00:26.239> now<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:26.630> I<00:00:27.560> am

using it for being 3 months now and I am

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.579 
using it for being 3 months now and I am
NOT<00:00:29.509> on<00:00:29.659> the<00:00:29.689> fence<00:00:29.989> about<00:00:30.140> it

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
NOT on the fence about it

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.920 
NOT on the fence about it
I<00:00:30.619> understand<00:00:31.519> what<00:00:31.699> it's<00:00:31.819> meant<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.090> do<00:00:32.329> but

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
I understand what it's meant to do but

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.630 
I understand what it's meant to do but
it's<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:33.350> different<00:00:33.649> from<00:00:33.950> any<00:00:34.130> other<00:00:34.309> shampoo

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
it's so different from any other shampoo

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.920 
it's so different from any other shampoo
that<00:00:34.789> I've<00:00:34.910> ever<00:00:35.000> tried<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:35.359> I<00:00:35.660> can't

necessarily<00:00:36.050> say<00:00:36.800> that<00:00:37.309> it's<00:00:37.430> good<00:00:37.640> or<00:00:37.760> bad

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
necessarily say that it's good or bad

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.130 
necessarily say that it's good or bad
what<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:38.690> can<00:00:39.500> say<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:40.730> it<00:00:41.000> does<00:00:41.600> what<00:00:41.989> it's

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
what I can say is that it does what it's

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.470 
what I can say is that it does what it's
supposed<00:00:42.199> to<00:00:42.890> which<00:00:43.579> is<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:43.969> supposed<00:00:44.239> to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
week to a week and a half basis so I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.500 
week to a week and a half basis so I
have<00:01:08.930> used<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:09.320> probably<00:01:10.480> every<00:01:11.480> single

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
have used this probably every single

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.850 
have used this probably every single
time<00:01:11.900> for<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.140> last<00:01:12.260> three<00:01:12.440> months<00:01:12.500> with<00:01:12.800> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
time for the last three months with the

exception<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.250> two<00:01:13.400> times<00:01:13.610> when<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:13.820> wore<00:01:13.970> my

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
exception of two times when I wore my

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.630 
exception of two times when I wore my
hair<00:01:14.270> curly<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.890> had<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.160> wash<00:01:16.310> my<00:01:16.490> hair

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
hair curly and I had to wash my hair

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.160 
hair curly and I had to wash my hair
more<00:01:16.850> frequently<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:17.540> therefore<00:01:17.840> I<00:01:17.900> couldn't

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
more frequently and therefore I couldn't

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
more frequently and therefore I couldn't
use<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:20.210> is<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.390> very<00:01:20.960> drying<00:01:21.530> shampoo

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
use this but it is a very drying shampoo

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.250 
use this but it is a very drying shampoo
so<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.640> have<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.090> be<00:01:23.270> warned<00:01:23.720> when<00:01:23.810> using<00:01:24.140> this

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
so you have to be warned when using this

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.050 
so you have to be warned when using this
I<00:01:24.410> would<00:01:24.560> suggest<00:01:24.710> using<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.280> hair<00:01:25.550> mask<00:01:25.760> or

I would suggest using a hair mask or

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
necessarily need lather to get a good

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.300 
necessarily need lather to get a good
clean<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.570> guys<00:03:40.720> know<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.980> yeah<00:03:42.100> it's

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
clean just so you guys know so yeah it's

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.520 
clean just so you guys know so yeah it's
a<00:03:42.400> very<00:03:42.430> drying<00:03:42.820> shampoo<00:03:43.450> it's<00:03:43.930> does<00:03:44.290> its<00:03:44.440> job

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
a very drying shampoo it's does its job

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.830 
a very drying shampoo it's does its job
because<00:03:44.829> when<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.670> use<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.030> into<00:03:46.299> conjunction

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
because when I use this into conjunction

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.039 
because when I use this into conjunction
with<00:03:46.989> moisturizing<00:03:47.500> conditioner<00:03:48.390> say<00:03:49.390> this

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
with moisturizing conditioner say this

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.610 
with moisturizing conditioner say this
one<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.440> find<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.400> yeah<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.660> lot<00:03:52.930> drier

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
one I find that yeah it is a lot drier

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.430 
one I find that yeah it is a lot drier
but<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.040> feel<00:03:54.310> like<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.790> moisture<00:03:55.239> has<00:03:55.290> sunk<00:03:56.290> in

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
but I feel like the moisture has sunk in

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.250 
but I feel like the moisture has sunk in
a<00:03:56.530> lot<00:03:56.709> faster<00:03:57.310> then<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.420> would<00:03:58.690> have<00:03:58.870> had<00:03:59.230> I

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
a lot faster then it would have had I

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.530 
a lot faster then it would have had I
not<00:03:59.709> use<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:00.250> clarifying<00:04:00.730> shampoo<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.510> I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
not use this clarifying shampoo so I

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.390 
not use this clarifying shampoo so I
would<00:04:01.690> suggest<00:04:01.810> this<00:04:02.200> for<00:04:02.260> anyone<00:04:02.769> who<00:04:03.070> uses

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
would suggest this for anyone who uses

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.880 
would suggest this for anyone who uses
silicone<00:04:04.090> based<00:04:04.329> products<00:04:04.780> like<00:04:05.350> Moroccan

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
silicone based products like Moroccan

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.819 
silicone based products like Moroccan
oil<00:04:06.239> because<00:04:07.239> although<00:04:07.690> Moroccan<00:04:08.380> oil<00:04:08.530> is

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
oil because although Moroccan oil is

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.420 
oil because although Moroccan oil is
sold<00:04:09.640> as<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.720> argan<00:04:11.290> product<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:11.829> actually<00:04:12.400> a

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
sold as a argan product it's actually a

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.849 
sold as a argan product it's actually a
silicone<00:04:12.910> based<00:04:13.150> product<00:04:13.480> with<00:04:13.780> argan<00:04:14.410> in<00:04:14.620> it

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
silicone based product with argan in it

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.610 
silicone based product with argan in it
so<00:04:15.340> its<00:04:15.970> main<00:04:16.919> fighter<00:04:17.919> or<00:04:18.430> working-age

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
so its main fighter or working-age

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.099 
so its main fighter or working-age
and<00:04:19.680> in<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.250> actually<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.209> silicone<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:22.019> if

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
and in it is actually the silicone so if

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.480 
and in it is actually the silicone so if
you<00:04:22.169> use<00:04:22.320> too<00:04:22.500> much<00:04:22.530> of<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:23.070> does<00:04:23.250> build

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
you use too much of that that does build

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.159 
you use too much of that that does build
up<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:23.880> prevents<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.389> actual<00:04:24.870> good

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
up and it prevents the actual good

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.530 
up and it prevents the actual good
products<00:04:25.620> from<00:04:25.800> doing<00:04:26.340> good<00:04:26.550> work<00:04:27.030> on<00:04:27.330> your

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
products from doing good work on your

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.629 
products from doing good work on your
hair<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.350> order<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.800> make<00:04:29.070> sure<00:04:29.100> that<00:04:29.460> when

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
hair so in order to make sure that when

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.879 
hair so in order to make sure that when
you<00:04:29.760> do<00:04:29.970> go<00:04:30.210> in<00:04:30.389> for<00:04:30.630> your<00:04:30.780> conditioner<00:04:31.350> that

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
you do go in for your conditioner that

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.439 
you do go in for your conditioner that
it's<00:04:32.190> actually<00:04:32.610> doing<00:04:32.790> its<00:04:32.880> job<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.270> might

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
it's actually doing its job you might

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.939 
it's actually doing its job you might
want<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.810> invest<00:04:34.229> in<00:04:34.410> something<00:04:34.590> like<00:04:34.680> this

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
want to invest in something like this

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.040 
want to invest in something like this
this<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.610> think<00:04:35.669> was<00:04:36.090> 16<00:04:36.510> dollars<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:36.900> don't

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
this I think was 16 dollars I don't

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.360 
this I think was 16 dollars I don't
remember<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.410> it's<00:04:37.500> really<00:04:37.650> expensive<00:04:37.860> I'm

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
remember so it's really expensive I'm

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.500 
remember so it's really expensive I'm
pretty<00:04:38.580> sure<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:38.850> can<00:04:39.000> find<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.479> cheaper

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
pretty sure you can find a cheaper

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.930 
pretty sure you can find a cheaper
clarifying<00:04:40.350> shampoo<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:41.280> smells<00:04:41.639> much

clarifying shampoo that smells much

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.370 
clarifying shampoo that smells much
better<00:04:42.290> and<00:04:44.360> maybe<00:04:45.360> lathers<00:04:45.990> if<00:04:46.229> you're

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380

looking for that but as I said it's

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.210 
looking for that but as I said it's
gonna<00:04:49.229> be<00:04:49.320> one<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.530> those<00:04:49.650> reviews<00:04:50.040> where<00:04:50.190> I
