00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.330
 with the name of this car occurred 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.680
 an amusing story in the west he is known 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.710
 under the name of patriot we have a little earlier this 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.269
 name staked out one domestic 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.030
 SUV so the jeep had to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.149
 renaming your car 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.509
 in liberty today it is the most compact 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 representatives of the American brand on 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.289
 Russian market however looking at 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.199
 car is hard to guess 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.410
 this is what the external similarity with 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.410
 older jeeps that give out 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.550
 chopped like an ax 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 body shape and famous 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.119
 radiator grille family from 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.269
 vertical cuts generally behind 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.260
 an account of courageous design is already 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.240
 rather looks like an armored car rather than 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.970
 on a civilian car this version 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.330
 liberty came to Russia just a few 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.350
 months ago she almost didnâ€™t 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.560
 changed but inside the SUV 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.080
 his salon has noticeably changed 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.750
 more modern decoration and ornate 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.409
 finish 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.589
 even the plastic on the front has become 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.649
 commercial pity just hands off 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.839
 Americans did not reach all such as sled 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.969
 chairs still looks somewhat 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.549
 unpresentable but they themselves 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.630
 great comfortable 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.439
 the nave is that rare 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.240
 comes with a little liter 8 and 4 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.390
 two-cylinder engine 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.649
 four tenths of a liter 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.789
 modesty decorates his 170 better not 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.189
 Allow to accelerate quickly spending at 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.270
 this is a fairly moderate amount 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.849
 gasoline 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.989
 so for 100 kilometers it consumes 

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:27.749
 about 15 liters of fuel is interesting 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.429
 also that liberty is supplied 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.089
 unconventional automatic 

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:33.099
 CVT therefore overclocking is not 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:34.939
 accompanied by jerks in the transmission 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.099
 the car picks up progress logically and 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.009
 predictable so take advantage 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.769
 manual shift mode 

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:41.979
 reluctance does not even occur 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.899
 for example everything is done on the platform 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.869
 ordinary car therefore 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.979
 handling is quite passenger 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.539
 clear response to taxiing and small 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.850
 rolls however rainbow overall 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.259
 picture spoils not high enough 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.189
 smoothness of the brakes too 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.109
 claims further consider that 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.319
 the car slows down not enough and then 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.979
 suddenly the wheels strive to drop sharply in the EU 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.200
 well at least this thing stops 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.399
 anti-lock system despite 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.379
 no downshift 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.940
 and wheel lock sword 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.909
 car still does not pass before 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.660
 lenders, however, until the end find out it 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.579
 opportunities we did not become all the same 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.720
 somewhat confused variator from the first 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.370
 glance and connoisseur amateur understandable 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.500
 a real jeep without fools 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.590
 Is that the front bumper is too heavy 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.850
 just the same granite jaw however 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.420
 be alone all the more such hint at 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.750
 American charisma
