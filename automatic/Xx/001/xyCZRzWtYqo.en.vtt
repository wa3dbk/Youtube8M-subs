00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:17.520
Released transcript: I have been reflecting deeply about my presidency
and about the forty years in which my life

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:32.730
has been inextricably bound to FIFA and the
great sport of football.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:46.140
I cherish FIFA more than anything and I want
to do only what is best for FIFA and for football.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.359
I felt compelled to stand for re-election,
as I believed that this was the best thing

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:10.940
for the organisation. That election is over
but FIFA’s challenges are not. FIFA needs

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.180
a profound overhaul.
While I have a mandate from the membership

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:31.430
of FIFA, I do not feel that I have a mandate
from the entire world of football – the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:41.030
fans, the players, the clubs, the people who
live, breathe and love football as much as

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:52.140
we

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.960
all do at FIFA.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:08.249
Therefore, I have decided to lay down my mandate
at an extraordinary elective Congress. I will

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:17.870
continue to exercise my functions as FIFA
President until that election. The next ordinary

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:30.379
FIFA Congress will take place on 13 May 2016
in Mexico City.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:40.569
This would create unnecessary delay and I
will urge the Executive Committee to organise

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.280
an Extraordinary Congress for the election
of my successor at the earliest opportunity.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.209
This will need to be done in line with FIFA’s
statutes and we must allow enough time for

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:03.900
the best candidates to present themselves
and to campaign.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:15.629
Since I shall not be a candidate, and am therefore
now free from the constraints that elections

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:31.090
inevitably impose, I shall be able to focus
on driving far-reaching, fundamental reforms

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.499
that transcend our previous efforts. For years,
we have worked hard to put in place administrative

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:46.669
reforms, but it is plain to me that while
these must continue, they are not enough.

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:57.559
The Executive Committee includes representatives
of confederations over whom we have no control,

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:07.349
but for whose actions FIFA is held responsible.
We need deep-rooted structural change. The

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:18.750
size of the Executive Committee must be reduced
and its members should be elected through

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.620
the FIFA Congress.
The integrity checks for all Executive Committee

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.550
members must be organised centrally through
FIFA and not through the confederations. We

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:45.330
need term limits not only for the president
but for all members of the Executive Committee.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:53.629
I have fought for these changes before and,
as everyone knows, my efforts have been blocked.

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.560
This time, I will succeed.
I cannot do this alone. I have asked Domenico

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:13.360
Scala to oversee the introduction and implementation
of these and other measures. Mr. Scala is

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.569
the Independent Chairman of our Audit and
Compliance Committee elected by the FIFA Congress.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:26.940
He is also the Chairman of the ad hoc Electoral
Committee and, as such, he will oversee the

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:34.569
election of my successor. Mr. Scala enjoys
the confidence of a wide range of constituents

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:44.400
within and outside of FIFA and has all the
knowledge and experience necessary to help

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.879
tackle these major reforms.
It is my deep care for FIFA and its interests,

00:05:51.879 --> 00:06:03.409
which I hold very dear, that has led me to
take this decision. I would like to thank

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:12.569
those who have always supported me in a constructive
and loyal manner as President of FIFA and

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.349
who have done so much for the game that we
all love.

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:26.819
What matters to me more than anything is that
when all of this is over, football is the

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:27.439
winner.
