00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
I mean I I tend to listen to melodic

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.300 
I mean I I tend to listen to melodic
symphonic<00:01:40.280> music<00:01:40.689> that<00:01:41.689> has<00:01:42.130> kind<00:01:43.130> of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
symphonic music that has kind of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.609 
symphonic music that has kind of
wandering<00:01:43.789> melodies<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:44.929> then<00:01:45.109> and<00:01:45.289> then<00:01:45.590> a

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
wandering melodies and then and then a

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.179 
wandering melodies and then and then a
theme<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:47.179> ties<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.600> all<00:01:47.659> together<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.380> that

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
theme that ties it all together so that

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.840 
theme that ties it all together so that
when<00:01:49.549> I'm<00:01:49.939> riding<00:01:50.810> over<00:01:51.310> chords<00:01:52.310> or<00:01:52.549> whatever

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
when I'm riding over chords or whatever

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.810 
when I'm riding over chords or whatever
I<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.659> tend<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.469> fish<00:01:54.799> a<00:01:54.829> little<00:01:55.130> bit<00:01:55.280> before<00:01:55.789> I

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
I I tend to fish a little bit before I

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.609 
I I tend to fish a little bit before I
ever<00:01:55.939> land<00:01:56.240> on<00:01:56.420> something<00:01:56.719> that<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.020> return<00:01:57.409> to

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
like a returning theme or course or a

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.719 
like a returning theme or course or a
