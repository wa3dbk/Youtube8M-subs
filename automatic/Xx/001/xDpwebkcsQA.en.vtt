you<00:01:51.740> go<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.009> track<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.430> learn<00:01:52.580> something

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
you go to the track you learn something

their<00:01:53.240> biggest<00:01:53.960> change<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:55.700> sort<00:01:55.940> of<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.149> code

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
their biggest change it sort of a code

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.449 
their biggest change it sort of a code
between<00:01:56.479> engine<00:01:57.110> much<00:01:57.590> higher<00:01:57.830> are<00:01:58.039> after<00:01:58.369> the

different chassis swinging up set up so

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.190 
different chassis swinging up set up so
and<00:02:04.580> they're<00:02:05.179> both<00:02:05.330> waiting<00:02:05.539> some<00:02:05.810> time<00:02:05.840> to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and they're both waiting some time to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.190 
and they're both waiting some time to
get<00:02:06.319> right<00:02:06.560> there's<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.250> lot<00:02:07.429> to<00:02:07.580> do<00:02:07.729> but<00:02:08.209> you

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
get right there's a lot to do but you

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.330 
get right there's a lot to do but you
know<00:02:09.229> at<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> end<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.800> day<00:02:09.920> we<00:02:10.039> expect

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
know at the end of the day we expect

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.410 
know at the end of the day we expect
this<00:02:10.429> part<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.759> be<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.849> lot<00:02:11.000> faster<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.390> a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
this part to be a lot faster in a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.449 
this part to be a lot faster in a
straight<00:02:11.450> line<00:02:11.660> last<00:02:12.110> year<00:02:12.290> save<00:02:13.220> us<00:02:13.340> some

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
straight line last year save us some

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.250 
straight line last year save us some
problems<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.060> things<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.420> work<00:02:14.569> through<00:02:14.870> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
problems and things to work through and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.600 
problems and things to work through and
there's<00:02:15.530> always<00:02:15.709> more<00:02:15.950> improvements<00:02:16.520> were

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
there's always more improvements were

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.820 
there's always more improvements were
made<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:17.750> will<00:02:17.900> never<00:02:18.050> start<00:02:18.380> developing

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
made so it will never start developing

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.370 
made so it will never start developing
their<00:02:18.920> by<00:02:19.130> for<00:02:19.340> tomorrow<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.000> think<00:02:20.180> so

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
their by for tomorrow and think so

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.770 
their by for tomorrow and think so
heading<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.830> TT<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:23.000> finally<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.540> find

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
heading for the TT you finally you find

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.540 
heading for the TT you finally you find
problems<00:02:24.230> we've<00:02:24.380> got<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.560> solve<00:02:24.830> them<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.490> you

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
problems we've got to solve them and you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.030 
problems we've got to solve them and you
get<00:02:25.760> there<00:02:26.000> things<00:02:26.780> only<00:02:26.990> ever<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.350> amplified

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
get there things only ever be amplified

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.950 
get there things only ever be amplified
and<00:02:28.210> because<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.300> bigger<00:02:29.480> than<00:02:29.660> what<00:02:29.720> they

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
and because it bigger than what they

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.720 
and because it bigger than what they
were<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.380> track<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:30.770> can<00:02:30.830> ignore<00:02:31.280> nor

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
were the track so you can ignore nor

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.670 
were the track so you can ignore nor
anithing<00:02:32.150> you've<00:02:32.300> gotta<00:02:32.510> leave<00:02:33.140> no<00:02:33.350> stone

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
anithing you've gotta leave no stone

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.220 
anithing you've gotta leave no stone
unturned<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:35.890> at<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.040> level<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.430> bikes<00:02:37.700> at

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
unturned so at the level this bikes at

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.390 
unturned so at the level this bikes at
and<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.440> early<00:02:39.710> in<00:02:39.800> development

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
and so early in development

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.670 
and so early in development
I<00:02:40.430> mean<00:02:40.730> Cody<00:02:41.090> would<00:02:41.300> be<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> dream<00:02:41.780> he's<00:02:42.500> very

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
I mean Cody would be a dream he's very

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.870 
I mean Cody would be a dream he's very
very<00:02:42.860> difficult<00:02:43.100> we're<00:02:43.430> up<00:02:43.490> against<00:02:43.760> some

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
very difficult we're up against some

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.240 
very difficult we're up against some
extremely<00:02:44.360> good<00:02:44.480> competition<00:02:45.040> but<00:02:46.040> we'll<00:02:46.130> be

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
extremely good competition but we'll be

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.290 
extremely good competition but we'll be
giving<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.640> hundred<00:02:46.790> percent

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
giving it a hundred percent

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.940 
giving it a hundred percent
and<00:02:47.390> we'll<00:02:47.540> see<00:02:47.750> where<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:47.990> leaves<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.500> as

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
and we'll see where that leaves this as

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.130 
and we'll see where that leaves this as
I<00:02:49.220> said<00:02:49.400> my<00:02:49.580> main<00:02:50.180> goal<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.690> be<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.930> top

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
I said my main goal is to be in the top

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.020 
I said my main goal is to be in the top
ten<00:02:51.350> practice<00:02:51.770> week<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.190> could<00:02:52.310> do<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.580> which

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
ten practice week we could do that which

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.420 
ten practice week we could do that which
I<00:02:53.120> think<00:02:53.300> are<00:02:53.420> required<00:02:53.750> probably<00:02:54.050> 128<00:02:54.710> mile

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
I think are required probably 128 mile

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.950 
I think are required probably 128 mile
an<00:02:55.550> hour<00:02:55.640> plus<00:02:55.880> laps<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.330> give<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.570> racket

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
an hour plus laps we give the racket

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960 
an hour plus laps we give the racket
this<00:02:57.050> week<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:58.190> would<00:02:58.310> be<00:02:58.490> a<00:02:58.520> brilliant

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
this week that would be a brilliant

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.430 
this week that would be a brilliant
beginning<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.600> TT<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.020> that's<00:03:00.200> all<00:03:00.350> I'm

beginning of the TT and that's all I'm

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.030 
beginning of the TT and that's all I'm
really<00:03:00.650> focusing<00:03:01.070> on<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> minor<00:03:01.520> no<00:03:02.150> results

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
really focusing on the minor no results

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.040 
really focusing on the minor no results
in<00:03:04.040> racing<00:03:04.430> agendas<00:03:04.820> focusing<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:05.480> being<00:03:05.960> on

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
in racing agendas focusing on being on

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
Ricardo's left onto practice I will get

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.360 
Ricardo's left onto practice I will get
to<00:03:08.990> practice<00:03:09.140> we<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.590> see<00:03:09.770> how<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:09.920> that

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
to practice we can see how that that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.920 
to practice we can see how that that
takes<00:03:10.610> us

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.989
