00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:09.120
 the two years of Jesus cast so much is 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.400
 just sells the belt 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:22.630
 what good that serves the god that freud 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:25.449
 limit who finds thinking where I am 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.160
 doctor loyal renata of the profession and today 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.929
 We'll talk a little priest 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.869
 doctor's view on the serious problem of 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.850
 eye health are the string of scenes and 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.630
 converted to the forefront of the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.910
 patience 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.310
 I decided to talk a little about the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.150
 problems she had started began 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.460
 problem 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.210
 it is unpleasant that he faced and how 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.210
 she is today 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.040
 the commitment that resembles a little 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.530
 You talk about you initially 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.629
 used contact lens is and in their 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.300
 zones register and contact lenses 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.730
 and you even had the care you 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.559
 do you consider appropriate so that these 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.040
 minds in the process a problem for you 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.650
 I had no cause that I work in 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.810
 store of plants so it would have to 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.360
 to be more careful with the mind I was not 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.820
 taking such care thing missing from 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.310
 time anyway at home wash your hands 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.970
 the well was not having some 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.210
 genius and all of a sudden my eye started 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.119
 so stay there playing in the red with 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.340
 a white spot in the center and 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:35.679
 aching and sensitive to quality and there was 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.450
 about a couple of days then I 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.130
 I decided to go and see a doctor I felt 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.259
 it was getting worse 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.470
 as if there was anything 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.250
 Strange in the eye to take brave washes 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.149
 cleaned it did not work 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.610
 he continued as if he had a body 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.470
 strange know this time was 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.170
 diagnosed you had an ulcer of 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.060
 how was it and was there a treatment 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.910
 with antibiotics 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.450
 my strong biological clock taken 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.590
 rabbit and even injections even if the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.450
 eye 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.280
 at that time when it was made 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.849
 diagnosis of the workshop 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.680
 stay 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.300
 There is no way to be sure about 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.640
 what kind of agent is causing this 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.069
 problem can be a bacteria can be 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.849
 a background can be a virus can be a 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.410
 amoeba 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.299
 then it was important at that time to 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.640
 send the owner cleonice to 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.110
 Paulo collected material to make a 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 culture exam 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.879
 the best laboratory in the country 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.530
 is in this world of things and see the 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.209
 really positive result for the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.040
 staphylococcus aureus bacterium 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.500
 but the cornea at that moment was already 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.630
 so harmed and although we had 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 made the appropriate treatment 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.010
 we were able to eradicate the infection 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.500
 there was no more pathogen in the cornea 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.019
 there is no more infection but the form 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.510
 stayed behind with a scar and 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.420
 blisters that generated pain in the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.610
 patient unfortunately she had to be 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.250
 undergoing surgery and today she is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.480
 free from infection and is now 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.310
 transparent 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.930
 there is a crime that refers to people who think 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.730
 that the contact lens that she came 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.799
 using were tight 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.260
 this is an important phase of suffering 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.079
 on the cornea and can carry a 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.180
 some micro- holes in the epithelium 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.639
 corneal that will give way to 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.829
 good microorganisms and that these serious 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:25.099
 microorganisms mounted last 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.739
 corneal instance to a scene as 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.780
 important example of the premise is the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.060
 people made the importance of 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.069
 a good adaptation of contact lenses 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.380
 case the patient needs to be 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.840
 use the mind always pass through a colleague 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.940
 who is an expert and who 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.989
 constant monitoring of adaptation 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.360
 of this lens 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.459
 but why it was only adapted today 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.239
 which in six months is still certain in the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.239
 half of that patient 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.680
 I'm afraid he'd tell us one 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.830
 How little are you feeling? 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.280
 now after your surgery, how are you? 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.100
 Your life is now great without pain. 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.440
 no information that my vision 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.120
 It's coming back like this every day I 'm 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.570
 realizing that the option is well 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.790
 better and our mother happy 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.080
 this was further clarification of the fact 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.720
 every year 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.930
 We hope to have helped viewers 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.180
 in the understanding because it is an ulcer 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.180
 horny and until next week
