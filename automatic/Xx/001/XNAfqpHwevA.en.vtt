00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 33 delete tattoos many are 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.069
 people who repent 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.330
 but with what techniques with which 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.089
 results 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 and why not with what costs I have 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.140
 started thinking they were something 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.289
 that reminded me of a strong first 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.000
 I mentioned it over 20 years ago 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.529
 only for a matter of fashion and therefore 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.990
 not thinking about what they are 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.300
 future consequences for someone are 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.250
 even an art form for someone 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.890
 other instead a simple piece 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.559
 yet among the tattoo freaks at least 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 one out of three thinks back over a while 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.250
 our patient's case we have a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.500
 tattoo done only with colors 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.110
 dark then an easier tattoo to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.760
 eliminate the colored ones above all 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 made with red yellow colors 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 white are more difficult especially 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.449
 why colorful tattoos are 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.500
 generally performed by tattoo artists 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 professionals 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.420
 the professional footballer uses of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 organic dementia that go further 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.909
 depth and therefore are critical 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.619
 eliminate contact a dermatologist 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.600
 expert as he did maximiliano is the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 first step to avoid risks 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.439
 for years now blaser more and more 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.409
 sophisticated allow you to remove 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.270
 even complex tattoos 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.360
 the ideal laser to remove tattoos 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.520
 is the q switched laser this type of 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 laser emits high power pulses 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.900
 but of very short duration 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.920
 this allows you to hit the target 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.409
 without damaging the 16 constants 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.299
 the laser beam does not dig the skin but 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.549
 crumbles the pigment in small letters 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.189
 particles that are then reabsorbed 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.110
 but it is good to know the result depends 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.720
 also from the area where the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.490
 tattoo is so areas of the body 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 Tattoo removal is more difficult 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.240
 for example at the ankle and wrist the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.930
 neck and décolleté because in these areas 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.640
 there is more risk of scarring 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.570
 to eliminate a medium tattoo 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.299
 size 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.039
 it takes from 6 to 10 sessions but between 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.100
 one treatment and the other is good to do 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.110
 spend at least a month and a half in this 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.940
 patient we performed three sessions 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 of laser therapy for the removal of 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.230
 tattoo the number of sessions depends 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.450
 neither size nor tattoo is also 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.459
 from the depth of the pigment like 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.450
 you can not always see the removal 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.340
 perfect 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.470
 this is because the laser beam can 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.290
 also hit the melanin and then 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.940
 to provoke the praises alphanani has therefore of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.640
 white spots that can be 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.700
 transient or permanent you think you will do 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.350
 other tattoos certainly 0 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.690
 if not even these small inconveniences 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.090
 of discouraging and thinking lida 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.190
 look here are some good rules for 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.019
 do it safely 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.760
 first of all you seek in 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.250
 centers that you have exhibited from 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.989
 authorization of the us hunter 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.720
 must use latex gloves 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.450
 disposable to always use the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.989
 mask and the dog also obviously 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.940
 I have to use disposable products 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.720
 disposable and must have a clear view of the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.720
 sterilizer
