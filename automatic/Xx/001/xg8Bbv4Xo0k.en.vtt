I<00:00:10.250> definitely<00:00:11.250> remember<00:00:11.580> taking<00:00:12.509> pictures

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I definitely remember taking pictures

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.749 
I definitely remember taking pictures
with<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.559> mom's<00:00:13.769> camera<00:00:14.219> when<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.549> younger

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
with my mom's camera when I was younger

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.490 
with my mom's camera when I was younger
probably<00:00:15.830> eight<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.369> nine<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.320> like

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
probably eight to nine and and just like

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.170 
probably eight to nine and and just like
messing<00:00:19.920> around<00:00:20.010> obviously<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.820> would<00:00:21.000> just

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
messing around obviously it would just

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.240 
messing around obviously it would just
be<00:00:21.270> around<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.720> mom<00:00:21.900> would<00:00:22.109> let<00:00:22.230> me<00:00:22.289> use<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
be around and my mom would let me use it

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.890 
be around and my mom would let me use it
when<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:24.029> started<00:00:24.359> getting<00:00:24.420> into<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
when I really started getting into that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.970 
when I really started getting into that
I<00:00:24.960> was<00:00:25.109> probably<00:00:25.970> 15<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.269> 16<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.470> high<00:00:28.680> school

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.880 

the<00:00:35.239> principles<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.719> photography<00:00:37.050> haven't

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the principles of photography haven't

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.760 
the principles of photography haven't
changed<00:00:38.399> over<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> years<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.629> always<00:00:39.840> been

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
changed over the years it's always been

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.220 
changed over the years it's always been
about<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.399> light<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> subject<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
about the light about the subject and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.279 
about the light about the subject and
about<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> end<00:00:43.860> goal<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:45.140> cameras<00:00:46.140> have

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
about the end goal the cameras have

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.740 
about the end goal the cameras have
changed<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.489> tool<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.270> digital

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
changed and the tool you know digital

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.389 
changed and the tool you know digital
film<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.410> whatever<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> end<00:00:50.160> goal<00:00:50.340> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
film or whatever but the end goal is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.900 
film or whatever but the end goal is
still<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> same<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.360> for<00:00:51.930> me<00:00:52.050> that's<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
still the same and for me that's to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.750 
still the same and for me that's to
inspire<00:00:53.910> people<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.949> really<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.280> make

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
inspire people and really just to make

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:23.950 
inspire people and really just to make
people<00:00:57.090> happy

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.760 

a<00:01:24.080> camera<00:01:24.920> works<00:01:25.250> like<00:01:25.909> your<00:01:26.150> eye<00:01:26.180> where<00:01:26.990> there

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
a camera works like your eye where there

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.910 
a camera works like your eye where there
your<00:01:27.979> iris<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.760> f-stop<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.930> would<00:01:30.080> maybe

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
your iris is the f-stop you would maybe

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.060 
your iris is the f-stop you would maybe
blink<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.780> remember<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.900> image<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.950> would

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
blink and remember that image that would

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.210 
blink and remember that image that would
be<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.340> shutter<00:01:35.350> where<00:01:36.350> your<00:01:36.680> iris<00:01:37.040> is

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
be the shutter where your iris is

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.070 
be the shutter where your iris is
controlling<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.880> light<00:01:38.119> coming<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:38.960> out

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
controlling the light coming in and out

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.730 
controlling the light coming in and out
and<00:01:39.790> your<00:01:40.790> retina<00:01:41.570> or<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.990> your<00:01:42.229> brain<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
and your retina or the your brain is the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.090 
and your retina or the your brain is the
the<00:01:43.190> film<00:01:43.460> plane<00:01:43.729> or<00:01:44.210> digital<00:01:44.840> sensor<00:01:45.290> which

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
the film plane or digital sensor which

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.670 
the film plane or digital sensor which
is<00:01:46.130> capturing<00:01:47.119> that<00:01:47.270> image<00:01:47.960> instead<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
is capturing that image instead of the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.710 
is capturing that image instead of the
film<00:01:48.920> plane<00:01:49.220> there<00:01:49.820> they're<00:01:50.090> very<00:01:50.119> similar

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
film plane there they're very similar

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.660 
film plane there they're very similar
obviously<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.680> film<00:01:51.920> there's<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.220> different

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
obviously in film there's a different

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.310 
obviously in film there's a different
process<00:01:52.700> behind<00:01:53.330> that<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.780> have<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:53.990> develop

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
process behind that you have to develop

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.020 
process behind that you have to develop
the<00:01:54.409> film<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:54.950> print<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.340> or<00:01:55.670> digital

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
the film and then print it or digital

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.469 
the film and then print it or digital
you<00:01:56.990> can<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:57.320> upload<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.300> process<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.390> in

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
you can just upload it and process it in

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.580 
you can just upload it and process it in
Photoshop

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.510 

the<00:02:05.580> photographer's<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.479> look<00:02:06.900> up<00:02:07.080> to

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
the photographer's that I look up to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.490 
the photographer's that I look up to
they<00:02:08.520> all<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:09.090> documenting<00:02:09.840> what's<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.110> on

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
right there and then that's what I do

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.720 
right there and then that's what I do
and<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.660> work<00:02:12.840> too<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.140> think<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.740> don't<00:02:14.400> want<00:02:14.640> to

the hands of the creator of the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.230 
the hands of the creator of the
