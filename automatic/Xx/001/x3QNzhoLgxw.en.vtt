00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.200
 the objective of this contest will be to 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.520

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.360

 pronunciation and ideally this 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.970
 would be written ph teens 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 after which pseudo style I would like 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.350

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.479
 who is going a little bit with the zobal or 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.829
 still a pseudo stylus that does a little 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.689
 like finally offering there is no 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.329
 word game but it's a pretty game 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.060

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.570

 so how do you propose me how 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.880
 you can count when you

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.590
 private on youtube 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.729
 so for those who do not know how 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.950
 make 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.150
 I comment offline so right to 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.769
 the image that will appear on the screen for 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.409
 show you or about private messages 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.700
 maybe they do not know it you 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.209
 will have to send me yours alone or by 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.129
 private message 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.930
 you do not want more than one if you 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.190
 want to be sent to us in vain 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.010
 have more chances to win after 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.269
 Better to make quality than 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.680
 nicks to rot it's only since 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.940
 it is to have what I will repeat 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.709
 none simply 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.360
 so after that your nickname is 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.080
 valid it must be available on 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.879
 his bar but man 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.159
 do not hesitate to go on my valves 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.180
 you create a near- zero character you 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.620
 create your character 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.030
 if it would be available or delete 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.750
 directly otherwise I think I could have 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.829
 the nickname is like that me so what 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.599
 I'm interested is good I create the mule 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.670
 and simon won will not give you the 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.200
 simply fake reward 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.099
 obviously than to save this country otherwise 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.280
 I do not think I 'm on our two balls 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.950
 simply and be careful also do not 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.000
 do not comment on your username and 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.890
 do not put your nickname in 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.209
 comment since the info I made 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.760
 something like that well I was stung the 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.260
 nick for a point because shit everything 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.609
 simply 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.319
 so I really advise you to avoid 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.670
 to put your nickname in 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.930
 comments what if you win da 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.310
 you will earn more since we are giving 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.169
 will not be available simply 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.000
 and it must also be proud of missing out 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.319
 a good nickname it is true that I would have 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.030
 well loved renamed me just bid but 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.609
 it's already taken for quite some time 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.980
 even to the firms and that's a saga that 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.900
 is banished dominates so here after to 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.940
 example also I have a nickname that I have 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.049
 taken also you feel free to say in 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.040
 comment if you like it otherwise I 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.410
 will give them like that in a valve 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.919
 I had found like those of skies of 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.120
 finally there is oph 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.489
 since it's the beginning of schizophrenics 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.530
 and schizophrenic that comes back a little to 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.540
 ovals finally it corresponds to a 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.609
 little bit anyway 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.630
 here I thought about that I already kept the 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.620
 alone or two sides like that if they 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.450
 find a way maybe I 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.959
 would do those of secularism not in any case to 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.760
 write your review on on skies of 6e 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.079
 gala you like it or not so that's it 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.859
 everything for this game contest to win a 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.720
 subscription month
