00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:10.720
 cliff 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.960
 if he thinks that the echo will become the 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.580
 to move to so many meters and 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.710
 they ended up being used 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.660
 Dude I think the echo is very good for 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.600
 solo here one sincerely still 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.940
 competitive I look at it I do not 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.940
 I can see nothing but a target one 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.680
 bit worse in several ways I do not know 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.150
 that it 's very wrong, I was I'm bad 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.010

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.690

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.390

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.010

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.030
 kiss is with so much potential does not want 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.040
 ask the question the leco 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.010
 he improved a lot lately or 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.120
 did not even get into the city revolt in the cage 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.489
 I wanted to know what motivated you to 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.989
 improve and if the entrance of the 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.020
 it helped a lot 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:06.460

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.979
 a part of everything and back so helped 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.490
 quite a few things and sat down on my 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.250
 and I did not talk to anything, I think 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.340
 You can improve on this and other things. 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.799
 it was more about dedication and coexistence 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.439
 I think now that everyone is 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.460
 helping a lot and I'm glad that 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:43.630
