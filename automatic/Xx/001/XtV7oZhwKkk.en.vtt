of<00:00:50.340> made<00:00:50.489> sense<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.879> me<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
of made sense to me this is a way here I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.680 
of made sense to me this is a way here I
was<00:00:52.829> able<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.309> attach<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> rod

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.319 
holder so at first I just had the rod
holder<00:00:57.809> coming<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.289> by<00:00:59.190> itself<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
holder coming up by itself now I put the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.720

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
to put a cup holder paddle clip also add

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
to put a cup holder paddle clip also add
a<00:01:07.020> light<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.680> other<00:01:08.119> rod<00:01:09.119> holder<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.870 
a light to the other rod holder in the
back<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.439> allowed<00:01:11.070> me<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> lot<00:01:11.850> more
