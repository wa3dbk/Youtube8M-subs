00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello to everyone so I wish you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.830
 present a novelty from solo 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.660
 scientist the rade thing backs then 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.040
 what is the routine backs it's a 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.590
 waterproof tinder box that makes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.980
 also solar lighter and mirrors of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 distress then as usual at 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
 on the scientist 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.630
 it's a superbly factories piece and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.630
 in the united states 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.529
 here you can see which and guillot 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.469
 in order to have a good grip in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.950
 hand to open the lid behind 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.960
 wherein there is a ring seal which it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.969
 prefers a perfect seal 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 So here I take you my box I 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.280
 discover here my little container at 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.879
 tinder in the covered so I have to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.440
 charred fabric of course 2 Corsican's 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.379
 the old man's beard because I have 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.609
 a hospice near my home leaves 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.589
 and as you can see and I 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.049
 have nothing to protect the mirror 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.240
 of tinder the reason is this 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.520
 I really really and I weigh my 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.420
 words been impressed by the quality of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.200
 this room the mirror is carved in the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.939
 mass 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.799
 it's not an added mirror it's not a 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.710
 additional room added 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.540
 pauli in the mass also so he 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.049
 there is no coating that can blister 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.890
 to deteriorate and that is obviously 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:38.009
 you can go there it's solid and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.990
 very very difficult to reyes so here 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.990
 that's the mirror the tinder box 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.100
 that I'm going to dump inside of 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.289
 which one discovers the foot that is going to 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.929
 put on the mirror to hold 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.969
 to soften him up so he is very 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.640
 well secured so no possibility of 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:07.689
 loose it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.509
 then we will place it on the small 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.440
 ergo in the center of the mirror so I you 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.080
 spoke earlier about mirrors of 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.549
 distress you see it if it's this is 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.790
 not this one committed suicide is this 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.790
 box 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.329
 this is a mirror of distress very 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.360
 very very very effective then that's 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.930
 then very very simple there for example 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.849
 I will take a small piece of Corsican 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:48.610
 we put tinder here on the small 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:51.639
 support and we are looking for the sun here and 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.420
 as you can see it's going 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:57.190
 very very very very fast 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.260
 super easy to use ultra 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.810
 performant I think you can see 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:11.410
 the solar point so here are 2 the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:16.799
 Corsican the beard of the old man that I 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.799
 continue to thank 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.700
 that's the old man's beard 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 hop 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.780
 I hope you see the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.860
 concentration related to the quality of 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.880
 design of this mirror 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.030
 the concentration of the solar ray 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.570
 the old man's bar 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.090
 obviously very easy the fabric 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.380
 charred that will not make smoke but 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.730
 which will ignite in two stages three 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.900
 movements because as you know 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:02.080
 then the color is dark in the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:06.820
 more solar light and here is 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:14.970
 absorbed ok so there it does not smoke but 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:19.209
 I guarantee that reader flames and 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.470
 So here you are then in the box of 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.770
 at solo scientist very very very 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.560
 top of the line 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.740
 it's a debate I had with friends 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.360
 on the high end in this case is 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.250
 there we really have it 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.620
 something exceptional then actually 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.610
 you will find on the internet lighters 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.919
 manufactured in some quality countries 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.810
 very average 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.430
 that's something we keep for life 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.190
 and so I just need to 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:59.169
 put my tinder back into the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.690
 cover and close the box and there 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.150
 we have a perfect seal so 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.060
 really once again 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:12.340
 of course I'm doing this is for sale 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:16.630
 but I am very impressed by the 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.580
 final quality of 2 7 me really 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.960
 really extraordinary 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.790
 that's it and this enthusiasm is not 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.770
 commercial 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.530
 Moreover I will forbid and 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.780
 a few for me this is bah listening 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.070

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.730
