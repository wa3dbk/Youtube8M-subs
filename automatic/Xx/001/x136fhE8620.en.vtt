00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
Oh Mike all those people are lucky

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.440 
Oh Mike all those people are lucky
alright<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.369> basically<00:02:03.490> what<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.000> do<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.210> you

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
alright so basically what you do is you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.309 
alright so basically what you do is you
fly<00:02:04.690> up<00:02:04.900> here<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:06.400> if<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.090> read<00:02:07.360> this<00:02:07.570> sign

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
fly up here and if you read this sign

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.210 
fly up here and if you read this sign
it<00:02:08.380> says<00:02:09.069> no<00:02:09.340> hidden<00:02:09.640> content<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.569> way

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
it says no hidden content this way

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.580 
it says no hidden content this way
obviously<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:13.330> guess<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.290> means<00:02:14.380> we<00:02:14.560> should

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
obviously I guess that means we should

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.460 
obviously I guess that means we should
just<00:02:14.860> turn<00:02:15.010> around<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.459> leave<00:02:15.580> right<00:02:16.230> no<00:02:17.230> this

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
just turn around and leave right no this

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.559 
just turn around and leave right no this
is<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.130> Statue<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.520> Liberty<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:18.970> course<00:02:19.330> and
