00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
on my mic they're they're actually not

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.420 
on my mic they're they're actually not
as<00:01:06.580> loud<00:01:06.760> as<00:01:06.909> they<00:01:07.060> sound<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.450> camera<00:01:08.220> anyway<00:01:09.220> I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
as loud as they sound on camera anyway I

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.310 
as loud as they sound on camera anyway I
had<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.640> get<00:01:09.760> another<00:01:09.880> water<00:01:10.180> block<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.750> bought

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
had to get another water block I bought

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.580 
had to get another water block I bought
these<00:01:11.470> three<00:01:11.770> fans<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.810> temp<00:01:14.020> sensor<00:01:14.380> and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
these three fans and a temp sensor and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.360 
these three fans and a temp sensor and
more<00:01:15.370> fittings<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:17.530> think<00:01:17.710> that's<00:01:17.860> pretty

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
more fittings and I think that's pretty

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.690 
more fittings and I think that's pretty
much<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:19.409> other<00:01:20.409> than<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:20.680> I<00:01:21.070> had<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.400> get<00:01:21.580> it

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
much it other than that I had to get it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.289 
much it other than that I had to get it
a<00:01:21.880> power<00:01:22.270> supply<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.830> run<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.549> coolant<00:01:24.940> this

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
a power supply to run the coolant this

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.880 
a power supply to run the coolant this
you<00:01:25.600> know<00:01:25.720> these<00:01:25.900> two<00:01:26.080> guys<00:01:26.320> right<00:01:26.590> here

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
you know these two guys right here

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.330 
you know these two guys right here
because<00:01:27.760> that<00:01:28.060> way<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.510> at<00:01:29.140> least<00:01:29.320> I'm<00:01:29.470> told<00:01:29.680> it

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
because that way it at least I'm told it

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.109 
because that way it at least I'm told it
takes<00:01:30.549> stress<00:01:31.210> off<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:32.190> ps3<00:01:33.190> power<00:01:33.430> supply<00:01:33.760> so

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
takes stress off the ps3 power supply so

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.270 
takes stress off the ps3 power supply so
it's<00:01:34.270> not<00:01:34.420> getting<00:01:34.630> over<00:01:35.140> you<00:01:35.590> know<00:01:35.710> exerted

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
it's not getting over you know exerted

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's not getting over you know exerted
and<00:01:36.460> producing<00:01:37.060> excess<00:01:37.390> heat<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.250> anyway<00:01:39.250> I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
and producing excess heat and anyway I

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.120 
and producing excess heat and anyway I
got<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.790> power<00:01:40.330> supply<00:01:40.630> for<00:01:40.869> free<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:41.470> why<00:01:42.100> not

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
got the power supply for free so why not

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.929 
got the power supply for free so why not
use<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:43.299> got<00:01:44.049> all<00:01:45.040> these<00:01:45.220> my<00:01:45.610> buddy

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
this acrylic panel which a lot went into

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.200 
this acrylic panel which a lot went into
making<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.220> lot<00:02:03.610> more<00:02:03.790> than<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:04.030> thought

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
making this a lot more than I thought

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.850 
making this a lot more than I thought
went<00:02:04.450> into<00:02:04.479> making<00:02:04.750> this<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.560> got<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.740> be

careful<00:02:06.130> with<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.670> at<00:02:06.880> least<00:02:07.090> with<00:02:07.299> whatever<00:02:08.019> I

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
careful with it at least with whatever I

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.469 
careful with it at least with whatever I
use<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.439> don't<00:02:08.709> know<00:02:08.799> if<00:02:09.459> this<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:09.789> lexan<00:02:10.329> or

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
use I don't know if this is lexan or

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.480 
use I don't know if this is lexan or
acrylic<00:02:10.899> or<00:02:11.049> what

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
acrylic or what

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.570 
acrylic or what
it's<00:02:12.670> thin<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.360> it's<00:02:13.780> really<00:02:14.050> brutal<00:02:14.440> cuz<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
it's thin and it's really brutal cuz the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.220 
it's thin and it's really brutal cuz the
first<00:02:15.760> time<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:15.940> tried<00:02:16.210> cutting<00:02:16.540> these<00:02:16.630> holes<00:02:16.930> I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
first time I tried cutting these holes I

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.400 
first time I tried cutting these holes I
just<00:02:17.410> used<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.650> regular<00:02:17.800> wood<00:02:18.220> hole<00:02:18.550> saw<00:02:18.790> and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
just used a regular wood hole saw and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.020 
just used a regular wood hole saw and
completely<00:02:20.410> shattered<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> thing<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.850> really

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
completely shattered the thing it really

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.290 
completely shattered the thing it really
it<00:02:22.570> was<00:02:23.400> aggravating<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.430> say<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.850> least<00:02:25.000> so

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
it was aggravating to say the least so

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.260 
it was aggravating to say the least so
what<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.410> have<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.560> do<00:02:26.740> what<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.640> found<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.240> you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
what you have to do what I found is you

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.660 
what you have to do what I found is you
have<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.540> run<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.020> saw<00:02:29.230> backwards<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.430> it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
have to run the saw backwards and it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.850 
have to run the saw backwards and it
effectively<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:31.660> melts<00:02:32.140> through<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.650> and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
effectively just melts through it and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.520 
effectively just melts through it and
makes<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.160> perfect<00:02:33.550> hole<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:35.140> otherwise

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
makes a perfect hole because otherwise

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.830 
makes a perfect hole because otherwise
the<00:02:36.310> teeth<00:02:36.520> catch<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.330> just<00:02:37.480> rips<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
the teeth catch and it just rips the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.330 
the teeth catch and it just rips the
whole<00:02:37.930> thing<00:02:38.110> apart<00:02:38.230> because<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.920> too<00:02:39.100> thin

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
whole thing apart because it's too thin

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.840 
whole thing apart because it's too thin
and<00:02:39.990> yeah<00:02:40.990> but<00:02:41.770> yeah<00:02:42.010> melting<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.490> works<00:02:42.640> fine

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
and yeah but yeah melting it works fine

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.830 
and yeah but yeah melting it works fine
and<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.600> cut<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.870> out<00:02:44.020> with<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.260> dremel<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
and I cut this out with a dremel and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.360 
and I cut this out with a dremel and
yeah<00:02:46.840> there's<00:02:47.110> not<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> whole<00:02:47.410> lot<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.830> this

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
what I had to do instead of just

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.890 
what I had to do instead of just
mounting<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.640> acrylic<00:03:33.970> flush<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.660> ball

mounting the acrylic flush to the ball

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.320 
mounting the acrylic flush to the ball
or<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.170> case<00:03:35.620> here<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.100> used<00:03:36.910> these<00:03:37.060> little

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
or the case here I used these little

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.700 
or the case here I used these little
spacer<00:03:37.690> deals<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.110> came<00:03:38.290> with<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.530> water

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
spacer deals that came with the water

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.710 
spacer deals that came with the water
kit<00:03:38.980> they're<00:03:39.220> there<00:03:39.490> for<00:03:39.670> mounting<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.240> think

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720

according to how my cheese is flowing on
any<00:03:55.120> given<00:03:55.360> day<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.580> anyway<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.820> raised<00:03:58.270> it<00:03:58.450> off

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
any given day so anyway I raised it off

any given day so anyway I raised it off
and<00:03:59.020> I<00:03:59.290> used<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.770> just<00:04:00.220> like<00:04:00.520> door<00:04:00.820> sealer

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
and I used this just like door sealer

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.210 
and I used this just like door sealer
from<00:04:01.570> Home<00:04:01.750> Depot<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:02.830> actually<00:04:02.950> doesn't

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
from Home Depot and it actually doesn't

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.500 
from Home Depot and it actually doesn't
look<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.430> bad<00:04:03.820> just<00:04:03.880> don't<00:04:04.270> look<00:04:04.360> at<00:04:04.450> the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
look that bad just don't look at the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.110 
look that bad just don't look at the
corners<00:04:04.900> they're<00:04:05.050> kind<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.320> it<00:04:05.700> but<00:04:06.700> yeah<00:04:06.880> so

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
corners they're kind of it but yeah so

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.670 
corners they're kind of it but yeah so
that<00:04:07.150> seals<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.720> off<00:04:07.840> nicely<00:04:08.170> around<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
that seals it off nicely around the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.610 
that seals it off nicely around the
acrylic<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.730> air<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.390> getting<00:04:11.170> drawn

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
acrylic so that the air is getting drawn

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.100 
acrylic so that the air is getting drawn
you<00:04:12.400> know<00:04:12.490> from<00:04:12.880> here<00:04:13.240> you<00:04:13.600> can<00:04:13.720> feel<00:04:13.930> it

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
you know from here you can feel it

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.440 
you know from here you can feel it
sucking<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.950> from<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.340> sides<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.330> that

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
sucking in and from the sides and that

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.479 
sucking in and from the sides and that
way<00:04:16.600> it's<00:04:16.750> actually<00:04:16.900> pulling<00:04:17.380> air<00:04:17.650> over<00:04:18.070> all

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
way it's actually pulling air over all

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.370 
way it's actually pulling air over all
the<00:04:18.670> components<00:04:19.270> at<00:04:19.840> least<00:04:20.140> hopefully

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
the components at least hopefully

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.860 
the components at least hopefully
and<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.950> know<00:04:22.070> getting<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.730> more<00:04:23.120> effective

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
and you know getting you more effective

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.930 
and you know getting you more effective

around<00:06:05.620> to<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.800> radiator<00:06:07.390> where<00:06:08.390> hopefully

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
around to the radiator where hopefully

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.170 
around to the radiator where hopefully
it<00:06:09.290> reaches<00:06:09.680> room<00:06:09.710> temperature<00:06:09.920> and<00:06:10.700> then

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
it reaches room temperature and then

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.150 
it reaches room temperature and then
gets<00:06:11.420> pumped<00:06:11.780> back<00:06:12.230> into<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:13.130> chips<00:06:14.290> so<00:06:15.290> you

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
gets pumped back into the chips so you

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.370 
gets pumped back into the chips so you
know<00:06:16.520> if<00:06:16.670> there's<00:06:16.820> anyone<00:06:17.110> doing<00:06:18.110> one<00:06:18.260> these
