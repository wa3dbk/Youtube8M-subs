00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.630
 This is my dear, they had already done very well 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.800
 accompanied here by Luz María Martínez 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.690
 teacher of the schools of distrust 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.510
 comes to teach how to make a fix 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.359
 beautiful fruit like this is true if 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.039
 we come to provide you with how to make a 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.720
 arrangement inside your house that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.910
 we need first to start 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.949
 mainly the base has a barrier 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.320
 The base can be made of glass or 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.180
 plastic of the premises of we have a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.219
 see or any base any low 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.680
 ceramic what tools are we going to 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.280
 need to create the sticks arrangement 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.399
 bamboo 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.649
 when we're going to start doing 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.170
 little flag obviously the fruits that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 we have are of our choice true and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.760
 if they are suddenly in season they are more 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.379
 We were also going to spend less 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.420
 money doing it now when doing the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.539
 arrangement as we simply do 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.339
 we prepare if we start to insert 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.229
 try the fruit the center of danger 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.609
 from the stick to form little flags 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:03.780
 a fruit flag I see that here you have 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.510
 lettuce lettuce leaves on this 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.620
 lady who is down to endure the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.620
 are are 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.650
 but you also told me that in 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.600
 this one used the head as such of the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.550
 lettuce a lettuce if you do not have a 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.400
 sponge and has a rule if round that 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.380
 can put that I can truly put the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.500
 head of the lettuce puts it and then 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.960
 already here we see that we have the little flags 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.520
 as you told me and we have simply 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.930
 we are going to put them we are going to accommodate them 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.430
 AHA 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.770
 mainly we are always going to start 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.050
 with the view although being this this 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 heart this lady who has here that sees 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.790
 that has a heart come these 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.440
 cutters that are like cookies or 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.760
 of carrier cookie players 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.070
 cookie that you can get them in 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.560
 any pastry shop then 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.350
 nothing but the fruit they put nothing 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.390
 until now we press and they are already formed 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.370
 the design that you see the effect and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.730
 then to accommodate one simply 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.370
 accommodates you to your liking if we start 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.370
 through the center through the center of the center 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.990
 outward though james and the sticks 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.740
 you have to cut them in different sizes 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.200
 different sizes as I go down 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.870
 because we are going to do it in a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.870
 horizontal and perfect then this 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.000
 you can also lady adapt to the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.220
 special occasions not for Christmas 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.130
 you can do as a holy week be 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.770
 Valentine hearts as to 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.010

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.320
 easter trade laws now as soon as 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.870
 approximately it can cost one 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.000
 make an arrangement like this depending 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.880
 seasonal fruits depending on those 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.060
 They are cheap but they give they have very good 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.220
 good clear cost very good profit and 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.950
 an arrangement like this would come as an entity 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.340
 is about 180 dollars good 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.340
 Lady already said that with little you can do 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.950
 a beautiful arrangement and then if you take it from 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.730
 Young can sell it and become very good 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.730
