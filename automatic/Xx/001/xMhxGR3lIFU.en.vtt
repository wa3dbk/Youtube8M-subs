your choice of two graphics card options

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.479 
your choice of two graphics card options
on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> low<00:00:45.149> end<00:00:45.329> you'll<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> nvidia<00:00:46.489> 460

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
on the low end you'll have a nvidia 460

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.299 
on the low end you'll have a nvidia 460
and<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.510> enables<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> 3d<00:00:49.530> technology<00:00:50.100> or

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and that enables the 3d technology or

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.900 
and that enables the 3d technology or
you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.610> step<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:52.129> 6000<00:00:53.129> series<00:00:53.250> ati

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you can step up to the 6000 series ati

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.490 
you can step up to the 6000 series ati
graphics<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> most<00:00:55.140> horsepower

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
graphics if you want the most horsepower

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.529 
graphics if you want the most horsepower
but<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.640> makes<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.059> notebook

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
but what really makes this notebook

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.069 
but what really makes this notebook
different<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.710> gain<00:00:59.640> in<00:01:00.270> HD<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
different is that you can gain in HD and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.470 
different is that you can gain in HD and
stream<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.530> without<00:01:02.070> any<00:01:02.309> latency<00:01:02.760> right

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
stream it without any latency right

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.850 
stream it without any latency right
right<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:03.840> they're<00:01:04.080> playing<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> games

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
right now they're playing the games

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.260 
right now they're playing the games
themselves<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.610> looking<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:05.939> videos

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
themselves you're just looking at videos

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
themselves you're just looking at videos
but<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> look<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.619> both<00:01:07.770> displays<00:01:08.100> at<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
but if you look at both displays at the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.230 
but if you look at both displays at the
same<00:01:08.729> time<00:01:09.170> it's<00:01:10.170> basically<00:01:11.240> perfectly

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
same time it's basically perfectly

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.140 
same time it's basically perfectly
insane<00:01:12.659> without<00:01:12.869> any<00:01:13.229> last<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.670> can't<00:01:15.000> wait

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
insane without any last so we can't wait

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.429 
insane without any last so we can't wait

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to get this notebook in our labs and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.330 
to get this notebook in our labs and
we're<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.590> gonna<00:01:16.740> show<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> couple<00:01:17.100> more
