00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.199
 do not forget it's a real journey 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:11.659
 in real time 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.639
 right now where as you look at these images 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 you go through the brassens space 7000 km 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.079
 today we are here 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.080
 we will reach the equinox point 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.390
 the beginning of spring 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 in four weeks 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.200
 during our journey through the solar system 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.730
 our neighbors the planets accompanies us 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.720
 this week let's look beyond the planets 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.480
 the infinitely more distant stars 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 the stars that serve us as benchmarks 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.900
 a star always tells us north 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.550
 the polar star 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.280
 it's easy to find five times in the back of the big bear that you 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.280
 know all 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 the pole star is in the extension of the sonatel 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.950
 all night 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.759
 the sky and the stars seem to turn around this Picardy star 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.759
 is immobile since precisely it is tired of the rotation 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.390
 the polar star is therefore a reliable and practical reference 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.570
 christophe colomb the utilaton who sailed to the continents are 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.680
 unknown 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.520
 he had decided to cross the ocean following the 28th parallel 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.829
 every night he measured how far the polar star appeared 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.730
 as long as his dial indicated 28 degrees he knew he was on course 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.560
 he had not drift emitted to the south nor to the north 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.310
 he was following well and the 28th parallel 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.190
 like christophe colomb you can without telescope nor mathematics imagine the 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.380
 movement of our spaceship earth 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.090
 turning around its axis always directed towards the polar star 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.909
 but that's not exactly right 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.359
 in twenty-six thousand years 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.359
 she will describe a casket 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.879
 if we imagine that the appearance of the earth comes out of the North Pole 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.879
 and extend to infinity he meets the polar star 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.289
 the millennium to another 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.290
 it's other stars that become 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.290
 our polar star 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.359
 there are twelve thousand euros 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.149
 from the time of the caveman 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:34.189
 they were guys 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.189
 5000 years ago the tudor star 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.859
 it was the time when the Egyptians built the great pyramid 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.669
 it is true that a gallery 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.189
 pointing north 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.049
 do the Egyptians see at the end of this gallery 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.510
 it was the northern star 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.069
 just to the left of the big bear 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.069
 while today tourists see the polar star 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.629
 the polar star is the angle under which the therapy vote in 5000 hours 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.189
 we can all imagine ourselves for months maybe years the mass 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.139
 but to imagine 5 milan 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.139
 you have to watch languages ​​between tuba on the phone angry 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.239
 traveling on the other orbit 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.669
 we see from week to week that the stars change slightly from 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.859
 position 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.559
 like for example the constellation of orion 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.409
 easy to find 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.079
 m orion 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.569
 its head 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.709
 it's arm 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.369
 his two feet 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.369
 his belt 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.309
 the small daily movements of the stars 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.119
 it was completely drowned in the huge rocking movement 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.969
 caused by the rotation of the earth 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.969
 which turned our field of vision 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.889
 at night 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.839
 but look at each night at the same time 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:12.939
 and you will see the very slow rotation of the celestial vault the celestial vault 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.669
 of course it does not exist 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.820
 it's an imaginary double on which the stars appear infinitely 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:18.840
 distant 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.480
 and of course this celestial vault does not turn it's us on the earth who 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.219
 short now let's go around the sun yesterday 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.219
 360 degrees in 365 days 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.949
 or by decree per day 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.870
 we see the high school stars one degree to the right 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.080
 this week around 9 pm 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.680
 orion and further south 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.570
 in two weeks orion gold slid to the right and in another month a 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.900
 little more to the right 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.280
 stars move one degree a day where she spends each day 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.189
 four minutes earlier 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.159
 a degree in space four minutes in time 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.159
 relaxation area meet 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:09.800
 since the beginning of these cruises 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
 we make the difference between the nearby planets 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.499
 and the stars very far away 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:18.799
 a star however is in the middle of our planetary neighborhood 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.599
 the sun 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.719
 yes the sun is a star 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.389
 all these bright spots that we see beyond the planets these are 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.240
 stars to isolate far 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.409
 galaxies are billions of suns 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.020
 the planets seen from the ground 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.479
 looks like stars 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.089
 but just look at the sun to reward or iparla different 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.990
 the sun shines while the planets only reflect a 

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:46.529
 part of the sunlight 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.330
 the sun sends us light 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.539
 and heat 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.539
 because it's a gigantic nuclear reactor 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.650
 the solar system c the sun and dust 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.039
 because all the planets were understood the earth 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.450
 represents only about 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.450
 one thousandth of the mass of the solar system 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.449
 the sun was too big for us to represent 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:19.710
 to get an idea 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.490
 let's say rather than the whole moon-earth system 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.240
 with all their culinary marbles 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.240
 will hold more mans inside the sun 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.790
 yet it's huge sun and a relatively small star and if we 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.350
 let's compare our sun to other stars our little and to disappear 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.350
 completely from the screen 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.550
 in the constellation of orion 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.909
 the betelgeuse star and the biggest star we know 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.080
 it is so big that it could largely contain our sun more 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.749
 their earth orbits 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.749
 all this would hold inside this star 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.819
 we know the dimension of the infinitely small 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:06.360
 the atoms with their nucleus 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.559
 where and the electrons that revolve around 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:12.399
 we also know the dimension of the infinitely large the universe and the 

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:13.909
 stars 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:16.569
 but there is a new dimension 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.569
 that of our solar system 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:26.379
 we are the first generation to seize it 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.229
 explore 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.000
 brings you back to life in this new dimension is the purpose of our trip
