00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.879
 The Busan Sungjiji Song Zoo is a once-in-a-lifetime bazaar, 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.630
 It was 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.799
 In the 1990s, the generation of parents who spent their childhood in Busan 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.300
 To the elderly 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.980
 The Sungji-gum Zoo is a happy place where memories of childhood memories and black-and- 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.460
 It was a space. 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.060
 But after a while, close the doors in October 2000, at the end of British 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:33.410
 Worth Catherine Park has prepared a reopening of the zoo . 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.239
 The nsp communication has been in progress for the past seven years , 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.739
 I've looked at it. 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:45.260
 The park is the site of the main street going to the zoo and safari-type far other municipalities 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:49.280
 I have a voice that is smaller than the size of the zoo . 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.420
 World Daejeon O Zoo that holds the vehicle of domestic Zoo Safari 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.400
 is 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:59.510
 The total area of ​​the park in China is 84,700 square meters. 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.680
 I do not make a big difference when I superimpose the pictures I accumulated in one thousandth 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.600
 There is a question about whether profitability will be achieved properly after opening. 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.680
 It is pointed out that it is only 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.000
 In the case of Daejeon Ohworld Zoo, where the zoo is located, 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:20.000
 Safari Rose captain while yay 0 ticket prices lower 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.380
 Despite the big increase, the number of visitors is continuously increasing 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.210
 In the first year of operation, 90,000 people were found, and last year, 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.220
 I went there 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.350
 The maximum number of visitors per year after opening is 109% 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.190
 Year or 160 million people 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:42.710
 Tenor Park's sales rise was 65% 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:48.110
 Then 25% of torrents and 10% of other sales 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.420
 Therefore, 1.6 million free-float condominiums generated additional revenues of 35% 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.659
 It is being analyzed as 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.310
 Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:03.010
 From the feasibility study report on the expansion project for the theme park of the Sungji-ji Zoo 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:08.260
 It is estimated that an average of 33.33 million people visit this year. 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.820
 Estimated revenue is 9.14 billion won, and the operating expenses are 440 million won. 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:17.080
 I recalled that operating profit reached 460.5 billion won 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:21.760
 These figures are based on the current state of Daejeon Oworld 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:26.650
 It is the scale that can be accomplished easily when comparing the number of population and facilities 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.410
 A group of Park Development Project which estimated the total investment in 1130, 700 million won 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.670
 The input cost is 687 hug 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.930
 Showing that more gongjeongryul the current 70%, depending on the park side claims 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.790
 Considering 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.730
 Estimated project cost of Yiwu is estimated at W45bn. 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.900
 It is a marriage that can offset the cost of construction . 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.150
 In Busan, two metropolitan cities and 14 seeds are located within a distance of 100km . 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.020
 There is 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:57.460
 Therefore, the annual visitors to Yeonnam area's only Safari The Park are Busan 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.600
 The expectation that steady lead in an area where anyone can easily 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.640
 Situation 4 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:08.590
 In an emergency, five punching questions were asked unanimously in this paper's decision . 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.970
 Our city is a project I've been through this over the carp muscle '10 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.940
 It took 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:21.040
 It would be a lot of content business partner haewatgo continue to develop content 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:25.959
 And that development, such as the building is shed only if you do not know how to operate and go 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.020
 Because of the situation, the business in the park is extended more than 8 times 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:34.060
 It is known that the business has been suspended for more than 6 years 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:36.640
 Dwaeteumyeo construction in progress until September 2010. Most of the stories are designed to change and extend 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.290
 Complaint handling, etc. 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.030
 Additional Projects The application for the extension of the project to the faculty has already been completed in December 2010 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.260
 February , 2011 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:51.140
 Other than that 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:54.439
 Preparing for the opening of the zoo in the business field 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.790
 Have been steadily progressing so far. 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:03.799
 Space designed to communicate directly with animals in Chang Nam 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:07.310
 Seven years of preparation , such as Kids Land, an imaginary space designed to match the children's eye level 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:12.440
 This period seems many never do not colorless 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.030
 Busan Song population 357 childhood layer of 10,000 people 12.8% 2.45 million 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.930
 About 5,000 people 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.350
 I met the citizens of Busan who found the Dojang Children's Grand Park 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.620
 I am tearful to the best friend 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:29.990
 Animals must be scored until they have to score the animal directly 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:34.160
 When it initially because there is a low road publicity also essential As the zoo is not 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:38.840
 I've been expecting a lot since I studied , but it was only October when I opened it in March. 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.950
 Next it will keep growing, so now no one has ever diminishing expectations 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.010
 It'll happen. 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.130
 Yeah. That 's what happened . I 've been to two . 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.060
 No 1 No first 4 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:54.950
 Then how did you see the animals ? 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:57.020
 Zhang was postponed several times already world citizens so desperately Zoo 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.070
 Chapter 3 of the hope 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.060
 Understanding Korea- made Underwater City The first marine city in Busan 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.320
 Animal painting for children 1 I am angry at the fact that it is not right 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.400
 I was there. 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:14.840
 Just give me a little more time. 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.730
 I would be able to show that you can think of creating a zoo 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.210
 And his 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:23.210
 Please give me one more animal of the umbrella too 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.289
 Make it happen. 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.789
 Seventeen years have passed since the zoo was closed on the 17th. 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.630
 It's possible 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:38.410
 If the business is proceeding as suggested by The Park Book, 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:42.759
 You can also see a city theme park 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:47.370
 The zoo development project is a waste of lung cancer . 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:51.400
 The future of the Holy Land Song Zoo is reborn as the garden of children's dreams 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.050
