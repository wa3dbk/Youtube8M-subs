shows<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.530> soy<00:00:47.070> products<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.059> seem

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
shows is that soy products do not seem

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.680 
shows is that soy products do not seem

also alright final question what are
some<00:02:33.200> excellent<00:02:34.370> isolation<00:02:35.370> exercises<00:02:35.790> for

some excellent isolation exercises for

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.270 
some excellent isolation exercises for
tricep<00:02:36.510> long<00:02:36.810> head<00:02:37.050> besides<00:02:37.290> skull<00:02:37.830> crushers

tricep long head besides skull crushers
alright<00:02:39.120> as<00:02:39.270> I've<00:02:39.420> covered<00:02:39.630> before<00:02:39.870> remember

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
alright as I've covered before remember

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.930 
alright as I've covered before remember
it's<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> way<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.460> do<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.790> go

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
it's the way that you do this go

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.250 
it's the way that you do this go
pressure<00:02:42.240> that<00:02:42.510> determines<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:42.990> amount<00:02:43.080> of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
pressure that determines the amount of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.800 
pressure that determines the amount of
tricep<00:02:43.740> activation<00:02:44.370> anything<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.210> lets<00:02:45.420> you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
tricep activation anything that lets you

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.380 
tricep activation anything that lets you
get<00:02:46.320> extension<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.040> shoulder<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:48.030> if

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
get extension of the shoulder so if

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.630 
get extension of the shoulder so if
you're<00:02:48.600> doing<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.140> tricep<00:02:49.890> press<00:02:50.070> down<00:02:50.400> and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
you're doing a tricep press down and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.550 
you're doing a tricep press down and
you're<00:02:51.060> coming<00:02:51.270> up<00:02:51.480> high<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.110> then<00:02:52.260> bringing

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
you're coming up high and then bringing

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.050 
you're coming up high and then bringing
it<00:02:52.710> down<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.250> where<00:02:53.310> your<00:02:53.490> shoulders<00:02:53.880> are

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
it down to where your shoulders are

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.240 
it down to where your shoulders are
extending<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.590> recruiting<00:02:56.010> more<00:02:56.130> of

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
extending up that is recruiting more of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.520 
extending up that is recruiting more of
the<00:02:56.310> long<00:02:56.460> head<00:02:56.730> anything<00:02:57.570> done<00:02:57.780> behind<00:02:57.990> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the long head anything done behind the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.160 
the long head anything done behind the
head<00:02:58.880> activates<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.120> stretch<00:03:00.450> reflex<00:03:00.960> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
head activates that stretch reflex it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.070 
head activates that stretch reflex it
puts<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.440> stretch<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.310> tricep<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.300> it

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
puts that stretch on the tricep and it

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.510 
puts that stretch on the tricep and it
helps<00:03:04.350> work<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.710> long<00:03:04.890> head<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.250> doesn't

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
helps work the long head it doesn't

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.070 
helps work the long head it doesn't
matter<00:03:05.640> whether<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.180> with<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.330> cable<00:03:06.660> whether

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
matter whether it's with a cable whether

matter whether it's with a cable whether
it's<00:03:07.260> with<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.440> dumbbell<00:03:07.770> whether<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.460> with<00:03:08.580> a

it's with a dumbbell whether it's with a

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.700 
it's with a dumbbell whether it's with a
barbell<00:03:09.090> as<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.050> matter<00:03:10.230> whether<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.590> do<00:03:10.680> it

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
barbell as a matter whether you do it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.560 
barbell as a matter whether you do it
with<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.100> hand<00:03:11.130> or<00:03:11.550> two<00:03:11.610> you're<00:03:12.240> still

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
with one hand or two you're still

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.510 
with one hand or two you're still
working<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.140> long<00:03:13.290> head<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:14.100> anything

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
working the long head with anything

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.300 
working the long head with anything
behind<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.480> neck<00:03:15.660> or<00:03:16.590> behind<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.130> head

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
behind it the neck or behind the head

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.030 
behind it the neck or behind the head
like<00:03:17.490> that<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.840> it's<00:03:19.110> all<00:03:19.290> about<00:03:19.320> shoulder

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
like that so it's all about shoulder

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.680 
like that so it's all about shoulder
extension<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.700> stretch<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:24.150> hopefully<00:03:24.510> that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
extension and stretch so hopefully that

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.210 
extension and stretch so hopefully that
clarifies<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.440> bit<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.830> reason<00:03:26.130> I

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
clarifies that a bit and the reason I

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.740 
clarifies that a bit and the reason I
was<00:03:26.250> showing<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.790> with<00:03:26.940> skull<00:03:27.150> crushers<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.630> it

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
was showing it with skull crushers is it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.300 
was showing it with skull crushers is it
because<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.050> skull<00:03:28.320> crusher<00:03:28.350> done<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.100> way

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
because the skull crusher done that way

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.699 
because the skull crusher done that way
actually<00:03:29.610> effectively<00:03:30.510> recruits<00:03:31.020> all<00:03:31.200> three

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
actually effectively recruits all three

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.330 
actually effectively recruits all three
heads<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:33.000> good<00:03:33.709> lift<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.100> develop

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
heads it is a good lift to just develop

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.150 
heads it is a good lift to just develop
a<00:03:35.610> well-balanced<00:03:36.390> tricep<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.800> that's<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
a well-balanced tricep so that's the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.590 
a well-balanced tricep so that's the
reason<00:03:38.190> i<00:03:38.459> point<00:03:38.640> out<00:03:38.760> using<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.330> shoulder

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
reason i point out using the shoulder

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.030 
reason i point out using the shoulder
extension<00:03:39.989> on<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.170> skull<00:03:40.410> Crusher's<00:03:40.800> rather
