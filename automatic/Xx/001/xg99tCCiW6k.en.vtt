so<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:51.290> am<00:02:51.620> using<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.490> nourish<00:02:53.210> and<00:02:53.420> shine<00:02:53.690> by

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
so I am using the nourish and shine by

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.750 
so I am using the nourish and shine by
Jane<00:02:54.410> Carter<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.840> taking<00:02:57.230> out<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.710> foil<00:02:58.490> and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
Jane Carter and taking out the foil and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.970 
Jane Carter and taking out the foil and
I'm<00:02:59.030> making<00:02:59.240> sure<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.870> take<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.380> out<00:03:00.530> very

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
I'm making sure that I take it out very

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.940 
I'm making sure that I take it out very
slowly<00:03:01.510> because<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.600> don't<00:03:02.840> want<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.470> snag

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
slowly because I don't want it to snag

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.380 
slowly because I don't want it to snag
on<00:03:04.220> my<00:03:04.400> hair<00:03:04.700> causing<00:03:05.180> any<00:03:05.570> tears<00:03:05.900> or<00:03:06.170> rips<00:03:07.390> so

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
on my hair causing any tears or rips so

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.449 
on my hair causing any tears or rips so
I<00:03:08.420> was<00:03:08.660> really<00:03:08.870> liking<00:03:09.200> how<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.620> curl<00:03:10.010> looked

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
I was really liking how the curl looked

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.570 
I was really liking how the curl looked
as<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:11.180> was<00:03:11.330> taking<00:03:11.660> them<00:03:11.810> down<00:03:12.020> I<00:03:15.400> thought<00:03:16.400> that

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
as I was taking them down I thought that

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.550 
as I was taking them down I thought that
they<00:03:16.700> were<00:03:16.790> looking<00:03:17.030> pretty<00:03:17.239> nicely<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.290> was

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
they were looking pretty nicely so I was

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.030 
they were looking pretty nicely so I was
really<00:03:18.739> excited<00:03:19.489> about<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:21.080> possible

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
really excited about the possible

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.940 
really excited about the possible
outcome<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:23.630> here<00:03:23.870> I'm<00:03:23.989> just<00:03:24.020> trying<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.620> fluff

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
outcome so here I'm just trying to fluff

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.040 
outcome so here I'm just trying to fluff
up<00:03:25.130> my<00:03:25.310> roots<00:03:25.670> because<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.150> felt<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.900> was

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
up my roots because I felt like it was

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.860 
up my roots because I felt like it was
too<00:03:27.230> flat<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:28.430> didn't<00:03:28.790> have<00:03:28.970> as<00:03:29.270> much<00:03:29.480> volume

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
too flat it didn't have as much volume

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.500 
too flat it didn't have as much volume
as<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.380> would<00:03:30.590> have<00:03:30.650> liked<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.000> played<00:03:32.330> around

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
as I would have liked so I played around

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.900 
as I would have liked so I played around
with<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.050> style<00:03:33.350> as<00:03:33.620> much<00:03:33.860> as<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.190> could<00:03:34.250> until

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
with the style as much as I could until

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.240 
with the style as much as I could until
I<00:03:34.970> could<00:03:35.270> get<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.540> desired<00:03:36.110> shape<00:03:36.290> on<00:03:37.040> how<00:03:37.220> I

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
I could get a desired shape on how I

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.960 
I could get a desired shape on how I
wanted<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.090> look<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.459> initially<00:03:40.940> thought

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
wanted it to look so I initially thought

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.360 
wanted it to look so I initially thought
that<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.630> was<00:03:41.810> really<00:03:41.840> pretty<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.650> liked<00:03:43.070> how

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
that it was really pretty I liked how

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.990 
that it was really pretty I liked how
the<00:03:43.430> texture<00:03:44.299> came<00:03:44.660> out<00:03:45.130> but<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.580> was<00:03:46.760> still

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
the texture came out but I was still

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.080 
the texture came out but I was still
feeling<00:03:47.360> kind<00:03:48.019> of<00:03:48.140> unsure<00:03:48.320> about<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:49.580> here

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
feeling kind of unsure about it so here

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.229 
feeling kind of unsure about it so here
I'm<00:03:50.299> just<00:03:50.330> kind<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.810> showing<00:03:51.310> how<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.370> looked

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
I'm just kind of showing how I looked

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.170 
I'm just kind of showing how I looked
with<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.230> curls<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.100> liked<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.549> initially

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
with the curls and I liked it initially

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.080 
with the curls and I liked it initially
I<00:03:56.209> thought<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:56.989> was<00:03:57.140> very<00:03:57.320> cute<00:03:57.830> but<00:03:58.160> I

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
I thought that it was very cute but I

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.509 
I thought that it was very cute but I
was<00:03:59.660> still<00:03:59.840> feeling<00:04:00.110> unsure<00:04:00.470> as<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.130> said<00:04:01.370> it

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
was still feeling unsure as I said it

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.110 
was still feeling unsure as I said it
before<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.299> decided<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:03.019> pin<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.130> up<00:04:04.310> only

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
before so I decided to pin it up only

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.560 
before so I decided to pin it up only
because<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:05.600> was<00:04:05.870> headed<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.799> meeting<00:04:07.570> where

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
because I was headed to a meeting where

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.590 
because I was headed to a meeting where
I<00:04:08.600> had<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.080> give<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.680> small<00:04:10.340> presentation<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:11.540> I

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
I had to give a small presentation and I

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.620 
I had to give a small presentation and I
just<00:04:11.900> felt<00:04:12.110> like<00:04:12.170> my<00:04:12.410> hair<00:04:12.860> just<00:04:13.760> wasn't<00:04:14.239> doing

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
just felt like my hair just wasn't doing

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.930 
just felt like my hair just wasn't doing
it<00:04:14.989> for<00:04:15.830> what<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.010> was<00:04:16.250> going<00:04:16.609> for

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
it for what I was going for

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.280 
it for what I was going for
so<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.330> pinned<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.930> up<00:04:18.080> as<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.410> can<00:04:18.590> see<00:04:20.229> so<00:04:21.229> I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
so I pinned it up as you can see so I

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.460 
so I pinned it up as you can see so I
just<00:04:21.560> decided<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:22.070> rock<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:23.630> rock<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.200> way

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
just decided to rock to rock it this way

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.440 
just decided to rock to rock it this way
I<00:04:24.740> felt<00:04:25.130> like<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.580> just<00:04:25.610> looked<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.120> little<00:04:26.240> bit

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
I felt like it just looked a little bit

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.870 
I felt like it just looked a little bit
better<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.200> it<00:04:27.800> was<00:04:27.860> more<00:04:28.130> presentable<00:04:28.520> for

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
better and it was more presentable for

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.900 
better and it was more presentable for
what<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.030> was<00:04:29.210> going<00:04:29.510> for<00:04:29.750> or<00:04:29.930> for<00:04:30.169> work<00:04:33.910> so

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
what I was going for or for work so

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.210 
what I was going for or for work so
after<00:04:35.210> some<00:04:35.450> adjustment<00:04:36.140> on<00:04:36.380> my<00:04:36.410> bangs<00:04:36.860> and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
after some adjustment on my bangs and

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:57.040 
after some adjustment on my bangs and
such<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.940> is<00:04:38.000> what<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.330> came<00:04:38.570> up<00:04:38.750> with

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.920 

this<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:57.860> my<00:04:58.009> hair<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.639> next<00:04:58.849> day<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.599> just

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
this is my hair the next day I just

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.219 
this is my hair the next day I just
slept<00:05:00.169> with<00:05:00.319> my<00:05:00.669> satin<00:05:01.669> bonnet<00:05:01.879> on<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.960> just

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
slept with my satin bonnet on and I just

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.080 
slept with my satin bonnet on and I just
got<00:05:03.440> up<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.830> morning<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.520> just<00:05:04.789> fluffed

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
got up in the morning and I just fluffed

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.990 
got up in the morning and I just fluffed
it<00:05:05.240> out<00:05:05.500> so<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.680> looked<00:05:06.949> more<00:05:07.039> like<00:05:07.580> just<00:05:07.879> the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
it out so it looked more like just the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.110 
it out so it looked more like just the
regular<00:05:08.180> twist<00:05:08.629> out<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.080> next<00:05:09.470> day<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:10.400> I

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
regular twist out the next day and I

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.379 
regular twist out the next day and I
actually<00:05:11.300> liked<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.720> results<00:05:12.440> better<00:05:13.210> here

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
actually liked the results better here

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.180 
actually liked the results better here
and<00:05:14.479> I'm<00:05:14.659> not<00:05:14.870> sure<00:05:15.080> if<00:05:15.530> because<00:05:15.860> of<00:05:16.099> the

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
and I'm not sure if because of the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.629 
and I'm not sure if because of the
definition<00:05:16.580> from<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.240> foil<00:05:17.949> came<00:05:18.949> out<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.520> my

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
definition from the foil came out and my

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.119 
definition from the foil came out and my
in<00:05:20.060> my<00:05:20.389> hair<00:05:20.629> still<00:05:20.900> had<00:05:21.139> that<00:05:21.319> actual<00:05:21.710> twist

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
in my hair still had that actual twist

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.300 
in my hair still had that actual twist
pattern<00:05:22.729> that<00:05:23.539> I<00:05:23.569> liked<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.229> it<00:05:24.620> shrunk<00:05:24.919> up<00:05:25.159> a

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
pattern that I liked and it shrunk up a

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.210 
pattern that I liked and it shrunk up a
little<00:05:25.490> bit<00:05:25.759> so<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.449> actually<00:05:27.020> liked<00:05:27.530> my<00:05:27.949> hair

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
little bit so I actually liked my hair

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.510 
little bit so I actually liked my hair
better<00:05:28.490> this<00:05:28.849> day<00:05:29.680> ironically<00:05:30.680> so<00:05:31.039> I<00:05:31.250> was

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
better this day ironically so I was

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:44.110 
better this day ironically so I was
happy<00:05:31.819> with<00:05:31.969> the<00:05:32.000> way<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.360> looked

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.180
