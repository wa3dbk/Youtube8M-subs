is a deeper way to get inside that tight
mid-back<00:04:55.450> groove<00:04:56.380> you're<00:04:56.920> going<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.160> create

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
mid-back groove you're going to create

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.720 
mid-back groove you're going to create
tension<00:04:58.060> by<00:04:58.930> flexing<00:04:59.710> and<00:04:59.830> then<00:04:59.920> extending

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
tension by flexing and then extending

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.490 
tension by flexing and then extending
the<00:05:00.820> spine<00:05:01.090> so<00:05:01.330> think<00:05:01.540> you're<00:05:01.630> sitting<00:05:02.020> up<00:05:02.140> and

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
the spine so think you're sitting up and

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.080 
the spine so think you're sitting up and
then<00:05:02.950> you're<00:05:03.160> leaning<00:05:03.520> as<00:05:03.610> far<00:05:03.790> back<00:05:03.910> as

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
then you're leaning as far back as

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.450 
then you're leaning as far back as
possible<00:05:04.120> look<00:05:04.690> at<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:04.930> pain<00:05:05.230> face<00:05:05.560> also

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
possible look at that pain face also

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.180 
possible look at that pain face also
