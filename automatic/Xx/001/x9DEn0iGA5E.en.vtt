00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.790
 type of bid so that you can 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.590

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.290

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 well we have bronzes and all these 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.159

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.610

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.960
 let's center with ibra and what you 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.960
 I come to say what I'm going to do will be a 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.670
 type of bid that you are going to be able to 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.670
 do then 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.479
 what I'm going to do will be something that 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.360
 It will be quite special where I will go 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.630
 to the other account to mine I will leave 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 here 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.800
 I remember that this account has for 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.950
 that you are from ps4 you still have two months of 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.220
 psn plus that is still a little higher 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.750
 its value but let's see I'm going to change here 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.790
 one second user 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.310
 we give to change user we 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.950

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.489
 we're going to get into the fifa there we have 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.310
 to close the application with this account 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.660
 and we get into the cifa with mine 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.310
 while it's loading, I'm going to 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:33.610
 explain how everything will go I'm going to put 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.650

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.390
 three hundred and fifty thousand coins 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:49.680
 then from there you go to 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:52.290
 go bidding and the winning bid d 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.079
 that at the end of the three days the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.180
 which is the one that has won the account 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.439
 with free and non-transferable sends me to the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.200

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:07.019
 he has won and I will pass him the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.819
 data and everything then now let's go 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.250
 there to the account I'm going to teach 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.280
 let's go to this that is still being 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.459
 loading and good kids to go 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.139

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.799
 get some large amount per per pound 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.060

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.340
 account and that also does not matter and 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.250
 Well now we're going to go that already 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.250

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.140
 to see if you are lucky about everything is very 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.080
 important to have a video or a picture of 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.659
