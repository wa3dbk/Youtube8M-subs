00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.740
 by charles henri writer of very good 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.869
 to be true 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.030
 hey thousands of sonic knuckles ideas that 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.220
 take care of your house they were green or they put 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.050
 to do nonsense at home and eat 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.030
 data in his chair and obviously what 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.010
 they stain so both enter a 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.530
 contest to win a new armchair 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.629
 But just entering the mane 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.000
 apparently ekman knew more about his nick 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.770
 in akers unfortunately lose and you 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.410
 blame ekman for the armchair 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.140
 this chapter was very fun was 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.060
 joke after joke my favorite part was 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.400
 when the man and sonny who are in the 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.500
 contest and discover that they know more about 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.570
 another than what they expected in america 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.910
 latina 'broadcast the chapters 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.280
 let's play musical friends and 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.440
 making you feel guilty in videos 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.140
 past I told you about a future chapter 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.270
 called I did not go was the other one in this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.920
 Sunni chapter that is blamed for things 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.080
 that he did not do and he tells them that the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.270
 antagonist could be metal sound and 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.490
 I was right this chapter already 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.090
 premiered in France and I'll leave you link 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.460
 that nobody 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.399
 friction plus added two new 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.020
 bad titles examples and who does not follow 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.600
 it occurs to me that they can be treated 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.359
 these and added two more spaces for 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.700
 future chapters more than a month ago 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.860
 my story about the sony chapter 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.539
 Cakes of San Valetta was unlocked 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.270
 for youtube sorry for not having it 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.459
 mentioned before sony crooners came to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.439
 the 3 million downloads 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.299
 before sara to talk about the saga of 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.789
 silver I would like to tell you about a 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.770
 character that appears in this saga and that 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.049
 it's from the first series of sony me 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.179
 I refer to Professor von Kleist the 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.750
 appeared in the chapter tale is made 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.939
 big 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.469
 ekman captures him to use his machine 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.450
 that makes everything great 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.640
 ekman uses it to make tale grow 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.400
 which not only increases its size but 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.620
 his appetite are and rescues the teacher and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.959
 return to normal to the truth 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.610
 I did not like this chapter I thought 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.950
 boring and I fell very bad 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.440
 live sausages that lived in the village 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.540
 which first defend to assume but 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.640
 they change their minds when being bribed by 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.859
 the man think I ever return to 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.150
 complain about any character from the town of 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.340
 sonic boom 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.980
 now that they know who is Professor von 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.110
 kléber we can start the comic the comic 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.819
 initial showing the world serves you 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.250
 where everyone lives dominated by the 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.110
 council silvera trained outside the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.239
 city ​​but is discovered by the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.670
 teacher who tells you that they put you down 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.040
 which is the only one capable of controlling the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.560
 portals of genesis conveniently 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.390
 one opens below them and silver lo 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.579
 saves which confirms the point of 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.040
 teacher so he takes it with the 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.439
 council which reveals its secret that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.230
 I think more than one will seem familiar 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.819
 no doubt it was an interesting start and I 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.709
 Glad you were given a second 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.139
 opportunity to the teacher seems a 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.389
 interesting character with a rare accent 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.280
 that's all for today but do not forget 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.090
 be on the lookout only in the jazz channel 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.090
 blues changing
