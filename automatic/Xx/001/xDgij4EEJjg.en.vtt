00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
mitral valve prolapse is in Sara's case

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
mitral valve prolapse is in Sara's case
yeah<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> show<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.579> over<00:00:44.700> here

yeah so I'm going to show you over here

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.840 
yeah so I'm going to show you over here
on<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.750> ultrasound<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.700> an

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
on the ultrasound and this is an

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.369 
on the ultrasound and this is an
ultrasound<00:00:48.539> recording<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> same

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
ultrasound recording which is the same

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.729 
ultrasound recording which is the same
technology<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.010> use<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.640> look<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:51.000> babies<00:00:51.750> when

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
technology we use to look at babies when

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.220 
technology we use to look at babies when
women<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.280> pregnant<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.930> valve

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
women are pregnant and this is the valve

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
women are pregnant and this is the valve
which<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> doorway<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.820> connects<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> top

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
view here is what tickles the heart or

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.200 
view here is what tickles the heart or
irritates<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> causes<00:01:29.850> our<00:01:30.000> heart<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
irritates it and causes our heart to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
irritates it and causes our heart to
skip<00:01:30.540> beats<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> symptoms<00:01:31.619> that

yeah now the left side is what what a
normal<00:01:39.329> heart<00:01:39.479> looks<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> blue

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
normal heart looks like this is the blue

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.660 
normal heart looks like this is the blue

it's<00:01:42.360> being<00:01:42.630> pumped<00:01:42.899> off<00:01:43.079> into<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> lungs

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it's being pumped off into the lungs

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
it's being pumped off into the lungs
that's<00:01:43.950> getting<00:01:44.189> oxygenated<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.479> it's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that's getting oxygenated and then it's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
that's getting oxygenated and then it's
collected<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.320> left<00:01:46.619> upper<00:01:47.009> chamber

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
collected in this left upper chamber
called<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> left<00:01:47.759> atrium<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.540> goes<00:01:48.750> down

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
ventricle and that gets pumped out to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.929

the left collecting in the left atrium

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.240 
the left collecting in the left atrium
and<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.060> as<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:01.170> leaflets<00:02:01.860> close

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and you can see as the leaflets close

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.429 
and you can see as the leaflets close
they<00:02:02.759> balloon<00:02:03.240> upward<00:02:03.869> which<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.290> the

they balloon upward which is the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.039 
they balloon upward which is the
prolapse<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.909> stretches<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
prolapse and as it stretches as that

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.960 
prolapse and as it stretches as that
leaflet<00:02:07.469> stretches<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.129> doesn't<00:02:08.759> close

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
leaflet stretches it doesn't close

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.270 
leaflet stretches it doesn't close
correctly<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.170> blood<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.619> leaks<00:02:10.920> back

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
correctly and the blood then leaks back

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.339 
correctly and the blood then leaks back
where<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.760> regurgitates<00:02:12.180> into<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.110> left

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
where it regurgitates into the left

where it regurgitates into the left
upper<00:02:13.680> chain

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890

amber and that extra volume of blood can
tickle<00:02:17.130> or<00:02:17.310> irritate<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> heart<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.330> cause

tickle or irritate the heart and cause
skip<00:02:19.050> beats<00:02:19.290> palpitations<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.760> lot<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
skip beats palpitations and a lot of the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.320 
skip beats palpitations and a lot of the
symptoms<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.510> Sarah's<00:02:21.990> experiencing<00:02:22.560> and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
symptoms that Sarah's experiencing and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.610 
symptoms that Sarah's experiencing and
that's<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.450> great<00:02:24.630> explanation<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.500> in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
that's a great explanation because in

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.290 
that's a great explanation because in
the<00:02:25.709> end<00:02:25.860> your<00:02:26.130> cardiovascular<00:02:26.760> system

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the end your cardiovascular system

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.120 
the end your cardiovascular system
it's<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.750> plumbing<00:02:28.140> system<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.980> that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
it's a plumbing system with that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.010 
it's a plumbing system with that
prolapse<00:02:29.640> things<00:02:30.360> are<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> wrong

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
prolapse things are going in the wrong

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.660 
prolapse things are going in the wrong
direction<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:32.040> get<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.220> heart<00:02:32.370> tickled

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
direction you can get the heart tickled

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.400 
direction you can get the heart tickled
so<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:33.930> thing<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.110> want<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.290> highlight

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
so the one thing I want to highlight

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
so the one thing I want to highlight
because<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> lot<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.070> folks<00:02:35.370> get<00:02:35.850> these

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
because a lot of folks get these

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.060 
because a lot of folks get these
palpitations<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:37.080> people<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.590> ER<00:02:37.860> all

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
palpitations I see people in the ER all

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.880 
palpitations I see people in the ER all
the<00:02:38.310> time<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.850> they<00:02:39.780> may<00:02:40.080> not<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.620> the
