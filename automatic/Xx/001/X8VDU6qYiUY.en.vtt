and it doesn't even twist because of the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.340 
and it doesn't even twist because of the
extra<00:00:40.870> I<00:00:41.110> don't<00:00:41.290> know<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.440> extra<00:00:41.680> torsion

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
extra I don't know the extra torsion

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.580 
extra I don't know the extra torsion
metal<00:00:44.350> collars<00:00:44.710> they<00:00:44.950> use<00:00:45.160> as<00:00:45.460> well<00:00:46.000> as<00:00:46.120> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
metal collars they use as well as the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.240 
metal collars they use as well as the
construction<00:00:47.590> within<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.070> rules<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.950> then

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
construction within the rules and then

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.360 
construction within the rules and then
even<00:00:51.970> though<00:00:52.210> it's<00:00:52.630> very<00:00:52.780> rigid<00:00:53.170> they<00:00:54.040> still

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
even though it's very rigid they still

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.830 
even though it's very rigid they still
have<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.910> leveling<00:00:55.720> Center<00:00:56.050> ball<00:00:56.230> if<00:00:56.470> you<00:00:56.530> like

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
have a leveling Center ball if you like

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.620 
have a leveling Center ball if you like
with<00:00:58.840> a<00:00:58.870> full<00:00:59.170> extension<00:00:59.560> column<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:00.970> you<00:01:01.420> can

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
with a full extension column so you can

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.720 
with a full extension column so you can
always<00:01:01.840> level<00:01:02.260> out<00:01:02.380> on<00:01:02.590> uneven<00:01:02.980> ground<00:01:03.310> right

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
always level out on uneven ground right

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.040 
always level out on uneven ground right
so<00:01:03.910> you<00:01:03.970> meet<00:01:04.119> yourself<00:01:04.180> stable<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:04.870> then<00:01:04.989> you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
so you meet yourself stable and then you

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.570 
so you meet yourself stable and then you
can<00:01:05.199> use<00:01:05.379> this<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.710> that's<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.040> hope<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.430> like

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
can use this and that's it hope you like

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.280 
can use this and that's it hope you like
it<00:01:06.729> set<00:01:06.970> it<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.270> then<00:01:07.420> just<00:01:07.659> move<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.990> level

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
it set it and then just move the level

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.780 
it set it and then just move the level
until<00:01:08.530> you're<00:01:08.770> on<00:01:08.800> level<00:01:09.010> terrain

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
until you're on level terrain

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.070 
until you're on level terrain
and<00:01:10.090> there's<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.300> number<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.659> heads<00:01:10.840> in<00:01:10.990> a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
and there's a number of heads in a

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.270 
and there's a number of heads in a
number<00:01:11.260> of<00:01:11.350> different<00:01:11.620> systems<00:01:11.950> like<00:01:12.130> this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
number of different systems like this

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.010 
number of different systems like this
they<00:01:12.640> have<00:01:12.790> they<00:01:13.120> have<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.450> from<00:01:13.600> tabletop

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
they have they have it from tabletop

come up to I 64 inches and it will

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.140 
come up to I 64 inches and it will
collapse<00:01:29.320> down<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.710> 20<00:01:30.010> inches<00:01:30.280> now<00:01:30.880> for<00:01:31.030> this

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
collapse down to 20 inches now for this

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.240 
collapse down to 20 inches now for this
one<00:01:31.270> what<00:01:31.390> is<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.540> price<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:31.869> this<00:01:32.010> this<00:01:33.010> one
