00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
school I don't know about

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.850 
school I don't know about
you<00:02:24.390> guys<00:02:24.570> if<00:02:25.020> you've<00:02:25.170> ever<00:02:25.350> been<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.650> summer

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
you guys if you've ever been to summer

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.320 
you guys if you've ever been to summer
school<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.520> there's<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.790> lot<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.030> hot<00:02:27.300> chicks

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
school but there's a lot of hot chicks

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.060 
school but there's a lot of hot chicks
generally<00:02:28.110> hot<00:02:28.260> chicks<00:02:28.530> are<00:02:28.650> really<00:02:28.890> stupid

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
generally hot chicks are really stupid

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.800 
generally hot chicks are really stupid
so<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.520> kind<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.760> makes<00:02:29.910> sense<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.330> didn't

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
so it kind of makes sense I didn't

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.840 
so it kind of makes sense I didn't
understand<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.380> until<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> few<00:02:31.890> days<00:02:32.070> ago<00:02:32.130> but

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
understand that until a few days ago but

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.700 
understand that until a few days ago but
I<00:02:32.880> kind<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.270> figured<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.630> out<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.080> there<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.680> a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
I kind of figured it out so there is a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.260 
I kind of figured it out so there is a
lot<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.040> hot<00:02:35.280> chicks<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.610> summer<00:02:35.820> school<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
lot of hot chicks in summer school and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.400 
lot of hot chicks in summer school and
the<00:02:36.330> reason<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.690> there's<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.990> lot<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.170> hot

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
the reason that there's a lot of hot

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.140 
the reason that there's a lot of hot
chicks<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.770> summer<00:02:37.980> school<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.250> because<00:02:38.730> they

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
chicks in summer school is because they

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.000 
chicks in summer school is because they
are<00:02:39.330> really<00:02:39.810> really<00:02:40.170> stupid<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.830> don't

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
are really really stupid I don't

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.920 
are really really stupid I don't
understand<00:02:41.400> why<00:02:41.640> they're<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.000> stupid<00:02:42.240> but
