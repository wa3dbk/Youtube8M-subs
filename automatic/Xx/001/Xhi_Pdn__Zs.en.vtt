00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
little bit obviously um I think it took

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.270 
little bit obviously um I think it took
two<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.370> three<00:00:44.700> weeks<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
two or three weeks to get here and

two or three weeks to get here and
that's<00:00:47.280> okay<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:48.230> if<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> works<00:00:49.620> why<00:00:49.860> not
