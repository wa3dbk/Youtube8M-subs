00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi all a story of Krivoy Rog 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.599
 which is a strange way to respond to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.550
 requests for help from the citizens of Ukraine are cold 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.889
 make up the situation happened all 19 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.969
 March, I just turned out to be my workers 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.410
 on Kosior Street 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.180
 all of it after we decide to go out I see 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.640
 following stasu as official 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 car 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.920
 Traffic Police dreams or drivers for 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.359
 apparently 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 inserts administrative stuff 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.570
 the driver at that time was in 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.120
 official car that telegram there 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.780
 Deputy Department of Traffic Police of Ukraine 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.550
 forbidding to do i would get into the car 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.730
 I think I'll wait and see what situations 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.649
 the driver will continue to develop twice 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.480
 got out of the company car sat down 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.460
 in your car and well bring the day and for 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.289
 that business came back to us 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.570
 he came out with documents the second time 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.000
 it's all on the video you can see sat and the whole 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.420
 visibility left I see the situation decided 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.670
 ask the traffic police staff 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.080
 and what happened there approached them 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 opened the window 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.360
 I saw an inspector who was behind 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.740
 driving in no way responded 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.900
 but ready to give on the gas and give deru 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.640
 supposedly taken aback by this situation I think 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.130
 somewhere at the traffic lights other company 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.700
 it becomes i 'm approaching them 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 let's talk and here it was all that from this 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 prius could squeeze they survived 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.600
 around the city violating the rights of the road 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.210
 pedestrian traffic without missing 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.610
 red blue without flashing beacons 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.040
 there included a right turn driving straight 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 with a sea ​​of ​​violations, I doubt that it was 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.330
 did not manage such actions 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.430
 traffic police officers 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.980
 but that is, immediately after this immediately 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.710
 turned to the traffic police of the city directly to 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.320
 the head of the traffic police did not say yes if 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.550
 there are such actions illegal employee 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.030
 traffic police please write statement 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.120
 attach a disk and we will consider attracted 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.310
 punish responsible but as to 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.660
 I have not addressed this once 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.810
 I will erase to the management of traffic police there with statements 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.810
 video applied by violation 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.840
 employee overuse 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.940
 city ​​traffic police and when 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.470
 intelligible answers I did not get something 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.050
 there was always an answer such that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.540
 traffic police officers in employee actions 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.540
 traffic violations not identified acted there 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.240
 under the law, everything that is in 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.340
 this case decided that again the situation 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.490
 will not budge decided to go to 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.700
 the prosecutor's office became a statement within 30 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.010
 days we will see what happens 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.780
 here many will say yes well that there are 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.310
 situations happen every day it's not 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.290
 the worst is that we are the driver of the car 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.480
 I pull out a hundred percent agree 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.080
 there was nothing criminal 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.560
 normal such realities 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.750
 traffic police of Ukraine but I just call everyone 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.880
 who have the opportunity not to pass by 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.040
 here you see the situation can help 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.080
 a man to give yes there some help 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.760
 be as loyal as possible 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.010
 as calmly as possible in communication 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.720
 traffic police officers do not stay 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.820
 indifferent to these all situations every 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.350
 I make this my hand then I think 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.430
 socks then 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.880
 a little bit sorry the changes will be 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.500
 something like this is why guys 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.500
