00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello everyone this time I'll explain 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:10.320
 how to connect the computer 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.920
 and a sound system via bluetooth 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.250
 the sound system does not have bluetooth 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.900
 usually they do not have bluetooh 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.480
 sound equipment unless it is a very 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.260
 sophisticated but this time we're going to 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.230
 use this bluetooth accessory 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.970
 wireless to listen to music and this 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.570
 will not help connect us with the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.210
 team 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.760
 what is needed is this accessory 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 wireless bluetooth 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.989
 what is something like a pair of a 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.269
 wireless hearing aid this is the cable 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 that we connect to the auxiliary outputs 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:54.610
 of the team and this we connect here and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.790
 we have the computer 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.700
 This computer does not have bluetooth not 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.329
 comes full but we have not placed your 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.600
 bluetooth usb card 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.860
 Now I 'm going to explain how to do 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.860
 configuration on the computer 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.960
 hello everyone continuing I think we're going to 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.930
 install the driver on the pc to 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.550
 be able to listen to music on the computer 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.550
 this computer or store 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.670
 note bluetooth so 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.800
 We will install the 'bluetooth' light that 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.600
 this this 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.600
 at this moment we are connecting 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.810
 and the computer starts to install 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.470
 automatically the driver is what 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.470
 is doing at this moment 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.680
 and will find a controller and then what 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.490
 goes 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.960
 She is going to download and install it 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.150
 I will automatically put a pause 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.270
 while the team is doing this 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.270
 area 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.950
 continuing with the recording with the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.370
 configuration has already finished downloading 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.170
 All controls for bluetooth 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.170
 and this part of ccoo is already 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.920
 now let's go let's 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.200
 to turn on wireless device 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.760
 I'm lighting it in this 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.580
 moment I keep it pressed during 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.970
 a few seconds the blue light stayed fixed 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.190
 is already on then I'm going to this 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.820
 part of the control panel devices 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.820
 and printers 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.700
 and we are going to add 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.650
 the wireless the wireless sound 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.750
 it does not appear let's go to add a 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.760
 device 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.830
 it detects it quickly 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.520
 I give next 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.380
 is connecting the device 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.050
 you are not configuring this moment 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.030
 installing the software 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.730
 and well you have to wait a bit for that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.040
 finished installation indicates that the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.120
 device was added correctly this 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.600
 team but still installing the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.670
 drivers you have to wait a bit 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.480
 I will place again pause while 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.480
 continue installing 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.010
 already apparently finished installing the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.329
 controllers 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.980
 and at this moment you have seen the 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.680
 device to work as the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.439
 work in this way we put button 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.420
 right the speaker icon we put 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.970
 playback devices 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.040
 this is when we want to hear from 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.019
 wireless way 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.810
 the speaker is linked to what we're going to 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.650
 disable by a number 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.079
 automatically activate stereo and in 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.870
 one what are you going to use the player 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.069
 bluetooth of this at this moment already 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.620
 is 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.680
 and we are going to do and we are ready to 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.140
 listen to music 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.750
 by the computer through the 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.950
 computer 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.950
 how are we going to listen to music 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.460
 that would be all ready 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.229
 good continued with the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.520
 with the final part of how to do 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.979
 listen to music on a sound system 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.370
 wirelessly from the computer already 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.100
 we have the computer configured 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.350
 we have our 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.180
 bluetooth wireless accessory and 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.630
 stable to connect with the team 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.630
 of sounds 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:53.960
 let's change the device 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.330
 reproduction 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.389
 is on loudspeakers this we're going to 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.639
 disable and we will automatically 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.210
 enabled what is the device 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.210
 bluetooth 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.300
 That is what we will light 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.300
 we work for a few seconds 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.710
 then it stays fixed 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:24.160
 and this indicates that it is already ready 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.160
 now let's connect to the team 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.120
 we have here 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.120
 in the second in the field of cables 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.930
 and this is the team of functions 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.060
 in auxiliary output 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.750
 and the back 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.480
 auxiliary let's connect my cable 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.530
 over here 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.500
 what we reproduce at this moment the 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.500
 computer will come out 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.909
 with the team 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.599
 a music 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.320
 and it's playing by the team 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.320
 sound let's go up volume 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.630
 in this way they can comfortably 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:48.280
 listen to music from your computer 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.680
 but being reproduced in a team of 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.610
 sound that has better fidelity and 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:58.460
 it sounds much better than a couple of 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:08:00.270
 computer speakers 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:04.730
 that's all dust 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.730
 in this video thank you so much later
