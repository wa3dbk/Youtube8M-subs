skin in order to achieve this standard

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.649 
skin in order to achieve this standard
of<00:02:01.500> beauty<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> many<00:02:02.880> people<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.360> say<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
of beauty and many people can say that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.859 
of beauty and many people can say that
about<00:02:04.909> plastic<00:02:05.909> surgery<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.390> any<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.780> of

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
about plastic surgery in any kind of

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.770 
about plastic surgery in any kind of
like<00:02:07.049> cosmetic<00:02:07.590> surgery<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.129> general<00:02:08.720> but<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
like cosmetic surgery in general but I

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.660 
like cosmetic surgery in general but I
still<00:02:10.110> think<00:02:10.440> that's<00:02:10.649> different<00:02:11.160> than

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
still think that's different than

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.490 
still think that's different than
putting<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.120> chemical<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.840> your<00:02:13.020> face

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
putting a chemical on your face

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.270 
putting a chemical on your face
to<00:02:14.280> change<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:15.020> because<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.200> think<00:02:16.530> while

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
to change it because you think while

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.640 
to change it because you think while
you're<00:02:17.460> fine<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:18.030> your<00:02:18.180> race<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.720> suppose<00:02:19.350> but

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you're fine with your race I suppose but

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.850 
you're fine with your race I suppose but
you<00:02:19.860> feel<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:21.660> want<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.290> be<00:02:22.410> lighter

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you feel like you want to be lighter

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.820 
you feel like you want to be lighter
because<00:02:23.400> being<00:02:23.670> lighter<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.480> better<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.320> I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
because being lighter is better and I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.530 
because being lighter is better and I
think<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.460> opinion<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
think it's just that opinion that's a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.650 
think it's just that opinion that's a
little<00:02:27.810> bit<00:02:28.110> offensive<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.250> me<00:02:29.400> because<00:02:30.330> I

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
little bit offensive to me because I

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.130 
little bit offensive to me because I
feel<00:02:30.990> like<00:02:31.170> you're<00:02:31.410> rejecting<00:02:32.780> me<00:02:33.780> well<00:02:34.080> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
feel like you're rejecting me well the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.540 
feel like you're rejecting me well the
truth<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.440> you're<00:02:34.560> not<00:02:34.709> even<00:02:34.890> rejecting<00:02:35.310> me<00:02:35.430> or

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
truth is you're not even rejecting me or

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.980 
truth is you're not even rejecting me or
rejecting<00:02:35.970> yourself<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.510> has<00:02:36.600> nothing<00:02:36.810> to

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
rejecting yourself and it has nothing to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.199 
rejecting yourself and it has nothing to
do<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.200> me<00:02:37.410> at<00:02:37.500> all<00:02:37.650> but<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.310> think<00:02:38.730> it's

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
do with me at all but I just think it's

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.570 
do with me at all but I just think it's
one<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.420> those<00:02:39.570> topics<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.440> can't<00:02:40.740> be

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
one of those topics that I just can't be

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.010 
one of those topics that I just can't be
like<00:02:41.610> well<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.270> know<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> person<00:02:42.690> feels<00:02:42.870> this

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
like well you know the person feels this

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.510 
like well you know the person feels this
way<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.470> don't<00:02:43.680> feel<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> same

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
way because I don't feel it's the same

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.090 
way because I don't feel it's the same
thing<00:02:44.820> as<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.120> getting<00:02:45.300> boobs<00:02:45.840> or<00:02:46.380> getting<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
thing as like getting boobs or getting a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.350 
thing as like getting boobs or getting a
bigger<00:02:47.280> butt<00:02:47.520> I<00:02:47.640> don't<00:02:47.820> think<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> same

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
bigger butt I don't think it's the same

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.620 
bigger butt I don't think it's the same
thing<00:02:48.570> at<00:02:48.660> all<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.910> more<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.150> about

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
thing at all I think it is more so about

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.040 
thing at all I think it is more so about
colonialism<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.800> brainwashing<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
colonialism and brainwashing and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.570 
colonialism and brainwashing and
instilling<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.260> deep<00:02:55.500> sense<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:56.070> hate<00:02:56.340> in

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
instilling a deep sense of hate in

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.020 
instilling a deep sense of hate in
oneself<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.690> one's<00:02:57.930> melon<00:02:58.500> ated<00:02:58.739> beauty<00:02:59.220> in

oneself and one's melon ated beauty in
order<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.720> achieve<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> standard<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.060> not

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
order to achieve a standard that is not

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.660

that's what you really want why don't

that's what you really want why don't
you<00:03:35.519> just<00:03:35.700> go<00:03:35.850> ten<00:03:36.090> or<00:03:36.450> whatever<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.110> make

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
you just go ten or whatever and make

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.870 
you just go ten or whatever and make
yourself<00:03:37.680> darker<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.070> match<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.400> why<00:03:38.700> do<00:03:38.760> you

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
yourself darker to match that why do you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.080 
yourself darker to match that why do you
have<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.090> go<00:03:39.209> with<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.420> lighter<00:03:39.660> skin<00:03:39.900> tone<00:03:40.080> I

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.850 

mean<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.510> mean<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.260> guess<00:03:46.410> there's<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> lot<00:03:46.739> of

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
mean I mean I guess there's a lot of

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.180 
mean I mean I guess there's a lot of
argument<00:03:47.310> for<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:48.440> but<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.500> often<00:03:50.040> think

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
argument for it and but I often think

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.830 
argument for it and but I often think
that<00:03:50.280> when<00:03:50.459> people<00:03:50.610> talk<00:03:51.060> about<00:03:51.600> skin

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
that when people talk about skin

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.620 
that when people talk about skin
