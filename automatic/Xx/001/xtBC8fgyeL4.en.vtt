00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
Thunderbolt here's the HTC Thunderbolt

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.000 
Thunderbolt here's the HTC Thunderbolt
looking<00:04:43.080> at<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.260> same<00:04:43.440> place<00:04:43.650> as<00:04:43.980> the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
looking at the same place as the

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.700 
looking at the same place as the
fascinate<00:04:47.120> go<00:04:48.120> ahead<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.480> look<00:04:49.020> down<00:04:49.290> see<00:04:49.680> how

fascinate go ahead and look down see how

00:04:49.710 --> 00:05:12.850 
fascinate go ahead and look down see how
we<00:04:49.860> focus<00:04:51.620> tap<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.890> focus

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.020 

there<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:14.010> have<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.340> comparison<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:14.910> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
there you have the comparison of the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.790 
there you have the comparison of the
cameras<00:05:15.390> between<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.840> fascinate<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.590> the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
cameras between the fascinate and the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.770 
cameras between the fascinate and the
Thunderbolt<00:05:17.370> one<00:05:18.000> thing<00:05:18.240> to<00:05:18.390> note<00:05:18.570> is<00:05:18.600> the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
Thunderbolt one thing to note is the

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.990 
Thunderbolt one thing to note is the
Thunderbolt<00:05:19.410> has<00:05:19.620> a<00:05:19.650> front<00:05:20.190> facing<00:05:20.250> camera

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
Thunderbolt has a front facing camera

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.690 
Thunderbolt has a front facing camera
while<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.780> fascinate<00:05:22.320> does<00:05:22.500> not<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:22.980> I<00:05:23.280> didn't

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
while the fascinate does not so I didn't

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.000 
while the fascinate does not so I didn't
think<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:23.940> was<00:05:24.030> fair<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.270> compare<00:05:24.480> that

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
think it was fair to compare that

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.230 
think it was fair to compare that
however<00:05:26.010> if<00:05:26.430> you<00:05:26.550> want<00:05:26.730> to<00:05:26.790> see<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.060> front

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
however if you want to see the front

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.940 
however if you want to see the front
facing<00:05:27.600> camera<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.230> Thunderbolt<00:05:28.710> check

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950
