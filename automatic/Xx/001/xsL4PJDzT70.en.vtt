00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
to experiment with there's so many

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
kind of purity level and then some sort

kind of purity level and then some sort
of

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
of

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.569

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
or grape and rum just seems to be a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.020 
or grape and rum just seems to be a
little<00:02:19.359> more<00:02:19.599> versatile<00:02:20.139> to<00:02:20.349> me<00:02:20.819> but<00:02:21.819> I<00:02:21.849> could

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
little more versatile to me but I could

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.599 
little more versatile to me but I could
just<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.480> run<00:02:23.730> who<00:02:24.730> does<00:02:24.969> it<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:26.349> don't<00:02:27.159> know<00:02:27.400> I

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
just like run who does it I don't know I

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.220 
just like run who does it I don't know I
bet<00:02:27.939> you<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.150> google<00:02:28.569> for<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.719> hate<00:02:29.019> rum

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
bet you if you google for I hate rum

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.330 
bet you if you google for I hate rum
there'll<00:02:29.439> be<00:02:29.469> some<00:02:29.709> money<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.099> don't<00:02:33.280> know

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
there'll be some money but I don't know

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.099 
there'll be some money but I don't know
who<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.549> person<00:02:33.609> would<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.359> what<00:02:34.959> their

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
who that person would be in what their

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:42.239 
who that person would be in what their
problem<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:37.950> they're<00:02:38.950> stupid<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:42.040> just

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.249 
problem is they're stupid I'm just

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.709 
problem is they're stupid I'm just
trying<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.489> kick<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.879> to<00:02:42.909> the<00:02:43.060> next<00:02:43.239> level

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
trying to kick it to the next level

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.899 
trying to kick it to the next level
apparently<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.829> know<00:02:44.980> kind<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.519> that's<00:02:45.760> why<00:02:45.879> I

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
apparently you know kind of that's why I

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:52.580 
apparently you know kind of that's why I
do<00:02:46.030> here<00:02:46.299> oh<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:48.639> syrupy<00:02:49.030> sweet<00:02:49.680> whoa

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
do here oh this is so syrupy sweet whoa

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.809 
do here oh this is so syrupy sweet whoa
burn<00:02:53.590> out<00:02:53.709> your<00:02:53.859> retina<00:02:54.189> with<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.519> sweetness

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
burn out your retina with that sweetness

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.319 
burn out your retina with that sweetness
just<00:02:55.769> one<00:02:56.769> right<00:02:56.980> now<00:02:59.250> that's<00:03:00.329> redundancy

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
just one right now that's redundancy

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.490 
just one right now that's redundancy
that's<00:03:02.319> nothing<00:03:02.709> new<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:02.949> depth<00:03:03.250> perception

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.220 

and<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.650> will<00:03:08.769> notice<00:03:09.419> the<00:03:10.419> drink<00:03:10.719> contents

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
and you will notice the drink contents

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.869 
and you will notice the drink contents
are<00:03:11.349> not<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.709> big<00:03:11.919> so<00:03:12.129> I<00:03:12.159> chose<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.730> use<00:03:12.760> a

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
are not that big so I chose to use a

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.929 
are not that big so I chose to use a
thinner<00:03:14.129> cocktail<00:03:15.129> glass<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:15.579> opposed<00:03:15.849> to

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
thinner cocktail glass as opposed to

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.509 
thinner cocktail glass as opposed to
like<00:03:16.060> one<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.389> deep<00:03:16.569> ones<00:03:17.340> double<00:03:18.340> your

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
like one of the deep ones double your

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.149 
like one of the deep ones double your
recipe<00:03:20.609> yeah<00:03:21.609> if<00:03:21.669> it<00:03:21.819> was<00:03:21.909> a<00:03:21.970> thicker<00:03:22.180> glass<00:03:22.479> Oh

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
recipe yeah if it was a thicker glass Oh

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.559 
recipe yeah if it was a thicker glass Oh
thicker<00:03:24.159> like<00:03:24.519> yeah<00:03:25.030> you're<00:03:25.239> right<00:03:25.389> it

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
thicker like yeah you're right it

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.729 
thicker like yeah you're right it
doesn't<00:03:25.780> make<00:03:25.870> sense<00:03:25.900> thinner<00:03:26.430> lengthwise

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
doesn't make sense thinner lengthwise

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.119 
doesn't make sense thinner lengthwise
deeper<00:03:30.060> yeah<00:03:31.090> holds<00:03:31.659> more<00:03:31.780> contents<00:03:32.379> that's

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
deeper yeah holds more contents that's

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.979 
deeper yeah holds more contents that's
probably<00:03:33.489> like<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.669> four<00:03:34.419> ounce<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:34.870> other

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
probably like a four ounce the other

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.569 
probably like a four ounce the other
ones<00:03:35.139> like<00:03:35.259> six<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.709> eight<00:03:35.799> why<00:03:36.310> are<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.459> not

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
ones like six and eight why are you not

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:48.580 
ones like six and eight why are you not
eight<00:03:36.759> it<00:03:37.419> would<00:03:37.540> become<00:03:37.810> intense<00:03:38.169> anyway

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.410 

and<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:50.340> other<00:03:50.520> reason<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.030> don't<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.240> this

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
and the other reason I don't think this

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.080 
and the other reason I don't think this
is<00:03:51.480> an<00:03:51.780> original<00:03:52.410> recipe<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.490> that<00:03:53.700> can<00:03:53.880> even

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
is an original recipe if that can even

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.030 
is an original recipe if that can even
exist<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.780> hate<00:03:55.230> people<00:03:55.410> who<00:03:55.590> tell<00:03:55.770> us<00:03:55.860> well<00:03:55.980> I

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
exist I hate people who tell us well I

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.530 
exist I hate people who tell us well I
don't<00:03:56.190> hate<00:03:56.310> people<00:03:56.340> at<00:03:56.640> all<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.120> dislike

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
don't hate people at all but I dislike

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.690 
don't hate people at all but I dislike
the<00:03:58.200> attitude<00:03:58.710> that<00:03:58.920> there's<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.220> recipe<00:03:59.670> that

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
the attitude that there's a recipe that

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.040 
the attitude that there's a recipe that
has<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.210> be<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:00.570> way

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
has to be this way

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.280 
has to be this way
any<00:04:01.800> deviation<00:04:02.100> from<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.790> you're<00:04:03.360> wrong<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:04.020> get

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
any deviation from it you're wrong I get

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.070 
any deviation from it you're wrong I get
that<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.470> lot<00:04:04.680> but<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.540> believe<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.840> original

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
that a lot but I believe the original

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.900 
that a lot but I believe the original
hurricane<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:07.980> at<00:04:08.100> least<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.370> saw<00:04:08.610> when<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.820> was

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
hurricane that at least I saw when I was

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.000 
hurricane that at least I saw when I was
in<00:04:09.230> New<00:04:10.230> Orleans<00:04:10.620> was<00:04:11.430> blue<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.530> I'm<00:04:13.590> guessing

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
in New Orleans was blue so I'm guessing

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.740 
in New Orleans was blue so I'm guessing
that<00:04:14.160> has<00:04:14.460> more<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.850> blue<00:04:15.000> curacao<00:04:15.510> or

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
that has more of blue curacao or

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.890 
that has more of blue curacao or
something<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.670> could<00:04:17.670> be<00:04:18.120> completely<00:04:18.359> wrong

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
something I could be completely wrong

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.690 
something I could be completely wrong
but<00:04:19.890> that's<00:04:20.100> odd

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
but that's odd

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.460 
but that's odd
there's<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.120> many<00:04:21.209> there's<00:04:21.480> like<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.080> blue<00:04:22.350> and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
there's so many there's like a blue and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.540 
there's so many there's like a blue and
a<00:04:22.560> pink<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.950> there's<00:04:23.070> different<00:04:23.340> drink

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
a pink and there's different drink
