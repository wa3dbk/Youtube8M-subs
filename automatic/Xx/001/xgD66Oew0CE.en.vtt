 I think he is sailing boats 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.170
 understand but you come to sail the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.850
 You also come across many limitations 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.990
 if you have little money and I'll come one 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 once 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.220

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.670

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.410
 industrial port for free and now comes 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.530

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.759
 absurd and I mean 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.730

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.819

 in the gangway the need comes and 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.379
 I can close my eyes and watch 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.269
 only to the model that you have to 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.219

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.909
