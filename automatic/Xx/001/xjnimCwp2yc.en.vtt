00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.729
 yes today welcome to dressing tutoria and Simon 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:06.700
 Stronghold Crusader online game so 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.840
 to have with you now is a program finder pay and that means that 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.510
 Theme pension and that finds the slips of this page 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.859
 that's exactly where it would often do 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.329
 he should have done the same thing with the same one 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:21.640
 Step to land 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.150
 the TuS himself installed and if he did not make it then he should 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.989
 It blames itself that can of course show that 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.550
 In any case, then quite a lot of games should be found on the Internet 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.230
 above is older Baiersbronn stands at the top 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.670
 because 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.400
 it's going to be exhausting and how is it coming? 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.380
 Illiterate scraper episode quite high up 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.819
 In the second half of the year, this and the concentration will be high 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.019
 that's easy, you can scroll down for the scroll down 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 there is 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.080
 For this 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.200
 in the game Stronghold Crusader is coming 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.340
 back then 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.410
 among students everything themselves they just become aware of the percent of Wenger 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.200
 to Stronghold Crusader the cove whole lot 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.320
 around 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.680
 However, I think so too, because I often do so 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.909
 that we do not have the game in yours yesterday 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.960
 then you just go to percent 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.710
 percent 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.259
 promptly shots were fired 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.580
 whether Schulz 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.550
 then there could be percent 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.800
 second 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.020
 that's where Bregenz could be 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.330
 could then and wanted 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.410
 and also so Strohm Hotspurs relative for example 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.490
 and if that does not do you, the videos just show 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.290
 and then he gives a deserved 3 league per each player has denied 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.370
 Then he just gets our window or he's standing there student stuff 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.410
 as 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.800
 instead wants to do 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.910
 sung-hyung Cho himself promo-trailer Stronghold Crusader the tape 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.340
 then kicks open 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.750
 and then 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.880
 up to about then would be finished so now the game in your list 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.650
 taken care of 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.880
 but that's what I'm always into the crowd all the time it could just be here too 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.910
 lying in the field 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.640
 and then on May that 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.660
 and landed right where you just Bruno your games and 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.069
 the very nice that he has history so now we come to the hostel and to 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.719
 should 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.539
 So if you use your house then up here, too, was rusting 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.879
 then such a window will appear 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.149
 that's right then shunk and shortwave 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:30.120
 maximum of 3 out of there could then enter 5 or 4 or 3 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.159
 the budget of master Alba 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.730
 So, for example, only that means Markus Zeller's Top Ten password 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.729
 must enter bad luck on okay 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.519
 and if he's now the chic preparing to measure St now he's waiting for it 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.769
 that is it can be earned it arises Import Restricted come Machu 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:48.619
 TAP 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:52.669
 Jens Mattern Action that we will conwert a polka öztürk under 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.659
 Mepha works by Cranach is the collision that's missing here 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:57.839
 there is a way to do it 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.309
 PregLem Borg to find out author is also for the program 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.420
 but we do not care about that 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.459
 Konzen EU if we are cultivated on Stan's normal cell 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.579
 the name IT but it looks like 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.610
 above is note 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.889
 4 cents 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.329
 &amp; Cie more i do not need anything yet 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.840
 then you are on the right side of the list 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.369
 stand by the names of the players who are degrees in your server 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.509
 and percent Lyon could then write into things like, for example 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:25.819
 Hello 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.289
 how does it work 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.209
 and then all the players in it have split you can just go to the floor 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.589
 and your game starts automatically with old people instead of the game 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:37.509
 automatically 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:43.069
 and you are a direct percent for the launch of Sport + Zeller where Jan 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.399
 Can not choose Kaden and so could choose more opponents where 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:47.519
 the teams could form 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.269
 yes, and then the rest of course, you have to go there yourself on the bottom right 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.919
 the hand you can start 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.659
 When he saw the war from my side I wish you much success with the customer 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:57.669
 play 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:58.589
 Until next time
