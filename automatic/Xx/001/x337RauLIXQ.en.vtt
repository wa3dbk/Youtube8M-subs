00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello in this video we're going to talk about 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.040
 how to clean that offers to us what 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.690
 that we normally use are siphons and there are 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.150
 of these two types really are very 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.620
 similar what changes is the size of 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.450
 the mouthpiece 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.030
 and the length of what wood is 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:24.730
 how it works 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:27.460
 that's all this what it does is it was 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.030
 makes a vacuum the gravel will stay here 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.220
 and by the air that enters it is stirred and 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.560
 all the dirt will come out that you are going to have 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 careful to have a bucket so that 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.600
 fall and the whole society 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.680
 it is important that only one change 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.500
 third of the central water of your fish tank 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.750
 you should always have at hand how 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.680
 refill it and the conditioners 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 what do you put on keep the social 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.260
 if you have a good filter and if you put 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.370
 you do not constantly need to make a 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.370
 total water change 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.729
 a week depending on the size of your 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.680
 fish tank or every three months 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.720
 equally depending on the amount of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.299
 fish and the news size is 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.690
 important that they do the and 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.510
 national 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.210
 will this part be introduced as well 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:28.980
 it fills with water starts to come out 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.980
 here you put it low and the bronze 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.049
 how can you notice 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.690
 start to leave 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.050
 the name of the lake 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.250
 this is important luck is the gravel and 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.250
 do the pressure again 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.540
 this is going to be done by zones you can 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.820
 take for example from this corner this 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.510
 corner all this box 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.050
 and you take it again after the water 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.720
 it has to come out transparent 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.560
 after effects in this case we 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.540
 we are here 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.900
 of garbage is released another piece 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.000
 and it's also important that you remember 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.340
 that the gravel does not reach up 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.010
 because because if not to cover the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.579
 hose or going out with it if you see 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.870
 the water was pretty much has a 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.870
 average of a week 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.260
 then you are going to see 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.880
 so frequent does this sense 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.670
 you can do for example this third 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.530
 that this piece is very big a week 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.530
 the next week 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.300
 remember to always put 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.510
 suitable conditioners for 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.510
 babies
