00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.820
 Some people like to come here and we come to 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.439
 another gameplay comments being 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.970
 no, just a comment 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.009
 because today is no gameplay in the 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.660
 background again and see that 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.060
 also has a reason because today it works 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.010
 I have around the black ops two maps 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.560
 talked about it for a long time and I have you 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.320
 tells how I measure a good find 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.170
 or as I like a good map yes 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.120
 imagine better said and yes you have 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.670
 For the most part agreed with me 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.430
 and now all loading 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.199
 screens were released, however 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.610
 through a league quasi hold through 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.290
 this vehicle I have ever 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.900
 a video made which also here 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.290
 do not link for that again 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.330
 have heard 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.530
 Anyway, I hope you can hear it 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.940
 phone just the background 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.510
 Anyway, now are the situation 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.400
 screens published and looks very much 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.379
 good 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.659
 the maps are all very open so far 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.880
 that is the whole thing now 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.250
 in beta status and therefore the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.390
 Graphics not so good if the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.799
 textures or something like that now 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.140
 shit look like this is on the screens 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.049
 quite normal because a beta version is 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.969
 which is very old and has the graphics 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.130
 not too high on the detail 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.799
 crow's just do not like it 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.689
 they will be in the later game 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.450
 So do not be too shocked by that 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.009
 too bad graphics, however the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.359
 Maps in open that's important at the very least 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.130
 until now perhaps will be missing 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.100
 I do not know a few boxes or something 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.789
 However , the maps seem open similar 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.460
 like the black ops 1 maps has a big one 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.799
 point on the map and then stop right 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.299
 and on the left smaller paths find 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.979
 I was good as well in the play offs 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.829
 most part to with some exceptions 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.299
 a few maps have me up to black 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.639
 ops map its for example the map 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.920
 message I believe is called i mate last 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:02:00.280
 that reminds me a bit of lounge 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.329
 or hectic newtown but I want you 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.819
 Not too long now for the torture 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.020
 Tighten and just stop it 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.299
 loading screens show 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.709
 I'm calm so I'll be myself 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.810
 say goodbye here now 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.640
 and yes I wish a little bit that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.500
 here on the individual maps in the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.970
 Comments may also write 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.330
 again a single video to as 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.770
 It's all the same as has feedback 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.610
 have given and then say sometimes 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.740
 my opinion to the individual 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.600
 as I said comments in the 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.600
 comments until next time schaun
