00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
one but what I can do is I can simply

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.470 
one but what I can do is I can simply
just<00:02:10.310> punch<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.670> ground<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.209> can<00:02:11.360> see

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.920 
that I'm smelling some coal ore down
there<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.610> if<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.790> dig<00:02:14.030> my<00:02:14.060> way<00:02:14.209> over<00:02:14.540> here<00:02:14.660> I

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
there so if I dig my way over here I

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.460 
there so if I dig my way over here I
could<00:02:15.260> probably<00:02:15.650> find<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.640> coal<00:02:17.120> maybe<00:02:17.870> I'm

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
could probably find that coal maybe I'm

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.810 
could probably find that coal maybe I'm
not<00:02:18.710> entirely<00:02:18.980> sure<00:02:19.160> there<00:02:19.430> might<00:02:19.550> be<00:02:19.580> some

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
not entirely sure there might be some

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.530 
not entirely sure there might be some
stone<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.360> I'm

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
stone so I'm

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.289 
stone so I'm
I just<00:02:20.780> uh<00:02:20.870> not<00:02:21.709> go<00:02:21.920> for<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.219> but<00:02:22.909> you<00:02:23.030> can<00:02:23.180> see

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
I just uh not go for it but you can see

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.550 
I just uh not go for it but you can see
that<00:02:23.450> there<00:02:23.569> might<00:02:23.750> be<00:02:23.780> some<00:02:24.079> cool

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
that there might be some cool

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.569 
that there might be some cool
what<00:02:24.680> do<00:02:24.739> you<00:02:24.799> know<00:02:24.890> there's<00:02:25.219> coal<00:02:25.430> right

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
what do you know there's coal right

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.179 
what do you know there's coal right
there<00:02:25.819> so<00:02:26.450> um<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:27.469> might<00:02:27.680> be<00:02:27.890> another

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
there so um this might be another

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.920 
there so um this might be another
alternative<00:02:28.760> way<00:02:28.909> of<00:02:28.939> x-raying<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.810> way

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
alternative way of x-raying in a way

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.330 
alternative way of x-raying in a way
because<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.260> could<00:02:30.500> find<00:02:30.680> all<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:30.980> ore<00:02:31.099> and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
because you could find all the ore and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.800 
because you could find all the ore and
I'm<00:02:31.519> pretty<00:02:31.730> sure<00:02:31.879> if<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.150> press<00:02:32.510> o<00:02:32.750> you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.360 
I'm pretty sure if you just press o you
could<00:02:33.079> probably<00:02:33.230> find<00:02:33.530> C<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:33.859> iron<00:02:34.099> over

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
could probably find C this iron over

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.160 
could probably find C this iron over
there<00:02:34.519> there's<00:02:35.000> gold<00:02:35.329> all<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.659> way<00:02:35.870> down

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
diamonds are straight over there so if I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.160 
diamonds are straight over there so if I
keep<00:02:40.609> mining<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.299> stuff<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.689> could<00:02:41.870> lead<00:02:42.140> me

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
keep mining and stuff it could lead me

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.110

this<00:04:24.289> could<00:04:24.409> work<00:04:24.560> on<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.710> multiplayer<00:04:25.220> server

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
this could work on a multiplayer server

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.010 
this could work on a multiplayer server
but<00:04:25.820> I<00:04:25.849> don't<00:04:26.120> recommend<00:04:26.389> it<00:04:26.630> because<00:04:26.750> you

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
but I don't recommend it because you

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.600 
but I don't recommend it because you
could<00:04:27.169> get<00:04:27.320> banned<00:04:27.590> if<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:27.979> tell<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.400> host

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
could get banned if you tell the host

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.149 
could get banned if you tell the host
that<00:04:28.789> you<00:04:28.969> have<00:04:29.479> this<00:04:29.690> mod<00:04:29.930> installed<00:04:30.080> which<00:04:31.039> I

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
that you have this mod installed which I

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.860 
that you have this mod installed which I
don't<00:04:31.219> recommend<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.940> believe<00:04:32.300> there<00:04:32.419> isn't<00:04:32.570> a

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
don't recommend I believe there isn't a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.210 
don't recommend I believe there isn't a
bucket<00:04:33.200> plugin<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:33.620> could<00:04:33.740> counter<00:04:34.039> the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
bucket plugin that could counter the

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.880 
bucket plugin that could counter the
Samad<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.390> fresh<00:04:35.720> mod<00:04:35.990> for<00:04:36.650> like<00:04:36.860> a

Samad so this is a fresh mod for like a

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.950 
Samad so this is a fresh mod for like a
new<00:04:37.190> alternative<00:04:37.820> way<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:37.970> x-ray<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.780> guys

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
most likely won't get caught on a server

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.340
