00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
but you know so often you hear oh it

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.580 
but you know so often you hear oh it
should<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.760> at<00:03:48.209> least<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:49.170> shade<00:03:49.350> or<00:03:49.560> two

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
should be at least a shade or two

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.630 
should be at least a shade or two
lighter<00:03:50.510> not<00:03:51.510> really<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.140> see<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.620> also<00:03:53.010> have<00:03:53.220> a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
lighter not really and see I also have a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.520 
lighter not really and see I also have a
little<00:03:53.940> bit<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.269> redness<00:03:54.510> even<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.140> my<00:03:55.320> nose

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
little bit of redness even on my nose

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.370 
little bit of redness even on my nose
here<00:03:55.859> because<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.190> had<00:03:56.400> had<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:57.540> skin<00:03:58.170> cancer

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
here because I had had a skin cancer

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.259 
here because I had had a skin cancer
actually<00:03:58.739> removed<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.430> number<00:03:59.819> of<00:03:59.910> years<00:04:00.120> ago

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
actually removed a number of years ago

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.240 
actually removed a number of years ago
so<00:04:00.930> I'm<00:04:01.200> using<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.680> little<00:04:01.829> bit<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.069> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
so I'm using a little bit of the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.059 
so I'm using a little bit of the
neutralizer<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:03.660> even<00:04:03.959> soften<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.620> redness

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
neutralizer to even soften the redness

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.180 
neutralizer to even soften the redness
from<00:04:05.250> an<00:04:05.400> old<00:04:05.609> scar<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:07.260> can<00:04:07.650> see<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.100> it

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
from an old scar and you can see that it

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.400 
from an old scar and you can see that it
really<00:04:08.489> does<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:08.970> trick<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.600> neutralizes

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
really does the trick and neutralizes

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.550 
really does the trick and neutralizes
out<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.799> redness<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:12.109> here<00:04:13.109> I<00:04:13.260> have<00:04:13.500> a

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
out that redness and here I have a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.490 
out that redness and here I have a
