00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.359
 from all the boys and welcome 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.389
 today to the forcing of the ICS box in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.340
 this beautiful but green box 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.620
 now you will surely be 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.900
 asking why I should 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.359
 go see this boxing that by now 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.869
 the one is gone but the console is 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.529
 come out already seen 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.630
 nv200 67.4 video why where to go to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.119
 see the video read but simple 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 all see this video because you don't have 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.770
 seen this year you've never seen 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.860
 the unboxing done as I do it and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.410
 now you look at this video and you 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.510
 will like it and you will leave the ric 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.520
 because you liked this video 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.590
 so very much how to do an unboxing 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.350
 like no one else did 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 generally the word well box me 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.420
 I'm not closing it now and now 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 normally a person to go to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.020
 open the box should remove the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.180
 seals there in short of protection of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.210
 guarantee with what bacon once a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.450
 cutter like this and this one 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450
 pussies 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.920
 perfect thanks to the after opening 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.910
 the other the box with the powerful means a 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.930
 our provision 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.420
 let's see the contents of this tab 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.550
 basically here we see just for 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.030
 i have all the xbox as you like from 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.530
 carlo but here we immediately see the kilt that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.030
 let them be so then who will be made 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.190
 dream about this box before 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.370
 get into my hands then the kin e 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.140
 if we see it first not the last 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.750
 because he knows why they take the kinect that 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.240
 show them what circus in 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.010
 and here it is very effortless force 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.750
 this but for anyone with two eyes 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.700
 and have seen the video will have noticed that 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.920
 the console was bundled consisting of a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.780
 5 people normally a 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.300
 this point they tell us Roma I do 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.620
 rigid rules from but who if 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.140
 scrub the code that I show it 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.670
 look at it here we make you a nice shape 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.300
 image then you can also scan 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.130
 image 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.230
 this is the very sporting strength code 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.640
 5 you know why I show you why not 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.230
 I know so much jerk to post the video 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.630
 without having taken the code 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.640
 after seeing some paper that 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.380
 strangely useful we see that instead 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.000
 card that is absolutely useless or 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.959
 the better this they use it for 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.840
 turn on the stove 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.800
 I will use this to turn on the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.819
 stove and these where he was born a little 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.579
 use as 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.530
 firewood but now I have returned 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.749
 account because there are a joke before 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.579
 reject this as it cooks a 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.950
 magnificent code probably the year 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.439
 first to redeem why this is it 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.870
 an xbox live gold code 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:54.319
 then we see this wonderful you know 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.750
 one thing 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.750
 a moment to stop you know xbox 360 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.290
 here is a huge mistake, gentlemen 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.409
 why this plastic bag that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.409
 infinite sadness as I imagine there is 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:14.930
 the pad and very soon also this ai 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:17.060
 cables needed to be done also celebrates the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.939
 camera doesn't even make it so 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.310
 it spits on its own because you remember against 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.790
 newly separated Xbox 360 all 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.739
 colored green orange with xbox studies 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.389
 360 everywhere because he thought us 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.310
 we can not have with the balls 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.889
 still figured out who he bought 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.530
 the xbox 360 that there is a bags all 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.979
 colored with microsoft script 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.349
 this is an entity for these secrets are 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:45.709
 sad this point is worth the headphone work 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.590
 useful for picking up during 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.650
 in short, the usual groups we know 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.780
 already on xbox and here instead we have the 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.979
 check them a lot we say online but 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.379
 it's just not online because 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:59.180
 directly on beat I have to say that if 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.579
 very comfortable little weight change 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.519
 which they brought is definitely better 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.530
 and then I must also say that this little one 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.859
 ex set supplied with the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.359
 neither secret software had very nice e 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.329
 he took many have done a great job 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.489
 step forward under the aspect of style 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.039
 before going on to check we see 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.449
 this a cabbage you see is perfect it wants 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.009
 say that we see it all we are not 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.599
 blind 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.280
 no a hdmi cable that is put into 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.780
 supplied with the console at least 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.590
 this indispensable useful accessory 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.000
 to connect the console to the monitor at 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.479
 TV what you want 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.240
 there is a fantastic beautiful black head and 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:42.190
 then I said let's go around the neck 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:45.430
 nov i lied to you in this 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.289
 bag of a thousand shapes or just one 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.710
 shape we find the power cord 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.740
 It went our learned 50 hertz and 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.780
 220 volts and up to our ass 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.599
 feeder to the feeder likes a 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.340
 sack just started the beautiful exterior 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.169
 so here it is 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.000
 the external power supply a little more pretty 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.620
 but aesthetically compared to the top but 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.270
 so much this feeder at the most will see 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.770
 a lot of dust in the twists and turns of the 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.819
 I don't know my desk or room 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.110
 say hello to the power supply we 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.710
 Feeder know that you'll never see 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.229
 plus sunlight such as batteries 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.360
 however duracell go surely if in 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.639
 this lower compartment of the bar had 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.979
 already inserted what is the battery 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.090
 Then we pack it completely apart 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.159
 would certainly have been a value 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.139
 added instead of not putting then the 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:35.409
 fleece but for this reason I am 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.289
 equipped with these clips as I said there 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.120
 these batteries are so if you want 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.919
 you can buy this file the bacteria 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.930
 I absolutely recommend you why 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.460
 there have been many cards to be 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.590
 used payment however we see 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.510
 that here one 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.580
 shows the game account in the loops are in 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.140
 degree after five years of maintaining how 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.080
 you still see 70 percent of 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.050
 capacity after the recharge cycles ed 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.470
 here it is the xbox wan pad 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.540
 one 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.090
 there is a quick overview of this 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.830
 done and that is certainly exceptional 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.630
 in short, for what my tastes are 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.000
 I personally do it financially 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.410
 I find it convenient if I think one of the fairies 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.930
 most comfortable ever because 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.670
 however it already resumes what the 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.850
 used design we can say the father 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.530
 of the 360 and I really like it did 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.030
 perhaps a small criticism, however, we can 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.100
 do it also because it is rightly so 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.040
 because it is not perfect in all perhaps 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.520
 these analogs too lightly 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.860
 closer and here it is the chinext 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.720
 well i don't know for what reason though boss 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.730
 they are mysterious objects on the cube 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.410
 that is, I don't know where you are heading from 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.650
 where it opens where this comes from 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.650
 end 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.630
 in short, peel this is the 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.340
 kinect but we are here we are losing 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.900
 too much time we are losing too much 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.280
 time and why I can't wait to see 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.550
 if there are other manuals 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.430
 inside this package it would be 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.500
 been practical boy is an actor are 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.380
 38 kilos is no longer physical for these 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.730
 what's this 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.290
 guys let me pose because in the 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.290
 its position I remind you that the console 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.920
 parmensi vertically from a discount e 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.920
 verifiable 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:19.360
 home guys but a hard way or if 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.750
 made the price of 28 the whole 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.470
 ladder 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.990
 however this xbox milan boxing 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.670
 so I would say this time it is 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.800
 really all for this video if you 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.870
 had liked to leave a nice like e 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.330
 maybe a nice comment with the post 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.190
 pyrotechnic strategy on how to open a 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.320
 box without using the cutter 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:43.350
 what would you have used 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.350
 ok i 'm and we 'll get the next one
