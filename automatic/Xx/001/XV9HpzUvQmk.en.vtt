00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:15.280
 how to dial on small circular needles 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.860
 many many loops 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.020
 usually we recruit by folding two knitting needles but 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:27.110
 if we recruit so we will 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:34.119
 uncomfortable pulling fishing line so we take 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.119
 knitting needle of a similar size and recruit 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.800
 be sure to follow the thread 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.800
 fell did not fall between the spokes 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.480
 and so we recruit 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.920
 and gradually here the loops are shifted and 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.080
 further recruit 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.830
 if it turns out that is already inconvenient 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.950
 to recruit 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.950
 then we pull out an additional knitting needle 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:34.040
 insert it into several loops 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:42.190
 and these loops we have freely already gone 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.190
 on the spokes and continue to set 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:59.390
 then loops again run to dial 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:05.540
 follows one loop more than 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.580
 required to properly connect 1 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.800
 circular row 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:16.070
 after dialing auxiliary needle 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:18.850
 remove and here are many, many loops with us 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.850
 typed
