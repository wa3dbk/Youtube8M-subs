a<00:04:16.579> valve<00:04:16.820> valve<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.299> highly<00:04:17.690> recommended<00:04:17.840> blow

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
a valve valve is highly recommended blow

a valve valve is highly recommended blow

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
up elders used because any excess air

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.950 
up elders used because any excess air
flow<00:04:21.169> from<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:21.759> turbo<00:04:22.759> should<00:04:23.389> be<00:04:23.539> measured

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
flow from that turbo should be measured

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.749 
flow from that turbo should be measured
and<00:04:24.400> not<00:04:25.400> vented<00:04:26.860> this<00:04:27.860> here<00:04:28.100> is<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.520> mouth<00:04:28.729> of

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
and not vented this here is the mouth of

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.010 
and not vented this here is the mouth of
weather<00:04:29.210> if<00:04:29.449> I<00:04:29.600> made<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.840> would<00:04:30.259> bolt<00:04:31.160> in<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.810> as

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
weather if I made a would bolt in so as

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.120 
weather if I made a would bolt in so as
you<00:04:33.169> can<00:04:33.289> see<00:04:33.349> everyone<00:04:33.860> goes<00:04:34.250> in<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.820> any

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
you can see everyone goes in and any

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.800 
you can see everyone goes in and any
excess<00:04:37.130> air<00:04:37.340> flow<00:04:37.550> will<00:04:38.060> go<00:04:38.090> back<00:04:38.449> into<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
excess air flow will go back into the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.170 
excess air flow will go back into the
turbo<00:04:39.139> again<00:04:39.410> here<00:04:39.919> on<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.310> r34<00:04:40.729> we're<00:04:41.030> using

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
turbo again here on the r34 we're using

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.439 
turbo again here on the r34 we're using
the<00:04:41.360> factory<00:04:41.690> blow-off<00:04:41.840> valve<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:44.150> here<00:04:44.330> we

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
the factory blow-off valve so here we

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.870 
the factory blow-off valve so here we
are<00:04:44.479> in<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.780> house<00:04:44.900> before

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
are in the house before

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.080 
are in the house before
there's<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.030> chilly<00:04:47.449> air<00:04:47.479> flow<00:04:47.690> sensor<00:04:49.090> we're

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
there's the chilly air flow sensor we're

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.820 
there's the chilly air flow sensor we're
just<00:04:50.270> gonna<00:04:50.389> bolt<00:04:50.660> it<00:04:50.810> into<00:04:50.990> here<00:04:51.349> that's<00:04:51.680> a

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
just gonna bolt it into here that's a

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:04.040 
just gonna bolt it into here that's a
bit<00:04:52.009> of<00:04:52.099> a<00:04:52.250> squeeze<00:04:57.220> okay<00:04:58.220> so<00:04:58.280> that's<00:04:58.580> in

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.750 

so<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.350> good<00:05:05.500> thing<00:05:05.620> of<00:05:05.650> these<00:05:05.919> hpx<00:05:06.400> answers

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
so the good thing of these hpx answers

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.200 
so the good thing of these hpx answers
is<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.560> they<00:05:08.560> are<00:05:08.919> quite<00:05:09.460> resistant<00:05:10.120> to

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
is that they are quite resistant to

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.530 
is that they are quite resistant to
reversion<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:11.110> measure<00:05:11.979> a<00:05:12.250> lot<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.520> power<00:05:14.040> and

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
reversion I measure a lot of power and

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.570 
reversion I measure a lot of power and
fairly<00:05:16.540> priced<00:05:17.169> effective<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.889> compared<00:05:18.490> to

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
fairly priced effective to compared to

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.219 
fairly priced effective to compared to
these<00:05:18.790> a<00:05:19.020> 35-minute

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
these a 35-minute

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.520 
these a 35-minute
so<00:05:21.190> here<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.669> have<00:05:21.699> a<00:05:21.850> bunch<00:05:22.060> of<00:05:22.240> centers<00:05:22.660> I<00:05:22.990> try

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
so here I have a bunch of centers I try

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.520 
so here I have a bunch of centers I try
all<00:05:23.680> sorts<00:05:23.710> of<00:05:23.979> different<00:05:24.160> ethnicities<00:05:24.940> out

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
all sorts of different ethnicities out

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.860 
all sorts of different ethnicities out
so<00:05:26.530> yeah
