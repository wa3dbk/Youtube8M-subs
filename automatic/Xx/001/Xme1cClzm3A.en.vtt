with<00:00:23.310> no<00:00:23.430> chain<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.600> Aaron<00:00:24.869> Cohen<00:00:25.019> you're

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
with no chain and Aaron Cohen you're

right<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.800> drive<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.250> hanging<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.849> think

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
right the drive is hanging off I think

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.179 
right the drive is hanging off I think
it's<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.930> chain<00:00:28.199> that's<00:00:28.410> still<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.800> there<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
it's the chain that's still in there I

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.359 
it's the chain that's still in there I
hope<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.670> doesn't<00:00:29.849> go<00:00:30.090> into<00:00:30.269> his<00:00:30.480> spokes<00:00:31.369> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
hope it doesn't go into his spokes you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.740 
hope it doesn't go into his spokes you
should<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:32.969> if<00:00:33.030> there's<00:00:33.239> any<00:00:33.360> problems

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
should see now if there's any problems

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.120 
should see now if there's any problems
with<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.930> bite<00:00:34.170> where<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:34.680> clearly<00:00:34.950> are

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
with that bite where they clearly are

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.490 
with that bite where they clearly are
something<00:00:35.489> wrong<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:39.079> I'm<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.290> trying

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
something wrong with it I'm just trying

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.990 
something wrong with it I'm just trying
to<00:00:40.530> say<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> think<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> Ritter<00:00:41.219> alias<00:00:41.670> missing

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
to say I think the Ritter alias missing

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.270 
to say I think the Ritter alias missing
Claudio<00:00:42.530> but<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.680> doesn't<00:00:44.040> matter<00:00:44.100> if

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
Claudio but that doesn't matter if

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.940 
Claudio but that doesn't matter if
there's<00:00:44.460> no<00:00:44.610> chain<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> will<00:00:45.950> seriously

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
there's no chain but that will seriously

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.000 
there's no chain but that will seriously
maybe<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:48.000> know<00:00:48.149> no<00:00:48.510> chain<00:00:48.780> perhaps<00:00:49.110> well

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
maybe I don't know no chain perhaps well

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
maybe I don't know no chain perhaps well
I'm<00:00:50.399> seriously<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> cost<00:00:51.270> him<00:00:51.360> along

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
I'm seriously going to cost him along

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
I'm seriously going to cost him along
that<00:00:51.719> pedal<00:00:52.110> we<00:00:52.590> haven't<00:00:52.829> seen<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.100> /<00:00:53.250> pedaling

that pedal we haven't seen it / pedaling
yeah<00:00:55.430> less<00:00:56.430> than<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.760> second<00:00:57.180> America<00:00:57.780> went

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
yeah less than a second America went

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.770 
yeah less than a second America went
down<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:59.309> some<00:00:59.520> pedal<00:00:59.879> stroke<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.750> the
