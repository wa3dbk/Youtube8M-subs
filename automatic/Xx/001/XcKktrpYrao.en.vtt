 And to youtube and facebook people my name is SHINDI from SHINDIMASTER Channel, and this is my new board called "Shindimaster Tutorials" 

00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:16.017
 In this new framework I will be discussing about various tutorials. 

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:20.931
 In this video I will be teaching how to fold a shirt quickly and practically. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.169
 The shirt will be folded that way! 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.046
 Start by putting a T-shirt on a straight table. 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.399
 Arrange for it to stretch. 

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:45.067
 It is important that the shirt is placed horizontally to you as it appears in the video. 

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:53.969
 With your left hand, measure the left shoulder of the T-shirt and grab it with your thumb and forefinger, approximately in the middle. 

00:00:55.066 --> 00:01:02.070
 With your right hand draw an imaginary line horizontally, and mark more or less a midpoint of the shirt. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.315
 Hold with your thumb and forefinger. 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.569
 With the left, execute the movement that appears on your screen. 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.692
 Take the other end of the shirt using the index finger and thumb. 

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:23.438
 Notice that your arm will intersect. Continue holding the T-shirt with your fingers, and uncross the arms. 

00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:29.682
 You will notice that the shirt will be straight if you do not try to line up by shaking it. 

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:33.366
 To finish put the shirt on the table that way. 

00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:39.271
 Put the right half of the shoulder face down and the rest face up. 

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:44.233
 There are other ways to fold by positioning the T-shirt in other ways. 

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.889
