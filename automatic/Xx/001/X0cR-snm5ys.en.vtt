00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.839
 first of all as we always apply 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.739
 a base on the nails in this case 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.870
 used the ultra base also strengthens 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.190
 giving a pass on all the nails 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.080
 after which it took a lasting color 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.860
 white and I gave a pass also of 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.350
 this on all nails expected that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.570
 the enamel was very dry and then I have 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.009
 nail art started to make 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.970
 this in the north there would be a small bowl 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.979
 with water a toothpick from the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.110
 moisturizer and the glazes we have 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.509
 chosen to implement it first of all 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.130
 precisely we take the create but it is a 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.909
 brush put on the small brush the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.990
 cream 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.060
 let's start turning it on the skin 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.100
 around it then stretches in the cuticles 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.819
 well therefore good in frost cuticles too 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.819
 in the laterals 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:55.789
 we also go behind and then if 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:59.020
 let's go under that on everything tito so 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.930
 which precisely creates it but creates a barrier 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.359
 to isolating the skin so that when 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.250
 soak the finger in the enamel water 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.859
 therefore it does not stick to the skin 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.970
 then it's not difficult to remove it 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.579
 put the scotch too 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.680
 but I find that he called it more 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:20.359
 simple and faster as well as also 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.780
 More comfortable 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:25.160
 then after spreading the cream well 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 we can take the town again 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.720
 let's take the enamels in this case 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.230
 I chose three new colors for military use 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:42.040
 that the lasting color then the 220 that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:42.040
 this beautiful rose 625 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.420
 finally 519 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:06.780
 we open the enamels next to us we are 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.610
 by dropping I read stopped inside 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.590
 water as you see the enamel a 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:22.710
 contact with water expands creating 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:25.590
 of the circles we choose how much of 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.480
 enamel to make the water fall depending on 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.480
 of how much color we want therefore 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:36.660
 if we want one in the most colorful art or 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.580
 less colored then with the same one 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.840
 color frequency therefore in the sense 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.680
 with what we started for 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.520
 first by second and by third we create 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.520
 these circles 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.920
 after creating the number of circles 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.709
 sufficient 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:07.250
 take the toothpick and appeal 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:12.840
 water in a very delicate way then 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:15.299
 we create the design obviously wanting it 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.190
 to make flowers 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.590
 we will try later after making the 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.359
 design that we like to go 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.820
 in the part that seems more precisely 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.889
 floral where then could call back 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.330
 of the petals I would say that this part 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.030
 could do for us 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.240
 then we dip the finger in the point then 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.070
 we want to withdraw the drawing 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.860
 then with the toothpick 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.790
 we remove the excess of film 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.860
 take it off well because if not 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.690
 we want everything when we take away 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.729
 the ritual we take away the film and 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.020
 so all the color is left 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:54.389
 in the water and we ruin the drawing here 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:05:02.160
 here now we take away the bowl 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:03.930
 take a clean toothpick it 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.979
 let's go around the cuticles so as to 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.780
 remove the skin film from 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.780
 the one you know who joined it dreams 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:26.520
 in this way we then take a 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:29.750
 cotton pad without wetting it 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.190
 so we pass a clean disk 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.710
 you will find how the enamel is taken away 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.060
 without problems 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.740
 well even if long enough clean 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.720
 order a nice small lap pool 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:46.770
 so let's take the pen with holder 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.470
 enamel or in any case a bow 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:54.840
 then a cotton swab and clean 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:56.600
 the cuticle round so that precisely 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.010
 long be nice clean 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.850
 now we will have to wait well for it 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.920
 nail polish will dry completely and after that 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.690
 the enamel will be as dry as ever 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.540
 we are going to give a nice pass of 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.950
 bright enamel fixer on all 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.830
 the nails to make precisely the 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.350
 in the brightest most brilliant art 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.550
 and above all to fix it so that the 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.980
 my latex lasts longer 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.510
 so this is my idea of ​​spring 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.120
 my idea of ​​watermark all the way 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.610
 colored reminiscent of flowers I hope that 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.100
 you enjoyed the process both for 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.500
 you quite clear enough 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.300
 for any questions or curiosity you can 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.850
 write me quietly under the video 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.260
 I leave you to the photos in detail and vi 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.260
 I'm waiting for the next hello video
