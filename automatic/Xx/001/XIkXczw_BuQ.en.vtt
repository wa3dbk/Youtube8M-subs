00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
ago got me this for a present I don't

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.140 
ago got me this for a present I don't
remember<00:04:18.500> if<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.799> was<00:04:18.859> my<00:04:19.100> birthday<00:04:19.430> or

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
remember if it was my birthday or

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.030 
remember if it was my birthday or
something<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:20.870> never<00:04:21.139> used<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.889> she

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
something and I never used it and she

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.010 
something and I never used it and she
took<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.460> back<00:04:23.950> after<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:25.070> year<00:04:25.820> I<00:04:26.090> don't<00:04:26.810> know

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
took it back after a year I don't know

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.010 
took it back after a year I don't know
why<00:04:27.230> I<00:04:27.260> didn't<00:04:27.590> use<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.480> can't<00:04:32.750> believe

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
why I didn't use it and I can't believe

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.159 
why I didn't use it and I can't believe
I<00:04:33.200> put<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> part<00:04:33.740> in<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:33.950> back<00:04:34.130> right<00:04:34.400> here<00:04:35.169> that

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
I put a part in the back right here that

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.540 
I put a part in the back right here that
wasn't<00:04:37.270> what<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.300> should've<00:04:38.690> did<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:39.280> just<00:04:40.280> so

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
wasn't what I should've did it just so

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.490 
wasn't what I should've did it just so
wet<00:04:41.410> yeah<00:04:42.410> oh<00:04:43.630> yeah<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.660> only<00:04:45.020> use<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:46.070> much

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
wet yeah oh yeah I only use this much

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.050 
wet yeah oh yeah I only use this much
so<00:04:48.500> maybe<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.070> jar<00:04:49.340> will<00:04:49.580> last<00:04:51.040> after<00:04:52.060> about

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
so maybe the jar will last after about

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:04.409 
so maybe the jar will last after about
30<00:04:53.660> minutes<00:04:54.350> I<00:04:55.389> am<00:04:56.389> getting<00:04:56.930> oils<00:05:01.840> still<00:05:02.840> wet

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
30 minutes I am getting oils still wet

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:16.510 
30 minutes I am getting oils still wet
but<00:05:05.800> starting<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:06.979> curl<00:05:12.280> completely<00:05:13.280> dry<00:05:15.520> and

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
but starting to curl completely dry and

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:28.630 
but starting to curl completely dry and
I<00:05:18.310> like<00:05:19.310> it<00:05:22.600> it's<00:05:25.120> it's<00:05:26.120> not<00:05:26.410> sticky<00:05:27.550> it's<00:05:28.550> a

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
I like it it's it's not sticky it's a

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.460 
I like it it's it's not sticky it's a
little<00:05:29.060> stiff<00:05:29.510> but<00:05:29.840> I<00:05:31.660> guess<00:05:32.660> you<00:05:32.840> can<00:05:33.050> scrunch

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
little stiff but I guess you can scrunch

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.830 
little stiff but I guess you can scrunch
