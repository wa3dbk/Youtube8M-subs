like<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> use<00:01:33.270> synthesis<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.350> order<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:36.409> get

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
like to use synthesis in order to get

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
like to use synthesis in order to get
some<00:01:37.530> more<00:01:37.590> energy<00:01:37.979> into<00:01:38.100> play<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:39.030> have

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
some more energy into play I would have

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.300 
some more energy into play I would have
to<00:01:39.329> draw<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.869> switch<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:41.189> shame<00:01:41.640> NEX<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
to draw a switch and a shame NEX and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.370 
to draw a switch and a shame NEX and
that<00:01:44.310> seems<00:01:44.610> pretty<00:01:45.479> unlikely<00:01:45.630> i'm<00:01:46.170> gonna

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that seems pretty unlikely i'm gonna

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.109 
that seems pretty unlikely i'm gonna
play<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> hypno<00:01:46.920> toxic<00:01:47.310> laser<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.729> carom

I could have catcher doubt deoxys to try
to<00:01:50.159> stall<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.119> better<00:01:51.240> off<00:01:51.560> just

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
to stall but I think I'm better off just

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.069 
to stall but I think I'm better off just
lasering<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> thing<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.329> energy<00:01:54.600> try

lasering the thing with the energy try

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.770 
lasering the thing with the energy try
