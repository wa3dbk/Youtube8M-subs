the<00:01:53.649> p6<00:01:54.240> sexy<00:01:55.240> slider<00:01:55.750> here<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.170> I'll<00:01:56.320> bring

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
the p6 sexy slider here and I'll bring

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:57.959 
the p6 sexy slider here and I'll bring
that<00:01:56.530> up<00:01:56.799> to<00:01:57.009> 9%

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
that up to 9%

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.760 
that up to 9%
it'll<00:01:58.570> be<00:01:58.689> enough<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:58.990> make<00:01:59.110> her<00:01:59.320> walk<00:01:59.530> in<00:01:59.679> a

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
it'll be enough to make her walk in a

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.919 
it'll be enough to make her walk in a
slightly<00:01:59.979> more<00:02:00.219> feminine<00:02:00.369> fashion<00:02:00.820> if<00:02:01.720> I

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
slightly more feminine fashion if I

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.169 
slightly more feminine fashion if I
click<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.350> walk<00:02:02.470> button<00:02:02.679> now<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.179> know

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
click on the walk button now you know

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.899 
click on the walk button now you know
that's<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.479> bit<00:02:04.630> more<00:02:04.750> sensible<00:02:05.640> again<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.759> can

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
that's a bit more sensible again you can

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.889 
that's a bit more sensible again you can
change<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.299> views

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
change the views

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.080 
change the views
and<00:02:09.200> for<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.379> top<00:02:09.560> as<00:02:09.739> well

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
and for the top as well

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.530 
and for the top as well
and<00:02:11.750> I'll<00:02:12.080> go

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and I'll go

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.970 
and I'll go
three-quarter<00:02:13.019> view<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.409> moment

now I've set my blend styles here I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.980 
now I've set my blend styles here I
could<00:02:18.440> adjust<00:02:18.739> things<00:02:19.250> such<00:02:19.520> as<00:02:19.550> headbands

Allison casual figure that's confirmed
there<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.540> could<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> figure<00:02:48.990> walk<00:02:49.170> in

there I could have the figure walk in

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.500 
there I could have the figure walk in
place<00:02:49.530> if<00:02:49.710> I<00:02:49.830> wanted<00:02:50.250> or<00:02:50.430> I'll<00:02:50.880> make<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.120> follow

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
place if I wanted or I'll make it follow

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.560 
place if I wanted or I'll make it follow
the<00:02:51.690> path<00:02:51.870> since<00:02:52.410> I've<00:02:52.590> set<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:53.130> path<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:54.420> was

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
the path since I've set up a path it was

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.390 
the path since I've set up a path it was
only<00:02:54.690> one<00:02:54.930> path<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> scene<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:55.890> they

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
only one path in the scene but they

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.890 
only one path in the scene but they
would<00:02:56.580> appear<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.000> list<00:02:57.210> here<00:02:57.480> if<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.720> have

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
would appear on the list here if I have

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.750 
would appear on the list here if I have
more<00:02:58.080> than<00:02:58.200> one<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.340> align<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
more than one and then you can align the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.290 
more than one and then you can align the
head<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.150> one<00:03:00.720> step<00:03:01.020> ahead<00:03:01.140> or<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.030> end<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.180> the

head to one step ahead or the end of the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
path or the next sharp turn so what I'll

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.110 
path or the next sharp turn so what I'll
do<00:03:07.470> initially<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.160> set<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.430> up<00:03:08.610> for<00:03:08.670> one

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
do initially is to set it up for one

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.980 
do initially is to set it up for one
step<00:03:09.390> ahead

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
step ahead

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.510 
step ahead
and<00:03:11.410> since<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.770> have<00:03:11.950> opposed<00:03:12.280> at<00:03:12.460> the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
and since I have opposed at the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.430 
and since I have opposed at the
beginning<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.240> end<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.570> my<00:03:13.810> animation

beginning and the end of my animation

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.710 
beginning and the end of my animation
I'll<00:03:14.950> make<00:03:15.280> sure<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.610> transition<00:03:16.210> boxes

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
I'll make sure that transition boxes

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.750 
I'll make sure that transition boxes
have<00:03:16.840> clicked<00:03:17.080> here<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.070> transition<00:03:18.460> from

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
have clicked here so the transition from

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.940 
have clicked here so the transition from
the<00:03:18.910> start<00:03:19.570> pose<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.170> first<00:03:20.410> step<00:03:20.710> of<00:03:20.860> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
the start pose to the first step of the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.700 
the start pose to the first step of the
walk<00:03:21.160> will<00:03:21.340> be<00:03:21.490> 15<00:03:21.880> frames<00:03:22.270> which<00:03:22.960> is<00:03:23.140> half<00:03:23.560> a

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
walk will be 15 frames which is half a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.010 
walk will be 15 frames which is half a
second<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> transition<00:03:24.910> from<00:03:25.060> pose<00:03:25.390> at

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
second and the transition from pose at

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.260 
second and the transition from pose at
the<00:03:26.080> end<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.680> 15<00:03:27.130> frames<00:03:27.430> as<00:03:27.700> well<00:03:27.730> as<00:03:27.910> another

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
the end is 15 frames as well as another

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.540 
the end is 15 frames as well as another
half<00:03:28.540> second<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.010> see<00:03:30.130> here<00:03:30.520> that

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
half second and you can see here that

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.570 
half second and you can see here that
the<00:03:30.820> animation<00:03:31.600> has<00:03:31.690> automatically<00:03:32.350> set<00:03:32.620> 391

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
the animation has automatically set 391

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.490 
the animation has automatically set 391
frames<00:03:34.120> now<00:03:34.540> I've<00:03:34.660> got<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> few<00:03:35.020> more<00:03:35.200> than<00:03:35.320> that

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
frames now I've got a few more than that

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.160 
frames now I've got a few more than that
so<00:03:36.370> what<00:03:36.550> I'll<00:03:36.640> do<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:36.850> manually<00:03:37.600> change<00:03:37.930> that

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
so what I'll do is manually change that

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.680 
so what I'll do is manually change that
to<00:03:38.290> 400<00:03:38.890> that's<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.430> length<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.970> my<00:03:40.210> animation

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
to 400 that's the length of my animation

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.660 
to 400 that's the length of my animation
that<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.930> said<00:03:41.200> earlier<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.800> I<00:03:42.250> want<00:03:42.520> to

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
that I said earlier and I want to

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.010 
that I said earlier and I want to
include<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.090> animation<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.720> base<00:03:43.870> layer

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
include the animation in the base layer

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.690 
include the animation in the base layer
so<00:03:44.500> I'll<00:03:44.650> just<00:03:44.860> click<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.400> radio<00:03:45.640> button

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
so I'll just click the radio button

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.690 
so I'll just click the radio button
there<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.150> make<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.200> base<00:03:47.350> layer<00:03:47.700> now

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
there to make it in the base layer now

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.910 
there to make it in the base layer now
if<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:49.000> don't<00:03:49.330> adjust<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.140> end<00:03:50.350> frame<00:03:50.620> count

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
if I don't adjust the end frame count

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.610 
if I don't adjust the end frame count
here<00:03:51.130> something<00:03:51.610> very<00:03:51.640> strange<00:03:52.090> will<00:03:52.420> happen

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
here something very strange will happen

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.470 
here something very strange will happen
instead<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.310> figures<00:03:54.880> stopping<00:03:55.270> at<00:03:55.360> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
instead of the figures stopping at the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.880 
instead of the figures stopping at the
end<00:03:55.600> of<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.840> animation<00:03:55.960> it'll<00:03:56.740> actually

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
end of the animation it'll actually

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.220 
end of the animation it'll actually
automatically<00:03:57.640> skate<00:03:58.120> back<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.870> first

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
automatically skate back to the first

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.070 
automatically skate back to the first
frame<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.830> that's<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.550> very<00:04:00.910> desirable<00:04:01.300> so

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
frame and that's not very desirable so

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.020 
frame and that's not very desirable so
as<00:04:02.200> long<00:04:02.320> as<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.590> make<00:04:03.070> your<00:04:03.100> end<00:04:03.520> frame<00:04:03.790> here

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
as long as you make your end frame here

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.060 
as long as you make your end frame here
match<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:04.690> end<00:04:05.050> frame<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.740> set

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
match to the end frame that you set

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.400 
match to the end frame that you set
earlier<00:04:06.490> everything<00:04:07.210> should<00:04:07.720> just<00:04:08.020> work<00:04:08.200> out

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
earlier everything should just work out

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.290 
earlier everything should just work out
fine<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.340> figure<00:04:09.670> will<00:04:09.820> transition

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
fine and the figure will transition

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.990 
fine and the figure will transition
between<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> two<00:04:11.020> separate<00:04:11.410> animations<00:04:12.000> so

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
between the two separate animations so

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.420 
between the two separate animations so
if<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.330> click<00:04:13.720> on<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.110> ok<00:04:14.530> button<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:15.280> will

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
if I click on the ok button that will

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.039 
if I click on the ok button that will
now<00:04:15.550> be<00:04:15.730> applied<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.270> takes<00:04:16.480> one<00:04:16.810> or<00:04:16.900> two

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
now be applied it takes one or two

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.600 
now be applied it takes one or two
moments<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.560> do<00:04:17.739> all<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:17.980> calculations

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
moments to do all the calculations

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.820 
moments to do all the calculations
what's<00:04:19.150> actually<00:04:19.480> happening<00:04:20.080> is<00:04:20.230> that<00:04:20.440> poser

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
what's actually happening is that poser

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.980 
what's actually happening is that poser
is<00:04:21.190> working<00:04:21.730> out<00:04:21.880> all<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.360> keyframes<00:04:22.540> that

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
is working out all the keyframes that

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.020 
is working out all the keyframes that
are<00:04:23.200> needed<00:04:23.500> for<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.710> animation<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:24.790> if<00:04:24.910> I

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
are needed for the animation so if I

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.300 
are needed for the animation so if I
just<00:04:25.270> click<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.900> what<00:04:26.410> designer<00:04:26.770> there<00:04:27.100> and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
just click the what designer there and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.520 
just click the what designer there and
then<00:04:27.880> shut<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.210> now<00:04:28.900> everything<00:04:29.320> should<00:04:29.350> be

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
then shut it now everything should be

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.560 
then shut it now everything should be
set<00:04:29.800> up<00:04:30.010> now<00:04:30.640> I'll<00:04:30.760> just<00:04:30.790> run<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.450> animation

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
set up now I'll just run the animation

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.780 
set up now I'll just run the animation
from<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.440> top<00:04:32.650> view<00:04:32.680> here<00:04:33.190> so<00:04:33.340> you'll<00:04:33.610> see

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
from the top view here so you'll see

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.460 
from the top view here so you'll see
what<00:04:33.970> happens<00:04:34.330> if<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:34.690> just<00:04:34.900> click<00:04:35.080> on<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.260> play

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
what happens if I just click on the play

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.080 
what happens if I just click on the play
button

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
button

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.990 
button
Allisyn<00:04:37.090> sets<00:04:37.330> off<00:04:37.510> along<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.780> path<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.520> then

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
Allisyn sets off along the path and then

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.490 
Allisyn sets off along the path and then
she<00:04:40.270> turns<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.810> corner

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.680 

and<00:04:43.590> then<00:04:44.100> she<00:04:44.280> heads<00:04:44.610> off<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.360> end<00:04:45.540> point

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.360 

and<00:04:49.140> since<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.440> animation<00:04:49.830> set<00:04:50.040> on<00:04:50.190> loop

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
and since the animation set on loop

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.390 
and since the animation set on loop
it'll<00:04:50.670> just<00:04:50.850> do<00:04:51.000> that<00:04:51.150> over<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.600> over<00:04:51.690> again

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
it'll just do that over and over again

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.130 
it'll just do that over and over again
then<00:04:53.400> I'll<00:04:53.580> just<00:04:53.790> stop<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.120> animation<00:04:54.390> I'll

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
then I'll just stop the animation I'll

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.070 
then I'll just stop the animation I'll
turn<00:04:55.470> off<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.680> loop<00:04:56.070> radio<00:04:56.580> button<00:04:56.910> there<00:04:57.180> now

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
turn off the loop radio button there now

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.360 
turn off the loop radio button there now
I'll<00:04:58.170> change<00:04:58.320> camera<00:04:58.800> view<00:04:58.950> just<00:04:59.160> a<00:04:59.250> bit

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
I'll change camera view just a bit

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.390 
I'll change camera view just a bit
making<00:04:59.670> sure<00:04:59.910> I'm<00:05:00.060> on<00:05:00.180> frame<00:05:00.420> 1<00:05:01.130> I'll<00:05:02.130> come

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
making sure I'm on frame 1 I'll come

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.160 
making sure I'm on frame 1 I'll come
into<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.700> auxilary<00:05:03.060> camera<00:05:03.510> view<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:03.930> then

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
into the auxilary camera view and then

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.230 
into the auxilary camera view and then
I'll<00:05:04.320> just<00:05:04.620> zoom<00:05:04.890> out<00:05:05.070> slightly<00:05:05.580> so<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.000> can

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
I'll just zoom out slightly so you can

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.240 
I'll just zoom out slightly so you can
see<00:05:06.450> Alison<00:05:07.200> going<00:05:07.500> through<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.890> whole

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
see Alison going through the whole

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.430 
see Alison going through the whole
animation<00:05:08.730> she's<00:05:09.630> taking<00:05:09.930> out<00:05:10.050> quite<00:05:10.230> a<00:05:10.260> bit

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
animation she's taking out quite a bit

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.380 
animation she's taking out quite a bit
of<00:05:10.530> space<00:05:10.710> there<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.070> I'll<00:05:11.580> just<00:05:11.790> lift<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.180> up

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
of space there so I'll just lift that up

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.120 
of space there so I'll just lift that up
slightly<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:13.410> if<00:05:13.500> I<00:05:13.620> click<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.950> animation

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
slightly and if I click the animation

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.160 
slightly and if I click the animation
again<00:05:14.610> now<00:05:14.820> you'll<00:05:15.120> see<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.630> little<00:05:15.900> bit<00:05:16.020> more

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
again now you'll see a little bit more

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.720 
again now you'll see a little bit more
clearly<00:05:16.410> what's<00:05:16.680> going<00:05:16.740> on<00:05:17.130> she's<00:05:17.370> starting

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
clearly what's going on she's starting

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.420 
clearly what's going on she's starting
off<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.360> first<00:05:18.600> pose<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:19.140> set<00:05:19.410> there<00:05:19.620> and

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
off and the first pose I set there and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.030 
off and the first pose I set there and
she<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.670> sets<00:05:20.850> off<00:05:21.030> into<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.390> walk<00:05:21.540> animation

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
she it sets off into the walk animation

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.029 
she it sets off into the walk animation
and<00:05:23.040> away<00:05:23.400> she<00:05:23.550> goes

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
and away she goes

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.790 
and away she goes
to<00:05:25.339> new<00:05:25.490> corner

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.680 

they<00:05:29.129> shall<00:05:29.310> end<00:05:29.490> up<00:05:29.639> at<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:29.940> position<00:05:30.539> at<00:05:30.659> the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
they shall end up at the position at the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.650 
they shall end up at the position at the
end

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
that could do with a little bit of

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.620 
that could do with a little bit of
tweaking<00:05:34.220> there<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.730> can<00:05:34.880> see<00:05:35.060> just<00:05:35.330> at<00:05:35.540> the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
tweaking there you can see just at the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.880 
tweaking there you can see just at the

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840

your<00:05:54.650> animation<00:05:55.160> things<00:05:55.490> could<00:05:55.670> be<00:05:55.760> tricky<00:05:56.030> to

go<00:05:56.390> along<00:05:56.660> if<00:05:57.260> I<00:05:57.440> just<00:05:57.710> advance<00:05:58.100> the<00:05:58.580> slider<00:05:59.330> to

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540

it forward one at a time that could

it forward one at a time that could

feet are just sliding into the final
position<00:06:11.210> there<00:06:11.360> that's<00:06:11.540> because<00:06:11.690> it's

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
position there that's because it's

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.650 
position there that's because it's
automatic<00:06:12.560> training<00:06:12.860> and<00:06:13.130> poser<00:06:14.060> is<00:06:14.360> just

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
automatic training and poser is just

automatic training and poser is just
clicking<00:06:15.080> away<00:06:15.320> I<00:06:15.740> can<00:06:16.370> also<00:06:16.460> change<00:06:17.210> the

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
clicking away I can also change the

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.960 
clicking away I can also change the
position<00:06:18.260> of<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:18.950> figure<00:06:19.280> to<00:06:19.520> make<00:06:19.670> sure<00:06:19.820> it's

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
position of the figure to make sure it's

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.640 
position of the figure to make sure it's
not<00:06:20.120> dropping<00:06:20.540> through<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.870> floor<00:06:21.170> as<00:06:21.380> well

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
not dropping through the floor as well

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.200 
not dropping through the floor as well
and<00:06:22.040> that's<00:06:22.280> probably<00:06:22.550> a<00:06:22.700> little<00:06:22.790> bit<00:06:22.940> out<00:06:23.180> of

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
and that's probably a little bit out of

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.420 
and that's probably a little bit out of
scope<00:06:23.630> for<00:06:23.660> this<00:06:23.870> particular<00:06:24.230> chapter<00:06:24.740> so<00:06:25.190> we

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
scope for this particular chapter so we

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.280 
scope for this particular chapter so we
might<00:06:25.670> look<00:06:25.820> at<00:06:25.940> that<00:06:26.120> separately<00:06:26.630> but<00:06:27.080> there

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
might look at that separately but there

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.900 
might look at that separately but there
are<00:06:27.410> tools<00:06:27.680> included<00:06:28.190> with<00:06:28.310> poser<00:06:28.550> that<00:06:28.790> can

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
are tools included with poser that can

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.980 
are tools included with poser that can
help<00:06:29.090> you<00:06:29.270> tweak<00:06:29.570> lots<00:06:30.110> of<00:06:30.230> your<00:06:30.440> animations
