or<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.730> gasket<00:00:17.730> scraper<00:00:17.880> looking<00:00:18.510> flat<00:00:18.720> as

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
or is it gasket scraper looking flat as

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.810 
or is it gasket scraper looking flat as
compared<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.170> me<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.590> gases<00:00:20.220> vapors<00:00:20.250> would<00:00:20.699> be

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
compared to me but gases vapors would be

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.880 
compared to me but gases vapors would be
a<00:00:20.850> ballistic<00:00:21.029> all<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> okay<00:00:21.930> now<00:00:22.140> normally<00:00:22.680> on

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
a ballistic all it okay now normally on

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.960 
a ballistic all it okay now normally on

a on an LS LS one block aluminum block
you<00:00:27.840> wouldn't<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.369> would

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
you wouldn't want to do this you would

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.959 
you wouldn't want to do this you would
want<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.170> mean<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.289> could<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> lightly

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
want to I mean you could do it lightly

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:41.690 
want to I mean you could do it lightly
but<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.660> gouges<00:00:34.430> feel<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> easy<00:00:40.370> said<00:00:41.370> earlier

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but it gouges feel it easy said earlier

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.100 
but it gouges feel it easy said earlier
to<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:41.969> sure<00:00:42.149> they're<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:42.629> pretty<00:00:42.930> much

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
to make sure they're all pretty much

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.709 
to make sure they're all pretty much
smooth<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> thing<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> touch<00:00:44.450> going<00:00:45.450> over

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
smooth to the thing to touch going over

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.930 
smooth to the thing to touch going over
those<00:00:45.930> nice<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.920> that's<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> clean

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
those nice and that's going to clean

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.770 
those nice and that's going to clean
when<00:00:48.239> we're<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.480> said<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.899> done<00:00:50.149> on<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.660> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
when we're all said and done on some of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
when we're all said and done on some of
the<00:00:51.840> areas<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.350> difficult<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> reach<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.910> we

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the areas are difficult to reach so we

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.430 
the areas are difficult to reach so we
make<00:00:54.329> sure<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> take<00:00:54.780> extra<00:00:55.079> time<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
make sure to take extra time to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.439 
make sure to take extra time to
double-check<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.070> areas<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> can't

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
double-check the areas that so you can't

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.450 
double-check the areas that so you can't
see<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:57.870> well<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.320> us<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> Canada's<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
see as well with us and Canada's get a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.650 
see as well with us and Canada's get a
feel<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> depending<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
feel on depending on how much you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.200 
feel on depending on how much you
disassemble<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.680> motor<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.820> remember<00:01:03.120> how

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
disassemble the motor just remember how

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
disassemble the motor just remember how
much<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> took<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> far<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
much time it took to get this far and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
much time it took to get this far and
you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.489> something<00:01:05.790> critical<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.450> if

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
you know something critical like this if

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.330 
you know something critical like this if
you<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.080> back<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.040> just

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you have to get back in here it just

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340 
you have to get back in here it just
take<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.060> time<00:01:09.360> again<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
take you that much time again so you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.830 
take you that much time again so you
just<00:01:10.590> rather<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.340> make<00:01:12.210> sure<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> spend<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
just rather just make sure you spend the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.210 
just rather just make sure you spend the
extra<00:01:12.930> time<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> first<00:01:13.920> time

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
extra time to do it right the first time

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.990 
extra time to do it right the first time
and<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> second<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> third<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
and we don't do it a second a third so

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
and we don't do it a second a third so
action<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.810> another<00:01:19.140> thing<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.439> keep<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.619> mind

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
action now another thing to keep in mind

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.550 
action now another thing to keep in mind
too<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.400> using<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.170> scraper<00:01:22.170> or

too if you are using a scraper or

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.410 
too if you are using a scraper or
something<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.280> out<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.759> attack<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
something to go out and attack the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
something to go out and attack the
surface<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.100> come<00:01:26.250> down<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
surface that as you come down to the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
surface that as you come down to the
lower<00:01:26.850> section<00:01:27.360> near<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> bottom<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
lower section near the bottom of the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.370 
lower section near the bottom of the
cover<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.549> dig<00:01:29.880> into<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.509> gasket<00:01:31.049> where

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
cover to not dig into the gasket where

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
cover to not dig into the gasket where
the<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.100> oil<00:01:32.130> pan<00:01:32.549> gasket<00:01:32.579> comes<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the the oil pan gasket comes up and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.590 
the the oil pan gasket comes up and
meets<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.740> cover<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
meets the the cover so that that's a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.149 
meets the the cover so that that's a
gasket<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> its<00:01:37.229> own<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
gasket of its own which is get in a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.069 
gasket of its own which is get in a
little<00:01:38.369> bit<00:01:38.460> next<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:39.930> don't

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
little bit next to it you really don't

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.230 
little bit next to it you really don't
have<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.470> much<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:42.060> ahead

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
have to do much and then just go ahead

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.730 
have to do much and then just go ahead
and<00:01:42.420> leave<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.200> because<00:01:43.409> we're<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and leave that because we're going to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
and leave that because we're going to
put<00:01:43.860> some<00:01:44.040> ply<00:01:44.310> some<00:01:44.490> silicone<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.149> there

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
put some ply some silicone down there

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
put some ply some silicone down there
when<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.840> put<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> cover<00:01:46.290> back<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.740> okay<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
when we put the cover back on okay so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.350 
when we put the cover back on okay so
don't<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.640> too<00:01:47.759> much<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.210> those

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
don't get too much you get on those

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060 
don't get too much you get on those
corners<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.020> that's<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.619> spot<00:01:49.890> where

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
corners there that's the one spot where

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.399 
corners there that's the one spot where
you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.600> well<00:01:51.600> I'll<00:01:51.720> learn<00:01:51.960> more<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you can well I'll learn more on the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.260 
you can well I'll learn more on the
silicon<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.829> help<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.159> out<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.210> I'm

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
silicon to help you out but so I'm

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.990 
silicon to help you out but so I'm
feeling<00:01:54.450> pretty<00:01:54.630> good<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> touch<00:01:56.000> go

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
feeling pretty good to the touch go

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.520 
feeling pretty good to the touch go
ahead<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.329> hit<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:58.079> break<00:01:58.259> clean

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
ahead and hit it up little break clean

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.649 
ahead and hit it up little break clean
we're<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.490> our<00:01:59.729> bottom<00:02:00.119> again<00:02:00.329> anyways

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
we're going to our bottom again anyways

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.499 
we're going to our bottom again anyways
but<00:02:00.899> top<00:02:01.409> stuff<00:02:01.680> while<00:02:02.100> you're<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
but top stuff while you're here and you

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.180 
but top stuff while you're here and you
got<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> old<00:02:03.930> pump<00:02:04.170> laying<00:02:04.469> down<00:02:04.710> there

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
got the old pump laying down there

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.290 
got the old pump laying down there
you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.340> might<00:02:05.550> as<00:02:05.580> well<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.060> gunk

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
you know might as well get all this gunk

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.890 
you know might as well get all this gunk
on<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> old<00:02:07.290> pump<00:02:11.210> just<00:02:12.210> just<00:02:12.540> thought<00:02:12.690> about

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
on the old pump just just thought about

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.430 
on the old pump just just thought about
it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.320 
it
there<00:02:13.800> are<00:02:13.950> two<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> two<00:02:14.610> bottom<00:02:14.940> 13

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
there are two with the two bottom 13

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.400 
there are two with the two bottom 13
millimeter<00:02:15.750> bolts<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.170> all<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
millimeter bolts that all the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.600 
millimeter bolts that all the
transmission<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.070> you're<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.430> want<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
transmission on you're going to want to

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.710 
transmission on you're going to want to
loosen<00:02:17.910> those<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.240> pull<00:02:18.360> them<00:02:18.510> out<00:02:18.570> because

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
loosen those and pull them out because

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.220 
loosen those and pull them out because
those<00:02:18.900> hold<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.530> pattern<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.780> those<00:02:21.930> lose<00:02:22.140> you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
those hold the pattern so those lose you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.390 
those hold the pattern so those lose you
missed<00:02:22.410> yeah<00:02:22.710> right

bit<00:03:27.780> harder<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.140> get<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.470> out<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.620> there<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.860> mean

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
bit harder to get it out of there I mean

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.979 
bit harder to get it out of there I mean
you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.370> probably<00:03:29.550> go<00:03:29.790> through<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.120> oil<00:03:30.150> you

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
you can probably go through the oil you

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.009 
you can probably go through the oil you
know<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.230> oil<00:03:31.380> drain<00:03:31.770> but<00:03:32.280> if<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.489> can<00:03:32.640> see

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
know the oil drain but if you can see

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.390 
know the oil drain but if you can see
here's<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.200> bolt<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.709> we<00:03:34.830> got<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.130> get<00:03:35.220> out

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
here's the bolt that we got to get out

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.170 
here's the bolt that we got to get out
of<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.640> pickup<00:03:35.970> -<00:03:36.680> right<00:03:37.680> there<00:03:37.950> pretty<00:03:38.910> tough

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
of the pickup - right there pretty tough

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.820 
of the pickup - right there pretty tough
right<00:03:39.420> there<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.290> know<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.470> don't<00:03:40.680> have

what I'm going to do is grab the threads

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.130 
what I'm going to do is grab the threads

on loosely and once it's loose we're
going<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.209> try<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.420> finagle<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.080> out<00:03:50.330> yes<00:03:51.330> you

going to try to finagle it out yes you
can<00:03:51.720> see<00:03:51.930> there<00:03:52.080> Reverdy<00:03:52.489> your<00:03:53.489> design<00:03:53.700> white

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
can see there Reverdy your design white

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.729 
can see there Reverdy your design white
in<00:03:54.209> on<00:03:54.390> it<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.690> right<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.050> that's<00:03:55.230> what<00:03:55.620> you're

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
in on it but right so that's what you're

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.199 
in on it but right so that's what you're
looking<00:03:55.950> at<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.430> drops<00:03:56.730> it's<00:03:57.030> going

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
looking at so if that drops it's going

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.460 
looking at so if that drops it's going
straight<00:03:57.420> in<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.600> oil<00:03:57.810> pan<00:03:57.989> that's<00:03:58.230> probably

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
straight in the oil pan that's probably

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.830 
straight in the oil pan that's probably
gonna<00:03:58.590> roll<00:03:58.860> back<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.310> back<00:03:59.459> on<00:04:00.150> LS<00:04:00.600> ones

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
gonna roll back to the back on LS ones

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.990 
gonna roll back to the back on LS ones
and<00:04:01.080> stuff<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.530> shallow<00:04:01.739> up<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.310> you
