dearly<00:02:03.930> stuck<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.650> mission<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.250> needed

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
dearly stuck on that mission and needed

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.940 
dearly stuck on that mission and needed
some<00:02:06.000> sort<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.390> guide<00:02:06.750> well<00:02:07.409> then<00:02:07.710> there's

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
this really handy tool called a youtube

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.580 
this really handy tool called a youtube
search<00:02:10.200> bar<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.700> that's<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.590> secondly

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
search bar so that's that secondly

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.110 
search bar so that's that secondly
nothing

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
nothing

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.210 
nothing
that<00:02:15.209> was<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.599> only<00:02:15.780> thing<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.349> wanted<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.860> talk

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that was the only thing I wanted to talk

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.030 
that was the only thing I wanted to talk
about<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.120> let's<00:02:18.450> go<00:02:18.750> back<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.049> this<00:02:19.379> mission<00:02:19.860> I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
about so let's go back to this mission I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.850 
about so let's go back to this mission I
did<00:02:20.819> end<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.180> losing<00:02:21.450> lives<00:02:21.900> for<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.440> attempt

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
did end up losing lives for this attempt

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.970 
did end up losing lives for this attempt
because<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.549> those<00:02:23.700> pesky<00:02:24.060> combos<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.989> probably

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
because of those pesky combos I probably

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.979 
because of those pesky combos I probably
could<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.430> went<00:02:26.730> no<00:02:26.879> lives<00:02:27.150> lost<00:02:27.390> had<00:02:27.870> I

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
could have went no lives lost had I

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.170 
could have went no lives lost had I
placed<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.530> few<00:02:28.739> road<00:02:28.980> spikes<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.700> stop<00:02:29.970> him

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
placed a few road spikes to stop him

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.180 
placed a few road spikes to stop him
from<00:02:30.330> escaping<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.379> I<00:02:31.440> believe<00:02:31.860> at<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.069> time

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
from escaping but I believe at the time

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.819 
from escaping but I believe at the time
I<00:02:32.459> was<00:02:32.819> too<00:02:33.090> busy<00:02:33.420> jerking<00:02:33.930> off<00:02:34.079> or<00:02:34.349> some

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
I was too busy jerking off or some

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.160 
I was too busy jerking off or some
like<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.099> that<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.970> wasn't<00:02:36.390> even<00:02:36.720> paying

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
like that that I wasn't even paying

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.490 
like that that I wasn't even paying
attention<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> game<00:02:38.450> let<00:02:39.450> me<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:40.079> add<00:02:40.319> it

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
attention to the game let me just add it

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.589 
attention to the game let me just add it
did<00:02:40.680> take<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> few<00:02:41.220> attempts<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.879> eventually

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
did take a few attempts to eventually

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.309 
did take a few attempts to eventually
win<00:02:42.840> this

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
win this

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.800 
win this
so<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> guess<00:02:44.159> my<00:02:44.430> boredom<00:02:44.909> for<00:02:45.150> repeating<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
so I guess my boredom for repeating the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.229 
so I guess my boredom for repeating the
same<00:02:46.110> level<00:02:46.530> over<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.099> over<00:02:47.340> explains<00:02:47.879> why<00:02:48.209> I

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
same level over and over explains why I

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.470 
same level over and over explains why I
wasn't<00:02:48.840> paying<00:02:49.379> any<00:02:49.560> attention<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:51.090> will<00:02:51.329> be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
wasn't paying any attention that will be

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.599 
wasn't paying any attention that will be
it<00:02:51.599> for<00:02:51.629> now<00:02:51.989> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.709> enjoyed<00:02:52.859> be<00:02:53.190> sure<00:02:53.340> to
