problem<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.220> had<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.610> actual<00:01:23.939> video

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
problem I had with this actual video

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.210 
problem I had with this actual video
monopod<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.470> move<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:25.799> forward<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
monopod is that to move your forward and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.920 
monopod is that to move your forward and
backwards<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:26.970> either<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.630> loose

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
backwards it can either be really loose

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
backwards it can either be really loose
where<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> legs<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.280> make<00:01:29.430> no<00:01:29.579> sense

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
where the legs kind of make no sense

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
where the legs kind of make no sense
because<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.360> can't<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:30.930> leave<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
because you can't actually leave the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.069 
because you can't actually leave the
camera<00:01:32.159> sitting<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.790> its<00:01:32.939> own<00:01:33.150> or<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.930> can

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
camera sitting up on its own or you can

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.510 
camera sitting up on its own or you can
take<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> bottom<00:01:35.340> there's

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
take it or look on the bottom there's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.920 
take it or look on the bottom there's
actually<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:35.909> allen<00:01:36.210> wrench<00:01:36.360> screws<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
actually some allen wrench screws and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
actually some allen wrench screws and
you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.470> tighten<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.610> once

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
you can actually tighten it up and once

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.929 
you can actually tighten it up and once
you<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.560> stiffen<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you do so you can actually stiffen the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.120 
you do so you can actually stiffen the
the<00:01:42.479> amount<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.780> tilt<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.619> allowed<00:01:43.950> by

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the amount of tilt that is allowed by

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.520 
the amount of tilt that is allowed by
the<00:01:44.189> by<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> monopod<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.869> advantage<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the by the monopod the advantage of it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.230 
the by the monopod the advantage of it
is<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.860> tighten<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.790> it's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
is if you tighten it just right it's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
is if you tighten it just right it's
enough<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> hold<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.350> any<00:01:49.590> mid<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
enough to hold pretty much any mid to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.609 
enough to hold pretty much any mid to
lightweight<00:01:50.430> camera<00:01:51.420> set<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.350> tighten

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
lightweight camera set up if you tighten

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.889 
lightweight camera set up if you tighten
it<00:01:52.799> too<00:01:52.979> much<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.790> stiff<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.390> you'll

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
it too much it's so stiff that you'll

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
it too much it's so stiff that you'll
get<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.470> creaking<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.579> use<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.119> for

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
get a lot of creaking and I use it for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.090 
get a lot of creaking and I use it for
basically<00:01:57.630> leveling<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.799> I'm<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
basically leveling out so if I'm on a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
basically leveling out so if I'm on a
somewhat<00:01:59.759> uneven<00:02:00.090> surface<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.840> pretty<00:02:01.110> much

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
somewhat uneven surface I pretty much

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.450 
somewhat uneven surface I pretty much
leave<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> stiff<00:02:01.890> enough<00:02:02.159> where<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> can

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
leave it stiff enough where I can

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.160 
leave it stiff enough where I can
actually<00:02:02.850> adjust<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.360> tilt<00:02:03.570> where<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
actually adjust the tilt where the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.690 
actually adjust the tilt where the
actual<00:02:04.500> monopod<00:02:05.070> because<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> does<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
actual monopod because it does have a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
actual monopod because it does have a
bubble<00:02:06.060> level<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.960> pretty<00:02:07.170> much<00:02:07.259> adjust

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
bubble level and I pretty much adjust

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
bubble level and I pretty much adjust
that<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> where<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.700> pretty<00:02:09.000> much<00:02:09.179> level<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that to where it's pretty much level and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.089 
that to where it's pretty much level and
then<00:02:10.020> I'll<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.319> all<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.590> adjustments<00:02:10.679> from

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
then I'll do all the adjustments from

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.870 
then I'll do all the adjustments from
the<00:02:11.250> actual<00:02:11.520> head<00:02:11.730> itself<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.270> may<00:02:12.420> even

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the actual head itself and I may even

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.910 
the actual head itself and I may even
paying<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.480> little<00:02:13.630> from<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:13.960> base<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.740> me

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
paying a little from the base and to me

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.680 
paying a little from the base and to me
it<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.040> get<00:02:15.310> some<00:02:15.520> more<00:02:15.700> natural<00:02:16.090> feel<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.510> it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
it just get some more natural feel to it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.630 
it just get some more natural feel to it
the<00:02:16.870> s4<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:17.380> believe<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.070> something<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.550> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
the s4 I believe is something in the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.490 
the s4 I believe is something in the
middle<00:02:18.940> I've<00:02:19.330> heard<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.660> s2<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.200> something

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
middle I've heard the s2 is something

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.040 
middle I've heard the s2 is something
for<00:02:20.680> smaller<00:02:20.980> cameras<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.900> ideally<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> think

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
for smaller cameras and ideally I think

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.630 
for smaller cameras and ideally I think
I<00:02:23.350> would<00:02:23.470> only<00:02:23.590> probably<00:02:23.950> get<00:02:24.130> something<00:02:24.490> like

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
I would only probably get something like

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.680 
I would only probably get something like
that<00:02:24.670> if<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.060> had<00:02:25.210> maybe<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.570> a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
that if you had maybe like a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.420 
that if you had maybe like a
point-and-shoot<00:02:26.140> style<00:02:26.530> camera<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.100> get<00:02:27.310> it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
point-and-shoot style camera you get it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.890 
point-and-shoot style camera you get it
you'll<00:02:27.550> realize<00:02:27.730> how<00:02:28.060> sturdy<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.600> you'd

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you'll realize how sturdy it is you'd

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.780 
you'll realize how sturdy it is you'd
have<00:02:29.080> no<00:02:29.230> problem<00:02:29.590> putting<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.890> DSLR<00:02:30.400> on<00:02:30.640> it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
have no problem putting a DSLR on it

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.240 
have no problem putting a DSLR on it
pocket<00:02:31.060> camera<00:02:31.480> or<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> seven<00:02:32.620> I'd<00:02:32.860> actually

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
pocket camera or a seven I'd actually

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.680 
pocket camera or a seven I'd actually
feel<00:02:33.430> comfortable<00:02:34.000> even<00:02:34.180> putting<00:02:34.450> a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
feel comfortable even putting a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.450 
feel comfortable even putting a
production<00:02:35.470> camera<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.220> definitely

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
production camera on it I definitely

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.950 
production camera on it I definitely
would<00:02:36.760> leave<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.030> alone<00:02:37.240> sitting<00:02:37.660> on<00:02:37.780> its

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
would leave it alone sitting on its

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.380 
would leave it alone sitting on its
three<00:02:38.500> locking<00:02:38.980> feet<00:02:39.400> by<00:02:39.580> itself<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.120> did

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
three locking feet by itself I did

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.760 
three locking feet by itself I did
