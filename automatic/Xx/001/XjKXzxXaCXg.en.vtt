00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 and an expert in preventive medicine , I 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.470
 I make no news here that I, too 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.139
 I did not know how to clarify a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.019
 here is the coconut sugar 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.969
 sincerely i did not know i even talked 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 It's the sugar staff that gets angry that I 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.000
 can not I as practically zero of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.980
 sugar 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.680
 but then it is the sugar to put the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.920
 We knew how to produce very easy in the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 truth and is produced in Brazil then 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.630
 some 15 years on a small scale is like 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 today we have a tendency to demand 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 increasingly healthier foods and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.180
 the main criticism that we have in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.910
 relation to refined sugar that it is a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.070
 sugar that do not have associated nutrients 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.649
 does not have minerals in the refining 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.899
 withdrawal of these minerals and only 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.800
 Calorie is only empty calorie without 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.739
 nutrients 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.510
 sugar is coconut sugar is a lot 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 interesting in the sense that it has a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.910
 quality of flavoring sweet 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.440
 foods have a higher caloric value than 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.719
 lower than our refined sugar 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.359
 and it still has high 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.220
 concentrations of nutrients such as 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.400
 vitamin complexes mainly b1 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.060
 b2 the complex b and minerals as the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.369
 selenium magnesium such as zinc which are 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.409
 up to seminal we know on the day 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.330
 because, through research, those who 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.580
 has a reduction of what we find in our 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.110
 Brazilian soil, only Brazilian people. 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.509
 speaks very good of him in terms of 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.820
 product but he has a disability 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.860
 of these three minerals all food that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 can give us a little more selenium 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.299
 magnesium and zinc we get very 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.030
 happy in he has that puts it back to 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.000
 image is that same yellowish color 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.369
 used up to the brown sugar or 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.680
 integral sugar put integral not 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.750
 exactly refined the brown sugar that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.820
 would be a sugar at the beginning of the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.670
 refinement in the fiber he has that 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.920
 I taste but is pulled the cane molasses 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.350
 that does not please everyone 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 already the sugar stayed with him has a 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.880
 tendency to remind us a little of our 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.680
 It reminds me of rapadura but has a 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.750
 a little lighter nuance and more 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.060
 explored it is more fruity and it finishes 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.649
 being a little more interesting 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.530
 our producer is a very 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.180
 interesting because the production of sweet 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.519
 coconut and will not remove 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.200
 coconut to produce the withdrawal of the fruit 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.560
 will it produce coconut sugar 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.260
 through the flowers and through the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.379
 palm of the evil datafolha we started to 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.700
 use la nua in asia where it is very 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.829
 produced in Brazil is the fourth largest 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.780
 A coconut grower is asking himself 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.920
 philippines and asks for taiwan where he 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.200
 ask India 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.359
 I'll just give you an example and bg in 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.709
 world trade organization says that 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.049
 there in 2010 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.959
 the philippines producing 18 million 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.290
 tons or produce 2 million and 800 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.180
 thousand 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.730
 we have very great potential for 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.500
 produce in detail a value 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.959
 aggregate for our producer and 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.549
 You are using the leaf you are 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.409
 placing the production of the product within 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.109
 of a sustainable model 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.540
 This is a great comment you have to 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.250
 do exactly the disposal sheet 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.280
 production of coconut sugar the first 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.650
 place you already have a product that is 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.280
 coconut being put you will add 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.459
 value 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.040
 today you already recycle your body later 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.229
 that you use his water pulp that 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.810
 already has several purposes intended to 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:22.720
 the recycling process exactly in the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.159
 orient he came to use the plant 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.650
 the coconut she not only the fruit she 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.720
 generates around 100 products from 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.120
 foodstuffs until non-food 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.879
 looks at the value-added potential and 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.799
 put it in to extract the sugar from the 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.909
 Body how the process is the same 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:45.009
 cane privilege crushing process 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:48.310
 cooking back there after cooking 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.989
 perfect for drying and after a 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.209
 generation to produce crystals that 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.739
 specific form of presentation of the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.379
 subject you spoke to him for giving 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.169
 Varzim people with more magnesium selenium 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.689
 that only three elements with our soil is 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:04.000
 poor only very specific areas in 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.729
 pernambuco that has that our land 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.189
 the more purple you have a quality of 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.870
 soil cfu of soil sufficient for 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.340
 meet the need for what these 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.250
 three elements of our life in terms of 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.900
 and minerals we need are 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.060
 essential minerals that we need 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.190
 day to day to maintain our health in 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.900
 literally to keep our 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.550
 machine running properly 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.050
 that are found in which foods 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.340
 in brazil the marketing movement 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.500
 concentration I will give an example of 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.180
 selenium magnesium is in the day to day 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.220
 people are going to Brazil nuts 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.349
 she is well like this castle problem 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.449
 each day at four to six 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.800
 units if the person does not have me 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.860
 had one of the weight because she's shit 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.810
 economy occurs the brown of the para 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.900
 stop eating other things you start to 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.210
 consuming the coconut sugar and another 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.190
 cast guard how is it heat and 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.229
 that obviously then it would work 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.240
 like brown sugar yes that taste 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.580
 heavier and with a higher concentration of 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.830
 minerals they have become nutrient since 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.389
 use properly as 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.860
 of any sugar the world organization 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.080
 health asks us to hold on 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.849
 about 25 grams 20 grams per day 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.710
 more or less and where they are already producing 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.509
 that in the areas that produce with the 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.759
 production areas 10 are northeast of 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:17.000
 from the holy spirit up to 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:19.219
 people have the production is starting us 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.870
 we already have some products produced in 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.569
 Brazil is already beginning the process 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.940
 and to the farmer this is a very 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.699
 interesting because the added value of 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.460
 one of a final process value added 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.680
 coconut sugar as well as being linked to 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.020
 is doing well and health 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.979
 and this is a not a fashion it 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.569
 from the moment we have 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.969
 this information is a trend of 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.860
 market will need products and these 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:46.099
 products generally have added value 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.349
 this really is the final stage 11 we are 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.289
 talking about the south at least around 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.539
 32 to 34 reais a pound of plastic and if the 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.340
 Your Satanic Head The Producer Our Way 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.710
 For you who do not know what to do with 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.629
 coconut shell only by scocco without leaving 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.370
 to produce a fruit while 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:04.520
 produce the coconut then the production of coconut 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.289
 still does not touch and who are the plants 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.330
 who work and operate with these upas 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.310
 normal sugar mills are also not 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.460
 are specific plants that can not 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.199
 being plants is more suitable only adapted 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.020
 to the process there is no problem to be 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.500
 used the process of the cane 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.490
 sugar 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.080
 only they are places of production 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.719
 usually different then he 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.979
 process of transportation outside Brazil 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:26.479
 s / a sugar is also produced that the 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.639
 people between the sugars as the 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.560
 beet for example any you can 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.750
 extracting sugar from any advantage 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.099
 sugar cane quantity until sunday 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.409
 the advantage of sugarcane and the 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:38.689
 amount that the city had exactly 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.519
 Now coming back to 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:43.189
 is the more or less annual production per 

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:45.860
 plant I'm going to give thailand data in 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.889
 a young plant on a young coconut tree 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.169
 less than 20 years and produces 300 liters of 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:54.949
 cooking that will give around 240 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:56.959
 of sugar per year per year and 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.759
 over 40 years that increases production 

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:01.309
 reaches 400 liters and we 're beating 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.259
 About three years ago 320 kg of sugar 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:05.749
 You spoke in 30 thirty ammunitions a day. 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:07.669
 very good for us teachers that I already 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:09.979
 I made the coca that is thirty thirty 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:11.689
 two real per day bank account weighing 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.389
 least almost use any 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:16.399
 coconut tree has caught the attention of many people 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.539
 I wish it was a fantastic product 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.529
 to health 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.889
 the fact is that those who want more 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:24.409
 information on the internet address 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:28.099
 phone can locate through the www

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:34.610
 the instagram fs cardoso and nuno facebook 

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:36.319
 an access to social media nowadays is 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.539
 interesting is this doctor who is 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.069
 cardoso point teaches preventive 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.229
 consulting and sports medicine 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:45.229
 any fact thanks for the presence 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:47.059
 here in our program and by trans good 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:48.919
 information you brought here is about
