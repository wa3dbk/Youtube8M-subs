 Not a little bit and I 'm waiting for the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.659
 I want her to stay in a 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.560
 very soft but also not very hard either 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.560
 consistent 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.880
 clay also people she helps in 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:02.550
 back aging is there 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.740
 so you have to mix well 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.540
 to take is a form of balls and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:15.500
 you just pretty good it is that 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:18.510
 texture as soon as you can see 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.910
 consistent and now it's just you apply in 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.600
 Face, it's okay, I 'm going to tie my hair. 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 that's beautiful darling 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 Just not so good, so good, I'm just going to 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.350
 Up a little bit more that you see 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.350
 amused 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.620
 Then I'll stay like it's on the forehead. 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.780
 it's easier 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.490
 It is in a step close to the eyes that 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.350
 eye region and neither lips 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.600
 these slaves that is what 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.480
 especially in the region of the nose or 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.290
 come out all the way 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.470
 if you have a spine thing 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.540
 like this 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.030
 if you have a spine it will 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.410
 help to dry quickly 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.690
 There is not much secret that will only apply 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.860
 and then let it dry when they 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.710
 eca 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.580
 she starts pulling she just can not even 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.140
 talk about half an hour but you 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.360
 You have to stay quiet, you can talk to 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.950
 she starts to play neither can nor 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.720
 nothing on your lips gets stuck 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.630
 so that's all it makes you dry you know it's going 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.230
 certify well neither know with 50 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.700
 all speeding is you 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.150
 can paint on the neck also got 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.340
 so I'll tell you it starts to dry here 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.410
 well now I'm going to leave more or less 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.910
 to get all white back to 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.910

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.840
 Let's go, I got it, I got it. 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.900
 It is also too good to be afraid because 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.650
 activate the circulation if it gives you 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.020
 good when you apply or see yourself 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.030
 which is very well done the piece does not 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.090
 can talk about risks and make the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.850
 there were polls that happened later 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.760
 What dried out, I did not go there. 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.470
 I took on the spins instead of good bathroom I 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.440

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.030
 neighbor to the one with a spine here 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.789
 She left the champion in nothing was it true. 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.229
 here because she gave me thermal water 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.350
 but there are people who likes to apply a 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:08.410
 moisturizer we need to insulate you 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.410
 To prefer is there, I 'm just going to do it. 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.190

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.419
 media is found in many places and 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:38.030
 There is also a good deal that I know 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.370

 the vita derm that they come from a small package 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.720
 It is a bit expensive but there it also tends to 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.639
 then that's what you feel the same result 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.250
