and easy for our family but something
that's<00:00:32.070> also<00:00:32.340> very<00:00:32.369> safe<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:33.809> excited

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that's also very safe so it was excited

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.569

to<00:00:34.200> check<00:00:34.379> out<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.739> nissan<00:00:35.010> pathfinder

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to check out the nissan pathfinder

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.150 
to check out the nissan pathfinder
because<00:00:35.879> it<00:00:36.089> is<00:00:36.239> large<00:00:36.539> not<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.929> fit<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:37.440> family

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160

very<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.629> logical<00:00:43.409> and<00:00:43.589> practical<00:00:43.620> choice

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
very like logical and practical choice

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.979
