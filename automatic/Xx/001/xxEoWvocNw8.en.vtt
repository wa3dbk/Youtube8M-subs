00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:10.830
 Then... are you going to enter your room now? 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.035
 Hey, you little bad guy. 

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:15.676
 Let me turn on a light first 

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.623
 what happened? 

00:00:20.623 --> 00:00:22.695
蟑..蟑..蟑..蟑..螂! 

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:25.737
 Don't tell me that you are afraid of a few 蟑螂喔

00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:27.794
 These guys are like my roommates. 

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.649
 I also gave them a name. 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:30.819
 How many of them are there? 

00:00:30.818 --> 00:00:33.259
 Um...250 

00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:35.682
 I hope you will not be afraid of snakes. 

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:43.807
 Hey, see how happy he is to see you, Miguel. 

00:00:43.807 --> 00:00:44.958
 Say hello to others 

00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.289
 It seems to be watching the animal planet channel喔

00:00:55.018 --> 00:00:57.259
 Dirty house 

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.689
 Most people think this is a problem 

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:01.202
 I don't know how you feel, but it scares me. 

00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:03.944
 But when I was young, I had something more scary than a dirty house. 

00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:07.290
 When I was young, I would have seen very small problems very big. 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.926
 I just got the sign language of "big" 

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:11.105
 Actually, I don’t know sign language. 

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.938
 In short, when I go back to these issues, they are actually very small. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.349
 Shane! 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:27.275
 Lucky was hit by a car! 

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:28.398
 what!? 

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:29.730
 Just kidding 

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:32.159
 It was hit by a bus 

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.594
 Go buried it. 

00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:38.690
 Ok, this problem is actually quite big. 

00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:40.311
 But there are some smaller things 

00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:42.870
 For example, when I was in middle school, I was afraid to participate in a party with men and women. 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.528
 Ok, everyone, okay boys and girls. 

00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:49.269
 Come and play "Paradise Seven Minutes"! (Party game, draw 2 people by lot or other means, put them in the closet and other places for 7 minutes) 

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:51.174
 Shane, you go first (Party game, draw 2 people by lottery or other means, then put them in the closet and so on for 7 minutes) 

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:53.447
 You go with Gladeth (Party game, pick 2 people by lot or other means, then put them in the closet and so on for 7 minutes) 

00:01:57.447 --> 00:01:58.862
 I have a place to tremble 

00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:01.301
 let's start 

00:02:03.742 --> 00:02:07.765
 Then, what are we going to do? Gladys 

00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:13.381
 Can I speak with a doll? 

00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:15.474
 I will be more comfortable when I speak with her. 

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:17.194
 Okay 

00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:22.259
 Hey, doll wife. 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.265
 what's your name? 

00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:26.703
 Shut up, fxck, I am right!! 

00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:31.954
 Well, this is a true story. 

00:02:31.954 --> 00:02:36.099
 Another thing I was afraid of before was that I was afraid that my friend found me to wet the bed. 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.814
 Oh, yeah, grab it, Bella. 

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:46.493
 Catch my cold bird 

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:51.885
 Oops, I am in bed. 

00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:52.885
 what should I do now? 

00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:55.125
 Yes, we will give it to Jacob (the names of the dreamers are all from the Twilight Series) 

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.324
 The dead Indian 

00:02:57.324 --> 00:02:59.597
 It doesn't matter, maybe it will be done in the morning. 

00:03:05.548 --> 00:03:06.567
 Early 

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:08.787
 What is that smell? 

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:09.825
 taste? 

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:11.294
 What's the taste? 

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:13.018
 I think it is the taste of the morning. 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.056
 It smells like a cat sand bowl 

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:16.545
 Your cat pee in my bed 

00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:17.798
 what?! 

00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:20.438
 Ok, I guess so too. 

00:03:20.437 --> 00:03:23.284
 My mom said that if it dares to pee in bed once, it will be euthanized. 

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:25.936
 Ok, come over, Poptart 

00:03:25.936 --> 00:03:27.229
 It’s gonna die 

00:03:29.554 --> 00:03:33.724
 In fact, it is not a serious matter to be afraid of some things. 

00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:36.293
 I will review it later, for example, if I am in bed. 

00:03:36.294 --> 00:03:37.294
 In fact, it is not so serious. 

00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:38.505
 At least not as serious as the stool in bed 

00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:47.052
 Not good 

00:03:47.052 --> 00:03:49.381
 This is bad. 

00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:50.400
 But I haven’t done this before. 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.314
 In short, what I want to say is that many things may scare you when you are young. 

00:03:54.314 --> 00:03:56.433
 But when you grow up, you will know that there is nothing at all. 

00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:57.623
 So here I have a question to ask you. 

00:03:57.623 --> 00:03:58.860
 What was the most fearful thing when you were young? 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.996
 Are you afraid of darkness? 

00:03:59.997 --> 00:04:01.334
 Still afraid of friends discovering that you are wetting the bed? 

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:04.075
 Have you ever been afraid that when you grow up, you have no friends and you have to be a Youtube movie all day long? 

00:04:04.074 --> 00:04:07.317
 No matter what, even if the message is in the comment area below or respond with a video. 

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.626
 Just below my side 

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:11.819
 Oh, this comment makes me so comfortable. 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.536
 How can I come up with this stuff on my head? 

00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:19.149
 Oh, yes, I’m working on a video with the Take 180 website. 

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.122
 They turned me into a six-high LEGO toy. 

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:23.562
 I also want to warn everyone that I wear one of the world’s worst tops. 

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:26.396
 Not only twice as big as normal but also makes me look weird 

00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:30.615
 It looks like a huge A film actor is giving birth to a child who is about to be born. 

00:04:30.615 --> 00:04:32.120
 Go see it and you will know what I am talking about. 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.512
 Ok, I have to go, see you again next time. 

00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:35.600
 Bye 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.139
 Hey, special effects! 

00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:43.716
 Ok, I played too much time with my hands. 

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.651
 See you next time. 

00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:53.375
 I hope you will not be afraid of snakes 

00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:57.582
