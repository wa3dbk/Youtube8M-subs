hey guys welcome to 40 designing calm I
got<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> five<00:00:02.820> minute<00:00:03.120> or<00:00:03.240> last<00:00:03.480> tutorial<00:00:04.020> for

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
got a five minute or last tutorial for

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.499 
got a five minute or last tutorial for
you<00:00:04.380> it's<00:00:04.890> Easter<00:00:05.250> so<00:00:05.730> let's<00:00:06.060> create<00:00:06.330> an

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
you it's Easter so let's create an

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.410 
you it's Easter so let's create an
Easter<00:00:06.810> egg<00:00:07.519> first<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.760> thing<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.090> need<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.240> do

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
Easter egg first the thing we need to do

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.720 
Easter egg first the thing we need to do
is<00:00:09.570> put<00:00:09.780> us<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.960> sphere<00:00:10.429> on<00:00:11.429> our<00:00:13.099> in<00:00:14.099> our<00:00:14.460> viewer

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
is put us a sphere on our in our viewer

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.519 
is put us a sphere on our in our viewer
and<00:00:15.360> we're<00:00:15.509> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.690> crease<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:15.960> segments

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
and we're going to crease the segments

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.320 
and we're going to crease the segments
to<00:00:16.650> 72<00:00:17.160> gives<00:00:17.310> us<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:17.609> geometry<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> work

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
to 72 gives us more geometry to work

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.080 
to 72 gives us more geometry to work
with<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.949> next<00:00:20.130> thing<00:00:20.460> we're<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:20.910> is

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
with the next thing we're going to do is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.810 
with the next thing we're going to do is
add<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:22.050> taper<00:00:22.529> then<00:00:23.310> we're<00:00:23.430> gonna<00:00:23.580> make<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
add a taper then we're gonna make the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.779 
add a taper then we're gonna make the
taper<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.300> child<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.960> our<00:00:25.080> sphere<00:00:25.640> we're<00:00:26.640> gonna

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
taper a child of our sphere we're gonna

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.939 
taper a child of our sphere we're gonna
kill<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> curvature<00:00:27.720> making<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> zero<00:00:28.590> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
kill the curvature making it zero and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
kill the curvature making it zero and
then<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> strength<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.750> gonna

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
then in the strength we're just gonna

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.420 
then in the strength we're just gonna
begin<00:00:31.109> tapering<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.740> until<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.309> got

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
begin tapering this until we got

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.290 
begin tapering this until we got
ourselves<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:33.090> nice<00:00:33.450> looking<00:00:35.030> egg<00:00:37.129> alright<00:00:38.300> now

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
ourselves a nice looking egg alright now

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.119 
ourselves a nice looking egg alright now
that<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.600> got<00:00:39.750> all<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.260> I'm<00:00:40.680> gonna<00:00:40.890> click

that we got all that in I'm gonna click

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.380 
that we got all that in I'm gonna click
on<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.399> sphere<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:41.969> kind<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:44.210> little<00:00:45.210> action

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
on my sphere I'm kind of a little action

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
on my sphere I'm kind of a little action
here<00:00:45.660> drop<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> floor<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.860> move<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
here drop the floor or move that up and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.369 
here drop the floor or move that up and
drop<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> floor<00:00:48.140> next<00:00:49.140> thing<00:00:49.320> I'm

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379

grayscale goriller gonna use that just

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
grayscale goriller gonna use that just
to<00:00:56.219> give<00:00:56.370> us<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.520> quick<00:00:56.850> lighting<00:00:57.270> let's

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to give us some quick lighting let's

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.869 
to give us some quick lighting let's
kill<00:00:58.350> these<00:00:58.620> vases<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.309> don't<00:00:59.489> need<00:00:59.640> those

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879

kill these vases we don't need those
we've<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:00.899> our<00:01:01.260> egg<00:01:01.500> let's<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> quick

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
we've got our egg let's do a quick

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
we've got our egg let's do a quick
render<00:01:04.880> it's<00:01:05.880> great<00:01:06.180> when<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.540> any<00:01:06.630> shadows

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
render it's great when have any shadows

or anything in and I'm not really
worried<00:01:08.640> about<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.970> right<00:01:09.030> now<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.420> will

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
worried about that right now it will

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.060 
worried about that right now it will
definitely<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.020> better<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> let's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
definitely look better with that let's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
definitely look better with that let's
click<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> camera<00:01:11.880> move<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.020> around<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
click on the camera move this around so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.270 
click on the camera move this around so
it<00:01:13.619> better<00:01:14.509> represents<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:17.750> shot

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
it better represents you know shot

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.730 
it better represents you know shot
alright<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.270> we've<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.810> our<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
alright so we've got our a we got the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.429 
alright so we've got our a we got the
shape<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.790> got<00:01:23.939> us<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.060> basic<00:01:24.840> lighting<00:01:25.110> put

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
shape we got us some basic lighting put

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.560 
shape we got us some basic lighting put
in<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.970> now<00:01:27.180> let's<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.509> ahead<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.810> create<00:01:28.080> us<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
in so now let's go ahead and create us a

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.190 
in so now let's go ahead and create us a
texture

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.200 

double<00:01:34.979> click<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:36.960> our<00:01:37.170> texture<00:01:37.880> let's<00:01:38.880> go

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
double click to get our texture let's go

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.279 
double click to get our texture let's go
in<00:01:39.659> first<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> add<00:01:40.530> us<00:01:40.649> a<00:01:40.770> bump<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.170> I'm

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
in first and add us a bump and what I'm

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.499 
in first and add us a bump and what I'm
using<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.679> this<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.969> is<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> quick

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
using here this is this is a quick

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.749 
using here this is this is a quick
tutorial<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.289> it's<00:01:46.409> been<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> long<00:01:46.710> time<00:01:46.979> but

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
tutorial and it's been a long time but

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.319 
tutorial and it's been a long time but
to<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.600> us<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.350> egg<00:01:49.679> texture<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to get us the egg texture actually the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.580 
to get us the egg texture actually the
bump<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.600> our<00:01:51.720> egg<00:01:51.840> texture<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:52.740> gonna<00:01:53.189> use

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
bump on our egg texture I'm gonna use

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.919 
bump on our egg texture I'm gonna use
actually<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:56.450> drywall<00:01:59.060> texture<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.569> found

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
actually a drywall texture that I found

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.010 
actually a drywall texture that I found
on<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.229> internet<00:02:02.479> make<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.840> search

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
on the internet make it in the search

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.520 
on the internet make it in the search
path<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.850> we've<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.299> our<00:02:06.599> bump<00:02:07.049> texture

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
path so now we've got our bump texture

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.029 
path so now we've got our bump texture
in<00:02:07.619> place<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.269> go<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.959> quickly<00:02:10.200> let's

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
in place and we can go and quickly let's

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.370 
in place and we can go and quickly let's
go<00:02:11.190> ahead<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.430> apply<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:12.110> texture<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.349> our

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
go ahead and apply this texture to our

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.479 
go ahead and apply this texture to our
sphere<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:18.260> render<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.380> out<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.310> see

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
sphere and render this out and you see

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.160 
sphere and render this out and you see
that's<00:02:20.670> that's<00:02:21.390> our<00:02:21.569> texture<00:02:21.959> that's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that's that's our texture that's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.660 
that's that's our texture that's
actually<00:02:22.829> a<00:02:23.239> little<00:02:24.239> bit<00:02:24.950> too<00:02:25.950> grainy<00:02:26.220> doesn't

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
actually a little bit too grainy doesn't

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.370 
actually a little bit too grainy doesn't
much<00:02:27.060> look<00:02:27.239> like<00:02:27.420> an<00:02:27.540> egg<00:02:27.690> it's<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.049> too<00:02:28.170> far

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
much look like an egg it's just too far

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.289 
much look like an egg it's just too far
apart<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.560> way<00:02:31.819> go<00:02:32.819> into<00:02:33.269> our

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
apart so it's out of the way go into our

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.370 
apart so it's out of the way go into our
mapping<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.690> want<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.930> go<00:02:36.989> ahead<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.200> make<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
mapping I want to go ahead and make the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.690 
mapping I want to go ahead and make the
cylindrical<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.280> know<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.549> gonna

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
cylindrical because I know it's gonna

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.039 
cylindrical because I know it's gonna
have<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:39.060> there<00:02:39.239> in<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.750> little<00:02:39.780> while

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
have to be there in just a little while

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.890 
have to be there in just a little while
and<00:02:40.799> let's<00:02:41.340> change<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.730> towels<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.299> three<00:02:42.600> and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and let's change the towels to three and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.270 
and let's change the towels to three and
three<00:02:44.090> which<00:02:45.090> now<00:02:45.569> when<00:02:45.989> we<00:02:46.170> render<00:02:46.410> it's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
three which now when we render it's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.940 
three which now when we render it's
gonna<00:02:47.430> give<00:02:47.579> us<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.819> much<00:02:48.090> finer<00:02:50.900> texture<00:02:51.950> let's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
gonna give us a much finer texture let's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.819 
gonna give us a much finer texture let's
go<00:02:53.069> in<00:02:53.400> here<00:02:53.609> more<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.510> an<00:02:54.750> egg<00:02:54.900> yeah<00:02:55.650> it's

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
go in here more like an egg yeah it's

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.030 
go in here more like an egg yeah it's
more<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.160> an<00:02:56.310> egg<00:02:56.459> now<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.150> see<00:02:57.299> that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
more like an egg now so you can see that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
more like an egg now so you can see that
doesn't<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.880> miss<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.209> world<00:03:00.389> actually

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
doesn't like to miss the world actually

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.379 
doesn't like to miss the world actually
I'm<00:03:01.019> gonna<00:03:01.139> go<00:03:01.290> ahead<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.910> for<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.239> for

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
I'm gonna go ahead and for this just for

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.410 
I'm gonna go ahead and for this just for
it<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.540> show<00:03:03.720> up<00:03:03.900> more<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:05.090> really<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
it to show up more and really the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.890 
it to show up more and really the
texture<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:07.190> texture<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.340> more<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:09.720> don't

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
texture that texture is more it don't

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.610 
texture that texture is more it don't
pop<00:03:10.109> out<00:03:10.290> at<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.730> like<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.930> would<00:03:13.049> love<00:03:13.260> for<00:03:13.319> it

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
pop out at you like I would love for it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.080 
pop out at you like I would love for it
to<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.489> could<00:03:14.639> have<00:03:14.730> spent<00:03:14.880> more<00:03:14.940> time

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
to and I could have spent more time

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.520 
to and I could have spent more time
looking<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.660> texture<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.109> gives<00:03:16.319> us<00:03:16.440> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
looking for a texture but it gives us a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.470 
looking for a texture but it gives us a
little<00:03:16.650> bit<00:03:16.829> of<00:03:16.950> an<00:03:17.040> egg<00:03:17.160> feel<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:18.000> let's<00:03:18.239> just

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
little bit of an egg feel so let's just

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.530 
little bit of an egg feel so let's just
we'll<00:03:19.019> stick<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:21.120> now<00:03:21.239> let's<00:03:21.420> go

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
we'll stick with that so now let's go

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.400 
we'll stick with that so now let's go
back<00:03:21.720> into<00:03:21.750> our<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:24.049> next<00:03:25.049> thing<00:03:25.139> we<00:03:25.200> need<00:03:25.349> to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
back into our and next thing we need to

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.629 
back into our and next thing we need to
do<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.680> add<00:03:25.799> some<00:03:25.950> color<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.519> there's

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
do is add some color to this and there's

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.710 
do is add some color to this and there's
a<00:03:26.700> couple<00:03:26.819> of<00:03:26.940> different<00:03:27.209> ways<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.420> do<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.569> but

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
a couple of different ways to do it but

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.300 
a couple of different ways to do it but
I'm<00:03:27.900> gonna<00:03:28.019> do<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.349> fastest<00:03:28.889> way<00:03:29.069> and

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
I'm gonna do it the fastest way and

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.629 
I'm gonna do it the fastest way and
again<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.569> didn't<00:03:31.530> go<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.919> looking<00:03:32.310> for<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
again I didn't go in looking for the

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.089 
again I didn't go in looking for the
best<00:03:32.910> image<00:03:33.799> when<00:03:34.799> looking<00:03:35.069> for<00:03:37.099> something

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
best image when looking for something

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.280 
best image when looking for something
just<00:03:38.250> real<00:03:38.519> quick<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.840> basically<00:03:40.169> just

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
just real quick and I basically just

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.050 
just real quick and I basically just
took<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.709> screenshot<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.250> an<00:03:41.489> image<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:41.880> is

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
took a screenshot of an image this is

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.440 
took a screenshot of an image this is
just<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.390> pastel<00:03:43.040> stripe

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
just a pastel stripe

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.550 
just a pastel stripe
go<00:03:45.599> ahead<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.870> open<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:49.310> yes<00:03:50.629> and<00:03:51.629> now<00:03:52.379> we've

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
go ahead and open it yes and now we've

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.979 
go ahead and open it yes and now we've
got<00:03:52.739> our<00:03:52.890> color<00:03:54.769> now<00:03:55.769> let's<00:03:55.950> render<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.989> and

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
got our color now let's render that and

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.440 
got our color now let's render that and
we<00:03:58.140> got<00:03:58.290> our<00:03:58.410> Easter<00:03:58.739> egg<00:03:59.150> so<00:04:00.150> there<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.360> go
