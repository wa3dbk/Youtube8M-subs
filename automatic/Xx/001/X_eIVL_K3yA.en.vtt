in now and i do agree that in the video
the<00:01:24.820> room<00:01:25.030> actually<00:01:25.330> does<00:01:26.020> look<00:01:26.100> smaller<00:01:27.100> I

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
the room actually does look smaller I

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.880 
the room actually does look smaller I
don't<00:01:27.880> know<00:01:28.000> why<00:01:28.350> videotape<00:01:29.350> that<00:01:29.380> way<00:01:29.830> but

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
don't know why videotape that way but

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.670 
don't know why videotape that way but
forever<00:01:30.340> reason<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:31.570> room<00:01:31.780> does<00:01:32.200> in<00:01:32.560> the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
forever reason the room does in the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.680 
forever reason the room does in the
video<00:01:32.920> looks<00:01:33.370> smaller<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.000> room<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.360> now<00:01:34.480> but

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
video looks smaller the room and now but

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.360 
video looks smaller the room and now but
it's<00:01:34.810> actually<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.320> actually<00:01:35.620> is<00:01:35.770> bigger<00:01:36.070> as

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
it's actually it actually is bigger as

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.670 
it's actually it actually is bigger as
far<00:01:37.180> as<00:01:37.210> length<00:01:37.570> goes<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.080> think<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.500> same

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
far as length goes I think it's the same

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.700 
far as length goes I think it's the same
length<00:01:38.980> but<00:01:39.130> it's<00:01:39.370> definitely<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:41.260> width<00:01:41.530> is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
length but it's definitely the width is

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.830 
length but it's definitely the width is
definitely<00:01:42.280> wider<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.450> room<00:01:43.690> it's

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
definitely wider this room it's

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.930 
definitely wider this room it's
definitely<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.140> much<00:01:44.290> wider<00:01:44.650> room<00:01:45.040> so<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:45.820> do

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
definitely a much wider room so I do

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.640 
definitely a much wider room so I do
have<00:01:46.090> more<00:01:46.570> space<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.230> fact<00:01:47.410> that<00:01:47.500> I'm
