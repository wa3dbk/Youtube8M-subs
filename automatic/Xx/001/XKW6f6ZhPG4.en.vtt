 this is as if they have not put anything else 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.750
 if you go in the back 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.469
 here is a shortcut that I took is for 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.469

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.159

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.860
 I will continue straight

 limit more 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.670
 in that area 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.140
 in all that area that along 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.440
 let's say you start building by the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.440
 home 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.300
 This is the bride's house but good 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.360
 we are going to 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:09.050
 keep on here this is the typical 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.069
 circle of gta san andreas not very famous 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.730
 we will be here today 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.730
 this is a bridge 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.590
 let's get out of here 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.150
 the official game of the game gta san 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.459
 andreas this here I'm seeing here 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.459
 It's a common bar 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.940
 and this is the pair that we are going to enter as 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.940
 have made 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.830
 and as you see 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.110
 I sub sea let's say this is the bar 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.470
 these are like stools 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.470
 same because you can not upload 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.220
 the breasts here 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.140
 there are many houses here you can do 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.060
 even 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.100
 and 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.490
 but john with many friends 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.490
 Y 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.660
 he does I'm the bridge to see how it goes 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.090
 here 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.630
 I honestly have not seen before is 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.540
 quite pretty pretty big and 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.080
 pretty well done, try your work 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.080
 this here is 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.340
 as still 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.110
 let's go from here 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.319
 these are basketball courts 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.579
 very well very well done 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.579
 as you can see 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.840
 OK 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.190
 let's continue here 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.000
 that's like it's a truck 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:04.530
 is a map really if you see it is not 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.700
 infinite or nothing logically but it is not 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.769
 very big 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.769
 but if it is because it has many houses 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:18.040
 has many things done I want to say 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.280
 that is well well used 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.010
 it's pretty good 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.940
 ok let's see 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.290
 every centimeter was taken advantage of 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.290
 I'll leave it down 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.620
 in survival mode 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.919
 and in mode 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.729
 creative I'm in the creative for 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.099
 be as fast 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.139
 and as you can see here, you can do a lot 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:51.470
 a lot of things 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:53.790
 is how is the map of Algeria websites 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.849
 is 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:01.050
 Perfect for playing with friends 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.180
 not only for the amount of houses you can 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.090
 do here 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.650
 as in hunger games do not get 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.650
 Trunks is pretty good 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.980
 very 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.010
 very well done 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:24.310
 so nothing you will be bringing maps 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:27.850
 but the next videos to be packs 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.880
 pack of three maps what happens that this 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.890
 for I have seen a classic really not 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.030
 we have also appreciated that 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.660
 decided 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.350
 that if you do a ball of sun 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.770
 so nothing we go in the next one 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:48.870
 I embrace everyone and comment punctually on 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.870
