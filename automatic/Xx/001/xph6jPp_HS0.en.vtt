00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 welcome back everyone here and email you today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.550
 brings a new challenge to pokemon y always 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.230
 the single against cullen which is another 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.410
 boy who contacted me through the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.540
 my facebook fan page 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.869
 this challenge is quite old 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.300
 I think it was the fourth or fifth 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.400
 I've done absolutely on pokémon y 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.090
 however decided to put it because anyway 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.130
 it's a pretty good challenge it hasn't been 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.320
 played very well neither on my side nor 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.550
 by his however it is quite good in 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.100
 this first round 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.079
 he sends iron zorn a pokémon I hate 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.670
 and by the way I find it very ugly 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.680
 I send mister renoir use 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.079
 provocation to stop it and I put mine 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.079
 Vito Vite after which I also put the net 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.149
 risky and he uses vigor first 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.660
 blow that to a spectacular animation a 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.539
 my opinion 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.329
 then half header mister norba ko 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.629
 because he did his job he put 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.760
 le hazards now send in cabal field 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.410
 and without playing too much with it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.920
 show it use flamethrower 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.320
 but he is therefore a surprise at the focal 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.930
 tape which is a very strange choice on 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.670
 iron turn and vito not use it 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.340
 rocks I had expected that would 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.590
 used but uses honda thunder which is one 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 move that there and then seemed to me a 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.650
 error and maybe it would have been better 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.000
 vito rocks considering that in this 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.460
 team or us vernet and even such a flame 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.960
 and unfortunately, I anticipate that this 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.329
 your not from me will cause me many problems 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.640
 and yet I say no more he sends in the field 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.060
 I'd been expecting that from me 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.030
 it would have been a spinner, though 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.619
 unfortunately I did not trust being one 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.840
 of the first challenges I did on y not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.250
 I was still pretty good and I didn't 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.710
 still very familiar with the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.710
 spinner so I sent in jellyfish 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.010
 I should probably have sent 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.630
 regis lush to prevent him from using kidnapped 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.240
 around this time I have preached 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.710
 the frost ray and I sent jellyfish here 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.890
 I made a mistake more than a mistake 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.009
 a wanting to be too much in English 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.290
 we would say too much cries I wanted 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.950
 to exaggerate in fact he uses kidnapped around 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.959
 raises all the hazards I put in 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.640
 field in this case both me and him 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.560
 we will play without hazards because ours 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.840
 two pokémon went ko iron back 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.720
 mister renoir me that use dance 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.030
 sword and I should have attacked because 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.820
 you don't play in front of me stay there a 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.440
 a rather high special attack 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.180
 but I felt safe enough 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.310
 during the first challenges or still convinced 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.530
 that mega mogwai was invincible fossés 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.959
 between mythical megami while has some good 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.640
 defenses but the special defense is not 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.300
 very high and therefore I should have here 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.890
 attack 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:53.360
 here I preached a punch download one 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.570
 move however of ski priority 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.090
 luck download and then I used 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.790
 cuteness because precisely convinced black 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.310
 that with hurry I would not have attacked 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.890
 and in fact the profits from the rear gear and 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.730
 send bliss in the field that comes 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 absolutely it is indisputably 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.890
 obliterated destroyed mangled by 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.739
 this cuteness enhanced by dance 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.650
 sword the fact that b went ko 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.910
 with so much ease at the end from 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.799
 his point of view was not one 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.989
 loss so bad because my team is 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.000
 composed mainly of heavy 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.799
 physical attackers and then not glitters 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.120
 would have done who knows what also is 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.060
 better chancy colleagues to the idea of 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.640
 glissi anyway sends me ko jelly e 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.049
 I should have prevented him from knocking me out 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.010
 jellyfish I've really done bad here 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.049
 mistake 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.120
 I send dawn of light and ugly 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.609
 error follows a great play because 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.410
 I expect the ski switch dr 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.630
 and use reverse which is the small one 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.570
 problem that this team that the first 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.940
 team I did is absolutely is 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.820
 unquestionably weak to the pokemon who 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.930
 not stable too when I did 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.900
 I do n't know this challenge 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.849
 royal shield revocation does not also block 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.549
 the state moves at this point 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.140
 it went well for me because roto makes me 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.900
 rocket store if he fired at me 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.829
 fact would have been an epochal disaster 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.500
 because the other one would have done even one 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.570
 beautiful kakà figurine va bè uses 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.669
 launch store and then used a wave 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.380
 and here we are in front of the coffin flins io 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.090
 already i can't hit when i am 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.979
 just confused imagine 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.419
 how many times I can hit when one 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.380
 of my pokemon go learn fringe 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.750
 practically never 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.110
 here i got it completely wrong a 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.669
 play because rotom sent me in 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.259
 confusion apart that spin washing machine 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.810
 a pokémon I didn't know when I got it 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.910
 made this challenge I say that not 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.949
 I knew this pokémon not because it is 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.050
 a pokémon so unknown at the level of 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.460
 bath ing is one of the most pokémon 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.550
 used an absolute but because I have 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.590
 completely skipped the fifth 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.539
 generation i didn't battling in 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.849
 fifth generation and rotom washing machine is 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:59.270
 become famous in which the generation 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.990
 here I send my barbarella inside that a 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.580
 surprise is faster than rotom io 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.370
 I just can't understand I swear to you 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.169
 with hiroto but a problem when I foresee 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.500
 Whether it's a roll of support is a 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.300
 offensive roll and vice versa 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.150
 and by the way just as surprised not 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.490
 I send him kappa with a cut stone and 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.010
 fortunately I end up with whom 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.020
 he has it but without paralysis 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.659
 at this point in the game I have 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.400
 practically lost a pokémon and a half 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.830
 because of roth he ac zero it can 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.930
 quietly reed band walk me off 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.520
 barbarella that it was anyway 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.789
 very good in this match because he has me 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.099
 bred that stupid rotom ea 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:44.659
 this point I send dawn of light 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:48.889
 unfortunately I like to say I lost because a 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:52.280
 he remains dragon knight and season e 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:55.490
 dragon knight is faster than mine 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.610
 vern because we are paralyzed e 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.220
 he doesn't know if he had already calculated it in 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.110
 this turn however I have used bathing establishments and 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.050
 no fire charges because balde ali was 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.419
 my only little hope because 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.710
 I dropped it with two shots 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.840
 of canopies and him 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.970
 could not get me off in one fell swoop 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.800
 and if at this point he had 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.810
 wrong guy had tried to do 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.190
 dragon dance had not remembered that 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.290
 I had already paralyzed myself 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.170
 I could have won though 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.690
 unfortunately short, ideals and he if 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.330
 he plays it best or sweeping 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.850
 immediately walk with light with 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.440
 the outrage knowing that we are not 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.540
 will never stand an outrage and it is 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.480
 paralyzed and then driver attacks 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.330
 before me and then 1 to 0 for him 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.280
 I thank him for the challenge and I thank him 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.650
 also because with this challenge I have 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.180
 Realized how much washing machine roll 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.610
 be a danger now you never know 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.410
 I can handle it more or less or almost always 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.010
 a pokémon made on purpose to manage 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.390
 that damn little guy and I will 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.810
 I make an appointment with the next challenges 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.810
 Hello
