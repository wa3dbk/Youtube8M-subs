steering column in the scowl section

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.420 
steering column in the scowl section
should<00:00:16.139> give<00:00:16.320> everybody<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.740> good<00:00:16.950> idea<00:00:17.279> of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
should give everybody a good idea of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.070 
should give everybody a good idea of
what's<00:00:17.610> necessary<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.330> install<00:00:18.450> a<00:00:18.660> column

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
what's necessary to install a column

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.109 
what's necessary to install a column
into<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> vehicle<00:00:19.740> let's<00:00:20.610> take<00:00:20.759> a<00:00:20.790> look<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
into a vehicle let's take a look at the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.679 
into a vehicle let's take a look at the
column<00:00:21.720> we're<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.110> put<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.349> okay<00:00:23.689> this

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
column we're going to put in okay this

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.570 
column we're going to put in okay this
is<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> our<00:00:25.230> standard<00:00:25.529> tilt<00:00:25.980> columns<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
is one of our standard tilt columns and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.550 
is one of our standard tilt columns and
this<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.270> a<00:00:27.300> eight<00:00:27.570> position<00:00:28.050> tilt<00:00:28.320> steering

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this is a eight position tilt steering

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.710 
this is a eight position tilt steering
column<00:00:29.010> can<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.670> mounted<00:00:29.939> into<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.539> about

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
column can be mounted into just about

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.780 
column can be mounted into just about
any<00:00:30.930> vehicle<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.650> chose<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.640> fit

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
any vehicle but we chose this one to fit

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.820 
any vehicle but we chose this one to fit
this<00:00:32.940> particular<00:00:33.170> application<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.710> its

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
this particular application for its

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.619 
this particular application for its
length<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.550> offer<00:00:35.730> columns<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.330> all<00:00:36.449> different

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
length we offer columns in all different

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.689 
length we offer columns in all different
lengths<00:00:37.080> but<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> 32<00:00:38.129> inch<00:00:38.309> long

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the hole was already in the firewall you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.399 
the hole was already in the firewall you
may<00:00:50.670> need<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.909> sawzall<00:00:51.479> if<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.019> had<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> cut

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
may need a sawzall if you had to cut

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.850 
may need a sawzall if you had to cut
that<00:00:52.559> hole<00:00:52.769> yourself<00:00:53.449> or<00:00:54.449> any<00:00:55.049> tools<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.619> make

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that hole yourself or any tools to make

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.320 
that hole yourself or any tools to make
the<00:00:56.010> hole<00:00:56.159> that<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.369> need<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.790> get<00:00:56.909> in<00:00:57.059> through

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
the hole that you need to get in through

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.289 
the hole that you need to get in through
the<00:00:57.510> firewall<00:00:58.580> initially<00:00:59.580> when<00:00:59.790> we<00:00:59.820> set<00:01:00.089> up<00:01:00.119> a

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
the firewall initially when we set up a

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.210 
the firewall initially when we set up a
column<00:01:00.659> we'd<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> tell<00:01:01.500> people<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> set

column we'd like to tell people to set

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.570 
column we'd like to tell people to set
up<00:01:02.339> with<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.549> wood<00:01:03.449> dowel<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> PI<00:01:04.320> Tim<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
up with a wood dowel and a PI Tim that

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
up with a wood dowel and a PI Tim that
allows<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> adjust<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.840> angle<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
allows them to adjust the angle to get a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.830 
allows them to adjust the angle to get a
good<00:01:07.860> idea<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:08.790> want<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.270> column

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
good idea of where they want this column

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.179 
good idea of where they want this column
to<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.680> vehicle

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
to be in the vehicle

Issac in this case we're already pretty

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
Issac in this case we're already pretty
set<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.730> takes<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.300> that<00:01:15.480> is

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
set we know what it takes but that is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.360 
set we know what it takes but that is
normally<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.110> best<00:01:16.320> thing<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.890> need<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> have

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
hold the column in for the vehicle and

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
hold the column in for the vehicle and
this<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.400> a<00:01:44.580> seven<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.300> a<00:01:45.360> half<00:01:45.540> inch

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
this this is a seven and a half inch

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.920 
this this is a seven and a half inch
drop<00:01:46.050> this<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.620> go<00:01:46.800> to<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.310> dashboard<00:01:47.550> or<00:01:48.150> in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
drop this will go to the dashboard or in

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.960 
drop this will go to the dashboard or in
this<00:01:49.080> case<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.650> fiberglass<00:01:50.130> body<00:01:50.370> vehicle

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
this case it's a fiberglass body vehicle

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.880 
this case it's a fiberglass body vehicle
and<00:01:51.150> it'll<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.780> structural<00:01:52.380> beam<00:01:52.620> that's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and it'll go to a structural beam that's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.440 
and it'll go to a structural beam that's
up<00:01:53.100> underneath<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.700> dash<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.150> mount<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
up underneath the dash to mount the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.290 
up underneath the dash to mount the
column<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:56.460> were<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:57.800> steel<00:01:58.800> -<00:01:59.159> then<00:02:00.120> we

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
column to if this were a steel - then we

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.780 
column to if this were a steel - then we
would<00:02:00.479> use<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.960> drop<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.100> contoured

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
would use a drop that is contoured

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.750 
would use a drop that is contoured
specifically<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.500> -<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.340> cut<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:05.640> an

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
specifically for that - it's cut at an

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.640 
specifically for that - it's cut at an
angle<00:02:06.150> so<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> matches<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.110> angle<00:02:07.260> on<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
angle so it matches the angle on the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.249 
angle so it matches the angle on the
column<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:09.090> case<00:02:09.299> we<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.659> a<00:02:09.690> steel<00:02:10.019> bar

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
column in this case we have a steel bar

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.050 
column in this case we have a steel bar
underneath<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> John<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> install

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
underneath and John is going to install

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.960 
underneath and John is going to install
the<00:02:12.239> column<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.900> bar<00:02:13.340> now<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.580> happens

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the column to that bar now this happens

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.660 
the column to that bar now this happens
to<00:02:15.150> be<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.480> seven<00:02:16.140> inch<00:02:16.319> drop<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.430> seats

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
to be a seven inch drop if the seats

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.670 
to be a seven inch drop if the seats
were<00:02:17.880> lowered<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.450> vehicle<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.080> would<00:02:19.410> go

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
were lowered in the vehicle you would go

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.520 
were lowered in the vehicle you would go
the<00:02:19.829> longer<00:02:20.250> drop<00:02:20.599> if<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.840> seats<00:02:22.049> were<00:02:22.230> raised

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the longer drop if the seats were raised

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.380 
the longer drop if the seats were raised
in<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:22.950> vehicle<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.849> would<00:02:23.969> need<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> go

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
in the vehicle then you would need to go

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.660 
in the vehicle then you would need to go
with<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.629> shorter<00:02:25.590> drop<00:02:25.829> so<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.340> that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
with a shorter drop so that that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.280 
with a shorter drop so that that
steering<00:02:26.969> wheel<00:02:27.090> isn't<00:02:27.510> coming<00:02:27.780> across<00:02:28.049> your

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
different types of steering columns we

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.119 
different types of steering columns we
make<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.170> everybody's<00:02:34.650> column<00:02:35.010> we

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
make them for everybody's column we

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.470 
make them for everybody's column we
prefer<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.670> they're<00:02:35.819> using<00:02:36.000> one<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.299> our

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
prefer that they're using one of our

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.750 
prefer that they're using one of our
columns<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.230> these<00:02:37.620> will<00:02:37.859> work<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.310> any<00:02:38.489> make

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
columns but these will work for any make

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.030 
columns but these will work for any make
up<00:02:38.790> column<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.719> there<00:02:40.040> he's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
up column that is out there he's

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.069 
up column that is out there he's
basically<00:02:41.400> got<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.730> drop<00:02:42.510> supported

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
basically got the drop supported

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.649 
basically got the drop supported
underneath<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.590> dash<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.299> he's<00:02:45.299> going<00:02:45.569> to

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
underneath the dash and he's going to

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.099 
underneath the dash and he's going to
open<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.769> up<00:02:46.829> it's<00:02:47.219> actually<00:02:47.370> two<00:02:47.819> pieces<00:02:48.109> we

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
open that up it's actually two pieces we

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.750 
open that up it's actually two pieces we
do<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.439> some<00:02:49.739> customers<00:02:50.189> that<00:02:50.219> have<00:02:50.549> seen

that and thankful how do I get the

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.259 
that and thankful how do I get the
column<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.650> there<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.459> actually<00:02:53.639> our<00:02:53.909> buffer

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
column in there and actually our buffer

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.119 
column in there and actually our buffer
does<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> fantastic<00:02:54.780> job<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:55.919> very

does a fantastic job and it's very
difficult<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.730> see<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.209> line<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.639> is

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
difficult to see that line but it is

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.990 
difficult to see that line but it is
actually<00:03:00.030> two<00:03:00.450> pieces<00:03:01.129> next<00:03:02.129> he's<00:03:02.579> going<00:03:02.909> to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
actually two pieces next he's going to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.800 
actually two pieces next he's going to
be<00:03:03.120> using<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.689> adjustable<00:03:04.079> floor<00:03:04.409> mount<00:03:05.810> this

our ball floor mount and what it allows

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.089 
our ball floor mount and what it allows
is<00:03:12.419> the<00:03:12.750> column<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.379> go<00:03:13.560> through<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.919> ball

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
is the column can go through the ball

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.670 
is the column can go through the ball

the ball can adjust for any angle that

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.220 
the ball can adjust for any angle that
the<00:03:16.799> column<00:03:17.159> may<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.370> coming<00:03:17.760> through<00:03:18.000> at<00:03:18.230> what

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
the column may be coming through at what

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.959 
the column may be coming through at what
he's<00:03:19.409> going<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.739> have<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.159> is<00:03:20.340> slip<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:20.730> on

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
then realize that the thread is much too

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.230 
then realize that the thread is much too
long<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:01.680> then<00:05:02.680> most<00:05:03.220> people<00:05:03.400> will<00:05:03.730> then<00:05:03.910> mark

assembly<00:07:23.289> to<00:07:23.470> do<00:07:23.590> they<00:07:24.070> just<00:07:24.099> have<00:07:24.430> to<00:07:24.580> screw

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:24.789 
assembly to do they just have to screw

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.189 
assembly to do they just have to screw
the<00:07:24.940> knob<00:07:25.090> on<00:07:25.270> to<00:07:25.479> the<00:07:25.599> lever<00:07:25.810> and<00:07:27.330> then<00:07:28.330> you

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 
the knob on to the lever and then you

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.529 
the knob on to the lever and then you
would<00:07:29.380> attach<00:07:29.710> this<00:07:30.039> into<00:07:30.460> the<00:07:30.580> column<00:07:30.910> the

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
would attach this into the column the

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:34.260 
would attach this into the column the
tilt<00:07:31.900> lever<00:07:32.139> and<00:07:32.500> four-way<00:07:33.160> flasher<00:07:33.760> just

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.270 
tilt lever and four-way flasher just

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.800 
tilt lever and four-way flasher just
screw<00:07:34.599> in<00:07:35.490> they<00:07:36.490> actually<00:07:36.849> thread<00:07:37.150> right<00:07:37.360> into

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:37.810 
screw in they actually thread right into

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.980 
screw in they actually thread right into
the<00:07:37.930> provided<00:07:38.620> threads<00:07:39.539> and<00:07:40.539> then<00:07:40.659> the<00:07:40.780> turn

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
the provided threads and then the turn

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.839 
the provided threads and then the turn
signal<00:07:41.409> lever<00:07:41.560> actually<00:07:42.039> has<00:07:42.190> a<00:07:42.220> screw<00:07:42.639> that

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:42.849 
signal lever actually has a screw that

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.450 
signal lever actually has a screw that
goes<00:07:43.000> through<00:07:43.360> it<00:07:43.479> a<00:07:43.720> lot<00:07:44.650> of<00:07:44.770> customers<00:07:45.250> will

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:45.460 
goes through it a lot of customers will

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.550 
goes through it a lot of customers will
request<00:07:45.849> that<00:07:46.060> we<00:07:46.270> will<00:07:46.419> add<00:07:46.570> options<00:07:47.110> on<00:07:47.349> to

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 
request that we will add options on to

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.620 
request that we will add options on to
the<00:07:47.650> column<00:07:48.010> one<00:07:48.490> of<00:07:48.610> the<00:07:48.669> options<00:07:49.180> would<00:07:49.419> be<00:07:49.479> a

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:49.630 
the column one of the options would be a

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.200 
the column one of the options would be a
cruise<00:07:50.080> control<00:07:50.560> that<00:07:51.220> replaces<00:07:51.849> the<00:07:51.880> turn

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.210 
cruise control that replaces the turn

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.149 
cruise control that replaces the turn
signal<00:07:52.599> lever<00:07:52.810> so<00:07:53.530> that<00:07:53.710> they<00:07:53.830> can<00:07:54.010> have

00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 
signal lever so that they can have

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:56.760 
signal lever so that they can have
cruise<00:07:54.460> control<00:07:54.580> on<00:07:55.030> their<00:07:55.180> vehicle<00:07:55.770> some

cruise control on their vehicle some

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.189 
cruise control on their vehicle some
other<00:07:56.919> options<00:07:57.460> that<00:07:57.550> we<00:07:57.669> use<00:07:58.030> are<00:07:58.389> a<00:07:58.780> dimmer

00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 
other options that we use are a dimmer

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.860 
other options that we use are a dimmer
or<00:07:59.440> wiper<00:07:59.949> control<00:08:00.520> which<00:08:00.789> can<00:08:01.000> also<00:08:01.150> go<00:08:01.510> on<00:08:01.659> to

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:01.870 
or wiper control which can also go on to

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.820 
or wiper control which can also go on to
these<00:08:01.990> levers<00:08:03.270> up<00:08:04.270> to<00:08:04.570> two<00:08:04.840> of<00:08:05.139> those<00:08:05.470> three

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:05.830 
these levers up to two of those three

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.000

options<00:08:06.070> to<00:08:06.639> be<00:08:06.760> installed<00:08:07.240> in<00:08:07.570> the<00:08:08.349> column

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.010 
options to be installed in the column

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.980 
options to be installed in the column
and<00:08:09.159> we<00:08:09.610> will<00:08:09.820> wire<00:08:10.000> those<00:08:10.300> right<00:08:10.570> through<00:08:10.810> to

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:10.990 
and we will wire those right through to

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.419 
and we will wire those right through to
begin<00:08:11.260> with<00:08:11.440> to<00:08:11.949> make<00:08:12.130> installation<00:08:12.639> easier
