Pizza<00:00:06.510> Man<00:00:06.720> Matt<00:00:07.200> Gradle<00:00:07.740> nice<00:00:07.950> guys

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.919 

many<00:00:14.639> are<00:00:14.789> number<00:00:14.999> one<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.780> ever

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
many are number one have you ever

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.630 
many are number one have you ever
wondered<00:00:16.289> what<00:00:16.530> would<00:00:16.590> happen<00:00:16.980> if<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.460> took

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
wondered what would happen if you took

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.320 
wondered what would happen if you took
milk<00:00:18.090> food<00:00:18.810> coloring<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.679> a<00:00:19.830> clock<00:00:20.310> put<00:00:21.240> it

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
milk food coloring it's a clock put it

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.339 
milk food coloring it's a clock put it
all<00:00:21.420> together<00:00:23.300> you<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.509> dynamical

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
all together you get a dynamical

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.470 
all together you get a dynamical
reaction<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.369> only<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.789> described<00:00:27.240> as

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
reaction that can only be described as

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.249 
reaction that can only be described as
high-speed<00:00:28.699> low-drag<00:00:29.749> the<00:00:30.749> science<00:00:31.109> behind

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
high-speed low-drag the science behind

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.680 
high-speed low-drag the science behind
this<00:00:31.589> is<00:00:31.919> that<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.189> atoms<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> tent<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
this is that the atoms in the tent of

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.529 
this is that the atoms in the tent of
birth<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> lock<00:00:34.739> slide<00:00:35.039> our<00:00:35.940> arrangement

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
birth of the lock slide our arrangement

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.869 
birth of the lock slide our arrangement
was<00:00:36.660> called<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.050> trolli<00:00:37.649> onic<00:00:38.129> matrix<00:00:40.789> when<00:00:41.789> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
was called a trolli onic matrix when you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.689 
was called a trolli onic matrix when you
multiply<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.600> trolli<00:00:42.960> annika<00:00:43.410> matrix<00:00:43.829> by<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.000 

no<00:00:52.859> I<00:00:53.420> don't<00:00:54.420> remember<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.989> from<00:00:55.050> physics<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
no I don't remember that from physics in

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.470 
no I don't remember that from physics in
the<00:00:56.100> beginning<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.640> sounded<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.359> knew

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the beginning it sounded like you knew

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
the beginning it sounded like you knew
what<00:00:57.510> he<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:57.750> talking<00:00:57.809> about<00:00:58.199> until<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
what he was talking about until that I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.229 
what he was talking about until that I
say<00:00:59.609> real<00:01:00.000> he's<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:01.109> making<00:01:01.920> tie-dye<00:01:02.730> with

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
say real he's really making tie-dye with

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.509 
say real he's really making tie-dye with
a<00:01:03.660> bowl<00:01:03.960> full<00:01:04.230> of<00:01:04.290> milk<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:05.189> I'm<00:01:05.369> gonna

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
a bowl full of milk I think I'm gonna

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
a bowl full of milk I think I'm gonna
agree<00:01:05.729> yeah<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.299> real<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.110> don't<00:01:07.290> know<00:01:07.500> how

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
agree yeah I think real I don't know how

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
agree yeah I think real I don't know how
it's<00:01:07.830> happening<00:01:08.220> yeah<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.090> fake<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.840> think

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it's happening yeah I think fake I think

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
it's happening yeah I think fake I think
fake<00:01:10.470> -<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.979> call<00:01:11.430> fake<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.000> girls<00:01:12.240> against

is real right that wouldn't be the
awesome<00:01:27.819> coolest<00:01:28.270> backyard<00:01:28.869> thing<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.920> have

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
awesome coolest backyard thing to have

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.859 
awesome coolest backyard thing to have
because<00:01:30.460> you've<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.789> lawn<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.420> then<00:01:31.479> when<00:01:31.719> it's

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
yeah you got it this is real all right

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.779 
yeah you got it this is real all right
here's<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.270> last<00:01:43.450> video<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.789> the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
here's the last video this is the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:59.730 
here's the last video this is the
cinnamon<00:01:46.530> dumbbell

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:08.100 

no<00:02:04.300> fake<00:02:05.300> fake<00:02:06.080> there's<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.800> cut<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> video

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
no fake fake there's a cut in the video

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.249 
no fake fake there's a cut in the video
hmm

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
hmm

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.050 
hmm
there's<00:02:09.679> no<00:02:09.860> way<00:02:10.009> that's<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.369> real<00:02:10.520> 40-pound

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
there's no way that's the real 40-pound

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.550 
there's no way that's the real 40-pound
dumbbell<00:02:11.300> because<00:02:11.780> watch<00:02:12.020> how<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.410> bounces

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
dumbbell because watch how it bounces

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.490 
dumbbell because watch how it bounces
right<00:02:12.860> off<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.340> his<00:02:13.459> junk<00:02:16.630> yeah<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:18.050> feel<00:02:18.350> like

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
right off of his junk yeah I feel like

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.240 
right off of his junk yeah I feel like
you<00:02:18.620> would<00:02:18.770> have<00:02:18.860> been<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> lot<00:02:19.220> more

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
you would have been a lot more

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.830 
you would have been a lot more
debilitated<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.180> think<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.570> probably

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
debilitated I think it's probably

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840 
debilitated I think it's probably
actually<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.620> real<00:02:21.800> weight<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.550> think<00:02:22.730> he

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
actually the real weight I just think he

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.900 
actually the real weight I just think he
didn't<00:02:23.150> land<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.990> target<00:02:24.470> mm<00:02:24.920> we've<00:02:25.670> seen

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
didn't land on the target mm we've seen

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.580 
didn't land on the target mm we've seen
too<00:02:26.150> many<00:02:26.270> cinnamon<00:02:26.780> challenges<00:02:27.260> where<00:02:27.470> they

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
too many cinnamon challenges where they

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.780 
too many cinnamon challenges where they
haven't<00:02:27.830> been<00:02:27.890> able<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.190> keep<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.550> in<00:02:28.670> their

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
haven't been able to keep it in their

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.010 
haven't been able to keep it in their
mouths<00:02:28.970> oh<00:02:29.240> there<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.600> comes

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
mouths oh there it comes

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.740 
mouths oh there it comes
