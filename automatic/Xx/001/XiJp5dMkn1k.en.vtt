this<00:03:56.019> could<00:03:56.200> be<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.319> structural<00:03:56.799> thing<00:03:56.859> because

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
this could be a structural thing because

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:03.179 
this could be a structural thing because
it<00:03:57.790> really<00:03:58.329> feels<00:03:59.639> firm<00:04:01.349> towards<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.530> middle
