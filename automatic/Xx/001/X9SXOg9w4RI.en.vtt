00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.160
 air dough now we will be with you 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.130
 make pies 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.429
 we will make pies with cabbage 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.439
 me stuffing cabbage I have it specially 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.140
 put a friend to the family glass 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.809
 the extra liquid cabbage i did i 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.480
 pies stuffing first i roasted onions 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.629
 until golden brown then put there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.899
 cabbage and it all roasted if you 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.910
 wish you can add a hard-boiled egg i 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.059
 not added just for those reasons 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.520
 because I bake pies are always a lot and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.280
 with the egg as if they can not lie long 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.620
 pies they can spoil it like 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.809
 not safe with cabbage they can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.680
 lie down and day and 2 and 3 if you don't 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 have eaten there is nothing wrong now 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.010
 see and what i will do i like this 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.549
 Here I take this dough slightly such sprinkle 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.390
 flour and a little bit I forgot you 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.000
 say that as always on a baking sheet and I 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.610
 Stela paper and a baking tray and nothing 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.580
 grease I bed paper for you on 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.030
 that here is such a paper and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.790
 called for baking the most important thing 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.610
 look to be on paper on 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.280
 box is not written is not required 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.640
 requires to lubricate that it is not necessary 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.649
 lubricate does not require lubrication here if you 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.259
 buy somewhere cheap there 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.890
 the paper here can simply 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.500
 cakes stick to this paper dear 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.820
 don't stick now see what i 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.770
 will do 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.090
 it's my egg here for greasing pies 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.840
 now we are going to do with you as pies 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.620
 This is not the kind of course good if you have 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.050
 much you no one then when 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.940
 make cakes pies should 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.250
 be sure to separate that is 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.600
 increase in volume somewhere around 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.300
 twice then bake them only if 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.120
 you are not so many 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:33.600
 protvine means what you do then you 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 take so here we take a little 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.310
 so do these small buns 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.070
 and we put these tents somewhere on 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.040
 the table so they lay down 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.890
 This same as a fool took place. That is, they 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.739
 increased in volume I Protvino 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.230
 a lot so i don't just plain 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.830
 this text is just extraordinary 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.040
 it turned out that look I never 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.580
 I use a rolling pin, I take it like this 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.640
 talk about her and stretch about 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:15.400
 stretched his dough until 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.920
 then i give i do all science 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.280
 because there is no such thing hard to take 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.280
 cabbage 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.540
 fillings can be put more to not 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.450
 there is one dough then I take it like this 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:38.019
 helps finger 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:40.650
 I put it like this and we do it like that 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:45.860
 pie 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:50.720
 here and put my hand down the seam like that I take 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.720
 so I pull out the dough 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:00.540
 look at the chip 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:04.319
 why exactly the bottom case if the top of the seam 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.079
 they may burst the cakes disperse like 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:17.160
 would have passed it is not very beautiful shyshova 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:22.139
 vertu i do like this can be done and 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.970
 buns can be made cheesecakes all because 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.550
 of this dough because the dough is very 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:32.729
 delicious air we make pies bye 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.599
 not fill our whole sneaky so i 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:40.009
 I'm doing just a little bit like I said 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:45.710
 show all all all the dough I have not 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:49.800
 will be consumed if the filling is not enough 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:59.430
 happens so not enough stuffing so I 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:05:01.680
 I make buns here are beautiful cakes I 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.900
 I make pies always not so 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.919
 small medium ponies 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.919
 Perhaps so 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.229
 make our pies 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:22.080
 if the dough stays with me 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:26.560
 and the filling is over, I'll show you then 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:31.409
 how do i make buns which form no less 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:37.300
 if i have this 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:44.310
 pinch pinch tight to 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.310
 nowhere have we gotten nothing 7 patties 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.909
 when we made pies with you 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:56.409
 we filled our pan with pies we 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:06:00.069
 we take an egg like that shot down we take a brush 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:09.360
 silicone brush is very comfortable and here 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:09.360
 so our cakes we oil the eggs 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:20.500
 that they were beautiful had a glossy 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:25.199
 such a view if your little advice if 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:29.500
 your oven dries some pies 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:31.620
 when you get out of the oven you 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.680
 take in the marlechka 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:38.610
 wet it with water in one layer and 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.319
 cover our baked cakes 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.770
 Marlechka wet mom and on top 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:48.300
 cover with a towel when our cakes 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:51.129
 took away the whip and there will be soft hams hamsters 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.810
 here are our pies 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:57.750
 look how rosy they turned out 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.460
 roasted see see what dough 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.830
 it is soft porous 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.289
 I want to tell you a little little 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.650
 more advice if you have a bad oven 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.020
 don't despair 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.680
 buy an electric oven with 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.470
 convection and all issues will be resolved on 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.860
 this i say goodbye to you goodbye 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.860
