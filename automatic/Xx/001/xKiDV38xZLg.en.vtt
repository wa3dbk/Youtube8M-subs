00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:08.219
 Well I'm going to talk to you about the fish 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.559
 beta is a well-known fish the pellet to 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.530
 everyone knows everyone we know 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.950
 good 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 the beta fish is a fish from puddles of 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.440
 mud 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 from the mud like that where your water is not 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.830
 oxygenated is stagnant then by 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.279
 that he developed a labyrinth with 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.970
 which rises takes the oxygen from above the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.630
 air and it comes back and goes down 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.090
 so you will put an oxygenate one 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.760
 stone diffuser there everything is oxygen in its 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.300
 water he will not drink it from the water 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.510
 will take advantage 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 he's just going to take the oxygen from above 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.399
 rises taking oxygen and returns and lowers it 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.250
 you will never take it from the water because you do not 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.660
 need with him is enough without 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.660
 oxygen he takes it from above 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.170
 good 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.820
 there are people who have it in the aquarium 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.610
 community that's also good because 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.720
 enjoys a leak of all its 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.940
 waste 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.690
 but well fine very well so alone 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:24.500
 mine so alone in one in a fish tank 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.690
 little fish feeding beta 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.210
 the eta fish then they sell their food 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.430
 special for veins that gives you better 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.360
 color and all that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.210
 but not all beta fish like it 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.159
 that food does not everyone like 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.049
 there are some who really love that 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.330
 food but there are some who do not receive it 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.300
 very good if you are that your beta skin 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.259
 spits out that food and does not take it and what 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 leaves in the water because they assimilate very well 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.910
 the veins the common leaflets flakes 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.110
 I give him from time to time it was like that 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.860
 how are you 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.229
 it was the normal ones are flakes for 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.970
 golfers of the tetra brand 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.550
 assimilate very well the betas 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.100
 but recent food but of course 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.260
 the sales food is not dirty the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.200
 water and how they are usually in 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.240
 small spaces because if it 's better 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.690
 Give it to yourself so it does not get dirty 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.340
 Water 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.290
 we have to receive the food 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.780
 special to touch them live food once 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.120
 a week because these fish can be 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.750
 say they are very carnivorous 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.549
 and it is better to give them brine shrimp 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.560
 once a week so they have colors 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.770
 very beautiful and healthy are healthy 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.450
 I give mine your ifex part of mine 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.450
 you have not tried it but I am going to give it to you 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.439
 beta sometimes not because as everyone knows not 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.659
 they can be between males because they 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.659
 fight and shatter to death 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.430
 they kill they kill they kill they can not 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.430
 be between males 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.380
 2 betas planting 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.430
 It is not very common for them to fight but also 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.030
 fights arise if this is the way it should be 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.670
 because they are in very small spaces 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.680
 so that they have two females that 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.200
 have space for each one to be like 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.140
 separated as their territory but between 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.020
 males and whatever they are going to kill themselves 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.380
 They will not destroy so maybe I 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.600
 you are alone you can have many many 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.819
 betas but each one in its respective 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.830
 Aquarius 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:53.460
 each one in its respective 40 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.130
 I have this here, I have it here alone and 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.060
 I have another beta in my aquarium 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.459
 community 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.930
 my community choir I have another eta this 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.340
 I can not get it because the one who is already 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.129
 it's macho I have to have them separated 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.950
 the beta fish is a loose fish that does not 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.110
 I like to swim a lot but it's a fish very, very 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.000
 very pretty 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.000
 super is very very nice 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.980
 that's how it's not so weak and everything is a 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.260
 Very beautiful fish and it is easy to maintain 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.169
 just that people do not know and already and they 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.819
 Render with step is so so pretty 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:36.270
 so this is the basics about the goal 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:39.360
 good temperature 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.300
 and they live in very cold places because if 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.280
 have to have him in his heating or if not 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.410
 it's in places so cold because it's not 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.600
 necessary the target fish comes as water 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.590
 is more than everything as tempered as not 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.890
 so cold not so hot 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.520
 here I have it and in this boat yes where 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.190
 I have it here it stays more or less 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.340
 at 20 degrees the temperature there is 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.810
 well for the the planet needs a ph 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.090
 of 7 a totally neutral neutral ph for 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.880
 this planet to detect very easy 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.580
 have the neutral ph as 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.100
 by buying only water has to 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.110
 take treated water for the one that sells 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.060
 so that we take 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.010
 it is not clear because he lives in 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.830
 very small spaces and it's a little 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.570
 of water to take a bottle and with 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.790
 that's fine for your changes and everything 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.890
 have it always with water to drink because 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.870
 that is already neutral 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:43.840
 with the ph of 7 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.840
 and it's a very nice fish 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.610
 is to enjoy a very beautiful fish that's what 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.830
 that I tell you about the beta and I hope that 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.830
 have a very happy and very healthy fish
