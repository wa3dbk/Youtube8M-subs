00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
hello and welcome to the TSP today we

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.419 
hello and welcome to the TSP today we
are<00:00:05.490> making<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:06.240> quick<00:00:06.600> video<00:00:06.990> on<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:08.069> new

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
are making a quick video on the new

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.259 
are making a quick video on the new
daylight<00:00:09.240> sensors<00:00:09.870> feature<00:00:10.550> which<00:00:11.550> if<00:00:11.880> you

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
daylight sensors feature which if you

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.039 
daylight sensors feature which if you
right-click<00:00:13.049> them<00:00:13.620> they<00:00:14.190> turn<00:00:14.519> into<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> night

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
right-click them they turn into a night

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.349 
right-click them they turn into a night
light<00:00:16.590> sensor<00:00:17.400> does<00:00:18.359> they<00:00:18.539> make<00:00:18.900> sense<00:00:19.340> well

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
light sensor does they make sense well

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.359 
light sensor does they make sense well
they<00:00:21.359> will<00:00:21.480> emit<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> redstone<00:00:22.230> signal<00:00:22.380> when

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
they will emit a redstone signal when

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.810 
they will emit a redstone signal when
it's<00:00:23.519> night<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:25.189> protect<00:00:26.189> some<00:00:26.310> redstone<00:00:26.519> here

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it's night so protect some redstone here

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.109 
it's night so protect some redstone here
you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:29.310> emitting<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
you can see they are not emitting a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.319 
you can see they are not emitting a
redstone<00:00:30.810> signal<00:00:31.160> if<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.460> set<00:00:32.809> time<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:35.329> 18,000

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
redstone signal if we set time to 18,000

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.260 
redstone signal if we set time to 18,000
they<00:00:36.840> are<00:00:37.110> knitting<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.770> redstone<00:00:38.070> signal<00:00:38.399> so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
they are knitting a redstone signal so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.479 
they are knitting a redstone signal so
let's<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.690> back<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.940> 5,000<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:46.010> here<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.340> can

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
let's go back to 5,000 and here we can

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.100 
let's go back to 5,000 and here we can
see<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:48.030> very<00:00:48.500> simple<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:50.640> efficient<00:00:51.360> lamp

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
see some very simple but efficient lamp

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.790 
see some very simple but efficient lamp
designs<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:53.840> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.989> see<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> very<00:00:55.440> basic

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
designs as you can see is a very basic

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.369 
designs as you can see is a very basic
one<00:00:56.780> another<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:59.899> another<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.230> here

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
one another one here another one here

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.280 
one another one here another one here
and<00:01:02.899> all<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.229> these<00:01:04.790> actually<00:01:05.790> function<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and all of these actually function as a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.340 
and all of these actually function as a
proper<00:01:07.920> light<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> let's<00:01:13.760> set<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.360> light

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
proper light so let's set it to light

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.630 
proper light so let's set it to light
and<00:01:17.450> all<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.750> them<00:01:18.900> turn<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.640> simultaneously

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
and all of them turn on simultaneously

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.940 
and all of them turn on simultaneously
and<00:01:21.830> here<00:01:22.830> guys<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.869> these<00:01:25.140> lamps

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and here guys are all of these lamps

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.719 
and here guys are all of these lamps
with<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.030> John<00:01:27.570> Smith<00:01:27.990> texture<00:01:28.560> pack<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
with the John Smith texture pack and I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.600 
with the John Smith texture pack and I
must<00:01:30.180> say<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.659> look<00:01:30.930> better<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.610> but

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
must say they do look better now but
