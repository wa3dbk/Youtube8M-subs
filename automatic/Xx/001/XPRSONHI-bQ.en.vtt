00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.820
♫ Intro ♫

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.119
Hi, Matt! How lucky you came!

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.760
I was about to call for you to come to play.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.960
Play?

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.320
Great! What do you wanna play?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.020
Do you like painting?

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.300
Yes, indeed!

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.970
Well, then we'll have fun!

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150
What have you got in that box?

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.490
It’s something my dad bought at the carpenter’s workshop near here

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.920
to give my little brother in his birthday.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.160
That’s funny!

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.060
Usually, those presents are bought at the toy shop...

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.460
Look, there’re many pieces of wood with different shapes, for him to build towers, houses...

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.050
...and anything he feels like!

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.069
They’re very nice, Nat...

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:57.569
...but instead of pieces of wood I’d call them geometric shapes.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.200
And you came up with geometry.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.810
So, what do you wanna do?

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.030
I want to paint them with different colours, to make them look nicer.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.300
Here I’ve got some paint, paintbrushes, and all the stuff we need.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.850
Good! Let's paint!

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.850
I’ll start by this one, which looks like the roof of a tower.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.290
It’s called a cone, Natalie.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.780
¡Cone! I hope to remember it...

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.180
I’ll take this cube.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.299
The cone keeps moving!

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.470
But, why are you working so quietly?

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.850
Well, it’s a matter of faces.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.040
Faces? Did I paint my face?

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.060
No, Nat!

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.080
I think it’ll be better if we review what we’ve learnt at school.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.420
Children, please, have a look at the objects on the table:

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.080
There're all kinds of shapes and colours.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.120
Can we touch them?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.940
We’ll do something even better: watch them and I’ll ask you some questions.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.560
Yes, miss!

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.060
Let's start!

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.560
Ok, let's see...

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.280
What can you tell me about these geometric shapes??

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.760
Some have edges...

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.240
...ones have more than others.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.420
The fuchsia one, my favourite colour, has no edge.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.349
Some can stay still on the table.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.300
It depends on how you place them...

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.900
What do you call the part on which they are placed?

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.599
Face, Natalie, some shapes have faces.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.479
What I can see is that there are shapes with only faces,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.220
others with some faces, and the fuchsia has no face at all.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.860
Here there's one quite strange.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.829
It’s got only one round face and on the other side it’s got a tip.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.129
This one’s got only six square faces.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.159
If it weren’t so big, I’d say it looks like a dice, right?

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.019
That’s right! Very good observations!

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.839
Ok, now we can arrange the objects.

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.740
Yes, Matt. Now I see it clear.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.699
You paint every round shapes and I'll take the others.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.299
No. Let's sort them better.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.219
Ok!

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.019
On one hand we’ve got objects with curved faces: a sphere, a cone and a cylinder. They’re three,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.000
but in the game there is a big sphere and a small one, so we can paint one each.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.940
Fine. Now the shapes with plane faces.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.390
Remember how they’re called? We’ve also learnt it.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.710
Polyhedrons!

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.610
That’s right! First the pyramids...

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.169
Whose faces are triangles.

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:35.969
Good!

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:41.890
There are four, which are different, because one of them has three faces, another one, four and another, five.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.660
A lot of faces, don't you think?

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.380
These are easier to paint,

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.500
because I place them on their bases and hold them with my finger on their vertices.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.239
Remember that the vertex where all the edges come together is called apex.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.379
Finally the prisms,

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.059
whose faces are quadrilateral.

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:08.279
Thus all geometric shapes – those which roll and those which don’t-

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.360
¡Are well painted!

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:18.760
In Aula365 Speedy there's a lot more to learn and enjoy, don't miss it!

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.940
Aula365 Speedy, celebrating knowledge.
