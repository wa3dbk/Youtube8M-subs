so<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:11.600> for<00:02:12.080> 175<00:02:13.069> degree<00:02:13.430> water<00:02:13.670> over<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.239> leaf

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
so I for 175 degree water over that leaf

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.360 
so I for 175 degree water over that leaf
and<00:02:14.750> then<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.350> saw<00:02:15.530> how<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.739> poured<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.250> out

sank or tea desk so that was about a 10
second<00:02:53.329> rinse<00:02:53.510> now<00:02:53.989> I'm<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.410> back<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.890> 175

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
second rinse now I'm going back to 175

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.350 
second rinse now I'm going back to 175
degree<00:02:56.239> water<00:02:56.590> again<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.860> green<00:02:58.100> tea<00:02:58.360> to

degree water again it's a green tea to

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.699 
degree water again it's a green tea to
less<00:02:59.570> hearty<00:02:59.930> leave<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:00.500> going<00:03:00.650> to

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
less hearty leave so it's going to

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.030 
less hearty leave so it's going to
require<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.160> lower<00:03:01.910> water<00:03:02.269> temperature<00:03:03.040> and

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
require that lower water temperature and

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.920 
require that lower water temperature and
now<00:03:04.340> I'm<00:03:04.970> going<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.180> start<00:03:05.390> off<00:03:05.510> with<00:03:05.570> about<00:03:05.810> a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
say 30 seconds have passed then I can

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.380 
say 30 seconds have passed then I can
just<00:03:30.260> pour<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:30.620> off<00:03:31.070> in<00:03:31.790> this<00:03:32.000> case<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.329> don't

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
just pour that off in this case I don't

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.150 
just pour that off in this case I don't
need<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.930> use<00:03:33.049> a<00:03:33.079> fine<00:03:33.410> strainer<00:03:33.769> if<00:03:34.040> you've
