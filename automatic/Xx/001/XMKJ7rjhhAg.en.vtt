00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:05.800 

I<00:01:02.020> think<00:01:03.020> my<00:01:03.170> rice<00:01:03.410> cooker<00:01:03.950> is<00:01:03.980> heated<00:01:04.460> up<00:01:04.780> so<00:01:05.780> I

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
I think my rice cooker is heated up so I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.670 
I think my rice cooker is heated up so I
got<00:01:05.990> my<00:01:06.110> paddy<00:01:07.690> take<00:01:08.690> it<00:01:08.810> out<00:01:08.990> should<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.440> in

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
got my paddy take it out should be in

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.370 
got my paddy take it out should be in
this<00:01:10.420> circular<00:01:11.420> floor<00:01:13.420> make<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.540> pretty<00:01:14.870> thin

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
this circular floor make it pretty thin

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.290 
this circular floor make it pretty thin
so<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:17.600> doesn't<00:01:18.430> take<00:01:19.430> too<00:01:19.700> long<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.910> heat<00:01:20.270> up

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
so it doesn't take too long to heat up

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:39.770 
so it doesn't take too long to heat up
and<00:01:20.690> so<00:01:21.530> everything<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.280> cooked

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.690 

check<00:01:40.780> on<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.140> once<00:01:41.350> in<00:01:41.469> a<00:01:41.560> while<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:42.579> don't

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
check on it once in a while you don't

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.330 
check on it once in a while you don't
have<00:01:42.819> to<00:01:43.090> be<00:01:43.240> watching<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.380> entire<00:01:44.890> time

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
but it's probably a good idea not to

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.719 
but it's probably a good idea not to
just<00:01:47.709> late<00:01:48.009> leave<00:01:48.609> it<00:01:48.810> sitting<00:01:49.810> around
