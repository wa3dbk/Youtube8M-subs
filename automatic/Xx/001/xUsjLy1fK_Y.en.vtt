friends so they said kind of dressy

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.450

casual<00:00:25.570> so<00:00:26.570> I'm<00:00:26.960> wearing<00:00:27.230> a<00:00:27.409> pencil<00:00:27.769> skirt<00:00:28.039> and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
casual so I'm wearing a pencil skirt and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.880 
casual so I'm wearing a pencil skirt and
a<00:00:29.029> t-shirt<00:00:29.449> to<00:00:29.599> balance<00:00:30.050> out<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.259> skirt

a t-shirt to balance out the skirt

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.280 
a t-shirt to balance out the skirt
because<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.090> skirt<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.540> already<00:00:32.989> kind<00:00:33.230> of

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290
