crosshatch stitching and I didn't notice

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.210 
crosshatch stitching and I didn't notice
those<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.260> longest<00:01:16.500> time<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.770> only

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
those for the longest time the only

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.300 
those for the longest time the only
thing<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> don't<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.360> hat

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
thing I don't like about this hat

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.430 
thing I don't like about this hat
it's<00:01:20.310> too<00:01:20.670> small<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.360> doesn't<00:01:21.690> fit<00:01:21.870> my<00:01:22.050> head<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
it's too small it doesn't fit my head it

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.840 
it's too small it doesn't fit my head it
would<00:01:22.560> only<00:01:22.620> fit<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:22.980> of<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.100> kids<00:01:23.370> heads<00:01:23.640> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
would only fit one of the kids heads I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.310 
would only fit one of the kids heads I
don't<00:01:24.120> really<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.480> let<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.690> kids<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:25.170> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
don't really want let the kids use it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.230 
don't really want let the kids use it
because<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:25.980> get<00:01:26.190> destroyed<00:01:26.520> probably

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
because it would get destroyed probably

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.180 
because it would get destroyed probably
this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.590> hang<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.160> a
