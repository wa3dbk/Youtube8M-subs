00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.980
 then we end up on the viper 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.560
 fire so after 15-20 attempt I am 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.310
 finally got to do it without getting me 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.539
 touch only learned about 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.400
 better choices to chain them 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.680
 attempts 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 so we see that for the fire viper 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.520
 I took earth so with his technique 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.520
 landfill 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.020
 so who exactly allows when one is 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.610
 fleeing to move relatively 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.920
 fast while actually dodging all the 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.290
 dangers for the first phase it's not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.880
 very complicated ago Just dodge 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.700
 the hens explosive so here I start 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.309
 always down there left lists 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.690
 simply because when the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.670
 viper of soap opera if she falls to 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.250
 left and the two little lines of 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.750
 toxic products to dodge what 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.019
 add a difficulty where there is no 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.189
 the place so 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.039
 for that I always start with the 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.259
 left to finish at this place so 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.659
 there is nothing difficult actually in terms of 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.740
 steam it will start to scor done to himself 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.170
 to spice up here so there the viper goes 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.210
 put some little balls of fire that 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.020
 will turn a little bit by a little 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.440
 everywhere 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.650
 so we'll have to keep going 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.360
 by the toxic side there with the barrel 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.550
 and the small platform to avoid 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.790
 those who are basically in the area 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.380
 Caribbean at the bottom is a safe area where he 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.410
 are not the balls so the one to whom I 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.080
 will take the opportunity to run away 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.070
 until you press the button 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.440
 central approach me to the tag because 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.270
 that otherwise I risk coming out 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.430
 I'm going through here it's again a 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.920
 safe zone so the same technique I 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.650
 run away I do not care about the boums 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.110
 I activate I go back to the cei area and 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.840
 once she is the viper fell 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.310
 I just make sure that's it 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.050
 delicate sandro the soul and dodge the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.860
 bowls 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.390
 often it's here that I was doing 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.340
 hit 1 on the other attempts after 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.090
 to have found the small the little scheme 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.800
 I'm starting a second game 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.200
 times here always left active and 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.100
 so here I put myself in the safe crown 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.250
 in front of the expected tentacle 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.050
 here I go through always doing 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.110
 watch out for the balls 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.150
 of fire but the balance not hop there 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.030
 who cares 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.379
 keen attack so there hop back 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.060
 in the dry zone and so there I take advantage 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.890
 that the two balls that revolves around 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.500
 the abbot list is far to advance 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.750
 quickly enough and destroy which the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.819
 fourth crystal on his head then there 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.530
 I do it in easy 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.180
 you try in the other difficulty this 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.859
 will be just longer so the same I see 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.790
 why not add the girl who 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.920
 did where there is no place to 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.719
 to have since the goal is not to 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.189
 to be touched at all so there the 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.540
 last phase quite simple actually 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.420
 get to the top and continue to 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.879
 to advance even if one is against the wall 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.310
 in fact these are the flames are not going 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.930
 to the top so that's it once 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.430
 that we fall it allows us to move forward and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.280
 to go beyond the first two 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.109
 golem of fire we jump quickly over the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.299
 last golem of fire and we go quickly 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.250
 explode the crystal which allows one to 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.669
 not to confront them and not to risk 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.519
 to get burned and so that's life 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:36.079
 father of fire without being touched 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.169
 all so one more star a step of 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.419
 more towards the 100% so there it remains 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.780
 some levels to do for the 100% 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:47.380
 total in terms of bumps 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.459
 but I'll be fine I 'll get there I think 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.459
 see you
