00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
cover on our blueberry money here we

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.010 
cover on our blueberry money here we
basically<00:01:34.229> took<00:01:35.189> our<00:01:35.689> approximately<00:01:36.689> 12

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020

basically took our approximately 12
pounds<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> blueberries<00:01:38.090> threw<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
pounds of blueberries threw it in the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.370 
pounds of blueberries threw it in the
blender<00:01:39.659> broke<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.680> skins<00:01:41.450> threw<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the paint strainer tied it in a knot so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.030 
the paint strainer tied it in a knot so
the<00:01:47.369> skins<00:01:47.759> wouldn't<00:01:48.180> come<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> mix

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the skins wouldn't come out in the mix

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.690 
the skins wouldn't come out in the mix
sure<00:01:49.190> that<00:01:50.180> bag<00:01:50.540> is<00:01:50.900> in<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.220> mixture

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
sure that bag is in the in the mixture

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.810 
sure that bag is in the in the mixture
now<00:01:53.050> we<00:01:54.050> basically<00:01:54.350> ended<00:01:54.950> up<00:01:55.070> adding<00:01:55.340> about

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
now we basically ended up adding about

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.130 
now we basically ended up adding about
five<00:01:56.240> gallons<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:57.200> water<00:01:58.480> right<00:01:59.480> now<00:01:59.930> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
five gallons of water right now the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.710 
five gallons of water right now the
solution<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.070> about<00:02:01.340> five<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.150> quarter<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
solution is about five and a quarter to

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.340 
solution is about five and a quarter to
five<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.320> third<00:02:03.560> gallons<00:02:04.160> of<00:02:04.400> fluid<00:02:05.350> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
five and a third gallons of fluid the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.290 
five and a third gallons of fluid the
additional<00:02:06.920> ingredients<00:02:07.040> I<00:02:07.580> threw<00:02:07.910> in<00:02:08.090> there

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
additional ingredients I threw in there

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.470 
additional ingredients I threw in there
