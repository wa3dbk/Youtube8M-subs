00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.160
 Hello, I want to touch the question 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 centering the sailing ship and 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.059
 respectively center definition 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.349
 lateral resistance 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.389
 The pistons are considered to be well centered banana 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.160
 if on the course before the legends example on 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.380
 Ukraine, he does not boil down they are given 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.660
 whether the load on the arms 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.250
 saves the course when the steering wheel is located 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.859
 in the on position and therefore not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.810
 create lateral forces and this is known 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.210
 is achieved when the center of the lateral 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.430
 resistance and center of sail 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.840
 is on the same level classic 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.540
 center positioning method 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 lateral resistance is 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 that a profile is cut out of cardboard 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.930
 underwater vessel with the font 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.210
 and driving me and by experience is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.559
 center of gravity of the resulting figure and then 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660
 there are centers of lateral resistance 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.039
 sailboat 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.170
 however in practice it is known 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.629
 it turns out that if you arrange 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.489
 center of sail at the level of such 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.859
 way defined from this side 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 resistance then the sailboat will have 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.350
 VAT is strongly cited as 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.760
 posing for the course will lie on the steering wheel 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 true center lateral resistance 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 turns located at 10 18 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.780
 percent a long waterline ship in 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.490
 side of the nose repeated attempts 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.210
 explain this phenomenon in my opinion not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.520
 I am very convincing and not only I think 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 what is the classic cardboard method itself 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.869
 Beginning is a blunder that's all 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.659
 familiar to us picture the underwater part 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:36.750
 the vessel consists of three components 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.350
 hull swede tac-toe and steering each one 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.200
 creates 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 lateral resistance glad acting 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.920
 these forces running here somewhere here means 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.799
 match somewhere at the level here 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.360
 This line is the center of the side 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.479
 resistance of the entire sailboat in the stream 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.149
 such ships always go 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.130
 naturally drift away from the angle of tryphy 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.590
 which means the body is a Swede and the steering wheel 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.450
 definition is at an angle of attack and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.890
 each one creates a lateral force 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.290
 resistance body swede and steering wheel but times 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.760
 steering wheel creates lateral drag 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.569
 is at attack angle know what 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.400
 loaded means chopped up there is a load 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.120
 it means it is not centered yacht yacht 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.120
 lying on the wheel 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.010
 that is, the classical method is the method 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.569
 lateral center definition 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.299
 resistance is not centered in 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.409
 sailboat 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.909
 correct center position lateral 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.909
 Resistance Poroshenko should 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.200
 determine based on the condition that forces 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:49.019
 lateral resistance create body and 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:53.099
 Swede, but not the steering wheel 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.230
 the corner of the tariff, respectively, the body under 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.769
 angle of attack 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.780
 creates by virtue of lateral resistance and 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.359
 Swede is also difficult at the angle of attack creates 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.180
 lateral resistance and a role in 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.909
 on position and does not create 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.569
 no lateral forces are centered 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.989
 sailboat 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.450
 but it is fair for the courts 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.970
 which 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.040
 Swede or Kelin are strictly located 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.799
 vdp 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.810
 if we need a sailboat show 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.599
 no rice at all 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.970
 then it must be equipped with either a turn 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.689
 shvi mouth or change image wear some 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.230
 set at an angle of attack then 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:43.709
 sailboat goes without drift, etc. 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:47.010
 is parallel to the stream 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.049
 creates no lateral effort in the lateral 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.450
 resistance creates only swede only 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.030
 up the steering wheel is also in the included 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.590
 position in this case coincides with 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.420
 dp here, on the basis of this need and 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.750
 expect to use cardboard 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:06.590
 method that is, consider only the keel and 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:10.939
 only upward but not to consider taking housing 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.109
 here lies the mistake 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:18.810
 classic cardboard methods here if 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:23.370
 we are compatible wrong and right 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:27.660
 method we will see that 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.240
 these are the same 10 well, 18 per cent 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.340
 as for the area of ​​the feather wheel 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.130
 then it should be big enough 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.530
 to effectively counteract 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.270
 Sailboat trends are driven which 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.479
 arises on more complete courses or and 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.530
 for large creams that's under it and 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.080

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.210
 alexander taxes homemade captain 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.940
 homemade frame but your concern 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.940
