00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.000 
it tells him he can't swap it for that
weapon<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.110> he<00:00:34.140> takes<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.649> his<00:00:34.680> staff

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
weapon so he takes out his staff

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880 
weapon so he takes out his staff
obviously<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.030> he<00:00:36.510> trades<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.110> unaware<00:00:37.770> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.520 
obviously and he trades it in unaware of
what's<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> happen<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.379> go

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
what's going to happen so there you go

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.040 
what's going to happen so there you go
he<00:00:41.129> did<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.120> fire<00:00:42.300> staff<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.780> nowhere

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
he did it and the fire staff is nowhere

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
he did it and the fire staff is nowhere
to<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.200> found<00:00:43.579> we<00:00:44.579> thought<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.300> know

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to be found we thought that you know

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
to be found we thought that you know
maybe<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> would<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> Garza<00:00:46.530> who<00:00:46.920> knows

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
maybe it would be in a Garza who knows

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.369 
maybe it would be in a Garza who knows
so<00:00:47.399> he's<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.000> check<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.170> turns

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
so he's about to go check but it turns

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990 
so he's about to go check but it turns
out<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.739> wasn't<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.100> Garza<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> wasn't

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
out it wasn't in Garza it wasn't

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.420 
out it wasn't in Garza it wasn't
anywhere<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> map<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.890> we're<00:00:53.039> pretty<00:00:53.190> much

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
anywhere on the map so we're pretty much

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.799 
anywhere on the map so we're pretty much
screwed<00:00:53.699> from<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.090> point<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809

grab<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.510> all<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:13.080> you're<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
grab it at all because you're going to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.740 
grab it at all because you're going to
ruin<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.250> everyone<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.390> staff<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750

ruin it for everyone and the staff is
going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> disappear<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.040> these<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> two

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
going to disappear so these are the two

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
going to disappear so these are the two
official<00:01:19.409> reasons<00:01:19.799> why<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.119> staffs

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
official reasons why the staffs

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
official reasons why the staffs
disappear<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:23.009> happen<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.400> any<00:01:23.610> staff

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
disappear this can happen with any staff

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.490 
disappear this can happen with any staff
it<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.119> happen<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.509> ice<00:01:24.750> lightning<00:01:25.290> fire

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it can happen with ice lightning fire

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.609 
it can happen with ice lightning fire
any<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.009> them<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.900> do<00:01:28.049> any<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.439> these

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
any of them so if you do any of these

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.670 
any of them so if you do any of these
and<00:01:29.780> you're<00:01:30.780> trying<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> Easter<00:01:31.530> Egg

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and you're trying to the Easter Egg

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
and you're trying to the Easter Egg
you're<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.310> much<00:01:32.460> screwed<00:01:33.020> but<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.170> you're

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you're pretty much screwed but if you're

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.350 
you're pretty much screwed but if you're
just<00:01:34.439> trying<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> play<00:01:35.040> normal<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
just trying to play normal you know and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300 
just trying to play normal you know and
if<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.990> person<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.470> survive<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> staff

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
if one person can survive that a staff

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.880 
if one person can survive that a staff
that's<00:01:38.610> perfectly<00:01:39.570> fine<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.470> you're

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
that's perfectly fine but if you're
