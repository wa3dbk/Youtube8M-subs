at<00:01:44.220> least<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.670> me<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.180> about<00:01:45.299> Lori

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
at least for me I don't know about Lori

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.539 
at least for me I don't know about Lori
but<00:01:45.990> sometimes<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:46.619> shoes<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:47.040> downstairs

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
but sometimes my shoes are downstairs

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.679 
but sometimes my shoes are downstairs
and<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.820> feel<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.360> down<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and I don't feel like going down and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.359 
and I don't feel like going down and
getting<00:01:48.810> them<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.290> whatever<00:01:50.130> they're<00:01:50.310> in

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
getting them or whatever they're in

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
getting them or whatever they're in
another<00:01:50.460> room<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.149> don't<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> lot<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.350> be

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
another room I just don't a lot of to be

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
another room I just don't a lot of to be
honest<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.399> me<00:01:53.430> sometimes<00:01:53.939> it's

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
honest that's not for me sometimes it's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.730 
honest that's not for me sometimes it's
just<00:01:54.210> laziness<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.350> want<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> get

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
just laziness you know just want to get

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.560 
just laziness you know just want to get
in<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> our<00:01:56.610> workouts<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.420> get

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
in there get to our workouts and get

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.430 
in there get to our workouts and get
going<00:01:57.869> we've<00:01:58.079> been<00:01:58.290> doing<00:01:58.530> barefoot

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
going we've been doing barefoot

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.040 
going we've been doing barefoot
workouts<00:01:59.890> like<00:02:00.250> barefoot<00:02:00.520> for<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:01.540> while<00:02:01.780> now

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
workouts like barefoot for a while now

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.840 
workouts like barefoot for a while now
so<00:02:02.260> our<00:02:02.290> feet<00:02:02.620> are<00:02:02.650> used<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.370> so<00:02:03.580> if<00:02:03.700> you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
so our feet are used to it so if you

yeah
and<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:16.690> also<00:02:16.840> do<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.080> lot<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.500> stretching

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and we also do a lot of like stretching

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.520 
and we also do a lot of like stretching
normally<00:02:18.310> after<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> workout<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.510> having<00:02:20.260> just

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
normally after a workout so having just

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.460 
normally after a workout so having just
no<00:02:20.650> shoes<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.190> helps<00:02:21.640> us<00:02:21.760> get<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.200> a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
no shoes on helps us get to that a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.870 
no shoes on helps us get to that a
little<00:02:23.530> bit<00:02:23.830> better<00:02:24.010> for<00:02:24.280> some<00:02:24.490> reason<00:02:24.790> I

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
little bit better for some reason I

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.280 
little bit better for some reason I
don't<00:02:24.940> know<00:02:25.120> why<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.660> was<00:02:25.900> one<00:02:26.080> reason

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
don't know why so that was one reason

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.780 
don't know why so that was one reason
but<00:02:26.710> we<00:02:26.830> do<00:02:26.950> have<00:02:27.040> other<00:02:27.220> shoes<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.670> we<00:02:27.760> wear

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
but we do have other shoes that we wear

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.180 
but we do have other shoes that we wear
in<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.030> workout<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.750> we'll<00:02:28.870> go<00:02:28.990> over<00:02:29.170> those<00:02:29.440> our

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
in a workout so we'll go over those our

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.830 
in a workout so we'll go over those our
first<00:02:30.490> one<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.910> next<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.300> gets<00:02:31.450> kind<00:02:31.660> of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
first one of next that gets kind of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.450 
first one of next that gets kind of
again<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.170> whole<00:02:32.350> concept<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.160> barefoot

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
again the whole concept of barefoot

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.390 
again the whole concept of barefoot
working<00:02:34.270> out<00:02:34.390> barefoot<00:02:34.900> running<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.530> from

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
working out barefoot running is from

Vibram FiveFingers
I<00:02:38.380> believe<00:02:38.650> it's<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:39.070> whole<00:02:39.250> company's<00:02:39.730> name

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
I believe it's the whole company's name

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.600 
I believe it's the whole company's name
yet<00:02:40.630> but<00:02:41.080> we've<00:02:41.200> got<00:02:41.440> these<00:02:41.650> maybe<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.430> little

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
yet but we've got these maybe a little

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.510 
yet but we've got these maybe a little
over<00:02:43.510> two<00:02:43.900> years<00:02:43.930> ago<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:45.310> wear<00:02:45.490> them

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
over two years ago and we wear them

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.490 
over two years ago and we wear them
every<00:02:45.880> once<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.360> while<00:02:46.420> again<00:02:46.870> same<00:02:47.170> shoot

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
every once in a while again same shoot

every once in a while again same shoot
mm<00:02:48.070> we<00:02:48.250> don't<00:02:48.400> wear<00:02:48.580> them<00:02:48.790> outside<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.240> know<00:02:49.480> a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
mm we don't wear them outside I know a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.720 
mm we don't wear them outside I know a
lot<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.720> people<00:02:50.080> running<00:02:50.290> them<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:51.520> keep

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
lot of people running them just keep

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.510 
lot of people running them just keep
something<00:02:52.600> like<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.380> we<00:02:53.770> for<00:02:54.310> several

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
something like that and we for several

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.150 
something like that and we for several
sets<00:02:54.820> are<00:02:54.940> kind<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.180> an<00:02:55.330> expensive<00:02:55.890> shoe<00:02:56.890> we

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
sets are kind of an expensive shoe we

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.860 
sets are kind of an expensive shoe we
didn't<00:02:57.430> want<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.730> get<00:02:58.060> them<00:02:58.180> dirty<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.600> run

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
didn't want to get them dirty a run

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.240 
didn't want to get them dirty a run
through<00:02:59.080> them<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.410> quickly<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.130> only

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
through them that quickly so we only

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.940 
through them that quickly so we only
really<00:03:00.310> wear<00:03:00.730> them<00:03:00.910> inside<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.140> get<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:02.920> a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
really wear them inside and I get it a

really wear them inside and I get it a
lot<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.310> comes<00:03:03.520> down<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.180> two<00:03:04.480> if<00:03:05.110> you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
lot of it comes down to the two if you

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.900 
lot of it comes down to the two if you
feel<00:03:05.440> like<00:03:05.650> wearing<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.220> there's<00:03:06.459> no<00:03:06.610> really

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
feel like wearing it there's no really

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.670 
feel like wearing it there's no really
rhyme<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.330> reason<00:03:07.450> why<00:03:07.750> do<00:03:07.810> we<00:03:07.959> do<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.170> some

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
rhyme or reason why do we do it some

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.290 
rhyme or reason why do we do it some
days<00:03:08.890> we<00:03:09.070> do<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.370> than<00:03:09.520> some<00:03:09.760> days<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.120> don't

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
days we do it than some days we don't

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.030 
days we do it than some days we don't
just<00:03:10.720> whenever<00:03:11.170> we<00:03:11.350> kind<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.620> feel<00:03:11.800> like<00:03:11.830> that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
just whenever we kind of feel like that

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.040 
just whenever we kind of feel like that
day<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.790> guess<00:03:13.030> I'm<00:03:13.239> gonna<00:03:13.480> get<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:13.900> more

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050

filming and you're like bass stuff

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.820 
filming and you're like bass stuff
sometimes<00:03:16.780> we<00:03:16.930> tend<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.320> wear<00:03:17.470> them<00:03:17.709> in

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
sometimes we tend to wear them in

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.830 
sometimes we tend to wear them in
advance<00:03:18.010> again<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.760> whole<00:03:18.880> concept<00:03:19.270> is<00:03:19.450> it's

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
advance again the whole concept is it's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.110 
advance again the whole concept is it's
so<00:03:20.380> fits<00:03:20.860> like<00:03:21.130> your<00:03:21.370> career<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:21.940> you're

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
walking on the ground normally so again

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.210 
walking on the ground normally so again
we<00:03:25.150> like<00:03:25.330> basically<00:03:25.870> Fargo<00:03:26.410> barefoot<00:03:26.980> you

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
we like basically Fargo barefoot you

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.680 
we like basically Fargo barefoot you
want<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.489> want<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.940> maybe<00:03:28.269> it<00:03:28.390> won't<00:03:28.480> let

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
want it you want that maybe it won't let

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.229 
want it you want that maybe it won't let
you<00:03:28.870> start<00:03:29.170> wearing<00:03:29.410> them<00:03:29.590> outdoors<00:03:30.190> since<00:03:31.120> I

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
you start wearing them outdoors since I

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.120 
you start wearing them outdoors since I
guess<00:03:31.390> they're<00:03:31.600> older<00:03:32.320> now<00:03:32.350> maybe<00:03:32.709> we<00:03:32.890> could

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
guess they're older now maybe we could

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.380 
guess they're older now maybe we could
and<00:03:33.250> then<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.459> way<00:03:33.580> we<00:03:33.730> get<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> new<00:03:34.060> pair<00:03:34.360> for

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
and then that way we get a new pair for

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.470 
and then that way we get a new pair for
indoors<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:36.489> know<00:03:36.610> but<00:03:36.940> we<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.060> these

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
indoors but you know but we like these

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.930 
indoors but you know but we like these
so<00:03:37.750> we<00:03:37.959> recommend<00:03:38.650> these<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.280> give<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:39.820> the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
so we recommend these to give you the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.699 
so we recommend these to give you the
inference<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.720> then<00:03:40.989> there's<00:03:41.170> another<00:03:41.260> great

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
inference and then there's another great

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.620 
inference and then there's another great
way<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:41.920> build<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.519> strength<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.239> your<00:03:43.360> foot

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630
