00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.550
 in this new video we are going to demonstrate 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.850
 how to test a sensor map that we have 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.900
 here present which consists 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.490
 of a current a ground and a signal 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.020
 if we do not have the diagram of him what 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.350
 first that we are going to proceed is 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.150
 disconnect it we go to a clamp the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.090
 multimeter we're going to put the land of 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.130
 the battery and with the other clamp we are going to 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.340
 try let's find your current 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.310
 there we are seeing in the multimeter that 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.800
 marks its 5 volts which indicates is 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.160
 alright then if this is the current in 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.420
 the other clamp let's look for the earth 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.700
 the sensor 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.860
 and there we can corroborate 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.840
 which cable is current and which cable is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.310
 land is not that we verify that you 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.620
 they arrive all 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.680
 your signals to work your current and 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.260
 your land let's proceed 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.290
 to proceed then to connect it 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.510
 again 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.510
 with this device that I have here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 for empty 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.350
 again let's grab a clip from 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.420
 the clamp we are going to put the earth 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.360
 and this red clip we're going to put on the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.740
 signal we already got that a cable from the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.780
 shore is current and the other is land 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.040
 whereby the middle cable would come 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.770
 being the signal that travels to the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.719
 computer 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.719
 let's go through with the clamp 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.350
 traverse with a clamp this 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.350
 acceptable 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.270
 since we crossed it with the clamp 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.219
 we can 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.350
 verify that you are sending us a 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:04.479
 voltage of 392 but the truck is in 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.090
 these moments turned off this sensor 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.950
 works with the vacuum of the engine which 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.069
 let's give the gun that if not here 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.410
 of vacuum commonly all all 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.840
 15 of 20 to 20 inch transverse vehicles 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.550
 of mercury which we are going to start 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.950
 Apply 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.150
 as we apply the value in the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.640
 multimeter should go down we're going to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.640
 put the points so you can appreciate 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.770
 as we apply the vacuum the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.770
 The value of the map must go down 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.360
 he indicated the sea in good condition 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.560
 that as more vacuum we apply the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 value goes down 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.140
 we have to apply approximately in 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.140
 15 to 20 inches of mercury 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.010
 as we can see 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.430
 we can see that this sensor map has a 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.590
 correct operation 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.530
 if they do not have a gun on hand 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.930
 these can put some piece of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 hose and suck with your mouth to 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.450
 see what 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.360
 that works well the sensor now 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.080
 as we can see it has a correct 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.730
 functioning 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.580
 when 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.150
 if we drop the vacuum the voltage will 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.860
 go up to greater more greater greater gap less 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.650
 voltage is the correct functioning 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.579
 of the new sensor 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.579
 that's all
