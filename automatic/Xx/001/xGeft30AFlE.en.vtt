welcome<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.560> subtraction<00:00:02.010> with<00:00:02.280> whole

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
welcome to subtraction with whole

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.460 
welcome to subtraction with whole
numbers<00:00:02.520> just<00:00:03.210> like<00:00:03.330> addition<00:00:03.870> you<00:00:04.080> start<00:00:04.380> in

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
numbers just like addition you start in

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.410 
numbers just like addition you start in
the<00:00:04.560> ones<00:00:04.740> place<00:00:04.940> only<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:06.150> do<00:00:06.299> it

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
the ones place only you do it

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.820 
the ones place only you do it
subtraction<00:00:07.020> so<00:00:07.980> 9<00:00:08.400> minus<00:00:08.610> 1<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.150> 8<00:00:12.740> 4-7<00:00:13.740> you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
subtraction so 9 minus 1 is 8 4-7 you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
subtraction so 9 minus 1 is 8 4-7 you
can<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.849> borrow<00:00:15.150> from<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
can do that so with the borrow from the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.970 
can do that so with the borrow from the
six<00:00:16.310> make<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> 5<00:00:18.350> make<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> fourteen

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
six make that a 5 make that a fourteen

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
six make that a 5 make that a fourteen
14<00:00:20.970> minus<00:00:21.150> seven<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.869> seven<00:00:24.080> 5-8<00:00:25.080> cannot<00:00:25.410> do

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
14 minus seven is seven 5-8 cannot do

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.990 
14 minus seven is seven 5-8 cannot do
that<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.949> have<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> borrow<00:00:26.369> from<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.730> five

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
that we have to borrow from the five

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.020 
that we have to borrow from the five
again<00:00:27.330> make<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> 6<00:00:29.330> 15<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.930> 15-8<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:35.030> seven

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
again make that a 6 15 so 15-8 is seven

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.330 
again make that a 6 15 so 15-8 is seven
and<00:00:38.300> six<00:00:39.300> minus<00:00:39.570> 1<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:41.000> 5<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:43.190> there's<00:00:44.190> our

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and six minus 1 is 5 so there's our

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.040 
and six minus 1 is 5 so there's our
answer<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> over<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.180> 4-5<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.840> borrow

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
answer so over here 4-5 that's a borrow

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.470 
answer so over here 4-5 that's a borrow

the<00:03:07.900> six<00:03:08.200> make<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.740> 5<00:03:08.980> mix<00:03:09.400> out<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.670> 14

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
the six make that of 5 mix out of 14

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.460 
the six make that of 5 mix out of 14
it's<00:03:12.130> going<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.400> be<00:03:12.550> 8<00:03:12.820> 14<00:03:13.570> minus<00:03:13.720> six<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.200> eight

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
it's going to be 8 14 minus six is eight

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.630 
it's going to be 8 14 minus six is eight
five<00:03:15.370> minus<00:03:15.670> two<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:16.090> three<00:03:17.430> those<00:03:18.430> are

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
five minus two is three those are

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.620 
five minus two is three those are
answers<00:03:19.030> for<00:03:20.010> those<00:03:21.010> ones<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.640> when<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.480> get

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
answers for those ones and when you get

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.970 
answers for those ones and when you get
good<00:03:22.840> at<00:03:22.959> placement<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.560> can<00:03:23.770> do<00:03:23.890> it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
good at placement you can do it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.840 
good at placement you can do it
horizontally<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.840> 8<00:03:26.110> minus<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:27.040> make<00:03:27.580> sure<00:03:27.760> you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
horizontally so 8 minus to make sure you

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.390 
horizontally so 8 minus to make sure you
go<00:03:27.970> from<00:03:28.180> left<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.600> right<00:03:30.030> 8-2<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.420> six<00:03:32.280> put<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
go from left to right 8-2 is six put the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:44.420 
go from left to right 8-2 is six put the
six<00:03:33.640> way<00:03:33.820> over<00:03:34.090> here<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:35.410> then<00:03:35.970> 9-5<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:41.370> 446

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.860 

9-8<00:03:45.430> is<00:03:45.640> one<00:03:48.060> 6-7<00:03:49.060> can't<00:03:49.300> do<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.600> with<00:03:49.780> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
9-8 is one 6-7 can't do that with the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
9-8 is one 6-7 can't do that with the
borrow<00:03:50.200> from<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.650> six<00:03:51.060> make<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.269> 50<00:03:53.050> sorry

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
borrow from the six make that a 50 sorry

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.800 
borrow from the six make that a 50 sorry
bar<00:03:54.280> from<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.640> four<00:03:55.890> make<00:03:56.890> this<00:03:57.130> 16<00:03:57.940> make<00:03:58.540> that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
bar from the four make this 16 make that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:09.810 
bar from the four make this 16 make that
of<00:03:58.959> three<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:02.610> 16-7<00:04:03.610> is<00:04:04.590> nine<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.650> we<00:04:09.640> have

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
of three so 16-7 is nine and we have

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.140 
of three so 16-7 is nine and we have
three<00:04:10.209> minus<00:04:10.630> two<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:11.050> 1<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.310> then<00:04:12.670> 1<00:04:12.700> minus

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
three minus two is 1 and then 1 minus

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.170 
three minus two is 1 and then 1 minus
one<00:04:13.630> is<00:04:13.870> zero<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.430> don't<00:04:15.640> have<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.970> include

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
one is zero so you don't have to include

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.599 
one is zero so you don't have to include
it<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:17.380> don't<00:04:17.590> need<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.799> include<00:04:17.980> any<00:04:18.280> leading

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
it you don't need to include any leading

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.330 
it you don't need to include any leading
zeroes<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:20.290> very<00:04:20.470> important<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.070> include

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
zeroes it's very important to include

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.869 
zeroes it's very important to include
the<00:04:22.300> following<00:04:22.570> zeros

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:23.879 
the following zeros

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:28.469 
the following zeros
so<00:04:25.349> 1-3<00:04:26.349> can't<00:04:27.340> do<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.849> borrow<00:04:28.180> from<00:04:28.360> the

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
so 1-3 can't do that to borrow from the

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.070 
so 1-3 can't do that to borrow from the
to<00:04:29.310> make<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> one<00:04:30.819> put<00:04:31.629> the<00:04:31.750> one<00:04:31.900> right

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
to make that a one put the one right

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.600 
to make that a one put the one right
there<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:33.330> that's<00:04:34.330> going<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.539> be<00:04:34.750> 8<00:04:38.340> 1-4<00:04:39.340> can
