00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.560
 bottom right as you can see 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.210

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.850
 of 99 cents but as always 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.260
 I remember to check the decision of my video 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.820
 in the part of up to down there we gave them 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.800
 a rest where they can get that 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.570
 you are completely free because you already 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.640
 we have installed a new piece a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.890
 I breathe as always and we can enter what 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.290

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.789
 the buttons we can see that we have the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.100
 wifi bluetooth airplane mode which are the 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.239
 that we have at the top and the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.009
 we can scroll heras and for 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.260
 configure them we only set the mode 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.270
 of editing and we will stay here below 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.930
 which are available for example if 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.760
 I want to put the vpn pass through here 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.670

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.290
 screen which is what we want not to 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.700
 work in the box men we can 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.410
 enable it if we want something not 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.000
 appear there and I see more functions like 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.520
 for example how many icons do we want to see 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.620

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.770

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.280
 one way we had to edit it up 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.319
 we take and in this part they will be 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.150
 appearing the same by receiving the low 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.160
