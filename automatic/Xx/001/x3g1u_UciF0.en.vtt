the reveal that we're looking for
stanner<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.269> 3/4<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.869> an<00:00:24.990> inch

side<00:01:17.509> is<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:21.049> your<00:01:22.049> choices<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.560> this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
side is going to be your choices on this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
side is going to be your choices on this
is<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.130> side<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.580> thicker<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.840> can

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
is one side can be thicker so you can

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.950 
is one side can be thicker so you can
get<00:01:25.229> material<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> come<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.549> at

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
get material that's going to come in at

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.240 
get material that's going to come in at
inch<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> 1/4<00:01:30.409> but<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> can't<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
inch and 1/4 but you can't do that on

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.440 
inch and 1/4 but you can't do that on
both<00:01:32.430> sides<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.210> really

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
both sides it's going to be really

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.120 
both sides it's going to be really
difficult<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.960> try<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.200> fit<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.650> big<00:01:34.920> heavy

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
difficult to try and fit this big heavy

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.149 
difficult to try and fit this big heavy
stair<00:01:35.659> where<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.869> built<00:01:37.140> exactly<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.920> same

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
stair where it's built exactly the same

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.310 
stair where it's built exactly the same
size<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:38.970> rough<00:01:39.570> opening<00:01:39.960> 40<00:01:40.320> inch<00:01:42.320> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
size as your rough opening 40 inch so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.300 
size as your rough opening 40 inch so
you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.950> take<00:01:44.159> strips<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.920> nail<00:01:46.920> them<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
you can take strips and nail them to the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.740 
you can take strips and nail them to the
back<00:01:47.579> side<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:49.229> stand<00:01:49.950> off<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:53.040> would<00:01:53.250> take

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
back side to stand off so you would take

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.889 
back side to stand off so you would take
say<00:01:54.750> 3/8<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.500> strip<00:01:56.000> tack<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> backside

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
say 3/8 and strip tack to the backside

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.139 
say 3/8 and strip tack to the backside
so<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.950> least<00:01:59.159> some<00:01:59.310> surface

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
so that you have at least some surface

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.590 
so that you have at least some surface
area<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.899> sheetrock<00:02:01.680> slant<00:02:02.280> against<00:02:02.790> or

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
area for the sheetrock slant against or

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.719 
area for the sheetrock slant against or
you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.619> make<00:02:04.740> an<00:02:04.890> inch<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> quarter<00:02:05.430> on

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you can make an inch and a quarter on

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.240 
you can make an inch and a quarter on
one<00:02:06.090> side<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
one side and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.219 
one side and
on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.490> other<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:09.240> least<00:02:09.360> an<00:02:09.630> inch<00:02:09.780> dick<00:02:10.050> on

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
on the other at least an inch dick on

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.950 
on the other at least an inch dick on
the<00:02:10.350> other<00:02:10.470> side<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:12.090> you'll<00:02:12.480> want<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.780> take

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
the other side so you'll want to take

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.930 
the other side so you'll want to take
that<00:02:13.170> into<00:02:13.500> account<00:02:13.530> when<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.460> start<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.850> do

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
that into account when you start to do

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.720 
that into account when you start to do
your<00:02:14.970> layout<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.380> you've<00:02:16.770> got<00:02:17.040> one<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
your layout so if you've got one that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.640 
your layout so if you've got one that
let's<00:02:18.330> say<00:02:18.480> both<00:02:18.750> sides<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.260> figured<00:02:19.530> you're

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
let's say both sides you figured you're

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.250 
let's say both sides you figured you're
going<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.830> put<00:02:20.010> strips<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.080> got<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
going to put strips in you you got to

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.900 
going to put strips in you you got to
remember<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.860> thickness<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.490> strip<00:02:23.760> when

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
remember the thickness of the strip when

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.550 
remember the thickness of the strip when
you<00:02:23.970> start<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.360> cut<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.050> can't<00:02:25.320> simply

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
you start to cut it out you can't simply

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.330 
you start to cut it out you can't simply
say<00:02:25.950> well<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:27.240> got<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.780> 40<00:02:28.080> inch<00:02:28.290> opening<00:02:28.770> I'll

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
say well I got a 40 inch opening I'll

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.420 
say well I got a 40 inch opening I'll
take<00:02:29.959> my<00:02:30.959> distance<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.209> subtract<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.840> two

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
take my distance and subtract the two

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.760 
take my distance and subtract the two

that<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.730> have<00:02:38.910> for<00:02:39.900> your<00:02:40.590> treads<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
that you have to have for your treads is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.400 
that you have to have for your treads is
what's<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.050> final<00:02:43.400> width<00:02:44.450> plus<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.080> two

what's the final width plus the two

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.010 
what's the final width plus the two

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
housing aspect of it so if you're

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.729 
housing aspect of it so if you're
running<00:02:57.110> say<00:02:58.110> 1/2<00:02:58.350> inch

typically<00:02:59.640> it's<00:02:59.790> not<00:02:59.820> quite<00:03:00.239> half<00:03:00.480> inch<00:03:00.720> but

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989

for math be easier there are two
half-inch<00:03:05.720> dedos<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.380> need<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.860> add<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.130> for

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
half-inch dedos you need to add that for

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.229 
half-inch dedos you need to add that for
one<00:03:09.480> inch<00:03:09.750> two<00:03:10.260> times<00:03:10.530> 1/2<00:03:10.770> inch<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:12.209> your

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
what I tend to do is I'll take one
