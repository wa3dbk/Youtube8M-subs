00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello we will see together 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.470
 new features of adobe lightroom 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.179
 in version 5 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.309
 so the beta just came out 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.020
 we will start with the tool that 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.420
 allows to replace the dust or 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.520
 now in more detail the details or 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.160
 completely replace something 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.840
 in my picture then lightroom I will be 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.630
 side has still evolved so 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.690
 the tool has not changed we end up 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.010
 with duplicate or correct at the level of 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.010
 brush we will choose corrected 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.820
 so we will get some 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.140
 we will take here for example or at a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.200
 little white spot we have another 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.050
 here at the sidewalk for the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.360
 brush in correction and as for a 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.680
 dust that could be so on 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.899
 the sensor we will just adapt the with 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.620
 the wheel the size of our brush 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.219
 and just ignore making a click 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.109
 ditto here at the border and we 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:09.509
 sees that lightroom will automatically 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:12.450
 look for a source and a source that 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.310
 behaves relatively well yes here they 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.549
 will form the shadow that underneath 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.959
 so that it is correct then 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.780
 Here we see still small 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.909
 shift does not necessarily know that name can 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.770
 come get the source and move 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.270
 slightly our source 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.270
 or the line 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.689
 the other novelty is that we can 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.719
 now come coulommiers a party 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:44.729
 to replace it then we will take 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:46.079
 something quite simple we're going 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.049
 take here for example the part 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.909
 white that have already replaced we're going 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.090
 slightly increase in size 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.319
 brush and we will come coloring the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.939
 part that we want to remove then 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.770
 automatically it makes us think of al 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.580
 houthi content of where fight assault 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.050
 this photoshop not it does not work 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.300
 there is a happy tower engine 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.850
 behind so the engine for purpose taken in 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.970
 account but we find ourselves at the same time 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.290
 with a source system 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.580
 So it twists and square of the small 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.570
 question when we tell players we 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.850
 a photoshop 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.950
 So here we are and we find ourselves so 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.560
 with our layout is the source of our 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.080
 plot that was chosen automatically 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.790
 so there for me it does not pay since 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.120
 the blue line gone I can take 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.020
 the source and come over my source 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.140
 to restore my blue line 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.650
 and they still adapt the tool to see 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.650
 the result 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.530
 the result is rather bluffing I 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.630
 took a picture at random the tool so 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.060
 serene in terms of opacity and in terms 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.670
 size nothing of anything very huge to 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.160
 manage remains of really due lightroom 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.630
 something simple to use that 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.220
 can remove hasty rhymes 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.930
 quickly tasks or small 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.930
 details in a photograph
