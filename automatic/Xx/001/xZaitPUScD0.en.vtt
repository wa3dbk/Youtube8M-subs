00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
said I don't know but when you get a

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.800 
said I don't know but when you get a
chance<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.430> take<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.879> pique<00:02:21.480> when

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
chance with to take it and pique when

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.940 
chance with to take it and pique when
he's<00:02:21.900> had<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.110> chance<00:02:22.319> has<00:02:22.500> done<00:02:22.680> very<00:02:22.920> very

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
he's had the chance has done very very

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.410 
he's had the chance has done very very
well<00:02:23.160> taking<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> chance<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.239> he's<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
well taking a chance and now he's a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:35.150 
well taking a chance and now he's a
tough<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:32.870> yeah<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> mean<00:02:34.019> fantastic<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.980> think

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
tough that yeah I mean fantastic I think

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.180 
tough that yeah I mean fantastic I think
the<00:02:35.489> win<00:02:35.640> win<00:02:36.030> lose<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.440> lose<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:38.040> not

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the win win lose if we do lose it's not

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.780 
the win win lose if we do lose it's not
going<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:39.890> it'll<00:02:40.890> still<00:02:41.069> hurt<00:02:41.220> him<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.489> much<00:02:41.640> as

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
going to it'll still hurt him as much as

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.130 
going to it'll still hurt him as much as
anything<00:02:42.000> else<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.420> there's<00:02:42.599> anybody<00:02:42.780> else

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
anything else and there's anybody else

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.869 
anything else and there's anybody else
but<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.379> think<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.920> winning<00:02:44.129> doesn't<00:02:44.400> suppress

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
but I think the winning doesn't suppress

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.400 
but I think the winning doesn't suppress
his<00:02:45.060> desire<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.540> win<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.230> most

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
his desire to win that's the most

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.990 
his desire to win that's the most
important<00:02:46.859> thing<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.280> he<00:02:47.370> always<00:02:47.609> wants<00:02:47.940> to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
important thing and he always wants to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.520 
important thing and he always wants to
continue<00:02:48.269> in<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:49.140> when<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.379> watch<00:02:49.500> that

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
continue in what when you watch that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.009 
continue in what when you watch that
game<00:02:49.829> back<00:02:50.040> real<00:02:50.220> what<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.970> image<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
Barcelona players being presented with

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.629 
Barcelona players being presented with

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
that trophy yes I suppose it can but I

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.099 
that trophy yes I suppose it can but I
mean<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.030> more<00:03:00.150> than<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:00.540> us<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.870> looking

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.370 
mean it's more than to us and looking
ourselves<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.739> looking<00:03:02.040> at<00:03:02.099> anybody<00:03:02.280> else

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
ourselves and looking at anybody else

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.839 
ourselves and looking at anybody else
they'd<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.620> one<00:03:04.799> last<00:03:05.010> time<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.489> fingers

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
they'd a one last time and fingers

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:15.729 
they'd a one last time and fingers
crossed<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.180> can<00:03:06.329> change<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:06.840> time

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.319 

it's<00:03:16.739> just<00:03:16.829> it's<00:03:17.340> like<00:03:17.400> homework<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.150> to

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
it's just it's like homework you have to

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.520 
it's just it's like homework you have to

research on who you're playing and it

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:40.059 
research on who you're playing and it
was<00:03:21.690> part<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.019> process<00:03:22.410> really<00:03:38.660> things<00:03:39.660> that

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
was part of process really things that

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.849 
was part of process really things that
nobody<00:03:41.069> really<00:03:41.250> gives<00:03:45.440> I'd<00:03:46.440> love<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.769> be

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.280 
I think anything leading up to the game
is<00:03:51.900> neither<00:03:52.079> here<00:03:52.319> nor<00:03:52.379> there<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.739> us<00:03:52.889> really
