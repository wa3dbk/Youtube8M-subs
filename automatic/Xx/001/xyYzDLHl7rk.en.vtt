 ago this ford transit was vision 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.289
 Belarus citizen of Lithuania according to 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.969
 legislation to pass 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.999
 car for private use to another 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.960
 the owner of the car was supposed to 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.789
 declare the vehicle and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 pay customs duty however 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.539
 the man had no documents 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.409

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.939
 more than 150 million rubles withdrawn 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.740
 surprisingly strong ford focus hit 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.200
 accident of the Brest region now you 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.999
 see the effects of a night trip to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.950
 preliminary data the driver is not

 coped with the management and flew with 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.420
 tracks on his wagon car 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.310
 overturned however no driver 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.170
 the car did not get damaged 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.569
 As a rule, a similar accident is very 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.030
 traumatic but in this case 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.050
 the car remained intact even all the glass 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.120
 the morning then 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.520
 discovered by locals as reported 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.860
 eyewitnesses headlights went out only later 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.560
 a few hours after wagon 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.190
 re-put on wheels after that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.510
 inspectors began to look for a car driver 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.790
 in Brest, a minibus almost 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.190
 rolled over after colliding with 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.110
 the trailer which itself towed on 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.820
 the main question is how could such a thing 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.230
 happen now trying to answer 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.480
 traffic police inspectors 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.210
 near the trailer bus burst rather 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.070
 all this was the cause of accidents here's how 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.650
 it turned out that the car turned out 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.670
 left side on your own trailer 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.280
 little understandable in the evening 19-35 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.880
 we sum up the day do not miss 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.880
 I'll see you
