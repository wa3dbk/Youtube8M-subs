00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.950
 [Music] 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:21.990
 [Music] 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 today we are here to tell you about two new ones 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 finishing systems for stone is 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.810
 split everything naturally begins with 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.810
 the first if I show you now 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.810
 now let's proceed 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.810
 the application you follow your instincts 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.370
 at this point we can 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.110
 with typical split processing like 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.110
 we have already seen in so many other children 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.650
 here is now the time in 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.680
 polishing a little trick we add 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.890
 today if you want to make polishing a little 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:16.340
 the sprayer is simpler and softer 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.310
 spray some water on the ridges and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.250
 the processing will become simpler and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:29.430
 mobile 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:32.160
 [Music] 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 another important use of this 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.730
 spray if the product does 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.930
 just tears wet it a bit to 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.540
 review it in the opposite direction 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.640
 immediately work is flat and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.300
 come back very beautiful 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.620
 here is almost dry you begin to 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.170
 seeing white spots is the 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.280
 time to give a nice compact for 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.349
 have the surface shiny effect 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.349
 [Music] 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.350
 [Applause] 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:11.890
 [Music] 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.260
 the cracked stone to be dry 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.530
 that is, its smooth parts and parts 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.270
 Here we will work to develop 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.300
 finishes a bit special a little 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.020
 refined even a little sought after but everything 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.240
 begins with a base of joy that 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.010
 we're going to apply two steps 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.490
 diluted to 30 percent 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.090
 two steps because they are easier 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.580
 diluted than a single pure pass 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.660
 so we think we suggest this 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.040
 solution 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:49.800
 we can predict 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.800
 [Music] 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.090
 the twin so we go to one 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.990
 second hand that we uniform it 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.990
 completely 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.290
 then this split stone we have 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.720
 given a joy at this point not 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.209
 it absorbs more and we can go to work 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.150
 to make the colors a bit 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.370
 we did this in this part 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.220
 simpler and in this part instead the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.200
 we do very creative and artistic 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.420
 leaving you the chance to develop 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.980
 what you also want in terms 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.650
 of color even if on the sample book 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.989
 see different possibilities of use 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.700
 so let's start from here 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:50.610
 we will apply a gray color and we will go 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.019
 to insert it inside the veins then 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.030
 with a sponge 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.740
 let's put the color in the holes 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.819
 in the depressions 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.819
 [Music] 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.500
 while with the wet sponge 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.530
 we are going to clean up to remove all the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.480
 surpluses that have instead settled 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.970
 on the smooth side this way 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.570
 we have this depth this vein 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.570
 colored 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.220
 [Music] 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.090
 this was easy a nice color 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.710
 gray we have this vein of stone 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.970
 split the marble and white but there is this 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.590
 gray vein 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.380
 now we go towards complexity 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.330
 then a vein of different colors 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.070
 here creativity is free but us 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.950
 we see precise indications 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.340
 now let us show you how to get there 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:00.000
 to this result then let's start with 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.100
 an application of this rust color 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.610
 which is the background for the following ones 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.880
 workmanship also he diluted to 30 for 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.740
 one hundred 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:17.820
 [Music] 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:29.650
 [Applause] 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:29.650
 [Music] 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:47.660
 [Music] 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:06:08.100
 [Music] 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.100
 [Applause] 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.900
 here now we have this beautiful wine 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.720
 golden brown than in a stone 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.320
 broken city ​​by god but we will go now 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.630
 to make a drawing of an arena instead 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.840
 black and a bit of skill here 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.430
 so a lot of attention 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.620
 we put the color and then with the sponge 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.870
 wet we go to remove it in a way of 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.180
 take any vein penalty that 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.780
 runs through the appliance 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.860
 [Music] 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.860
 [Applause] 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.520
 [Music] 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:54.220
 [Applause] 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:55.690
 [Music] 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:02.550
 [Applause] 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:02.550
 [Music] 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:12.589
 [Music] 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.810
 show and therefore if we enter the 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.430
 art world, however, as you have seen 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.220
 it is not impossible 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.300
 it takes a bit of determination a little 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:30.300
 of edition that comes this vein 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.240
 really spectacular anyway inside of 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.980
 there is the desire to do to create of 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.410
 experimenting here is an application 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.840
 simple but very refined and here it is 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.840
 an application instead a little more 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.480
 complicated but extremely creative 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.390
 both of these processes must be finished 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.480
 with glass that we always give it as a sponge 

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:53.610
 we praise pure provided it is of one 

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.650
 last year production 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.540
 if instead of a previous production 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.880
 we praise diluted 

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.880
 at this point this wall is over 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:11.169
 [Music] 

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.169
 [Applause] 

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:20.139
 [Music]
