00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.180
 well mario the problem 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.119
 It's worth 99 euros movements that we spent 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.610
 it's worth 8 then you lack money but not 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.870
 we do not know how much milan 3 how we're doing 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.430
 to do 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.870
 asking the data so that it does not 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.870
 forget to see how many euros they had 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.310
 and how much is the car worth living 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.560
 television news 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.590
 99 and how are you going to find out what you 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.590
 lack 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.860
 and how are you going to do it? 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.030
 today we can do it directly truth 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.600
 99 minus 52 but we can also do it 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.220
 otherwise it is very facilitated 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.560
 discounting 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.880
 and also to see what you need to 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.080
 get the euros that you need to 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 arrive 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.710
 one day 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.300

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.210
 if I fall 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:45.640

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.640
 3 82 86 84 85 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 78 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.980
 and yells 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.980
 one 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 4 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.680
 Very much my mother how many sticks 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.590
 today those sticks could change 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.070
 some for a little circle and have first 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.070
 change melo 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.109
 how many would you change for a little circle 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.690
 when it changes 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.170
 but we just can not put a 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.930
 little circle to remove the sticks 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.120
 how much the circles are worth and then 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.379
 how many sticks are that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.379

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.250

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.290

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.870

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.870

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.110

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.280
