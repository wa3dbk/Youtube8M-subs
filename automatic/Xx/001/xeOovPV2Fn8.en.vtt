in the gate you know we're trained
negates<00:00:57.210> veiler<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.809> fine<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.579> we'll<00:01:00.000> go

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
negates veiler so it's fine so we'll go

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.389 
negates veiler so it's fine so we'll go
ahead<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.390> into<00:01:00.510> monsters<00:01:01.129> basically<00:01:02.129> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
