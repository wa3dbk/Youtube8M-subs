00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
don't know if he will be changed in the
future<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.250> hope<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.399> he<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.790> be

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
future I kind of hope that he will be

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.780 
future I kind of hope that he will be
because<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.170> new<00:01:55.320> Oryx<00:01:55.740> wide<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> lot<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
because the new Oryx wide is a lot of

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.399 
because the new Oryx wide is a lot of
fun<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.299> I'm<00:01:57.479> sure<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.780> could<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
fun so I'm sure they could do a lot of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.550 
fun so I'm sure they could do a lot of
stuff<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> new<00:01:59.130> works<00:01:59.369> too<00:02:00.530> instead<00:02:01.530> of

stuff with the new works too instead of

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.139 
stuff with the new works too instead of
