00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
the 50s so wonderful miles on a 2006

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.350 
the 50s so wonderful miles on a 2006
inside<00:02:05.650> yeah<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.369> mean<00:02:06.700> it's<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.910> little<00:02:07.180> bit

Spartan<00:02:07.899> but<00:02:08.200> again<00:02:08.649> this<00:02:08.830> car<00:02:09.040> isn't<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.580> lot

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
Spartan but again this car isn't a lot

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.320 
Spartan but again this car isn't a lot
of<00:02:10.090> money<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.690> together<00:02:11.370> 240<00:02:12.370> horsepower<00:02:12.550> a

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
of money and together 240 horsepower a

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.960 
of money and together 240 horsepower a
car<00:02:13.780> with<00:02:14.200> variable<00:02:14.800> valve<00:02:14.830> timing<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.790> that

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
car with variable valve timing and that

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.300 
car with variable valve timing and that
cool<00:02:16.270> 6-speed<00:02:16.810> transmission<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:18.160> not

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
cool 6-speed transmission it's not

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.790 
cool 6-speed transmission it's not
actually<00:02:18.880> bad<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.510> then<00:02:19.690> as<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.959> jump<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.410> at<00:02:20.590> 6

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
actually bad and then as I jump in at 6

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.229 
actually bad and then as I jump in at 6
feet<00:02:20.980> tall<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:22.470> had<00:02:23.470> tons<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.010> space<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.820> then

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
feet tall I had tons of space and then

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.360 
feet tall I had tons of space and then
it<00:02:25.360> has<00:02:25.480> not<00:02:25.750> only<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.320> tilt<00:02:26.800> steering<00:02:26.980> column

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
it has not only the tilt steering column

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.199 
it has not only the tilt steering column
but<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:27.970> has<00:02:28.090> telescopic<00:02:28.900> as<00:02:29.050> well<00:02:30.000> but<00:02:31.000> that

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
but it has telescopic as well but that

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.240 
but it has telescopic as well but that
long<00:02:31.420> wheelbase<00:02:31.720> there's<00:02:32.500> actually<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.920> lot<00:02:33.130> of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
long wheelbase there's actually a lot of

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.650 
long wheelbase there's actually a lot of
room<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.640> back<00:02:33.790> seat<00:02:34.060> as<00:02:34.209> well<00:02:34.390> now

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
room in the back seat as well now

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.180 
room in the back seat as well now
obviously<00:02:35.050> this<00:02:35.290> slope<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.709> going<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.890> impinge

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
obviously this slope is going to impinge

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.920 
obviously this slope is going to impinge
on<00:02:36.400> some<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.790> Headroom<00:02:37.270> but<00:02:37.600> again<00:02:37.810> it's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
on some of that Headroom but again it's

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.710 
on some of that Headroom but again it's
not<00:02:37.989> bad<00:02:38.260> at<00:02:38.440> all<00:02:39.209> taking<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.390> look<00:02:40.540> at<00:02:40.660> the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
not bad at all taking a look at the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.410 
not bad at all taking a look at the
trunk

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.290 

it's<00:02:44.990> spacious<00:02:45.290> it's<00:02:45.830> roomy<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:47.000> sports

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
it's spacious it's roomy it's a sports

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.230 
it's spacious it's roomy it's a sports
car<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.080> fun<00:02:48.350> car<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.310> drive<00:02:49.880> fast

car it's a fun car it's a drive fast

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.020 
car it's a fun car it's a drive fast
type<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.750> car<00:02:50.959> but<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.740> still<00:02:51.920> very

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
type of car but it's still very

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.760

practical and lots of space in the trunk

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.010 
practical and lots of space in the trunk
for<00:02:55.190> getting<00:02:55.640> away<00:02:55.819> for<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.090> weekend<00:02:56.450> or<00:02:56.600> just

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
lines it's got kind of a long rear half

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.560 
lines it's got kind of a long rear half
of<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.070> vehicle<00:03:04.730> again<00:03:04.850> with<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.270> super

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
of the vehicle again with that super

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.600 
of the vehicle again with that super
long<00:03:05.750> wheelbase<00:03:06.110> if<00:03:06.709> you've<00:03:06.920> ever<00:03:07.070> seen<00:03:07.340> a

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
long wheelbase if you've ever seen a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.000 
long wheelbase if you've ever seen a
Malibu<00:03:08.090> max<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.570> Malibu<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.110> max<00:03:09.380> body<00:03:09.770> line

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
Malibu max the Malibu is max body line

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.860 
Malibu max the Malibu is max body line
kind<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.340> goes<00:03:10.489> like<00:03:10.520> this<00:03:10.880> flattens<00:03:11.510> out<00:03:11.630> and

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
kind of goes like this flattens out and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.680 
kind of goes like this flattens out and
has<00:03:12.020> an<00:03:12.320> extra<00:03:12.800> extension<00:03:13.520> back<00:03:13.700> here<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.209> so

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
has an extra extension back here and so

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.199 
has an extra extension back here and so
this<00:03:14.959> g6<00:03:15.890> follows<00:03:16.310> along<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.700> same<00:03:16.940> theme

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
this g6 follows along that same theme

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.490 
this g6 follows along that same theme
obviously<00:03:17.600> just<00:03:18.290> much<00:03:18.470> more<00:03:18.680> aerodynamically

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
obviously just much more aerodynamically

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:30.580 
obviously just much more aerodynamically
let's<00:03:21.500> take<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.650> peek<00:03:21.860> inside

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.069 

now<00:03:31.590> again<00:03:32.030> 240<00:03:33.030> horsepower<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.599> nothing<00:03:33.959> to

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
now again 240 horsepower is nothing to

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.599 
now again 240 horsepower is nothing to
sneeze<00:03:34.260> up<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.230> has<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.409> dual<00:03:37.799> exhaust<00:03:38.010> that

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
sneeze up and it has a dual exhaust that

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.240 
sneeze up and it has a dual exhaust that
sounds<00:03:39.000> really<00:03:39.359> nice<00:03:39.620> climate<00:03:40.620> control<00:03:41.010> is

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
sounds really nice climate control is

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.520 
sounds really nice climate control is
all<00:03:41.459> digital<00:03:41.760> here<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.049> again<00:03:43.469> that
