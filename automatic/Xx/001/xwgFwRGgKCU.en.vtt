00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.759 
last couple of days it's been shedding a
lot<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.299> definitely<00:02:21.749> think<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.109> need<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.379> give

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
lot so I definitely think I need to give

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.230 
lot so I definitely think I need to give
it<00:02:22.859> a<00:02:22.920> protein<00:02:23.129> treatment<00:02:23.879> but

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
it a protein treatment but

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.330 
it a protein treatment but
I<00:02:24.390> used<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> aloe<00:02:25.350> vera<00:02:25.680> juice<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
I used the aloe vera juice on that

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.690 
I used the aloe vera juice on that
little<00:02:27.350> piece<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.380> hair<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.040> little<00:02:29.310> ball<00:02:29.520> of

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
little piece of hair the little ball of

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.780 
little piece of hair the little ball of
hair<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.570> see<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:30.990> revert<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.770> did<00:02:31.980> so

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
hair just see if we revert and it did so

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.640 
hair just see if we revert and it did so
i<00:02:33.210> think<00:02:33.480> i'll<00:02:33.720> probably<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:34.080> using<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.470> from

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
i think i'll probably be using that from

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.070 
i think i'll probably be using that from
now<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.190> since<00:02:35.460> i<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.960> my

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
now on but since i have this is my

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.560 
now on but since i have this is my
second<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.560> last<00:02:37.820> non-alcoholic<00:02:38.820> beer<00:02:39.120> got<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
second to last non-alcoholic beer got it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.710 
second to last non-alcoholic beer got it
target<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.260> think<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.770> was<00:02:40.800> 399<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.880> I'm<00:02:42.570> just

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
target I think it was 399 and I'm just

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.880 
target I think it was 399 and I'm just
going<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.900> use<00:02:43.080> these<00:02:43.230> because<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.530> don't<00:02:43.710> want

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890
