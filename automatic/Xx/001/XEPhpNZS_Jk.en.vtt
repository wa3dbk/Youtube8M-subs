00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hello, I want to tell everyone how I am doing 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.010
 drinking water filter for a jug 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.730
 common type of aquaphor barrier and so 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.789
 the old filter is further needed 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.180
 cut top comes 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:26.130
 here it is the ring below here 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.900
 mesh will need napkin cotton pad 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.090
 more precisely and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.750
 activated carbon of its own 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.410
 production here's a cotton pad i divide by 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.980
 two parts because he is crazy 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.149
 thick and one piece 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.149
 drop down 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.940
 that's so neat 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:00.250
 we omit it to lie on the grid then 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:05.270
 we have here is such a thing 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.160
 here is a grid and naturally further just 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.080
 quite simply 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:16.380
 small fraction of its activated 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:19.600
 coal we load our filter 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.960
 falling asleep to the brim of this one of ours 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.740
 cut filter again we put cotton 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.740
 drive on top 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:35.189
 so when typing water 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.189
 would not pop up 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.650
 and here it is a little ring further 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:50.900
 glue gun here put two 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:54.190
 dochechki can 4 here the filter is ready I think 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.509
 that it is not inferior to any aquaform 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.479
 new item filter 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.799
 cartridge and so on anyway 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:07.190
 my family's criticism this year was not 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:11.510
 and since we have water with great 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.560
 calcium content if its not 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.410
 filter teapots get terrible 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.200
 plaque such annular after filtration 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.140
 here is such a cartridge of plaque well, not 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.340
 I will say that there is no hundred percent but 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.380
 much much much less all 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.440
 I advise very good cheap and 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.440
 angrily 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.590
 online 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.070
 they
