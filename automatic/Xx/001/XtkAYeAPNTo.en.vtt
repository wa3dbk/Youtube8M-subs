00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.080
 how cold it is and we found the day 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.580
 today here in full rain because 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.049
 We want to take this little cane that 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.299
 we're going to be to do a little bit of 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.940
 sugar so let's create something 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:18.910
 special and magical today we are going to 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.910
 do the witch story we go there 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.529
 and good guys presents my new 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.150
 position room here guys we're going to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.739
 create what is the speed position 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.870
 that will be necessary to create 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.190
 our super ezkaba so they are already 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.200
 that we have created and that a few 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.640
 positions appear that they started 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.739
 they are put they already know what rises ruin 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.360
 berruguete and let that be distilled and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.879
 then let's start to see we have 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.230
 a rare position of these normals and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.879
 Now let's put some sugar 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.290
 to release the next position 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.640
 is going to be the speed position and 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.400
 after that we're going to put a little 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.960
 of reston that they give you that they give cat and his 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.059
 son of another kind of pressure so 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.219
 there will be booths in the hospital and 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.140
 a little network are so once you 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.270
 we have this created a subscribed these 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 two points pointed and here is our 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.690
 velocity position veis tamara de 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.670
 long duration so you have to put it 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.369
 a little network are our position 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.530
 of long-term speed so 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.330
 We are not going to take it and it's time to 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.610
 make magic guys the moment to use 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.539
 our object and for this we are the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.580
 following materials 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.259
 andrÃ©s Stonesoft if you want to know 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.179
 how it is done can see the chapter 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.280
 previous there is I say how it's done 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.950
 we have our speed position 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.360
 give a diamond a long duration 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.420
 zombie chicken 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.220
 a fluff of vampire and a truth one 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.170
 flower of your materials because 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.490
 we have there from previous chapters like this 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.220
 what are we going to throw 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.330
 finally in this part of here and we're going 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.540
 to see 1 2 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.710

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.360
 Four. Five 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.400
 and that was why we take our 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.080
 finally our position of fried or 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.780
 email that with this we are going to do that 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.850
 turn our broom now it's time 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.070
 to remember our witcher trees 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.080
 and how is this me in this part of here 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.610
 I have made a small forest full of 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.590
 this type of trees remember that this 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.060
 it can be done through the mutant and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.020
 if you want you do not know how to mutate and 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.670
 also lives in the chapters 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.620
 previous to be able to make your forest 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.540
 special yes how can you see here I have 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.110
 trees that to see we are going to see this one of 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.030
 What is it 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.620
 this is a lot that by the way 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.690
 we need this type of tree 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.310
 we have a rowan here and later 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.630
 there I think I did a few others 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.220
 trees more because we're really 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.810
 like a whole forest but good 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.280
 while we're taking this one we're 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.380
 to be hawton bours because you're going to 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.970
 need what are the twigs that we 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.970
 bring this tree so please 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.290
 it's perfect and we're going to take 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.910
 these twigs that loose this tree but 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.050
 They know that before we leave we will leave 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.940
 a few raised because we 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.950
 we were a lot of trees and not 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.810
 we want to leave this empty so 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.000
 remember to always have your trees well 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.200
 planted and that we do not need this 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.540
 tools that are very special to 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.070
 witcher and wings someone that you 're the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.920

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.849
 who I am 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 today we are going to create this is very 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.780
 simple since we have those ready ones 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.489
 how many sticks this is not a stick 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.830
 obviously we are taking out some sticks 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.930
 of cha to be exact nothing more than two and 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.959
 let's put the broom in this position 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.510
 we put three down points for 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.280
 textile and finally a normal strix 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.660
 three little sticks here the top part and 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.680
 tana is the broom 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.030
 and of course I'm here reading simply 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.560
 to find what we need to 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.810
 do the energy circle to be able to 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.330
 love our super scale and look 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.040
 that we need 2000 of altar power and 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.020
 we need the small circle and the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.030
 medium circle so let's create them 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.950
 have two guys here is our 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.590
 medium circle and our large circle 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.630
 with a power that we have like 5000's 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.430
 altar if I'm not wrong let's see 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.260
 when we have 5,000 so we have to spare 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.240
 power and something very important that not 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.100
 you can forget is that this enchantment 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.840
 it can only be done at night 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.980
 so guys so do not try 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.260
 do for the day because it's not going to 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.290
 work wait for the moon to come out and 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.330
 guide your enchantment at night and 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.860
 we finally have what is our 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.890
 exhibition that we have done previously 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.390
