00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 Today I have another here 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.450
 small touchpen for you brought 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.069
 a so-called stylus with 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.970
 pen you can see the vein 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.210
 already recognize 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.460
 that comes from moby which offer all sorts of things 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.039
 for example, small items were on display 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.750
 the big known online marketplaces 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.789
 I also had some time ago 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.000
 another touch pen a mini 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.400
 touch cases of mumbai were also 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 I think I tested it today 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 i think the st1000 is coming and i want to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.910
 show you briefly how the whole 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.380
 Processed like that is in operation 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.690
 It is in China 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.399
 pens mine and how is that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.960
 course, of course, also in action behaves 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.940
 on the tablet or smartphone 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 This is how the whole thing looks like 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.460
 here again twice packed in the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.649
 Packaging numbi sticker on the front 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 and I just look how the whole on 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.270
 get the looks not quite here yet 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.449
 Just open the back and the two 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.629
 things schÃ¶nherr he first of all 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.760
 the touchpen and then we have the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.500
 pen expression 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 I may have driven a piece 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 because that's not the biggest part here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.880
 so the pen mane is likely 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.010
 be black and the touchpen here in front 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.710
 with silicone tip like that too 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.080
 the other one around the touchpen was the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.369
 I introduced some time ago 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.299
 you have a small silicone as I said 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.229
 top and back a little 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.009
 metal rings or whatever that is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.200
 then you probably have to go back 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.259
 Be careful not to be too strong 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.850
 you press on otherwise or too obliquely 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.070
 so press on if you otherwise 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.409
 maybe with this little metal ring 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.659
 also over the screen surface 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.810
 can scrape up here but again 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.759
 Mobile and a clip for a shirt collar 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.820
 or a purse or whatever 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.790
 I'll do it all over with him 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.960
 everyone should be already 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.290
 pens that's what we mean 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.450
 even get a replacement mine to do so 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.140
 Pen with a pen like himself 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.130
 that belongs and the whole thing can then be 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.930
 screw it back like it did 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.549
 have opened than with spare mine 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.450
 I do not have it in now 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.180
 This is how it is in the memory 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 Product description 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.250
 to the stand and to the pen 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.170
 I just wanted to activate order 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.240
 you can get it out in the front 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.590
 pulling off the cap is quite good in the 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.120
 hand may be a bit short for 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.670
 wholesaler you can see that there are red 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.680
 Almost no not good in the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.660
 handballen rhein should be ok 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.240
 I take my calf piece of paper 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.709
 I have no pieces of paper at hand 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.810
 as I said the same as I said the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.730
 Ballpoint pen just front the cap 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.770
 Pull off and you have here a forward 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.200
 beautiful ballpoint girl and I 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.380
 try in which color or if 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.459
 works at all and the whole thing 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.620
 looks pretty neat in black 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.239
 does not make difficult and make good 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.650
 impression I have a tablet again 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.209
 just brought up shows you just that 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.160
 sharing action I am doing to 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.140
 first time but I can say right 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.580
 this works very well 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.720
 buttery maybe I could 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.150
 does not have to press 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.040
 that works quite normal as 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.810
 with the finger thereby at the other 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.850
 touch cases I showed you 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.590
 I think he was mine too but me 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.239
 just can not guarantee it 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.530
 I had big problems because you knew 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.970
 Press very hard 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.260
 And that's exactly why you are 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.019
 also risked this here 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.420
 press metal ring on the display 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.620
 which, of course, at 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.720
 cheaper tablets with plastic 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.290
 displays may have fatal consequences 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.060
 can in optics at least and that 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.680
 whole works wonderfully so for 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.920
 Touch to scroll is needed here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.780
 really just very soft and pull 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.330
 the same thing for money for typing 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.910
 exactly one needs only completely 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.190
 butter soft the things to tap and 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.330
 he does not need somehow it difficult 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.220
 to push the whole power now 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.769
 really a very good impression 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.040
 I do not have many stylus yet 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.420
 but touchpens donor uses hers 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.970
 I'm just feeling the impression 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.829
 but it costs about six euros for 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.370
 the price is absolutely more than in 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.350
 order 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.959
 the other mini I will give you once 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.980
 he showed around two euros 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.480
 so cost a small one 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.080
 Price difference was only so 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.560
 Long 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.930
 approximately and was still practical 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.510
 One piece was up here in the pawls 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.230
 audio jack because you could get in there 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.280
 they always need to be shipped 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.340
 Of course you can not do that here with me now 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.769
 but it works and how he does it 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.320
 He works conducted on the soft 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.850
 screen like a finger in sweat 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.010
 so bathed on the screen is that 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.420
 can one really say that's where I give you 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.190
 really a clear buy recommendation though 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.900
 you want to get a touchdown 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.440
 then you can peacefully 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.490
 to put down this mobi yes and who 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.410
 I really do not care about anything 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.750
 say it is only a small touchpen 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.830
 as I said and you can but I think 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.050
 Clear insight is very good 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.420
 clear buy recommendation works multi 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.260
 touch pen for about six euros me 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.730
 Thank you for watching this video 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.800
 the time have watched you taken 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.300
 I hope that was helpful for the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.400
 would one or the other if that was so 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.400
 I'm very positive about that 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.230
 looking forward or over an abo on 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.240
 a channel of course, otherwise 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.220
 I say anyway, it makes me feel good and 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.220
