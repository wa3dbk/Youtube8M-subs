00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
the new Forester is the same basic

the new Forester is the same basic
recipe<00:01:24.890> as<00:01:24.979> before<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:25.970> we<00:01:26.119> were<00:01:26.270> hoping<00:01:26.600> it

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
recipe as before so we were hoping it

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
the previous model its ground clearance

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.440 
the previous model its ground clearance
of<00:01:32.500> 220<00:01:33.500> millimetres<00:01:34.040> gave<00:01:34.250> us<00:01:34.369> some<00:01:34.610> hope<00:01:34.820> but

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
of 220 millimetres gave us some hope but

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.570 
of 220 millimetres gave us some hope but
Subaru<00:01:35.810> has<00:01:36.110> stated<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.979> engine<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:37.460> the

new Forester sits lower than ever before

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.550 
new Forester sits lower than ever before
so<00:01:40.009> some<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.910> off-road<00:01:41.360> usability<00:01:41.990> may
