00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
camera to the OMD lineup a lot of people

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.400 
camera to the OMD lineup a lot of people
are<00:00:11.730> wondering<00:00:11.880> what's<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> big<00:00:12.719> differences

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
are wondering what's the big differences

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.820 
are wondering what's the big differences
between<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:14.130> e/m<00:00:14.639> 10<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.990> em1<00:00:16.379> because

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
between the e/m 10 and the em1 because

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.890 
between the e/m 10 and the em1 because
there's<00:00:17.010> quite<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.430> price<00:00:17.699> difference<00:00:17.910> so

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
there's quite a price difference so

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.630 
there's quite a price difference so
basically<00:00:19.590> i've<00:00:19.800> gone<00:00:19.920> through<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.279> specs

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
basically i've gone through the specs

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.090 
basically i've gone through the specs
here<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.420> i've<00:00:21.539> got<00:00:21.720> six<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
here for you and i've got six of the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.009 
here for you and i've got six of the
main<00:00:23.279> differences<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.119> six<00:00:24.480> major

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
main differences the six major

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.220 
main differences the six major
differences<00:00:25.650> between<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:27.060> new<00:00:27.090> am<00:00:27.570> 10<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
differences between the new am 10 and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.179 
differences between the new am 10 and
the<00:00:28.769> em1<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.119> six<00:00:30.980> advantages<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the em1 now these are six advantages of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.139 
the em1 now these are six advantages of
the<00:00:32.669> em1<00:00:33.000> over<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.290> less<00:00:34.469> expensive<00:00:35.160> eeehm<00:00:35.730> 10

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the em1 over the less expensive eeehm 10

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.780 
the em1 over the less expensive eeehm 10
so<00:00:36.450> these<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.719> six<00:00:36.960> advantages<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.399> em1

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so these are six advantages of the em1

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.229 
so these are six advantages of the em1
that<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.989> e/m<00:00:40.350> 10<00:00:40.649> does<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.340> first<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
that the e/m 10 does not have first and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.660 
that the e/m 10 does not have first and
foremost<00:00:42.629> we've<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.140> five<00:00:43.559> axis<00:00:44.250> image

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
foremost we've got five axis image

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.799 
foremost we've got five axis image
stabilization<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.920> olympus<00:00:47.460> em1<00:00:47.910> we

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
stabilization in the olympus em1 we

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.680 
stabilization in the olympus em1 we
don't<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.649> 5<00:00:50.010> axis<00:00:50.610> stabilization<00:00:50.850> in

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
don't have the 5 axis stabilization in

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.319 
don't have the 5 axis stabilization in
the<00:00:52.379> e/m<00:00:52.620> 10<00:00:52.890> we've<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.309> three<00:00:53.879> axis

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the e/m 10 we've got three axis

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.770 
the e/m 10 we've got three axis
stabilization<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> still<00:00:56.460> decent<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.660> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
stabilization so still decent but it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.580 
stabilization so still decent but it
doesn't<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.920> much-vaunted<00:01:00.140> 5<00:01:01.140> axis

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
doesn't have the much-vaunted 5 axis

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
doesn't have the much-vaunted 5 axis
image<00:01:01.980> stabilization<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> lot<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.359> people

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
image stabilization that a lot of people

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.500 
image stabilization that a lot of people
really<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> em1<00:01:05.510> basically

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
really like that's in the em1 basically

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.929 
really like that's in the em1 basically
that<00:01:06.689> 5<00:01:06.990> axis<00:01:07.500> image<00:01:08.159> stabilization<00:01:08.490> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that 5 axis image stabilization is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.609 
that 5 axis image stabilization is
probably<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> best<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> market

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
probably about the best on the market

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
probably about the best on the market
right<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.939> allows<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
right now and it really allows you to

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
right now and it really allows you to
use<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.159> em1<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.869> running<00:01:16.290> gun<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:17.369> can

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
use the em1 as a running gun you can

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
use the em1 as a running gun you can
have<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.299> monopod<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:19.049> running<00:01:19.350> around

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
have it on a monopod be running around

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.789 
have it on a monopod be running around
doing<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.479> video<00:01:21.869> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
doing on the go you can go video it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.450 
doing on the go you can go video it
really<00:01:23.400> eliminates<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.420> need<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.960> lot<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
really eliminates the need for a lot of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.980 
really eliminates the need for a lot of
you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.490> shoulder<00:01:27.000> rigs<00:01:27.240> things<00:01:27.570> things

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you know shoulder rigs things things

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.380 
you know shoulder rigs things things
like<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> five<00:01:29.369> axis<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
like that because the five axis is that

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.870 
like that because the five axis is that
good<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.530> three<00:01:31.770> axis<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> e/m<00:01:32.490> 10<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
good the three axis and the e/m 10 is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.550 
good the three axis and the e/m 10 is
okay<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.350> good

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
okay but it's not going to be as good

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.850 
okay but it's not going to be as good
folks<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.310> five<00:01:35.579> axis<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> em1<00:01:36.860> second

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
folks as the five axis in the em1 second

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.660 
folks as the five axis in the em1 second
up<00:01:38.009> we've<00:01:38.490> got<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:39.030> better<00:01:39.270> shutter<00:01:39.750> speed

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
up we've got a better shutter speed

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.730 
up we've got a better shutter speed
setting<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.299> em1<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.200> go<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> one

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
setting on the em1 we can go to one

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
setting on the em1 we can go to one
eight<00:01:44.040> thousandths<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.000> second<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.869> em1

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
eight thousandths of a second on the em1

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.249 
eight thousandths of a second on the em1
we<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.920> only<00:01:47.040> go<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.939> four<00:01:48.390> thousandths

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
we can only go to one four thousandths

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830 
we can only go to one four thousandths
of<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.500> second<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.369> e/m<00:01:50.700> ten<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.509> might<00:01:51.689> not

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
of a second on the e/m ten you might not

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.210 
of a second on the e/m ten you might not
think<00:01:51.869> that's<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.409> big<00:01:52.590> difference<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.159> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
think that's a big difference but you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.130 
think that's a big difference but you
start<00:01:53.640> playing<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.060> studio<00:01:54.540> lighting<00:01:54.810> or

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
start playing with studio lighting or

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.660 
start playing with studio lighting or
external<00:01:55.740> lighting<00:01:55.950> folks<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.579> you're

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
external lighting folks and you're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
external lighting folks and you're
really<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> appreciate<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.229> higher

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
really going to appreciate the higher
