00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi daniele you girls today are up 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.940
 these pencils of the long lasting essence 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:12.019
 or six colors actually came out 8 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:16.949
 number one the black number two the brown 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:20.970
 number 5 metallic silver number 9 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.920
 cooldown that this blue number 12 a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.800
 this green with micro inside 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.740
 silver glitter and the number 16 is 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.449
 this viola lidi I would tell you immediately in two 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.460
 categories in fact these three opa that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.710
 landi from brown and blue I find that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.989
 are many different from the three instead 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.530
 however metallized for Latin or with 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.090
 these three letter bugs then these 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.399
 I prefer to use them 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 however, I use them a lot in rhyme 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.960
 domestic especially and black you already have 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 seen it is for many years that it is among mine 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.170
 favorite 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.360
 and also brown a beautiful brown 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.620
 because to be really a dad 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 of the best finest I 've seen 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.270
 around and write very well they last 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.980
 they are so easy to blend when you do 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.780
 they put the eye around 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.500
 to the eye, however, with the stop in the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.119
 internal rhyme fix well are a little 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.369
 dried as texture however I had it 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.930
 made no poses that fix you better 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.540
 then compared to many other pencils 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 instead, these tend to be cona 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.920
 three others are a little less homogeneous as 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.180
 pencils so the stroke is not superman 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.000
 homogeneous 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.640
 if you put them inside 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 they are not so much because of the eye 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.930
 I'm not a part like the others 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.020
 and if you put them on at least instead 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.030
 admits indino print then when 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.740
 I put it anyway I have to blend it a 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.000
 moment and I have to put on a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.000
 eyeshadow to fix them better 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.920
 even just after a few seconds you notice 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.660
 immediately as you see the green tender 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.420
 to print therefore despite being 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.940
 however long lasting 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.370
 this means that they don't print 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.920
 so if you use them don't use like 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.480
 the animate faded canvases inside 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.550
 of your smokey and your everyone 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.340
 colored and I would therefore avoid my vote 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.050
 in two different votes 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.800
 the first is for these three opaque colors 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.930
 black to brown and blue my vote is 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.000
 eight and a half drum roll and that 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.950
 they like them very much they are very long 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.830
 faded there I am very, very very 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.570
 nice while my vote for the others 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.310
 three pencils takes a little longer for morning 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.830
 metallized nor be walls 6 plus these 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.990
 more things because they don't make me crazy 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.500
 they are not as intense as colors 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.720
 or quite original and do not last 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.170
 very much taking just a moment to 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.990
 to disappear 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.820
 but the pa that I do is 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.320
 beautiful are really fantastic and 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.390
 before leaving you I tell you every order 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:55.360
 from my favorite which is less 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.580
 black brown blue purple gray and green 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.580
 girls at the next review
