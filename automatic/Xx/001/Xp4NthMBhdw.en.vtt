00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.369
 after the success of the first chapter 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.289
 the clan del coc mineri try ad 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.660
 emulate the success of dies lang with 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.919
 a spin off atp in the far from being 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.719
 Following a real riptide 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.910
 continues to tell the story of four 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.320
 Survivors of trivial catching on 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.659
 exactly from the end of the story 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.890
 previous that may have succeeded in 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.839
 get to safety on a military ship 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.489
 our heroes have finally returned 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.159
 account of the illusory nature of this 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.199
 peace painfully conquered by ship 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.699
 also based on the nafra zombies 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.070
 indeed on another small island 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.479
 palaknight a tropical nightmare in styria 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.129
 far cry from which the player will have to 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.280
 absolutely manage to escape 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.930
 using every available means 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.850
 at this point the version also begins 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.229
 not definitive that kindly a 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.030
 available from the publisher e 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.829
 developers we got to 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.299
 investigate in the past few days and who has 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.880
 aroused the positive bignami but 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.280
 conflicting 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.930
 the demanding resignation despite it 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.579
 poor level of difficulty put 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.439
 immediately violence the effort made by 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.680
 developers to distance themselves from three 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.670
 that and in any case the defects remain 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.380
 defects that can be included 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.060
 also an excessive repetitiveness of the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.470
 contrasted gameplay now 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 from the inclusion of all the mechanics 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.610
 new linear wanderings we are 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.649
 accustomed though far from being 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.329
 abandoned now leave space 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.789
 interesting assets from parts of the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.020
 zombie in these sections the player is 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.970
 called to defend their base 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.530
 building the cyclicals being turrets 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.390
 and collaborating with other survivors 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.429
 to ensure the survival of the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 group a decidedly situation 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.990
 many already seen in zombies 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.390
 movie that competes to create moments of 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.860
 suspense and pure action by forcing us to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.299
 to cope with the various needs of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.119
 from time to time they will present themselves during 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.770
 the siege of the disease repair the defenses 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.299
 damaged move the turrets into 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.979
 more suitable places do not blow up a 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.539
 bridge to cut the road the hordes of 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.740
 zombies are just some of the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.420
 possibility of such sections 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.160
 present 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.630
 pity that very soon game returns 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.610
 on its tracks proposing a long one 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.709
 series of linear missions already brand of 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.049
 dead island riptide series factory 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.430
 in fact, it does not abandon the basic structure 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.079
 of these of the predecessor 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.060
 so much so that most of the hours spent 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.040
 to play he would run by running from a 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.480
 point to the other side of the island slicing 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.980
 not dead and trying to bring back 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.510
 back and several useful objects 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.950
 to the advancement of the plot and the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.720
 your escape to salvation 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.670
 always to cope with the excessive 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.349
 the developers have linearity though 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.150
 tried to make the title a little more 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.340
 arduous, leaving ample space for 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.110
 explorations the tasks to be brought to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.400
 term will be of the same type but le 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.200
 areas where we will have to look for the various 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.060
 objects will appear much more serious and the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.560
 track to follow less obvious 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.060
 moreover the various types of zombies 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.550
 they will definitely be more 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.640
 with ace and reactivates raising of motion 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.650
 challenge level 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.390
 of this and the strange lack of weapons i 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.920
 protagonists will be able to count on new ones 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.600
 ways to come to terms with the non 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.310
 deaths will be possible, for example 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.650
 provincial banks using the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.600
 new vehicles available chase away 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.100
 giulia protrusions of wolves or even 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.020
 take yourself to an elevated position 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.270
 to jump on the nearest areas e 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.940
 landing in a cultured and refined sol 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.140
 also the combat system 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.820
 indicator of fatigue of fury are now 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.530
 better balanced making necessary a 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.989
 more strategic and frequent approach 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.790
 when the weapons are withdrawn they will also be damaged 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.590
 much more realistic than in the past so much 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.540
 that you will have to be very careful not to 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.070
 use improperly against 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.850
 otherwise of a huge expense for the 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.810
 repair of your favorite weapon 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.489
 despite the efforts made by the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.930
 developers, however, it appears evident that the 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.550
 title brings with it many of the flaws 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.739
 of the predecessor 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.209
 an example is the single pur mode 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.530
 fun deadrise multiplayer 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.540
 landry taider ends up becoming 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.250
 too arduous and chaotic it was played in 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.140
 solitary with no companions to help the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.820
 player to thin out the hordes of zombies 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.700
 which constantly miss the game chains 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.220
 collects little commitment seems to have been 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.239
 also spent on the technical sector 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.920
 cropping not just our engine 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.959
 graph too similar to that of 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.329
 first device but the graphic appears 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.739
 decidedly dirtier texture more 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.390
 detail a few numbers 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.120
 top of polygons for le 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.410
 in fact, settings are placed side by side 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.290
 abound in kindergartens and spread with 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.519
 Polini performance also to achievements 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.229
 water is a very important element 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.670
 given the setting of the title is 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.440
 certainly below average 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.910
 but this is also accompanied by a 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.590
 little artificial intelligence 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.120
 refined with isolated zombies that 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.580
 end up ignoring you are not 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.410
 serve them and with allies that end 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.960
 to run like mad on the table 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.210
 first enemy in the vicinity a series 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.560
 of defects we are sure are the 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.740
 direct consequence of the version 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.510
 final tested but that are solved 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.960
 could undermine too much league pay 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.960
 of wine
