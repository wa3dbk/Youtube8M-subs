is<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.390> multi-channel<00:00:22.390> diversity<00:00:23.050> receiver

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
is the multi-channel diversity receiver

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.950 
is the multi-channel diversity receiver
for<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:23.800> FPV<00:00:24.099> series<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:25.240> what<00:00:25.540> I've<00:00:25.660> done<00:00:25.779> is

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
for the FPV series and what I've done is

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.240 
for the FPV series and what I've done is
I've<00:00:26.110> designed<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.560> circuit<00:00:26.920> here<00:00:27.070> as<00:00:27.189> you

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
I've designed the circuit here as you

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.100 
I've designed the circuit here as you
can<00:00:27.279> see<00:00:27.400> it's<00:00:27.640> got<00:00:27.790> lots<00:00:27.970> of<00:00:28.119> wires<00:00:28.509> and<00:00:28.720> bits

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
can see it's got lots of wires and bits

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.409 
can see it's got lots of wires and bits
and<00:00:29.200> pieces<00:00:29.290> and<00:00:29.770> doodads<00:00:30.400> she<00:00:31.119> got<00:00:31.239> a<00:00:31.270> couple

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
and pieces and doodads she got a couple

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.440 
and pieces and doodads she got a couple
of<00:00:31.570> receivers<00:00:32.079> in<00:00:32.259> this<00:00:32.470> one<00:00:32.590> as<00:00:32.710> well<00:00:32.860> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
of receivers in this one as well and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.389 
of receivers in this one as well and
after<00:00:34.450> designing<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.260> I<00:00:35.590> then<00:00:36.010> had<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.190> each

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
after designing that I then had to each

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.910 
after designing that I then had to each
a<00:00:36.550> circuit<00:00:36.910> board<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.540> like<00:00:37.720> this<00:00:38.050> so<00:00:38.590> here<00:00:38.800> is

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
a circuit board and like this so here is

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.819 
a circuit board and like this so here is
the<00:00:39.130> resulting<00:00:40.059> four<00:00:40.780> channel<00:00:41.290> diversity

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
the resulting four channel diversity

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.950 
the resulting four channel diversity
controller<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:43.030> these<00:00:43.270> schematics<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.870> the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
controller and these schematics and the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.380 
controller and these schematics and the
lay<00:00:44.530> over<00:00:44.649> go<00:00:44.860> on<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.280> board<00:00:45.460> on<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.760> website

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
lay over go on the board on the website

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.380 
lay over go on the board on the website
very<00:00:46.480> shortly<00:00:46.719> for<00:00:47.170> that<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.969> it<00:00:49.269> actually

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
very shortly for that and it actually

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.729 
very shortly for that and it actually
switched<00:00:49.750> between<00:00:49.840> any<00:00:50.170> one<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.350> four

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
switched between any one of four

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.759 
switched between any one of four
antennas<00:00:51.570> based<00:00:52.570> off<00:00:52.870> four<00:00:53.140> receivers<00:00:53.469> based

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
antennas based off four receivers based

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.369 
antennas based off four receivers based
on<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.129> which<00:00:54.489> one<00:00:54.640> has<00:00:54.760> them<00:00:54.910> most<00:00:55.600> signal<00:00:56.230> at

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
on the which one has them most signal at

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.229 
on the which one has them most signal at
any<00:00:56.559> given<00:00:56.710> time<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.219> means<00:00:57.940> you<00:00:58.059> can<00:00:58.149> have

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
any given time that means you can have

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.029 
any given time that means you can have
your<00:00:58.390> omnidirectional<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.530> your<00:00:59.620> pitch<00:00:59.829> and

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
your omnidirectional and your pitch and

your helical or whatever you want and as

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:02.849 
your helical or whatever you want and as
you<00:01:01.899> can<00:01:01.989> still<00:01:02.109> get<00:01:02.289> a<00:01:02.320> bit<00:01:02.440> close<00:01:02.620> up<00:01:02.769> here

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
you can still get a bit close up here

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.250 
you can still get a bit close up here
I've<00:01:03.640> made<00:01:03.910> this<00:01:04.089> particular<00:01:04.690> board<00:01:05.080> it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
I've made this particular board it's

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.470 
I've made this particular board it's
just<00:01:05.290> very<00:01:05.680> easy<00:01:05.770> for<00:01:06.370> anyone<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.670> up<00:01:07.300> together

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
just very easy for anyone to up together

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.360 
just very easy for anyone to up together
and<00:01:07.810> vote<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.110> can<00:01:08.200> either<00:01:08.320> do<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.100> turn<00:01:09.280> of

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
and vote you can either do the turn of

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.890 
and vote you can either do the turn of
transformation<00:01:10.030> yourself<00:01:10.330> or<00:01:10.570> you<00:01:10.659> can<00:01:10.780> get

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
transformation yourself or you can get

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.720 
transformation yourself or you can get
the<00:01:11.050> board<00:01:11.230> done<00:01:11.530> at<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.800> there's<00:01:12.520> nothing

the board done at a there's nothing

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.010 
the board done at a there's nothing
dressed<00:01:12.909> I'll<00:01:13.030> see<00:01:13.390> one<00:01:13.510> of<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.659> board<00:01:13.810> fair

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
dressed I'll see one of the board fair

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.930 
dressed I'll see one of the board fair
houses<00:01:14.409> and<00:01:14.530> see<00:01:14.620> if<00:01:14.680> they'll<00:01:14.830> make<00:01:15.610> up<00:01:15.760> some

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
houses and see if they'll make up some

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.920 
houses and see if they'll make up some
boards<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.330> you<00:01:16.390> can<00:01:16.540> buy<00:01:16.659> them<00:01:16.780> directly

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
boards and you can buy them directly

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.240 
boards and you can buy them directly
from<00:01:17.200> them<00:01:17.409> with<00:01:17.560> solder<00:01:17.860> mask<00:01:18.009> and

from them with solder mask and

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.130 
from them with solder mask and
everything<00:01:18.520> but<00:01:18.640> it's<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.720> good<00:01:19.899> place<00:01:20.110> for

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
everything but it's a good place for

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.539 
everything but it's a good place for
people<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.590> get<00:01:20.649> started<00:01:21.159> if<00:01:21.250> you've<00:01:21.430> never

so<00:01:48.250> that's<00:01:48.969> basically<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.630> for<00:01:49.810> those<00:01:49.899> of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
so that's basically it and for those of

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.990 
so that's basically it and for those of
you<00:01:50.200> who<00:01:50.320> understand<00:01:50.799> such<00:01:51.009> things<00:01:51.039> we<00:01:51.820> have<00:01:51.939> a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
you who understand such things we have a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.560 
you who understand such things we have a
pic<00:01:52.240> controller<00:01:52.899> here<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.619> we<00:01:53.710> have<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:54.570> quad

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
pic controller here and we have a quad

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.840 
pic controller here and we have a quad
CMOS<00:01:56.200> gate<00:01:56.590> there<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.399> pit<00:01:57.549> controller

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
CMOS gate there so the pit controller

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.209 
CMOS gate there so the pit controller
just<00:01:58.000> looks<00:01:58.210> at<00:01:58.359> the<00:01:58.390> re<00:01:59.079> society<00:01:59.829> signal

this<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> big<00:02:08.710> voltage<00:02:09.009> regulator<00:02:09.430> because

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
this is a big voltage regulator because

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.310 
this is a big voltage regulator because
they're<00:02:10.240> cheap<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.630> have<00:02:10.780> plenty<00:02:10.960> of<00:02:11.080> them

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
they're cheap and I have plenty of them

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.170 
they're cheap and I have plenty of them
and<00:02:11.470> then<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.280> course<00:02:12.430> there's<00:02:12.580> my<00:02:12.670> little<00:02:12.790> 12

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
and then of course there's my little 12

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.330 
and then of course there's my little 12
volt<00:02:13.300> supply<00:02:13.420> if<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:14.050> turn<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.530> it'll<00:02:15.160> do<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
volt supply if I turn it on it'll do a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.640 
volt supply if I turn it on it'll do a
little<00:02:15.610> diagnostic<00:02:16.390> hopefully<00:02:17.050> should<00:02:17.410> fetch

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
little diagnostic hopefully should fetch

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.590 
little diagnostic hopefully should fetch
this<00:02:17.770> little<00:02:18.070> light<00:02:18.250> I've<00:02:18.760> got<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.000> blue<00:02:19.210> LED

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
this little light I've got this blue LED

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.120 
this little light I've got this blue LED
really<00:02:20.080> bright<00:02:20.350> photo<00:02:20.650> bright<00:02:20.860> if<00:02:20.980> not

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
really bright photo bright if not

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.040 
really bright photo bright if not
expected<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.730> easy<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.420> initial<00:02:22.750> switching

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
expected so easy is initial switching

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.650 
expected so easy is initial switching
between<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.440> four<00:02:23.680> inputs<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:25.030> cycles

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
between the four inputs it just cycles

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.510 
between the four inputs it just cycles
around<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.960> does<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.290> during<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
around and does it during the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.400 
around and does it during the
just<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.880> face<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.570> since<00:02:28.990> I've<00:02:29.080> got<00:02:29.170> nothing

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
just in face and since I've got nothing

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.530 
just in face and since I've got nothing
connected<00:02:29.820> once<00:02:30.820> it's<00:02:30.970> finished<00:02:31.120> it'll

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
connected once it's finished it'll

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.850 
connected once it's finished it'll
probably<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:31.870> flicker<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> couple<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.650> lights

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
probably just flicker a couple of lights

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.800 
probably just flicker a couple of lights
because<00:02:33.160> there<00:02:33.310> are<00:02:33.400> no<00:02:33.520> actual<00:02:34.360> signal

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
because there are no actual signal

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.600 
because there are no actual signal
inputs<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.010> won't<00:02:36.220> know<00:02:36.310> where<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.490> go

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
inputs and so it won't know where to go

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
inputs and so it won't know where to go
there<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.820> guys<00:02:36.940> got<00:02:37.120> those<00:02:37.300> flickering

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
there you guys got those flickering

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.870 
there you guys got those flickering
between<00:02:38.020> those<00:02:38.170> two<00:02:38.380> really<00:02:38.590> quickly<00:02:39.040> because

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
between those two really quickly because

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.600 
between those two really quickly because
those<00:02:40.420> two<00:02:40.570> inputs<00:02:40.870> are<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:42.040> two<00:02:42.190> defaults

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
those two inputs are the two defaults

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.390 
those two inputs are the two defaults
turn<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.420> off<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.890> there<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.130> go<00:02:45.250> that's

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
turn it off so there you go that's

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.620 
turn it off so there you go that's
coming<00:02:45.670> up<00:02:45.760> really<00:02:45.880> soon<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.360> course<00:02:46.510> the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
coming up really soon and of course the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.150 
coming up really soon and of course the
fpv<00:02:47.020> backpack<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.500> also<00:02:47.740> coming<00:02:47.950> up<00:02:48.040> really

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
fpv backpack is also coming up really

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.890 
fpv backpack is also coming up really
soon<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:48.580> what<00:02:49.240> I've<00:02:49.330> done<00:02:49.510> with<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.870> I

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
soon but what I've done with that is I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.000 
soon but what I've done with that is I
made<00:02:50.050> another<00:02:50.260> little<00:02:50.530> change<00:02:50.740> because<00:02:50.920> it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
made another little change because it

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.770 
made another little change because it
can<00:02:51.100> now<00:02:51.310> be<00:02:51.370> far<00:02:51.760> more<00:02:51.790> streamlined<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.750> I

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
can now be far more streamlined and I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.630 
can now be far more streamlined and I
want<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.990> make<00:02:53.620> also<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.950> little<00:02:54.160> fiberglass

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
want to make also a little fiberglass

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.230 
want to make also a little fiberglass
mold<00:02:55.060> for<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.690> little<00:02:55.900> sort<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.090> call

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
mold for a little sort of what you call

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.760 
mold for a little sort of what you call
a<00:02:58.270> shroud<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.840> will<00:02:58.930> go<00:02:59.080> around<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.470> that'll

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
a shroud that will go around it that'll

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.990 
a shroud that will go around it that'll
be<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> really<00:03:00.160> streamlined<00:03:00.610> little<00:03:00.820> thing<00:03:00.910> you

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
be a really streamlined little thing you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.390 
be a really streamlined little thing you
can<00:03:01.090> throw<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> top<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.170> your<00:03:03.010> model

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
can throw on the top of your model

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.610 
can throw on the top of your model
without<00:03:03.550> adding<00:03:04.150> any<00:03:04.420> extra<00:03:04.660> significant

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
without adding any extra significant

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.620 
without adding any extra significant
weight<00:03:05.740> or<00:03:06.010> drag<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:07.090> that's<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.390> that's<00:03:07.510> what

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
weight or drag so that's it that's what

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.940 
weight or drag so that's it that's what
I've<00:03:07.780> been<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.020> to<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.500> there's<00:03:08.740> lots<00:03:08.890> more

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
I've been up to and there's lots more

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.290 
I've been up to and there's lots more
videos<00:03:09.040> coming<00:03:09.520> up<00:03:09.580> withers<00:03:09.850> raining<00:03:10.180> outside

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
videos coming up withers raining outside

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.360 
videos coming up withers raining outside
at<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.600> moment<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:10.990> I<00:03:11.230> may<00:03:11.770> have<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.920> wait<00:03:12.160> a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
at the moment so I may have to wait a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.150 
at the moment so I may have to wait a
little<00:03:12.520> for<00:03:12.880> those<00:03:13.450> outdoor<00:03:14.050> videos<00:03:14.350> but<00:03:14.620> stay
