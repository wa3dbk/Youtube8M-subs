00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that the cap is white for some reason we

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.490 
that the cap is white for some reason we
got<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.939> thing<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.360> got<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> cap<00:02:04.200> was

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
busted but you can see it's all still in

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.749 
busted but you can see it's all still in
the<00:02:07.380> bottle<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:08.069> pretty<00:02:08.250> good<00:02:08.489> maybe

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
the bottle so I was pretty good maybe

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.029 
the bottle so I was pretty good maybe
you<00:02:08.910> busted<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.599> spit<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.289> or

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you busted it and spit in it or

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.589 
you busted it and spit in it or
something<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.550> maybe<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
something like that maybe that is the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.070 
something like that maybe that is the
trick

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
trick

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
trick
this<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.590> hope<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.340> hope<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:16.110> um<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.860> sill

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.620 
was still sealed so I don't think you
opened<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.890> Naga<00:02:20.160> Jolokia<00:02:20.490> pepper<00:02:20.970> is
