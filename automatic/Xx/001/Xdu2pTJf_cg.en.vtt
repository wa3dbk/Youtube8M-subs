to dirt towards the beginning of his
ground<00:00:40.829> faith<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.430> two<00:00:41.640> towards<00:00:41.969> the

ground faith and then two towards the
middle<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.770> DPS<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
middle the way we do it is we DPS the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.340 
middle the way we do it is we DPS the
first<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.450> then<00:00:45.570> leave<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.899> last

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
first two and then leave the the last

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.920 
first two and then leave the the last
two<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.039> when<00:00:47.160> he<00:00:47.280> tunnels<00:00:47.780> when<00:00:48.780> he

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
two up for when he tunnels when he

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.360 
two up for when he tunnels when he
tunnels<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> reason<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
tunnels this is the reason for the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.430 
tunnels this is the reason for the
permafrost<00:00:50.670> he's<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.750> target<00:00:51.989> somebody

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
permafrost he's going to target somebody

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
permafrost he's going to target somebody
and<00:00:52.590> basically<00:00:52.980> put<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> hunter's<00:00:53.579> mark<00:00:53.730> over

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
and basically put a hunter's mark over

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.970 
and basically put a hunter's mark over
their<00:00:54.149> head<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:55.460> shows<00:00:56.460> who<00:00:57.360> he's<00:00:57.600> targeting

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
their head that shows who he's targeting

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.349 
their head that shows who he's targeting
he's<00:00:58.980> going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> start<00:00:59.370> moving<00:00:59.550> under<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
he's going to start moving under the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.400 
he's going to start moving under the
ground<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.719> put<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:00.930> these<00:01:01.050> spikes

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
ground and put up these spikes

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.520 
ground and put up these spikes
everywhere<00:01:01.739> he<00:01:02.460> goes<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.940> order<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> basically

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
everywhere he goes in order to basically

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
everywhere he goes in order to basically
stop<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.700> spikes<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.360> need<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> run<00:01:07.110> into

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
stop the spikes you need to run into

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.719 
stop the spikes you need to run into
permafrost<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.010> he'll<00:01:08.159> spike<00:01:08.430> under<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
permafrost and he'll spike under the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
permafrost and he'll spike under the
permafrost<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:10.020> hurting<00:01:10.380> anybody<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
permafrost not hurting anybody but that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.920 
permafrost not hurting anybody but that
permafrost<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> shatter<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
permafrost is going to shatter so you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.620 
permafrost is going to shatter so you
want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.799> range<00:01:14.280> dps<00:01:14.520> always<00:01:15.270> dropping

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
want to have a range dps always dropping

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
want to have a range dps always dropping
permafrost<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> ground<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.310> other<00:01:17.460> thing

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
permafrost in the ground the other thing

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
permafrost in the ground the other thing
is<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> ads<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.479> he<00:01:18.720> spawns<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.470> also

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
is to the ads that he spawns do also

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.130 
is to the ads that he spawns do also
tunnel<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:20.909> tunnel<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.390> regen<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> lot

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
tunnel when they tunnel they regen a lot

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
tunnel when they tunnel they regen a lot
of<00:01:22.259> health<00:01:22.439> basically<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.220> come<00:01:23.670> back<00:01:23.850> up<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
of health basically they come back up to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.060 
of health basically they come back up to
full<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.960> take<00:01:25.170> them<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.409> permafrost<00:01:25.740> they

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
full if you take them on permafrost they

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.450 
full if you take them on permafrost they
can't<00:01:26.310> tunnel<00:01:27.350> that's<00:01:28.350> phase<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.159> Phase

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
can't tunnel that's phase one and Phase

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
can't tunnel that's phase one and Phase
two<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> other<00:01:30.990> thing<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.439> tank<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.100> phase

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
two the other thing to tank and phase

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460 
two the other thing to tank and phase
one<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:33.210> sure<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.630> tank<00:01:33.900> him<00:01:34.079> away<00:01:34.290> from

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
one is make sure you tank him away from

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.810 
one is make sure you tank him away from
the<00:01:34.530> raid<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.979> no<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.250> standing<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.640> front

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.330 
freezes everybody in front of him as you
can<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.329> now<00:01:42.329> phase<00:01:42.930> three<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:44.040> lot

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
can see now phase three is a lot

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.859 
can see now phase three is a lot
different<00:01:44.520> from<00:01:44.820> phase<00:01:45.060> 1<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.329> 2<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> wave

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
different from phase 1 and 2 the wave

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
different from phase 1 and 2 the wave
phase<00:01:46.140> 3<00:01:46.500> works<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.130> puts<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.549> an<00:01:47.700> AoE

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
phase 3 works is he puts out an AoE

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.160 
phase 3 works is he puts out an AoE
locust<00:01:48.450> swarm<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.930> usual<00:01:50.210> now<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.570> takes<00:01:51.899> off<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
locust swarm as usual now it takes off a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.740 
locust swarm as usual now it takes off a
percent<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> everybody's<00:01:53.549> effective<00:01:54.540> health

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
percent of everybody's effective health

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.929 
percent of everybody's effective health
so<00:01:55.740> instead<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.159> trying<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.490> keep<00:01:56.640> everybody

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
so instead of trying to keep everybody

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.060 
so instead of trying to keep everybody
at<00:01:57.240> full<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> keep<00:01:58.380> everybody<00:01:58.680> at

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
at full you want to keep everybody at

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
at full you want to keep everybody at
fifty<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> sixty<00:01:59.909> percent<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.450> over<00:02:00.689> heal<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
fifty to sixty percent but over heal the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.539 
fifty to sixty percent but over heal the
crap<00:02:01.259> out<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.649> main<00:02:01.829> tank<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.250> he's<00:02:02.399> going

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
crap out of your main tank is he's going

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.330 
crap out of your main tank is he's going
to<00:02:02.640> start<00:02:02.820> hitting<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> lot<00:02:03.240> harder<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:05.040> reason

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
to start hitting a lot harder the reason

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190 
to start hitting a lot harder the reason
for<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.270> try<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> keep<00:02:06.899> everybody

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
for this is if you try to keep everybody

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.020 
for this is if you try to keep everybody
up<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.829> hundred<00:02:07.890> percent<00:02:08.099> every<00:02:08.520> time<00:02:08.879> you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
up at one hundred percent every time you

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.940 
up at one hundred percent every time you
over<00:02:09.300> he'll<00:02:09.509> he<00:02:09.750> gains<00:02:09.959> health<00:02:10.200> back<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.709> over

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
over he'll he gains health back so over

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.610 
over he'll he gains health back so over
healing<00:02:11.640> 25<00:02:12.090> people<00:02:12.420> you're<00:02:12.540> never<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
healing 25 people you're never going to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.809 
healing 25 people you're never going to
but<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.709> want<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.920> keep<00:02:15.069> your<00:02:15.190> main<00:02:15.370> tank<00:02:15.610> up

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
but you want to keep your main tank up

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.240 
but you want to keep your main tank up
the<00:02:16.450> reason<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.230> keeping<00:02:17.379> them<00:02:17.620> at<00:02:17.920> fifty

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
the reason for keeping them at fifty

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.520 
the reason for keeping them at fifty
sixty<00:02:18.580> percent<00:02:18.819> also<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.660> because<00:02:20.080> since<00:02:20.319> it's

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
sixty percent also is because since it's

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.470 
sixty percent also is because since it's
a<00:02:20.739> percent<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.459> their<00:02:21.580> effective<00:02:22.030> health<00:02:22.239> if

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
a percent of their effective health if

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.089 
a percent of their effective health if
they're<00:02:22.660> at<00:02:22.780> fifty<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.230> sixty<00:02:23.530> percent<00:02:23.680> health

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
they're at fifty to sixty percent health

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.009 
they're at fifty to sixty percent health
they'll<00:02:24.670> end<00:02:24.819> up<00:02:24.910> taking<00:02:25.269> less<00:02:25.480> damage<00:02:25.900> from

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
they'll end up taking less damage from

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.330 
they'll end up taking less damage from
the<00:02:26.080> locusts<00:02:26.440> woman<00:02:26.739> if<00:02:26.860> they<00:02:26.980> were<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.129> hundred

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
the locusts woman if they were a hundred

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.140 
the locusts woman if they were a hundred
percent<00:02:29.099> so<00:02:30.099> once<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.580> hit<00:02:30.700> thirty-five

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
percent so once you hit thirty-five

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.089 
percent so once you hit thirty-five
percent<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:31.720> basically<00:02:32.140> wanted<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.890> save
