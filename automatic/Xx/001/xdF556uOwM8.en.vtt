the<00:00:16.859> hard<00:00:17.460> drive<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.600> memory<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the hard drive and the memory and it's a

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.759 
the hard drive and the memory and it's a
one<00:00:19.859> screw<00:00:20.720> access<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.990> I've<00:00:22.380> never<00:00:22.619> done

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
one screw access and I've never done

one screw access and I've never done
this<00:00:22.890> before<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.340> let's<00:00:23.939> see<00:00:24.180> whether<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.750> can

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
this before so let's see whether we can

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.060 
this before so let's see whether we can
break<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:26.300> am<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.680> take<00:00:28.859> off

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
break in am I going to have to take off

break in am I going to have to take off
the<00:00:29.429> why<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> snap<00:00:30.869> off<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.260> think

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the why is going to snap off I think

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.930 
the why is going to snap off I think
it's<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> snap<00:00:31.890> off<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.640> go

so<00:01:30.780> let's<00:01:31.050> upgrade<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.560> memory<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
so let's upgrade the memory this is the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.840 
so let's upgrade the memory this is the
hard<00:01:34.650> drive<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> looks<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.580> me<00:01:35.820> like

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
hard drive now it looks to me like

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.830 
hard drive now it looks to me like
that's<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> pretty<00:01:36.630> low<00:01:36.960> profile<00:01:37.670> hard<00:01:38.670> drive

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.570 

let's<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.890> pull<00:01:44.190> that<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
let's see if we can just pull that out I

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.120 
let's see if we can just pull that out I
think<00:01:44.820> there's<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.660> two<00:01:45.960> screws<00:01:47.540> here<00:01:50.150> mmm

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
think there's just two screws here mmm

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
think there's just two screws here mmm
got<00:01:53.130> feeling<00:01:53.550> device<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.180> standby<00:01:54.660> Jesus

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
doing standby right this is could screw

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.030 
doing standby right this is could screw
it<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.570> let<00:02:01.229> me<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.470> make<00:02:01.560> sure<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.890> turned

it up let me just make sure it's turned
off<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.670> might<00:02:03.660> just<00:02:03.869> kill<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.290> live<00:02:05.450> okay

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
is off in a few seconds right so let's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.979 
is off in a few seconds right so let's
pop<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.160> memory<00:02:38.580> module<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:41.840> pimp<00:02:42.840> it

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
pop that memory module in there pimp it

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.509 
pop that memory module in there pimp it
out<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.440> not<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.070> be<00:02:44.160> for<00:02:44.340> me<00:02:44.459> this

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
out this is not going to be for me this

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.350 
out this is not going to be for me this
is<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:44.820> my<00:02:44.910> wife<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:46.910> probably<00:02:47.910> won't<00:02:48.120> leave

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
is for my wife I probably won't leave

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.789 
is for my wife I probably won't leave
that<00:02:48.540> memory<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.049> were<00:02:49.110> like<00:02:49.350> let's

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
that memory and they were like let's

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.110 
that memory and they were like let's
face<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.600> think<00:02:51.600> she<00:02:51.720> needs<00:02:51.870> more<00:02:52.019> than<00:02:52.080> four

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
face it I think she needs more than four

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.300 
face it I think she needs more than four
so<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.269> looks<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.480> four<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:56.120> need<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> pick<00:02:57.360> up

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
so it looks like four I need to pick up

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.370 
so it looks like four I need to pick up
screw<00:02:59.310> Joe<00:02:59.489> over<00:02:59.700> here

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.100 

come<00:03:05.950> on<00:03:06.160> with<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.490> twine<00:03:07.360> there<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.600> go

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.750 

alright<00:03:11.110> let's<00:03:11.230> just<00:03:11.260> put<00:03:11.590> those<00:03:14.340> four<00:03:15.340> screws

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
alright let's just put those four screws

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.800 
alright let's just put those four screws
should<00:03:15.790> be<00:03:16.150> fairly<00:03:16.390> easy<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.720> take<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.380> out

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
should be fairly easy to take this out

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.630 
should be fairly easy to take this out
it<00:03:19.810> should<00:03:20.200> just<00:03:20.350> come<00:03:20.830> out<00:03:20.890> probably<00:03:21.430> with

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
it should just come out probably with

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.960 
it should just come out probably with
the<00:03:22.590> connector<00:03:23.590> as<00:03:23.710> well<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.640> I'm<00:03:24.730> just

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
the connector as well and I'm just

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:36.640 
the connector as well and I'm just
probably<00:03:25.360> gonna<00:03:25.630> pull<00:03:25.930> connector<00:03:26.530> off<00:03:30.990> okay

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.009 

uh-huh<00:03:37.930> easy<00:03:38.930> as<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.230> thought<00:03:39.590> maybe<00:03:41.019> okay

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
uh-huh easy as I thought maybe okay

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:51.380 
uh-huh easy as I thought maybe okay
there<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.290> go<00:03:42.379> and<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.680> eight

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.580 

there<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.569> go<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.480> think<00:03:55.720> that's<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.230> seven

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
there you go so I think that's a seven

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.960 
there you go so I think that's a seven
mil<00:03:56.770> hard<00:03:57.190> drive<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.540> makes<00:03:58.990> a<00:03:59.970> that

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
mil hard drive so that makes a that

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.380 
mil hard drive so that makes a that
makes<00:04:01.240> choosing<00:04:01.770> an<00:04:02.770> SSD<00:04:03.160> sleigh<00:04:03.580> slightly

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
makes choosing an SSD sleigh slightly

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.380 
makes choosing an SSD sleigh slightly
harder<00:04:07.080> looking<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.200> see<00:04:08.350> there's<00:04:08.500> any<00:04:08.650> space

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
harder looking to see there's any space

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.180 
harder looking to see there's any space
if<00:04:10.390> anything<00:04:10.780> more<00:04:10.989> probably<00:04:11.500> not<00:04:11.830> you<00:04:12.069> could

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
if anything more probably not you could

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.979 
if anything more probably not you could
probably<00:04:12.459> put<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.000> 9-mil<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.600> there<00:04:13.780> but<00:04:13.930> it

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
probably put a 9-mil in there but it

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.210 
probably put a 9-mil in there but it
will<00:04:14.050> bulge<00:04:14.489> bulge<00:04:15.489> out<00:04:15.850> on<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.209> case

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
will bulge bulge out on that case

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.280 
will bulge bulge out on that case
it's<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.370> Hitachi<00:04:19.260> Hitoshi<00:04:20.260> drive<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.810> anyway

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
it's a Hitachi Hitoshi drive so anyway

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.050 
it's a Hitachi Hitoshi drive so anyway
easy<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.919> take<00:04:24.130> out<00:04:25.080> easy<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.410> put<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:27.060> and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
easy to take out easy to put in and

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:38.840 
easy to take out easy to put in and
watch<00:04:28.270> me<00:04:29.340> brick<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:33.930> an<00:04:34.930> ultrabook<00:04:35.410> live<00:04:36.180> yeah

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
watch me brick a an ultrabook live yeah

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.190 
watch me brick a an ultrabook live yeah
I'll<00:04:39.850> just<00:04:39.910> pop<00:04:40.240> em<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.660> just<00:04:40.690> want<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:40.990> see<00:04:41.110> if

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
I'll just pop em I just want to see if

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.710 
I'll just pop em I just want to see if
that<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.770> memory<00:04:42.070> module<00:04:42.390> works<00:04:43.390> I<00:04:43.660> think

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
that that memory module works I think

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.159 
that that memory module works I think
it's<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.110> -<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:46.090> might<00:04:46.270> even<00:04:46.390> be<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.600> four<00:04:47.020> gig

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
it's a - it might even be a four gig

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.450 
it's a - it might even be a four gig
memory<00:04:47.350> module<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.860> have<00:04:48.010> there<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.250> should

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
memory module I have there so it should

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.159 
memory module I have there so it should
be<00:04:51.490> up<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.790> eight<00:04:51.940> gigs<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.419> memory<00:04:52.450> once<00:04:52.990> we've

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
be up to eight gigs of memory once we've

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.550 
be up to eight gigs of memory once we've
got<00:04:53.320> that<00:04:54.030> up<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.240> running<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:56.050> quickly<00:04:56.500> just

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
got that up and running so quickly just

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.640 
got that up and running so quickly just
pop<00:04:56.860> these<00:04:56.979> in<00:04:59.130> and<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:01.060> fourth<00:05:01.419> one<00:05:01.660> there<00:05:01.930> so

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.779 

for<00:05:05.650> those<00:05:05.770> of<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.100> watching<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.460> youtube

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
for those of you the watching on youtube

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.370 
for those of you the watching on youtube
thinking<00:05:07.180> about<00:05:07.390> upgrading<00:05:07.510> ultrabooks

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
thinking about upgrading ultrabooks

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.680 
thinking about upgrading ultrabooks
there's<00:05:08.650> not<00:05:08.770> many<00:05:08.950> of<00:05:09.130> them<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.340> have<00:05:09.490> these

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
there's not many of them that have these

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.650 
there's not many of them that have these
access<00:05:10.690> ports<00:05:11.200> so<00:05:11.380> it's<00:05:11.530> really<00:05:11.710> nice<00:05:11.950> that

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
access ports so it's really nice that

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.330 
access ports so it's really nice that
Samsung<00:05:13.660> have<00:05:13.810> provided<00:05:14.229> that<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:14.800> don't

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
Samsung have provided that and I don't

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.570 
Samsung have provided that and I don't
think<00:05:15.490> that's<00:05:15.910> going<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.330> invalidate<00:05:16.870> any

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
think that's going to invalidate any

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.430 
think that's going to invalidate any
warranty<00:05:18.580> that's<00:05:18.910> oh<00:05:19.180> there<00:05:19.750> we<00:05:19.930> go<00:05:19.960> that

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
warranty that's oh there we go that

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.730 
warranty that's oh there we go that

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
looks across the bottom there nice and

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.370 
looks across the bottom there nice and
easily<00:05:23.740> he<00:05:24.100> said<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:25.479> then<00:05:25.960> there's<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.229> one

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
easily he said and then there's the one

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.129
