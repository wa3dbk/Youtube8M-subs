I think fun for teachers is unique in
that<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.149> recognizes<00:01:26.079> a<00:01:26.289> key<00:01:26.799> resource<00:01:27.100> in

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
that it recognizes a key resource in

that it recognizes a key resource in
education<00:01:28.210> no<00:01:28.840> matter<00:01:29.020> what<00:01:29.439> else<00:01:29.619> is
