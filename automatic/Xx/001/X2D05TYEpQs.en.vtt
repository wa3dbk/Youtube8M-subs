00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
now I don't have this so I was quite

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.099 
now I don't have this so I was quite
pleased<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> see<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.000> as<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.690> looked<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:01.020> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
pleased to see one and as I looked at it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.180 
pleased to see one and as I looked at it
I<00:01:01.170> thought<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.590> was<00:01:01.680> something<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.070> bit

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
I thought there was something a bit

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.299 
I thought there was something a bit
wrong<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:04.500> worthy<00:01:04.650> jazz

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
wrong and the was the thing worthy jazz

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
wrong and the was the thing worthy jazz
worse<00:01:05.549> figures<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.479> there's<00:01:06.689> that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
worse figures is because there's that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.740 
worse figures is because there's that
many<00:01:06.930> things<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.830> articulation<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.939> they

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
many things of articulation and they

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
many things of articulation and they
tend<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> twist<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.890> turn<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.310> easily

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
tend to twist and turn really easily

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.039 
tend to twist and turn really easily
sometimes<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.720> put<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
sometimes when they get put in the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.070 
sometimes when they get put in the
machine<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.619> poses<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.250> slightly<00:01:14.549> different

of these issues already the reason why i
got<00:02:15.420> them<00:02:15.630> was<00:02:15.840> simply<00:02:16.230> because<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> free

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830

one<00:02:18.900> somewhere<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.769> not<00:02:19.920> as<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.640> good

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
one somewhere but it's not as in good

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.390 
one somewhere but it's not as in good
condition<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:21.780> actually<00:02:22.650> loose<00:02:22.860> from<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
condition it's actually loose from the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.570 
condition it's actually loose from the
comic<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:24.690> why<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> got<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.230> one<00:02:25.580> the

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.939 
how successful they're going to be with
this<00:05:51.310> because<00:05:51.960> mike<00:05:52.960> has<00:05:53.289> had<00:05:53.470> a<00:05:53.530> game<00:05:53.770> out

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
this because mike has had a game out

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.909 
this because mike has had a game out
recently<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.909> it<00:05:55.750> didn't<00:05:56.139> sell<00:05:56.380> that<00:05:56.590> great

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
recently and it didn't sell that great

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.820 
recently and it didn't sell that great
so<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.520> wish<00:05:57.819> them<00:05:58.030> luck<00:05:58.210> with<00:05:58.419> it<00:05:58.569> but<00:05:58.840> I<00:05:59.080> don't

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
so I wish them luck with it but I don't

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.290 
so I wish them luck with it but I don't
know<00:06:00.099> I<00:06:00.130> think<00:06:00.310> they<00:06:00.580> might<00:06:00.729> look<00:06:00.880> at<00:06:01.060> how

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
know I think they might look at how

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.450 
know I think they might look at how
commercially<00:06:02.050> viable<00:06:02.259> it<00:06:02.650> isn't<00:06:02.979> decided

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
commercially viable it isn't decided

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.309 
commercially viable it isn't decided
based<00:06:03.669> on<00:06:03.880> that<00:06:04.120> more<00:06:04.389> than<00:06:04.419> actual<00:06:04.990> demand

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
based on that more than actual demand

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.320 
based on that more than actual demand
but<00:06:06.039> I<00:06:06.069> hope<00:06:06.280> it<00:06:06.460> does<00:06:06.610> come<00:06:06.819> out<00:06:06.909> and<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:07.150> hoping

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
but I hope it does come out and I hoping

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.050 
but I hope it does come out and I hoping
