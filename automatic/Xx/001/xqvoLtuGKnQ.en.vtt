00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.000
 Mr. Uemura 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 It is today 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.660
 I hope to speak lighter 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.299
 Though it is met way 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.589
 Basically no editorial department 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.630
 Without adding a TV-like effect 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.339
 With the concept of strongly expecting itt's diary before 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.189
 I aim every day 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.289
 Right 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.300
 Where it has fallen 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
 I will not do Ghibli again 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.800
 Somehow in summer I also have an opinion on this blog 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.690
 I was angry when I exchanged it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 Did you attend 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.880
 With the Munakata of the policy work manager 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.070
 General manager also 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.030
 Director of Overseas Business 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.140
 The comedy world is the business manager Takeda 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.810
 Then it was 1-3 in charge of the Ghibli Museum Library 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.220
 As some opinions came out 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.220
 Introduce 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 It is this blog, but I am totally responsible 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.070
 More practice and stable coverage 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 I'm telling you, but no character is out 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.040
 Though there was experience 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.400
 Well about this 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.210
 Concept 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.210
 I want to keep my current style but I will keep it 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.950
 little by little 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.670
 Consciously 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.380
 I can tell you 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 I wanted to say that I wanted to go international 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.229
 Because there was little theme song going out 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.740
 It is urgent 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.960
 Well after next week 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.090
 Meet each company or person in charge 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.600
 I want to do my best to convey various information 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.980
 I think 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.830
 then 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.820
 squid's 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.830
 Hunsu who talked that it was straight and expensive 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.480
 There is also a story that it is not good but 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.250
 It must be Mr. Banda 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.350
 Talk light track 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.190
 I want to make it feel like I felt that length 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.569
 is 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.529
 then 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.529
 The clothes I'm wearing 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.999
 dic captain 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.099
 It was pointed out that you can win the brightness easily 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.599
 About this 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.430
 As you go, the more you look high, the more you mind 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.189
 I want to make a bright sunny team 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.499
 is 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.109
 3 blogs about portability 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:36.829
 It was raw
