00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
so this is basically it like I said I'm

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.030 
so this is basically it like I said I'm
just<00:00:07.109> using<00:00:07.260> a<00:00:07.410> four<00:00:07.590> and<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.710> half<00:00:07.770> inch

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
just using a four and a half inch

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.390 
just using a four and a half inch
grinder<00:00:08.460> I'm<00:00:09.000> using<00:00:09.330> just<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.770> composite

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
grinder I'm using just a composite

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.439 
grinder I'm using just a composite
grinding<00:00:11.820> wheel<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:13.350> to<00:00:13.469> use<00:00:13.619> these<00:00:13.799> on

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:14.449 
grinding wheel I like to use these on

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.420 
grinding wheel I like to use these on
thicker<00:00:15.449> materials<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.529> think<00:00:17.340> they

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
thicker materials you I think they

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.550 
thicker materials you I think they
remove<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> lot<00:00:18.029> more<00:00:18.210> material<00:00:18.690> faster<00:00:18.930> than

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
remove a lot more material faster than

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.830 
remove a lot more material faster than
the<00:00:19.800> flap<00:00:20.310> wheels<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.120> like<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> flap

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the flap wheels I do like the flap

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.070 
the flap wheels I do like the flap
wheels<00:00:22.110> a<00:00:22.200> lot<00:00:22.380> especially<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.520> shaping<00:00:24.080> but

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
wheels a lot especially for shaping but

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.650 
wheels a lot especially for shaping but
for<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.710> know<00:00:25.800> grinding<00:00:26.280> rivets<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:26.760> like

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
for you know grinding rivets off like

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.290 
for you know grinding rivets off like
over<00:00:27.930> there<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.800> find<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:29.640> composite<00:00:30.150> wheels

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
over there I find these composite wheels

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.350 
over there I find these composite wheels
just<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> fastest<00:00:31.289> way<00:00:31.440> to<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.890> and

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
just to be the fastest way to do it and

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.069 
just to be the fastest way to do it and
of<00:00:33.360> course<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:34.680> protection<00:00:35.420> I've<00:00:36.420> moved<00:00:36.900> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
of course that protection I've moved to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.740 
of course that protection I've moved to
these<00:00:37.230> fully<00:00:37.890> enclosed<00:00:38.400> goggles<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.720> I

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
always well I didn't always I learned

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.770 
always well I didn't always I learned
the<00:00:42.390> hard<00:00:42.540> way

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the hard way

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.900 
the hard way
I<00:00:42.960> got<00:00:43.829> metal<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.130> my<00:00:44.310> eye<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.470> did<00:00:46.710> wear

I have chisels but I don't have a
pneumatic<00:02:17.600> pneumatic<00:02:18.600> chisel<00:02:18.900> gun<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.060> I've

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
pneumatic pneumatic chisel gun so I've

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.410 
pneumatic pneumatic chisel gun so I've
got<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:21.420> long<00:02:22.580> just<00:02:23.580> kind<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.940> flat<00:02:24.150> blade

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
got this long just kind of flat blade

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
got this long just kind of flat blade
chisel<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.440> also<00:02:26.100> brought<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.640> punch

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
chisel I also brought a little punch

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.390 
chisel I also brought a little punch
this<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> little<00:02:29.280> bit

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
this is going to be a little bit

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.090 
this is going to be a little bit
difficult<00:02:29.610> because<00:02:29.940> really<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.420> only<00:02:30.600> two

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
difficult because really the only two

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.530 
difficult because really the only two
rivets<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.400> be<00:02:32.550> able<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
rivets that I be able to get to are the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.210 
rivets that I be able to get to are the
ones<00:02:33.720> here<00:02:34.110> towards<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.770> outside<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
ones here towards the outside of the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.610 
ones here towards the outside of the
frame<00:02:35.490> rail<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:36.600> too<00:02:36.660> far<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.380> this

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
frame rail if I go too far in like this

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.890 
frame rail if I go too far in like this
it's<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.940> not<00:02:39.180> gonna<00:02:39.270> do<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> whole<00:02:39.690> lot<00:02:39.870> of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
it's really not gonna do a whole lot of

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.720 
it's really not gonna do a whole lot of
good<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:41.040> probably<00:02:41.190> use<00:02:41.340> them<00:02:41.550> like

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
good so I can probably use them like

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.949 
good so I can probably use them like
this<00:02:42.380> let<00:02:43.380> me<00:02:43.470> pan<00:02:44.100> back<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> little<00:02:44.730> bit

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
this let me pan back here a little bit

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.600 
this let me pan back here a little bit
and<00:02:45.959> get<00:02:46.170> these<00:02:46.350> two<00:02:46.590> sort<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.100> inner<00:02:47.280> ones

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
and get these two sort of inner ones

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
and get these two sort of inner ones
this<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:47.880> there's<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.840> differential<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.010> it's

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
this is there's the differential so it's

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.150 
this is there's the differential so it's
the<00:02:50.220> inside<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> frame<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:52.650> use<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
the inside of the frame and then use the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.430 
the inside of the frame and then use the
flat<00:02:53.940> blade<00:02:54.120> chisel<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:55.170> get<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.190> between<00:02:57.440> this

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
flat blade chisel to get in between this

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.250 
flat blade chisel to get in between this
bracket<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.580> bump<00:02:59.850> stop<00:03:00.060> bracket<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.959> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
bracket this bump stop bracket and the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.410 
bracket this bump stop bracket and the
frame<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.010> let<00:03:02.519> me<00:03:02.610> going<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.150> we'll<00:03:03.299> see

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
frame so let me going on that we'll see

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:19.100 
frame so let me going on that we'll see
what<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.570> can<00:03:03.690> do<00:03:17.840> well<00:03:18.840> we're<00:03:18.989> getting

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
what we can do well we're getting

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.170 
what we can do well we're getting
somewhere

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
somewhere

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.960 
somewhere

while I shoot more video well as soon as
I<00:03:30.239> stopped<00:03:30.480> filming<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.400> got<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.519> thing<00:03:32.730> off

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
I stopped filming I got the thing off

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.850 
I stopped filming I got the thing off
and<00:03:33.540> all<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.690> really<00:03:33.930> did<00:03:34.170> was<00:03:34.230> take<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.650> hammer

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
and all I really did was take the hammer

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.960 
and all I really did was take the hammer
the<00:03:35.580> chisel<00:03:36.180> helped<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:37.670> this<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.850> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
the chisel helped but this is the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.120 
the chisel helped but this is the
outside<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.709> fits<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.890> here<00:03:41.570> like<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:43.130> so

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
outside this fits on here like that so

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.000 
outside this fits on here like that so
all<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> did<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> took<00:03:45.600> my<00:03:45.840> hammer<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.799> just

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
all I did so I took my hammer and I just

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.100 
all I did so I took my hammer and I just
banged<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.640> here<00:03:48.450> where<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.660> could<00:03:48.840> get<00:03:48.959> to

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
banged on it here where I could get to

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.050 
banged on it here where I could get to
it<00:03:49.290> was<00:03:49.350> kind<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.680> outside<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.670> frame<00:03:50.880> rail

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
it was kind of outside of the frame rail

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.690 
it was kind of outside of the frame rail
a<00:03:51.150> little<00:03:51.360> bit<00:03:51.500> just<00:03:52.500> smacked<00:03:52.830> on<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.340> few

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
a little bit just smacked on it a few

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.289 
a little bit just smacked on it a few
times<00:03:53.880> here<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.390> few<00:03:55.380> times<00:03:55.620> here<00:03:56.150> over<00:03:57.150> here

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
times here a few times here over here

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.970 
times here a few times here over here
again<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.780> then<00:03:58.230> poof<00:03:58.410> just<00:03:58.440> popped<00:03:58.889> right

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
again and then poof just popped right

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.670 
again and then poof just popped right
off<00:03:59.100> so<00:04:00.169> unfortunately<00:04:01.169> I<00:04:01.200> didn't<00:04:01.410> get<00:04:01.500> that

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
off so unfortunately I didn't get that

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.429 
off so unfortunately I didn't get that
film<00:04:02.010> but<00:04:03.109> there's<00:04:04.109> your<00:04:04.290> piece<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:06.319> so<00:04:07.319> now

we're ready to move on and do the other

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:09.789 
we're ready to move on and do the other
side

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
side

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.649 
side
all<00:04:10.799> right<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.189> here<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:11.939> are<00:04:11.969> on<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.569> other

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
all right so here we are on the other

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.660 
all right so here we are on the other
side<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.079> truck<00:04:13.319> this<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> passenger
