okay also to give us a little bit extra
working<00:00:17.369> room<00:00:17.670> we're<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> just

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
working room we're going to just

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.480 
working room we're going to just
disconnect<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.350> exhausted<00:00:19.800> digs<00:00:19.980> two<00:00:20.160> bolts

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
disconnect it exhausted digs two bolts

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.769 
disconnect it exhausted digs two bolts
right<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:21.600> give<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> little

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
right here just give a little

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.439 
right here just give a little
flexibility<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.769> room<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> work<00:00:29.449> all

flexibility so we have room to work all
right<00:00:30.570> next<00:00:30.720> we'll<00:00:30.929> install<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.349> hardware

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
right next we'll install our hardware

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.470 
right next we'll install our hardware
for<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:31.980> hole<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.210> sometimes<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.360> this

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
for this hole here sometimes if this

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.910 
for this hole here sometimes if this
hole<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:33.840> big<00:00:34.020> enough<00:00:34.050> there's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> bigger

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
hole is not big enough there's a bigger

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
hole is not big enough there's a bigger
access<00:00:35.309> hole<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.730> further<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> frame

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
access hole up further up in the frame

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
access hole up further up in the frame
you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.780> pull<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.140> through<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.250> case

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you can pull it through but in this case

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.680 
you can pull it through but in this case
we<00:00:38.610> actually<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.940> enough<00:00:39.090> room<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.570> do

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we actually have enough room to just do

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.740 
we actually have enough room to just do
everything<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.140> spot

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.570 

put<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.840> in<00:00:44.900> a<00:00:44.930> hole<00:00:45.050> we're<00:00:45.200> going<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.440> use<00:00:45.650> push

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
put it in a hole we're going to use push

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.350 
put it in a hole we're going to use push
it<00:00:46.730> up<00:00:46.820> in<00:00:46.970> there<00:00:47.230> put<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.260> block<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:48.710> there<00:00:49.360> and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
it up in there put a block in there and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.010 
it up in there put a block in there and
then<00:00:50.450> pull<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:50.690> back<00:00:50.900> through<00:00:51.200> and<00:00:52.750> this<00:00:53.750> point

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
then pull it back through and this point

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.210 
then pull it back through and this point
you<00:00:54.140> get<00:00:54.200> your<00:00:54.350> hardware<00:00:54.590> installed<00:00:54.980> we<00:00:55.190> can

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
you get your hardware installed we can

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.130 
you get your hardware installed we can
go<00:00:55.370> ahead<00:00:55.490> lift<00:00:56.240> the<00:00:56.300> hitch<00:00:56.450> in<00:00:56.570> position<00:00:56.690> and

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
go ahead lift the hitch in position and

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.000 
go ahead lift the hitch in position and
hang<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.530> by<00:00:57.650> those<00:00:57.830> bolts<00:00:58.130> we<00:00:58.220> just<00:00:58.430> installed

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.990 

now<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:04.100> want<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.280> leave<00:01:04.370> your<00:01:04.460> hardware

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
now you want to leave your hardware

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.210 
now you want to leave your hardware
loose<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.050> can<00:01:06.200> move<00:01:06.350> pitch<00:01:06.770> around<00:01:07.010> as

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
loose so you can move pitch around as

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.800 
loose so you can move pitch around as
needed<00:01:07.250> thread<00:01:07.940> into<00:01:08.060> your<00:01:08.330> bolts<00:01:08.570> right<00:01:08.750> here

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
needed thread into your bolts right here

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.750 
needed thread into your bolts right here
the<00:01:09.410> Jeep<00:01:09.590> itself<00:01:09.950> depending<00:01:10.280> on<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.430> year

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
the Jeep itself depending on a year

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.250 
the Jeep itself depending on a year
we'll<00:01:11.000> actually<00:01:11.060> have<00:01:11.300> different<00:01:11.780> bolts<00:01:12.140> that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
we'll actually have different bolts that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.900 
we'll actually have different bolts that
are<00:01:12.320> used<00:01:12.620> so<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.100> hardware<00:01:13.400> comes<00:01:13.730> with<00:01:13.850> a

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
are used so the hardware comes with a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.670 
are used so the hardware comes with a
different<00:01:14.390> bolts<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.260> best<00:01:15.500> way<00:01:15.560> to

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
different bolts and the best way to

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.650 
different bolts and the best way to
match<00:01:15.950> up<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.160> bolt<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.610> make<00:01:16.760> sure<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.570> you

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
match up the bolt to make sure that you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.150 
match up the bolt to make sure that you
have<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.810> right<00:01:17.990> one<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.320> by<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.680> size<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
have the right one is by the size of the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.219 
have the right one is by the size of the
bolts<00:01:19.490> itself<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:20.300> beat<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> more<00:01:20.810> accurate<00:01:20.990> way

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
bolts itself to beat a more accurate way

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.430 
bolts itself to beat a more accurate way
is<00:01:21.800> that<00:01:22.600> if<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.720> put<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.050> threads<00:01:24.290> together

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
is that if you put the threads together

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.530 
is that if you put the threads together
and<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.860> mesh<00:01:25.130> evenly<00:01:25.640> then<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.180> know<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:26.390> have

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
and a mesh evenly then you know you have

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.410 
and a mesh evenly then you know you have
the<00:01:26.600> right<00:01:26.750> bolt

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.240 

Calla<00:01:35.420> bolts<00:01:35.810> started<00:01:35.990> we<00:01:36.200> go<00:01:36.380> ahead<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:36.680> snug

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
Calla bolts started we go ahead and snug

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.680 
Calla bolts started we go ahead and snug
them<00:01:37.400> down<00:01:40.060> now<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.120> can<00:01:41.240> go<00:01:41.300> ahead<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.450> torque

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
them down now we can go ahead and torque

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.240 
them down now we can go ahead and torque
the<00:01:41.810> bolts<00:01:41.930> down<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.440> specified<00:01:42.860> setting

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
the bolts down to the specified setting

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:52.480 
the bolts down to the specified setting
in<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.000> instructions<00:01:50.890> our<00:01:51.890> next<00:01:52.070> step<00:01:52.310> after
