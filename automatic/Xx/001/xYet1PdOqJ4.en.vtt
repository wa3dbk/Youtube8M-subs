mop punch I guess I'm guessing maybe one
of<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.810> reasons<00:05:15.870> why<00:05:16.350> Harry<00:05:16.800> Yama<00:05:17.070> is<00:05:17.370> you<00:05:18.000> you

picking<00:05:18.540> on<00:05:18.600> civil<00:05:19.140> use<00:05:19.410> because<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:20.010> guess

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
picking on civil use because I guess

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.820 
picking on civil use because I guess
it's<00:05:20.340> lacking<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:21.090> decent<00:05:21.900> mood<00:05:22.020> pool<00:05:22.290> not<00:05:22.680> to
