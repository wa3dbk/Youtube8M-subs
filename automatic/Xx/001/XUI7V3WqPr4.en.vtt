00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.400
 today we are investigating addiction 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.280
 rotation speed 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.410
 gear motor-wheels volta bikes with 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.200
 rated voltage 24 volts 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.900
 350 watts of voltage 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 feed to whom only forest 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.760
 installed on the stand connected 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.710
 regular controller with voltage 24 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.570
 volts 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.939
 parallel connected multimeter which 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.590
 shows the voltage supplied from 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.620
 26 and 2 tenths volts batteries 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.410
 surface motor wheel glued 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.260
 insulating tape to black background 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 brilliant mark gave a landmark 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.570
 optical tachometer for correct 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.039
 measurement of speed we run pen 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.520
 gas motor wheel 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.610
 and bring to the label the optical tachometer 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.660
 he will show how many turns in the staff 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.620
 mode gives out 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:07.310
 This is the motor-wheel of the NATO fleet to the metro we 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.409
 see about 320 7 revolutions per minute 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.119
 if you count and the speed of kilometers 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 per hour by bike 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.939
 then with a rim of 26 inches will 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.720
 maximum speed of about 32 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.720
 kilometer per hour 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.540
 continue to explore addictions 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.810
 gear wheel rotation speeds 24 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.050
 350 watt volts bikes from 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.479
 supply voltage connected 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.810
 controller with a rated voltage of 36 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.180
 volt on multimeter we see voltage 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.280
 batteries thirty thirty eight and 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.820
 nine thirty nine volts run 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.500
 motor wheel using the throttle and 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.009
 bring to him the optical tachometer 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.970
 which will show how many turns will issue 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.970
 motor wheel 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.590
 499 rpm produces motor-wheel 24 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.580
 volts at a voltage of 36 volts this 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.160
 means that the speed of the electric bike 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.140
 with 26 inch wheels 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.769
 make up about forty nine 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.630
 kilometers an hour 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.620
 now to the gearbox on the flour forest volt both 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.410
 x 24 volts 350 watts we connected 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.320
 controller with rated voltage 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.230
 48 volt multimeter shows 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.290
 battery voltage 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.390
 53.9 volts we start the motor wheel with 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.300
 using the throttle and take readings 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.130
 speed optical tachometer 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.840
 we see that with increasing voltage 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.660
 power supply 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.950
 further increase in revolutions up to 689 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.520
 turnover per minute 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.580
 if you translate it to speed who 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.560
 electric bike with wheels diameter 26 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.050
 inches 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.420
 would reach a speed of 68 kilometers per hour 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.420
 but the truth is idling without load 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.130
 what speed will be under load 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.770
 tests continue to explore 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.270
 rotation speed dependence 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.980
 gear motor wheel 24 volt 350 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.360
 watts from the supply voltage 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.360
 connected controller with nominal 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.270
 voltage of 60 volts on the multimeter we 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:40.650
 see battery voltage 60 9.1 volts 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.650
 start the motor wheel handle gas 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.150
 on optical 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.780
 except when we see the rotation speed of 855 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.780
 turnover per minute
