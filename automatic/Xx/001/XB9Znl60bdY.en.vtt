let's<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.860> some<00:00:50.010> articulation<00:00:50.809> head<00:00:51.840> first

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
let's get some articulation head first

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
let's get some articulation head first
of<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:53.030> 360<00:00:54.030> oh<00:00:55.039> look<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> do

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
of all 360 oh look at that when you do

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.090 
of all 360 oh look at that when you do
it<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> bulges<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> I

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
it it kind of bulges out like that so I

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.229 
it it kind of bulges out like that so I
could<00:01:02.100> probably<00:01:02.340> pop<00:01:02.579> his<00:01:02.760> head<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
could probably pop his head out but I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
could probably pop his head out but I
don't<00:01:03.329> know<00:01:03.480> how<00:01:03.690> easy<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.500> back<00:01:04.650> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
don't know how easy it be to get back in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
don't know how easy it be to get back in
so<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.580> then<00:01:08.939> you've<00:01:09.119> got<00:01:09.270> these<00:01:09.390> feet<00:01:09.720> but

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so and then you've got these feet but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
so and then you've got these feet but
you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.460> guess<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you can just kind of do that I guess you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.170 
you can just kind of do that I guess you
could<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:13.189> try<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> force<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.760> rotation<00:01:15.150> like

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
could like try to force a rotation like

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.270 
could like try to force a rotation like
that<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> bend<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> feet

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that and then you have to bend the feet

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
that and then you have to bend the feet
to<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.549> them<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.790> 360<00:01:18.320> but<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.560> don't

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
to get them to go 360 but I really don't

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.899 
to get them to go 360 but I really don't
recommend<00:01:19.799> doing<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.490> cuz<00:01:20.640> you'll<00:01:20.790> get

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
recommend doing that cuz you'll get

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
recommend doing that cuz you'll get
paint<00:01:21.150> scuffs<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.960> bent<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.439> shape<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
paint scuffs and bent out of shape and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
paint scuffs and bent out of shape and
all<00:01:23.340> kinds<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.360> junk<00:01:26.119> that's<00:01:27.119> articulation

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
all kinds of junk that's articulation

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.190 
all kinds of junk that's articulation
paint<00:01:28.049> job<00:01:28.320> red<00:01:28.829> fire<00:01:29.460> Rodin<00:01:29.909> yeah<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:31.020> how

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
paint job red fire Rodin yeah that's how

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.240 
paint job red fire Rodin yeah that's how
you<00:01:31.259> tell<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.560> difference

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you tell the difference

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.359 
you tell the difference
ones<00:01:32.880> red<00:01:33.180> ones<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:35.040> real<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:36.119> he's<00:01:36.600> red

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
ones red ones not for real so he's red

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.520 
ones red ones not for real so he's red
and<00:01:38.369> that's<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:41.630> well<00:01:42.630> he's<00:01:43.049> obviously<00:01:43.170> more

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and that's it well he's obviously more

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.749 
and that's it well he's obviously more
than<00:01:43.590> red<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
than red I'm just just it for the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.219 
than red I'm just just it for the
difference<00:01:45.180> other<00:01:45.479> than<00:01:45.570> he<00:01:45.750> shoots<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.049> beam

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
difference other than he shoots the beam

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.270 
difference other than he shoots the beam

like<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.320> point<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.650> out<00:04:50.710> yeah<00:04:51.370> that's<00:04:52.180> the

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
like to point that out yeah that's the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.550 
like to point that out yeah that's the
only<00:04:52.360> reason<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.750> paired<00:04:52.990> him<00:04:53.050> with<00:04:53.140> it<00:04:53.350> was<00:04:53.440> so

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
only reason I paired him with it was so

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.210 
only reason I paired him with it was so
I<00:04:53.590> could<00:04:53.680> say<00:04:53.920> I<00:04:53.950> have<00:04:54.160> that<00:04:54.280> book<00:04:57.990> no<00:04:59.220> just

I could say I have that book no just
fine<00:05:00.790> I<00:05:00.820> guess<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.600> mean<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.960> door<00:05:02.140> should<00:05:02.350> be

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
fine I guess I mean the door should be

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.100 
fine I guess I mean the door should be
bigger<00:05:02.740> like<00:05:03.610> this<00:05:04.000> for<00:05:04.690> real

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
bigger like this for real

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.900 
bigger like this for real
i<00:05:05.140> watch<00:05:05.800> consumers<00:05:06.220> at<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.370> door<00:05:06.580> last<00:05:06.790> night

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
he's a pretty big dude but yeah I guess

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.170

yeah<00:05:15.970> whatever<00:05:16.710> did<00:05:17.710> someone<00:05:17.890> else<00:05:18.180> don't

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
yeah whatever did someone else don't

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.660 
yeah whatever did someone else don't
miss<00:05:19.390> out<00:05:19.630> SpaceGodzilla<00:05:20.530> or<00:05:21.340> as<00:05:21.430> I<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.520> to

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
call him candy corn space Godzilla

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.060 
call him candy corn space Godzilla
because<00:05:25.420> his<00:05:26.020> crystals<00:05:26.530> on<00:05:26.650> his<00:05:26.740> shoulders

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
because his crystals on his shoulders

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.500
