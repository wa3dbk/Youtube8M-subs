budget<00:00:34.500> games<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.040> guess<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.760> was

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
budget games I guess because this was

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.610 
budget games I guess because this was
only<00:00:36.120> 40<00:00:36.480> dollars<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:36.930> Gamestop<00:00:38.180> yeah<00:00:39.180> yeah
