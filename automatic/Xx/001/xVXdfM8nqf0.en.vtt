in the toolbox then I'll add a numeric

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.840 
in the toolbox then I'll add a numeric
stepper<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.549> that's<00:01:30.299> from<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> controls

with<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:41.880> layout<00:01:42.240> which<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.659> why<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.020> move

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
with also layout which is why it's move

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.200 
with also layout which is why it's move
the<00:01:43.470> button<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.860> top<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:45.119> the

so<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.570> change<00:03:18.870> its<00:03:19.020> I<00:03:19.140> d2f<00:03:19.620> label<00:03:21.260> for<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so I change its I d2f label for the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.770 
so I change its I d2f label for the
Fahrenheit<00:03:22.770> value<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.340> also<00:03:24.180> set<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> few

properties for the numeric stepper first

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.410 
properties for the numeric stepper first
I've<00:03:27.810> change<00:03:28.350> its<00:03:28.560> ID<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:29.310> see<00:03:29.580> stepper<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
I've change its ID to see stepper this

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.170 
I've change its ID to see stepper this
is<00:03:30.570> where<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.020> centigrade<00:03:32.030> value<00:03:33.030> will<00:03:33.150> be

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.710 
is where the centigrade value will be
displayed<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.550> I'll<00:03:35.550> make<00:03:35.730> its<00:03:35.940> maximum<00:03:36.540> and

things I do I can change the grid size

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.470 
things I do I can change the grid size
by<00:04:27.540> making<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.960> selection<00:04:28.230> from<00:04:28.530> here<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.480> I

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
by making a selection from here and I

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.270 
by making a selection from here and I
can<00:04:30.930> just<00:04:30.960> turn<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.380> off<00:04:31.470> again<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:31.980> don't<00:04:32.100> need

can just turn it off again we don't need

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.770 
can just turn it off again we don't need
it<00:04:32.400> for<00:04:32.580> now<00:04:32.670> so<00:04:32.820> I'm<00:04:32.910> going<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.150> turn<00:04:33.270> off<00:04:33.450> the

it for now so I'm going to turn off the

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.410 
it for now so I'm going to turn off the
grid<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.110> turn<00:04:34.800> off<00:04:34.950> snapping<00:04:35.280> there<00:04:36.120> are<00:04:36.270> a

design itself and that's what I'm going

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.300 
design itself and that's what I'm going
to<00:05:11.610> do<00:05:11.790> here<00:05:12.560> so<00:05:13.560> when<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.710> double-click<00:05:13.890> it

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310

this<00:05:14.490> creates<00:05:14.940> an<00:05:15.150> empty<00:05:15.420> method<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.230> all<00:05:16.350> I

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
this creates an empty method and all I

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.960 
this creates an empty method and all I
have<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.710> do<00:05:16.830> now<00:05:17.010> is<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.790> write<00:05:17.940> some<00:05:18.120> code

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
have to do now is to write some code

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.670 
have to do now is to write some code
okay<00:05:20.970> so<00:05:21.030> I'm<00:05:21.240> going<00:05:21.390> to<00:05:21.419> start<00:05:21.630> writing<00:05:22.260> the

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
okay so I'm going to start writing the

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.580 
okay so I'm going to start writing the
code<00:05:23.280> to<00:05:23.580> take<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.330> finite<00:05:25.080> value<00:05:25.410> and

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
code to take the finite value and

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.370 
code to take the finite value and
convert<00:05:26.070> it<00:05:26.100> into<00:05:26.930> sorry<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.020> centigrade

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
convert it into sorry the centigrade

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.360 
convert it into sorry the centigrade
volume<00:05:28.680> converted<00:05:29.070> into<00:05:29.250> Fahrenheit<00:05:30.320> so

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
volume converted into Fahrenheit so

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.580 
volume converted into Fahrenheit so
inside<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.460> method<00:05:32.790> i<00:05:32.940> start<00:05:33.390> typing<00:05:33.810> away

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
inside the method i start typing away

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.230 
inside the method i start typing away
and<00:05:34.950> as<00:05:35.040> soon<00:05:35.160> as<00:05:35.250> i<00:05:35.340> start<00:05:35.610> typing<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:36.090> see

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
and as soon as i start typing you see

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.880 
and as soon as i start typing you see
the<00:05:36.360> intellisense<00:05:36.840> system<00:05:37.440> goes<00:05:37.620> into

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
the intellisense system goes into

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.250 
the intellisense system goes into

as<00:06:20.460> I've<00:06:21.390> been<00:06:21.419> doing<00:06:21.750> this<00:06:21.870> I<00:06:22.050> notice<00:06:22.350> that<00:06:22.440> my

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
as I've been doing this I notice that my

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.940 
as I've been doing this I notice that my
code<00:06:23.190> formatting<00:06:23.760> is<00:06:23.850> a<00:06:23.880> bit<00:06:24.030> inconsistent

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
code formatting is a bit inconsistent

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.980 
code formatting is a bit inconsistent
you<00:06:25.950> can<00:06:26.130> see<00:06:26.250> it's<00:06:26.370> not<00:06:26.520> nicely<00:06:26.910> indented<00:06:27.470> the

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
you can see it's not nicely indented the

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.300 
you can see it's not nicely indented the
bracket<00:06:30.990> is<00:06:31.140> is<00:06:31.350> not<00:06:31.530> properly<00:06:31.890> aligned<00:06:32.160> and

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
bracket is is not properly aligned and

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.060 
bracket is is not properly aligned and
so<00:06:32.490> on<00:06:32.610> so<00:06:32.900> I<00:06:33.900> can<00:06:33.930> fix<00:06:34.289> that<00:06:34.470> using<00:06:34.890> the

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
so on so I can fix that using the

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.230 
so on so I can fix that using the
automatic<00:06:35.700> code<00:06:36.210> formatter<00:06:36.750> in<00:06:37.050> amethyst<00:06:37.680> and
