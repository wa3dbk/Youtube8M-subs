00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.210
 If there is someone who has already insured their 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.330
 go to the final of the world cup of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.709
 Brazil 2014 is the wta sugar the ball 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.959
 of the world is 437 grams has 69 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.030
 centimeters of circumference and is without 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.340
 place to doubt the ball with more 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.070
 technology of football history and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.920
 of the world champions this ball was created 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 in the German city of herzogenarauch 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.090
 there are no factories there but true 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.830
 laboratories in which 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.739
 developed the different tests of 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.560
 quality that led neither more nor less 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.420
 hundreds and a half years of work after 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.030
 the enormous criticism his 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.399
 predecessor to the jabulani used in the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.110
 World Cup of South Africa-2010 and manufactured 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.660
 also for the same brand but in the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.480
 united kingdom the brazuca was conceived as 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.260
 the most technically proven ball of the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.260
 football history 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.350
 first he sought the opinion 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.360
 who will have the most contact with the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.910
 ball that 's why the hug here 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.210
 went through the hands and feet of over 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.400
 600 players from around the world within 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.290
 the strict German laboratories the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.720
 World Cup ball was subjected to 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.390
 different aerodynamic tests inside 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.430
 of wind tunnels was also 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.470
 analyzed in terms of visibility in 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.300
 the air in the sector and on television 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.340
 to get the best results 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.580
 both from the point of view of 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.110
 players as of the spectators 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.450
 also went through the tests of a 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.850
 incredible mechanical leg that kicked the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.830
 ball repeated times with a power 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.259
 exactly the same in all cases 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.259
 this was to measure the speed the 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.990
 distance and the arc on the way through 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.940
 your part in brazil-2014 the ball 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.670
 will incorporate an innovative structure 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.520
 symmetric of 6 identical panels in 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.470
 propeller shape this change added to a 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.050
 new surface that gives you a 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.119
 greater contact adhesion and stability 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.670
 aerodynamic on the ground of the game 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.979
 make it a ball with greater 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.680
 yields the presence of a 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.050
 synthetic surface very united between its 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.569
 parts allows to avoid moisture and 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.400
 makes it possible that there is no added weight in 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.880
 the body of the ball when the ground 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.700
 all these stages are wet 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.380
 they demanded almost 30 months of analysis 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.989
 simulators and tests that concluded in 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.940
 this ball that undoubtedly bears 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.400
 behind it the greatest technological process 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.410
 of the history of the world and by 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.130
 supposedly all the hopes of the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.130
 Football fans 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.010
 yes 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.970
 Y
