00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:56.050
 1920 to 1080 at the widest 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:02.089
 corner we shoot a tripod 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:04.040
 the lake in well-lit conditions all 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:08.390
 same dear friends but the corner 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.159
 set the medium is not. shooting is not the place 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.740
 shooting not shooting conditions have not changed 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:18.680
 just changed the angle again resolution not 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.840
 changing 1920 to 1080 30 frames in 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.590
 second and still less shooting angle here 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.990
 Now I put the corner in general water ring 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.590
 in a single ring implies that we 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.750
 must be removed with another attachment 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:41.679
 probably see what happens angle 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.679
 worth wide 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:53.100
 I'll tell you to shoot them a little shit 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.740
 showing you the possibilities of the same 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.250
 stabilizer again of course I 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.520
 I turn very slowly but 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.610
 the next mode is 960 by 30 frames in 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.610
 give me a sec 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.510
 and the white balance is also worth the sun although I 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.270
 I think we should try it in this 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.740
 same mode for example just teeth 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.740
 try to change it in auto show people 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.880
 here is the white balance I will return to auto mode and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.480
 in its own way on the computer monitor 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.630
 change something or not go to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.180
 the next shooting mode resolution is 720 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.180
 60 frames per second 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.790
 the angle is still wide 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.900
 well, finally we will finish the regime soon 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.510
 in g 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.959
 frame rate 60 frames per second 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.959
 I don't know what quality this will be 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.920
 picture but can't not take off for you 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.920
 also please
