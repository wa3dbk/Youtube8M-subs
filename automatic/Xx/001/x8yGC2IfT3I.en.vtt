00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
so the reason why I placed my dough

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
so the reason why I placed my dough
inside<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.620> fan<00:00:46.890> mixer<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.030> can

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
inside my fan mixer is just so we can

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
inside my fan mixer is just so we can
cool<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.780> lot<00:00:48.930> quicker<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.530> mixed<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.489> high

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
cool a lot quicker I mixed it on high

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.430 
cool a lot quicker I mixed it on high
speed<00:00:51.059> for<00:00:51.090> about<00:00:51.329> three<00:00:51.750> minutes<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
speed for about three minutes and that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
speed for about three minutes and that
should<00:00:52.620> make<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> dough<00:00:53.039> cooler<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
should make the dough cooler then I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.869 
should make the dough cooler then I
added<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.570> eggs<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.230> by<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.550> your

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
added my eggs one by one and if your

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760 
added my eggs one by one and if your
dough<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> too<00:00:57.510> hot<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.960> eggs<00:00:58.140> will<00:00:58.410> scramble

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
dough is too hot your eggs will scramble

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.599 
dough is too hot your eggs will scramble
so<00:00:59.129> make<00:00:59.280> sure<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.180> hot<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> that's<00:01:02.489> what

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
so make sure it's not hot so that's what

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.960 
so make sure it's not hot so that's what
I<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.760> look<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.390> after<00:01:03.750> an<00:01:03.899> extending<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:05.010> then
