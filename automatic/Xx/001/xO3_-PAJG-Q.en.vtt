that<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.720> that's<00:03:12.230> another<00:03:12.740> downside<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.250> guess

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
that and that's another downside I guess

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.820 
that and that's another downside I guess
is<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.880> goes<00:03:14.000> iTune<00:03:14.450> if<00:03:14.960> you're<00:03:15.170> doing

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
is that it goes iTune if you're doing

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.430 
is that it goes iTune if you're doing
