00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
starting like at the middle of a strand

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.000 
starting like at the middle of a strand
of<00:02:48.330> hair<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:49.020> just<00:02:49.200> curling<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.740> all<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
a couple seconds to get a nice like sort

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030 
a couple seconds to get a nice like sort
of<00:02:53.970> messy<00:02:54.360> looking<00:02:54.630> curl<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.140> really<00:02:55.710> like<00:02:55.860> how

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
of messy looking curl I really like how

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.440 
of messy looking curl I really like how
it<00:02:56.160> looks<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.640> she<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:57.000> repeated<00:02:57.240> this

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
it looks and she just repeated this

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:12.210 
it looks and she just repeated this
process<00:02:57.510> until<00:02:58.350> my<00:02:58.920> whole<00:02:59.070> head<00:02:59.220> was<00:02:59.250> done

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.370 

and<00:03:13.690> surprisingly<00:03:14.690> enough<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.140> curl

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
and surprisingly enough the curl

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.170 
and surprisingly enough the curl
actually<00:03:15.860> really<00:03:16.099> lost<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.489> in<00:03:16.610> my<00:03:16.760> hair<00:03:17.000> you

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
actually really lost it in my hair you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.640 
actually really lost it in my hair you
could<00:03:17.330> probably<00:03:17.599> do<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.020> look<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.470> half

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
could probably do this look in half

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.380 
could probably do this look in half
second<00:03:19.130> third<00:03:19.340> maybe<00:03:19.580> even<00:03:19.700> fourths<00:03:20.209> cake

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
second third maybe even fourths cake

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:39.040 
second third maybe even fourths cake
rolls

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.500

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
so once I was all done with curling I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.390
