see<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.140> can<00:02:18.290> bring<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.620> down<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:19.099> create

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
see you can bring that down to create

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.270 
see you can bring that down to create
and<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.459> can<00:02:19.670> effect<00:02:20.830> I'm<00:02:21.830> not<00:02:21.980> even<00:02:22.160> touching

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
and I can effect I'm not even touching

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520 
and I can effect I'm not even touching
the<00:02:22.489> laptop<00:02:22.880> here<00:02:23.090> as<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.269> can<00:02:23.330> see<00:02:23.630> it's

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
the laptop here as you can see it's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.800 
the laptop here as you can see it's
using<00:02:24.800> actual<00:02:25.069> controller<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.569> pitch

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
using actual controller so the pitch

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.320 
using actual controller so the pitch
when<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.260> move<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.560> pitch<00:02:33.739> slider<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.940> can<00:02:34.970> see

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
when I move the pitch slider you can see

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:47.009 
when I move the pitch slider you can see
the<00:02:35.510> pitch<00:02:35.720> slider<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.349> actual<00:02:36.739> software

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
the sequencer on the software will sync

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.050 
the sequencer on the software will sync
with<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.140> actual<00:02:51.470> track<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:52.280> got<00:02:52.489> loaded<00:02:52.700> in

move<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.209> mouse<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:12.049> mouse<00:03:12.079> there<00:03:12.620> that's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
move the mouse the mouse there that's

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.470 
move the mouse the mouse there that's
the<00:03:14.180> face<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.569> be<00:03:14.720> streaming<00:03:15.019> in<00:03:15.170> there<00:03:16.480> which

the face to be streaming in there which

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.670 
the face to be streaming in there which
is<00:03:17.630> now<00:03:17.750> exactly<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.170> same<00:03:18.380> as<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.590> other

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
is now exactly the same as the other

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.089 
is now exactly the same as the other
side

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
side

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.720

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
just again it's improperly still go down

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:18.529 
just again it's improperly still go down
your<00:03:59.010> loops<00:04:16.669> so<00:04:17.669> yeah<00:04:17.789> this<00:04:17.910> this<00:04:18.299> same

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
your loops so yeah this this same

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.479 
your loops so yeah this this same
there's<00:04:18.959> actual<00:04:19.289> hardware<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.829> musin<00:04:20.190> here

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
there's actual hardware that musin here

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.800 
there's actual hardware that musin here
is<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.389> numark<00:04:21.889> DMC<00:04:22.889> -<00:04:23.250> software<00:04:24.240> controller

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
is the numark DMC - software controller

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.629 
is the numark DMC - software controller
so<00:04:25.620> basically<00:04:25.860> you've<00:04:26.070> got<00:04:26.190> your<00:04:26.310> jog<00:04:26.460> wheel

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
so basically you've got your jog wheel

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.640 
so basically you've got your jog wheel
as<00:04:26.789> well<00:04:27.000> which<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.389> can<00:04:27.539> do<00:04:27.930> scratch<00:04:28.349> with<00:04:28.530> as

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
as well which you can do scratch with as

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:39.750 
as well which you can do scratch with as
well<00:04:35.539> catch<00:04:36.539> it<00:04:36.690> all

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.180 

you<00:04:40.760> can<00:04:40.910> browse<00:04:41.120> through<00:04:41.150> your<00:04:41.420> files<00:04:41.780> or<00:04:42.290> the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
browser you file service file and then

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.620 
browser you file service file and then
I'm<00:04:45.650> turning<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.040> route<00:04:46.190> tweet<00:04:46.460> up<00:04:46.610> here<00:04:47.150> you

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
I'm turning the route tweet up here you

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.210 
I'm turning the route tweet up here you
can<00:04:47.750> see<00:04:47.990> it's<00:04:48.200> moving<00:04:48.350> up<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.770> down<00:04:48.830> at<00:04:49.190> the

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
can see it's moving up and down at the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.730 
can see it's moving up and down at the
actual<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:50.420> final<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:50.990> library<00:04:51.590> if<00:04:51.650> you

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
actual the final is the library if you

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.700 
actual the final is the library if you
like<00:04:51.920> on<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.790> software<00:04:53.120> itself<00:04:53.570> and<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.530> got

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
like on the software itself and you got

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.070 
like on the software itself and you got
to<00:04:54.830> put<00:04:55.760> down<00:04:55.880> your<00:04:55.910> phones<00:04:56.090> are<00:04:56.480> on<00:04:56.690> purpose

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
actual folders on the computer so now

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.990 
actual folders on the computer so now
with<00:05:02.480> some<00:05:02.840> some<00:05:03.320> bouncy<00:05:03.710> house<00:05:03.920> on<00:05:04.220> I'm<00:05:04.790> going

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
with some some bouncy house on I'm going

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.200 
with some some bouncy house on I'm going
to<00:05:05.120> there<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:07.460> if<00:05:07.550> you<00:05:07.610> want<00:05:07.640> it<00:05:07.880> on<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.000> deck
