00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.859 
think any of them seem like yep i know
and<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:38.790> personally<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.479> these<00:01:39.659> are

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and i personally think that these are

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.499 
and i personally think that these are
like<00:01:40.189> values<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.520> may<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.759> foreign<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.299> clubs

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
like values that may be foreign in clubs

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.270 
like values that may be foreign in clubs
would<00:01:42.930> try<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.290> pay<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.159> any

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
would try and pay but really if any

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069 
would try and pay but really if any

study was I did I did this piece up for

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.330 
study was I did I did this piece up for
the<00:02:12.180> Telegraph<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.170> study<00:02:13.440> was<00:02:14.190> about

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
the Telegraph and the study was about

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.890 
the Telegraph and the study was about
how<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.730> clubs<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.239> monetize<00:02:15.599> their<00:02:15.810> own

how the clubs and monetize their own

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.420 
how the clubs and monetize their own
brand<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.260> Barcelona<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:16.830> example<00:02:17.220> had<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
brand so Barcelona for example had the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.670 
brand so Barcelona for example had the
strongest<00:02:17.819> brand<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.510> world<00:02:18.780> football<00:02:18.840> but

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
strongest brand in world football but

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.890 
strongest brand in world football but
they<00:02:19.770> were<00:02:19.860> nowhere<00:02:20.010> near<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> top<00:02:20.520> there<00:02:20.700> was

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
they were nowhere near the top there was

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.089 
they were nowhere near the top there was
nothing<00:02:21.900> there<00:02:21.959> was<00:02:22.050> six<00:02:22.110> or<00:02:22.410> something<00:02:22.500> it's

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
nothing there was six or something it's

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.100 
nothing there was six or something it's
because<00:02:23.400> they<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:24.330> were<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.569> judged<00:02:24.870> by
