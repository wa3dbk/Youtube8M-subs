earlier<00:01:45.190> was<00:01:45.700> down<00:01:45.940> there<00:01:46.210> you've<00:01:47.200> seen<00:01:47.500> the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
earlier was down there you've seen the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.710 
earlier was down there you've seen the
whole<00:01:47.800> thing<00:01:47.830> by<00:01:48.310> now<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:48.940> I<00:01:49.210> don't<00:01:49.360> know<00:01:49.570> why<00:01:49.690> I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
whole thing by now so I don't know why I

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.030 
whole thing by now so I don't know why I
keep<00:01:49.900> acting<00:01:50.260> like<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.530> guys<00:01:50.620> haven't<00:01:50.920> seen

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
keep acting like you guys haven't seen

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.200 
keep acting like you guys haven't seen
this<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.280> guess<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.640> because<00:01:51.730> I<00:01:51.880> made<00:01:52.120> the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
this I guess it's because I made the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.550 
this I guess it's because I made the
video<00:01:52.300> before<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.840> guys<00:01:52.960> have<00:01:53.110> actually<00:01:53.380> seen

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
video before you guys have actually seen

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.410 
video before you guys have actually seen
it<00:01:53.620> there's<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.280> video<00:01:54.430> coming<00:01:54.850> out<00:01:54.940> well

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
it there's a video coming out well

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.560 
it there's a video coming out well
you've<00:01:55.600> already<00:01:55.780> seen<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.230> that<00:01:56.350> shows<00:01:56.650> me

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you've already seen it that shows me

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.150 
you've already seen it that shows me
making<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:59.320> thing<00:01:59.560> down<00:01:59.680> there<00:01:59.950> and

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
making that thing down there and

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.940 
making that thing down there and
extending<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.180> out<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.300> bit<00:02:01.390> well<00:02:01.720> I<00:02:01.930> decided<00:02:02.590> to

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
extending it out a bit well I decided to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.380 
extending it out a bit well I decided to
make<00:02:03.070> this<00:02:03.190> whole<00:02:03.400> thing<00:02:03.430> five<00:02:03.940> blocks

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
make this whole thing five blocks

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.170 
make this whole thing five blocks
instead<00:02:05.050> of<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.680> four<00:02:06.010> that<00:02:06.670> way<00:02:06.820> it'll<00:02:07.060> be

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
instead of the four that way it'll be

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.580 
instead of the four that way it'll be
even<00:02:07.420> with<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.690> thing<00:02:07.930> down<00:02:08.050> there<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:08.500> what

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
way around this thing all the way down

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.809 
way around this thing all the way down
rail<00:02:14.050> in<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.319> middle<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.709> then<00:02:15.160> walk<00:02:15.519> space

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
rail in the middle and then walk space

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.970 
rail in the middle and then walk space
on<00:02:16.060> each<00:02:16.240> side<00:02:16.540> probably<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:17.470> torches<00:02:17.860> or

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
on each side probably for torches or

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.430 

you'll<00:02:30.370> notice<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.760> uh<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.690> kind<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.200> made<00:02:32.350> it

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
you'll notice that uh I kind of made it

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.200 
you'll notice that uh I kind of made it
like<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:32.920> or<00:02:33.040> two<00:02:33.070> turns<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.730> because<00:02:34.030> it's

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
like one or two turns is because it's

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.880 
like one or two turns is because it's
really<00:02:34.540> really<00:02:34.780> hard<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.290> kind<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:35.680> make

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
really really hard to kind of like make

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.040 
really really hard to kind of like make
nice<00:02:36.220> rails<00:02:36.580> well<00:02:37.390> it's<00:02:37.600> kind<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.810> hard<00:02:37.870> to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
nice rails well it's kind of hard to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.980 
nice rails well it's kind of hard to
stupid<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.710> explain<00:02:39.070> but<00:02:39.370> um<00:02:39.870> it'll<00:02:40.870> be

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
stupid a to explain but um it'll be

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.750 
stupid a to explain but um it'll be
easier<00:02:41.320> just<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.680> make<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.100> rails<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.610> stuff

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
easier just to make the rails and stuff

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.390 
easier just to make the rails and stuff
this<00:02:42.940> way<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:43.990> um<00:02:44.200> what<00:02:44.740> I<00:02:44.770> wanted<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.130> really

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
this way but um what I wanted to really

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.760 
this way but um what I wanted to really
talk<00:02:45.640> about<00:02:45.700> was<00:02:46.150> I've<00:02:46.390> got<00:02:46.570> all<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.740> I

didn't work my butt off clucking trees I

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.690 
didn't work my butt off clucking trees I
like<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.960> basically<00:02:50.470> raped<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:51.040> forest<00:02:51.490> over

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
had a bunch of saplings to think they

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110

wooden roller coaster before how has all

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.570 
wooden roller coaster before how has all
the<00:03:40.720> bracing<00:03:41.140> under<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.500> all<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.830> way<00:03:41.920> up<00:03:42.100> I'm

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
the bracing under it all the way up I'm

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.900 
the bracing under it all the way up I'm
gonna<00:03:42.790> do<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.180> on<00:03:43.570> every<00:03:44.080> part<00:03:44.350> that's<00:03:44.620> a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
gonna do that on every part that's a

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.729 
gonna do that on every part that's a
floating<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.270> it<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:46.959> going<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.200> be<00:03:47.230> super

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
floating and it is going to be super

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.530 
floating and it is going to be super
epic<00:03:48.190> now<00:03:48.400> I'm<00:03:48.760> gonna<00:03:48.880> probably<00:03:49.120> take<00:03:49.300> out

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
epic now I'm gonna probably take out

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.000 
epic now I'm gonna probably take out
this<00:03:49.630> whole<00:03:49.840> entire<00:03:49.959> force<00:03:50.380> trying<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.709> do<00:03:50.860> it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
this whole entire force trying to do it

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.410 
this whole entire force trying to do it
and<00:03:51.160> probably<00:03:51.310> go<00:03:51.580> through<00:03:51.760> my<00:03:51.880> diamond<00:03:52.209> pick

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
and probably go through my diamond pick

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.479 
and probably go through my diamond pick
or<00:03:52.930> my<00:03:53.230> time<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.530> acts<00:03:53.680> i<00:03:53.860> should<00:03:54.070> say<00:03:54.280> i

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
or my time and acts i should say i

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.090 
or my time and acts i should say i
haven't<00:03:55.480> started<00:03:55.989> much<00:03:56.200> work<00:03:56.470> on<00:03:56.650> digging

haven't started much work on digging
down<00:03:57.250> inside<00:03:57.850> of<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:59.370> inside<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.580> quarry

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
down inside of the inside of the quarry

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.310

and<00:04:01.120> i<00:04:01.180> still<00:04:01.390> have<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.570> first<00:04:01.810> layer<00:04:02.110> that

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
and i still have the first layer that

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.960 
and i still have the first layer that
ever<00:04:02.470> i<00:04:02.500> did<00:04:02.739> add<00:04:02.920> these<00:04:03.160> in<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.459> second<00:04:03.790> ago

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
ever i did add these in a second ago

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.580 
ever i did add these in a second ago
these<00:04:04.150> are<00:04:04.330> gates<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:04.989> we<00:04:05.110> can<00:04:05.230> get<00:04:05.410> in

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
these are gates just so we can get in

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.290 
these are gates just so we can get in
and<00:04:05.770> out<00:04:05.830> real<00:04:06.160> easy<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.850> if<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:06.970> need<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.209> go

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
and out real easy so if we need to go

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.949 
and out real easy so if we need to go
out<00:04:07.330> 30<00:04:07.600> at<00:04:07.780> trees<00:04:08.050> which<00:04:08.260> will<00:04:08.410> real<00:04:08.530> soon

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
out 30 at trees which will real soon

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.290 
out 30 at trees which will real soon
yeah<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.200> also<00:04:12.010> there's<00:04:12.459> a<00:04:12.550> cave<00:04:12.820> over<00:04:13.000> here

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
yeah and also there's a cave over here

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.030 
yeah and also there's a cave over here
I've<00:04:13.780> locked<00:04:14.020> it<00:04:14.230> off<00:04:14.320> for<00:04:14.560> now<00:04:14.709> we<00:04:14.770> might

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
I've locked it off for now we might

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.430 
I've locked it off for now we might
explore<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.790> in<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:16.000> little<00:04:16.270> while<00:04:16.450> but<00:04:16.989> uh<00:04:17.019> I

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
explore it in a little while but uh I

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.340 
explore it in a little while but uh I
don't<00:04:17.650> know<00:04:17.739> why<00:04:17.890> that's<00:04:18.100> there<00:04:18.549> but<00:04:19.390> I<00:04:19.450> think

it's actually like I think actually

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.060 
it's actually like I think actually
blocked<00:04:22.240> it<00:04:22.510> or<00:04:22.630> it's<00:04:22.810> grass<00:04:23.320> is<00:04:23.620> covering<00:04:23.980> it

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
blocked it or it's grass is covering it

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.270 
blocked it or it's grass is covering it

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
further so basically to summarize what

further so basically to summarize what
I've<00:04:45.460> basically<00:04:45.699> just<00:04:46.120> said<00:04:46.300> in<00:04:46.780> like<00:04:47.169> last

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
video or last four videos I guess is

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.409 
video or last four videos I guess is
we're<00:04:50.949> going<00:04:51.039> to<00:04:51.159> cover<00:04:51.310> this<00:04:51.520> trade<00:04:51.939> track<00:04:52.240> or

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
we're going to cover this trade track or

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.140 
we're going to cover this trade track or
this<00:04:52.629> station<00:04:53.069> the<00:04:54.069> railroad<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:54.759> everything

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
this station the railroad and everything

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.659 
this station the railroad and everything
in<00:04:55.270> fences<00:04:55.719> so<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:56.229> looks<00:04:56.830> cool<00:04:57.009> it's<00:04:57.250> outside

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
in fences so it looks cool it's outside

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.249 
in fences so it looks cool it's outside
feel<00:04:57.939> and<00:04:58.539> then<00:04:58.719> we're<00:04:58.870> gonna<00:04:58.930> make<00:04:59.199> it

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
feel and then we're gonna make it

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.950 
feel and then we're gonna make it
undercarriage<00:05:00.099> like<00:05:00.490> down<00:05:00.729> here<00:05:00.759> out<00:05:01.599> of<00:05:01.659> like

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
undercarriage like down here out of like

all right here I mean I can probably
fill<00:05:31.090> that<00:05:31.210> in<00:05:31.270> with<00:05:31.360> dirt<00:05:31.629> and<00:05:31.719> get<00:05:31.870> away<00:05:32.020> with

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
fill that in with dirt and get away with

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.110 
fill that in with dirt and get away with
not<00:05:32.319> putting<00:05:32.650> any<00:05:32.770> there<00:05:33.039> but<00:05:33.669> like<00:05:33.819> these

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
not putting any there but like these

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.399 
not putting any there but like these
bigger<00:05:34.389> parts<00:05:34.750> it's<00:05:34.900> going<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.110> look<00:05:35.229> cool

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
bigger parts it's going to look cool

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.339 
bigger parts it's going to look cool
once<00:05:35.680> I<00:05:35.770> put<00:05:35.949> all<00:05:36.039> that<00:05:36.129> stuff<00:05:36.190> in<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:36.909> then

once I put all that stuff in and then

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.589 
once I put all that stuff in and then
I'll<00:05:38.349> probably<00:05:38.560> hide<00:05:38.949> my<00:05:39.129> redstone<00:05:39.599> under

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
I'll probably hide my redstone under

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.110 
I'll probably hide my redstone under
there<00:05:40.889> all<00:05:41.889> for<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.279> track<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.849> stuff

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
because I don't think I'm ever gonna

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.790 
because I don't think I'm ever gonna
need<00:05:44.289> to<00:05:44.409> switch<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:45.000> but<00:05:46.000> if<00:05:46.089> I<00:05:46.180> did<00:05:46.419> I'll<00:05:46.960> put

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:50.589 
like that I don't know I think it'd be

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.230 
like that I don't know I think it'd be
cool<00:05:50.830> to<00:05:50.860> have<00:05:51.039> like<00:05:51.069> a<00:05:51.279> redstone<00:05:51.580> tracklist

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
cool to have like a redstone tracklist

look more appealing i want to add on to

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.219 
look more appealing i want to add on to
all<00:06:24.819> of<00:06:25.029> this<00:06:25.210> out<00:06:25.360> here<00:06:25.629> with<00:06:25.779> the<00:06:25.810> dirt<00:06:26.080> that

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
all of this out here with the dirt that

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.369 
all of this out here with the dirt that
we<00:06:26.349> already<00:06:26.500> have<00:06:27.300> and<00:06:28.300> maybe<00:06:28.539> make<00:06:28.900> some

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:29.379 
we already have and maybe make some

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.550 
we already have and maybe make some
steps<00:06:29.860> going<00:06:30.550> like<00:06:30.759> down<00:06:31.180> like<00:06:31.599> all<00:06:32.319> the<00:06:32.500> way

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
steps going like down like all the way

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.610 
steps going like down like all the way
down<00:06:33.449> probably<00:06:34.449> filling<00:06:34.779> in<00:06:34.900> a<00:06:34.930> lot<00:06:35.319> of<00:06:35.349> this

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
down probably filling in a lot of this

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.079 
down probably filling in a lot of this
and<00:06:35.830> making<00:06:35.949> it<00:06:36.069> look<00:06:36.129> a<00:06:36.279> lot<00:06:36.400> more<00:06:36.460> smoother

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:37.089 
and making it look a lot more smoother

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:39.719 
and making it look a lot more smoother
because<00:06:37.990> it's<00:06:38.529> got<00:06:38.709> like<00:06:38.830> random<00:06:39.250> stuff<00:06:39.610> right
