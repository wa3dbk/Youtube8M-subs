00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:17.240
 Hi, how come today I bring you a video 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.400
 related to the fajitas as you know 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.820
 if you like these dolls normally 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.040
 the heads what is the hair is made 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.650
 also with mucus maeva but there is another 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.380
 option that is to use drying paste 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.520
 I use the brand jumping 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.130
 clay but good can be used 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.420
 any other brand and is to use this 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.739
 pasta to make the hair of the fruit already 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.020
 I tell you that I really like how 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:47.060
 and today I want to show you how 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.820
 as I do to see what you think 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.780
 I hope you like it we start 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.150
 to start I have a ball of by is 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.839
 that lined in half with rubber eva 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.579
 meat color 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.610
 usually the other part of the head 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.040
 it is covered with the color of the rubber eva 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.950
 class make hair but in this case not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.590
 I'm going to cover it because because the mass of 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.020
 Air drying in the rubber eva does not stick or 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.330
 they strike fatal however what is the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.820
 ball in the ball of x is sticks 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.420
 perfectly with which I'm going to leave 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.369
 is this part of the ball unlined 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.780
 to apply the pasta there and that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.250
 it sticks well what that hair 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.980
 I'm going to make this one brown 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.020
 what I do not tell you what I'm going for 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.050
 use your head because you will only see 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 the next video but we're going to 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.590
 start with 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.680
 with this pasta you have to have a lot 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.960
 careful because it is getting closer to 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.340
 contact with the air so the pasta 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.810
 that we are not using has to 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.400
 be always good 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.000
 well sealed 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.480
 what I'm going to do is the part that is 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.300
 unlined I'm going to apply a coat 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.700
 of drying paste to let's say as if 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.850
 outside the base of the music and the rubber eva 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.850
 when the eva rubber is used 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.680
 we extend it well it costs a little 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.680
 but good the result is worth it 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.780
 It takes less work than doing hair 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.270
 rubber eva or at least to me I stopped it 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.130
 Once I have it lined up I've clicked on 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.500
 a stick simply so that a do not 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.960
 touch what is air dried pasta 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.110
 on the surface and it's more comfortable for me to go 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.450
 putting her hair in this case is going to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.860
 take risks with what with which 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.860
 I have to make churritos 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.590
 and pick them up 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.420
 to go doing the curls of my doll 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.260
 the process is going to take you a while 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.440
 and take it easy and a little 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.489
 patience but good if you do it with 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.660
 rubber eva you also have to do it 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.660
 slowly so 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.920
 with the curls game cover the gaps that 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.920
 I'm staying 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.670
 and that's how it is in my head 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.470
 a curly little head 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.540
 and this is another system of doing 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.480
 chips is neither better nor worse is 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.569
 simply a matter of taste to me is 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.869
 an option that I like a lot 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.699
 I no story time for this 

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:37.639
 head if you want to see it you will have to 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.189
 wait for my next video os 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.349
 I recommend that you write so you do not 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:43.969
 you miss it and if this video has 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.790
 liked and want that can serve you 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:49.550
 that I like that 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.400
 what I said we'll see you in the next video 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.010
 so you can see what this 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.940
