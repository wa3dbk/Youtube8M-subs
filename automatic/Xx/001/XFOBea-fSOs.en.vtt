00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
and see if i can set fire to the 50 so

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.899 
and see if i can set fire to the 50 so
you<00:01:35.320> see<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.590> line<00:01:35.920> you're<00:01:36.100> underneath<00:01:36.549> it

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
you see that line you're underneath it

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.599 
you see that line you're underneath it
to<00:01:37.270> try<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.509> set<00:01:37.840> fire<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.079> it<00:01:38.289> I<00:01:38.590> set<00:01:39.340> fire<00:01:39.549> to

to try to set fire to it I set fire to

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.940 
to try to set fire to it I set fire to
it<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.119> I<00:01:40.210> get<00:01:40.359> but<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.600> get<00:01:40.810> good<00:01:41.020> hit<00:01:41.289> on<00:01:41.530> there

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
it and I get but I get good hit on there

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.660 
it and I get but I get good hit on there
and<00:01:42.189> I<00:01:43.149> pull<00:01:43.719> back<00:01:43.990> because<00:01:44.679> it<00:01:45.130> looks<00:01:45.399> like<00:01:45.640> a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
and I pull back because it looks like a

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.770 
and I pull back because it looks like a
type<00:01:45.939> 59<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:46.810> I'm<00:01:46.899> playing<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.350> like<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.560> type<00:01:47.859> 59

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
type 59 so I'm playing it like a type 59

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.370 
type 59 so I'm playing it like a type 59
so<00:01:49.780> keep<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.770> turret<00:01:51.399> in<00:01:51.549> play<00:01:51.969> but<00:01:52.780> my

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
so keep the the turret in play but my

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.620 
so keep the the turret in play but my
spatial<00:01:53.829> awareness<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.520> again<00:01:54.850> first<00:01:55.240> battle

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
spatial awareness and again first battle

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.730 
spatial awareness and again first battle
is<00:01:57.780> thought<00:01:58.780> I'd<00:01:58.869> treat<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.229> just<00:01:59.409> like<00:01:59.530> the

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
is thought I'd treat it just like the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.950 
is thought I'd treat it just like the
type<00:01:59.890> 59<00:02:00.069> and<00:02:00.549> keep<00:02:00.759> its<00:02:00.939> turret<00:02:01.270> on<00:02:01.389> top<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.869> I

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
type 59 and keep its turret on top and I

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.779 
type 59 and keep its turret on top and I
was<00:02:02.079> focusing<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:03.009> see<00:02:03.189> what<00:02:03.219> else<00:02:03.460> if<00:02:03.670> I

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
was focusing in to see what else if I
