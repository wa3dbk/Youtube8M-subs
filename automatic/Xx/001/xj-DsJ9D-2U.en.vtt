I found it quite calming after a while
and<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.920> mean<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.130> wasn't<00:02:17.400> expecting<00:02:17.850> much<00:02:18.180> from

off<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.190> ebay<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.630> seller<00:02:25.170> himself

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
off of ebay and then the seller himself

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.740 
off of ebay and then the seller himself

once<00:02:28.680> I'd<00:02:28.920> won<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.340> auction<00:02:29.490> because<00:02:30.060> he

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
once I'd won the auction because he

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.550 
once I'd won the auction because he
thought<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> sound<00:02:30.990> quality<00:02:31.080> was<00:02:31.530> bad

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
thought that the sound quality was bad

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.040 
thought that the sound quality was bad
and<00:02:32.010> when<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.160> put<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.780> record<00:02:33.780> player

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and when I put it on the record player

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.420 
and when I put it on the record player
it<00:02:34.170> was<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.320> bit<00:02:34.560> crackly

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
it was a bit crackly

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.250 
it was a bit crackly
I<00:02:35.540> put<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.630> into<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.990> gizmo<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:39.510> sounds

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
I put it into this gizmo and it sounds

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.040 
I put it into this gizmo and it sounds
really<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:41.280> really<00:02:41.640> improved<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.360> now<00:02:42.870> I'm<00:02:42.930> not

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
really it really improved it now I'm not

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.590 
really it really improved it now I'm not
saying<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.700> Holy<00:02:44.880> Grail<00:02:45.300> and

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
you know it's going to improve all your

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.010 
you know it's going to improve all your
records<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.910> course<00:02:48.090> certain<00:02:48.540> things<00:02:48.810> I've

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
records of course certain things I've

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.720

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.130 
got you know surface noise or you know
scratches<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:54.180> not<00:02:54.330> going<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.570> improve<00:02:54.840> but

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
scratches it's not going to improve but

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.430 
scratches it's not going to improve but
it<00:02:55.200> did<00:02:55.530> seem<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.300> get<00:02:57.300> rid<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.630> some<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.350> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
it did seem to get rid of some of the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.640 
it did seem to get rid of some of the
crackles<00:02:58.890> certain<00:02:59.760> certain<00:03:00.660> crackles<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.260> did

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
crackles certain certain crackles it did

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.180 
crackles certain certain crackles it did
seem<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.570> remove<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.050> also<00:03:04.739> seemed<00:03:05.160> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
seem to remove and it also seemed to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.790 
seem to remove and it also seemed to
improve<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.970> overall<00:03:06.570> sound<00:03:06.840> quality<00:03:07.020> you

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
improve the overall sound quality you

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.470 
improve the overall sound quality you
know<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.040> frequency<00:03:08.580> range<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.060> records

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
know the frequency range of the records

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.630 
know the frequency range of the records
I<00:03:09.540> mean<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.840> don't<00:03:10.290> know<00:03:10.590> if<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.280> like

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I mean I don't know if this is just like

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.840 
I mean I don't know if this is just like
a<00:03:11.670> some<00:03:12.000> sort<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.620> placebo<00:03:13.620> effect<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:14.640> I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
a some sort of placebo effect but I

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.940 
a some sort of placebo effect but I
thought<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.720> records<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.709> was

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
thought that the records that I was

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.270 
thought that the records that I was
cleaning<00:03:17.519> sounded<00:03:18.090> at<00:03:18.180> better<00:03:19.160> sound<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.250> a

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
cleaning sounded at better sound is a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.940 
cleaning sounded at better sound is a
bit<00:03:20.370> clearer<00:03:21.049> but<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.260> know<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.620> could<00:03:22.830> be

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
bit clearer but you know it could be

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.090 
bit clearer but you know it could be
just<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.280> month<00:03:23.580> I'm<00:03:23.820> agog<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.450> everything<00:03:25.110> so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
just a month I'm agog with everything so

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.979 
just a month I'm agog with everything so
yeah<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.310> mean<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:27.299> it's<00:03:27.420> really<00:03:27.750> really

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
yeah I mean I think it's really really

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.380 
yeah I mean I think it's really really
cool<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.920> get<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.130> bottle<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.580> cleaning

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
cool you get a bottle of cleaning

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.150 
cool you get a bottle of cleaning
solution<00:03:30.570> which<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.410> reuse<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:32.010> got<00:03:32.130> a

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
solution which you can reuse it's got a

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.520 
solution which you can reuse it's got a
filter<00:03:32.580> thing<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.269> can<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:34.140> can<00:03:34.320> reuse

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
filter thing and you can you can reuse

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.630 
filter thing and you can you can reuse
over<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.160> over<00:03:35.400> again

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
over and over again

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.830 
over and over again
I<00:03:35.820> think<00:03:36.180> they<00:03:36.630> cost<00:03:36.959> 20<00:03:37.440> pounds<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.880> to

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
I think they cost 20 pounds to to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.690 
I think they cost 20 pounds to to
restock<00:03:40.350> once<00:03:40.590> you've<00:03:40.769> used<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.400> think<00:03:41.640> you

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
restock once you've used it I think you

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.250 
restock once you've used it I think you
can<00:03:41.910> use<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.239> over<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.600> over<00:03:42.660> again<00:03:42.900> until

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
can use it over and over again until

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.220 
can use it over and over again until
well<00:03:44.010> until<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.750> finishes<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:45.989> I'm<00:03:46.049> going<00:03:46.200> to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
well until it finishes so I'm going to

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.900 
well until it finishes so I'm going to
I'm<00:03:46.920> going<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.130> go<00:03:47.250> through<00:03:47.489> my<00:03:47.549> record

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
I'm going to go through my record

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.660 
I'm going to go through my record
collection<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.690> clean<00:03:49.500> everything<00:03:49.890> give

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
collection and and clean everything give
