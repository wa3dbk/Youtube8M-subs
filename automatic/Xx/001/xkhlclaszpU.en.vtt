00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.500
 Hello everyone, clay with you today speech 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.390
 will go about tank ninth tier average 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.119
 Japan Type 61 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 this is the predecessor of the formidable stb-1 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.619
 whom many love for his dpm and in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.710
 principle let's find out what is this 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.410
 tank how come let's inevitably play right away 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.620
 getting close to the pros and cons of the car and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.649
 start with the merits and the very first 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 plus this weapon yes this weapon never 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.129
 put on a real tank yes it is a weapon 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.309
 scythe weapon to worse very DPM 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.089
 tapping but still cool 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.550
 good turn 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.649
 excellent breakthrough this two guarantor addition 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.899
 what will you wear constantly 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.420
 stable good average damage on 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.999
 car and of course this is one of the most 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.859
 main performance indicators in my 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.500
 so 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.650
 guns write a plus sign 2 plus sign it 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.140
 canopy incline hillside like 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.940
 Now we see this is our trump card 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.730
 our huge plus we can him 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.560
 use as we please 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.160
 there seems to converge well with us everywhere 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 comfortable excellent important 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.740
 Indicator for medium tank are 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.230
 his driving performance is our tank quite 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.570
 currently it accelerates well 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.810
 maneuverability therefore its running 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.760
 characteristics of the recording a plus also have 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.640
 He has a good overview of its a must 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.180
 u-sin illuminated optics and in principle 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.310
 we will notice everyone though if 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.760
 delve into the calculation of the huge silhouette bad 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.040
 masking and 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.680
 these okay review + 1 also 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.290
 we have a mask of weapons that holds 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.780
 hit even from gun tenth levels but 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.200
 you need to manage to get into this 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.170
 the mask of a tiny hand 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.660
 let's now and cons well we 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.130
 started about mask guns then basically 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.400
 booking in general 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.970
 garbage and does not hold a general strike even 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.100
 from the seventh sixth the frame is not rambus lena 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.850
 Gusl and everything breaks through all flies 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.910
 and if we admit that we admit t-54 and 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.060
 you naturally everyone will shoot you you 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.400
 first target for enemy artillery in 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.780
 Generally such a projectile receiver is excellent 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.930
 so glow on this tank 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.720
 categorically impossible but if we think 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.410
 about the next minuses then it will be done 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.980
 not at all just like we have a huge 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.480
 silhouette 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.330
 we have 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.879
 for medium tank the tank is very tall 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.190
 how bad do I take armor high silhouette in 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.260
 principle excellent excellent target table 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.790
 I do not want 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.090
 science okay we have good declination angles 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.019
 guns we have a mask gun let's 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.650
 play from the tower 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.110
 worn here too will not work why yes 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.660
 because we have a very harmful 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.180
 such a huge turret commander which 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.950
 leans out immediately as soon as you 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.049
 trying to go somewhere ie you 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.640
 first see this turret and then 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.819
 get out yourself taip 61 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.040
 naturally you shoot the turret and not 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.690
 even the player on this tank has time 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.269
 leave for lumbago you already 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.239
 roll back so skirmish 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.359
 from the tower is also extremely very uncomfortable and 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.370
 everything is left in this machine and here 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.069
 shines in this turret you will allow 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.079
 hidden there to this turret sticks me 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.870
 it seems even there are no bushes which 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.910
 stupid thorn-groove hiding in general due to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.730
 She probably reviews good but this our 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.359
 such their forest that all grew old it 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.019
 highly 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.000
 bothers and very uncomfortable and still we 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.220
 very weak maximum speed 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.410
 for a tank, that is, in principle, overclocking 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.269
 good maneuverability is good but if 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.940
 need to come from flank to flank then this 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.000
 take some time which sometimes 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.910
 you can not lose and that does not play on 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.560
 arm so let's say so basically 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.190
 also a minus 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.170
 we finished plus appeared and if in general 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.320
 collect everything then I can say that so 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.769
 such an average resembles something Plato in 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.200
 his best years 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.919
 principle of great discomfort i'm not 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.100
 was getting 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.169
 playing on this tank but also delight too 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.960
 that is, such a single account has passed 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.419
 1 truth bought in principle so 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.130
 everything happened 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.639
 additional equipment here everything is standard and 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.250
 stabilizers rammer and post wrap 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.380
 a standard set of his advice not to change 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.400
 because well, and put the stereo 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.180
 you can not sit on the bushes 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.720
 stupid all this is basically a good review 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.400
 some page 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.200
 light bulb disguise repair everything 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.419
 As standard, you can still put a smooth 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.150
 move smooth turn of the tower to improve 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.820
 accuracy and stabilization of the instrument because 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.630
 that science is soy and in principle further already on 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.200
 own discretion 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.490
 About the style of the game I think that this tank 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.770
 will fit 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.690
 Nastre on another color medium and 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.819
 long distances in this fight this 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.560
 demonstrated in principle almost in 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:18.580
 all battles this is paying off 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.639
 for repeating there as well 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.280
 you can waste your shots with tanks 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.410
 which is less than the alpha suppose you have 400 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.870
 200 normal size but don't forget 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.729
 about the fact that the margin of safety 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.680
 tends to end periodically 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.139
 so don't wait lego house advise on 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.060
 I do not advise you to look at the strip 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.710
 glow on the shallows of which a lot 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.900
 arts because shells are flooded 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.330
 often with pan damage several times 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.150
 I was even vanshotil artillerymen 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.319
 brown of ours and of course no 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.750
 it does not bring delight 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:52.810
 you can use terrain for 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.449
 their goals self-serving and tamping damage 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.360
 fred is very comfortable on this all 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.289
 the tank is interesting but not to say that 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.210
 stands out from the crowd 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.520
 play and win see results 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.259
 I say goodbye to you and do not forget 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.349
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.389
 Thank you all for watching with you 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:16.080
 green see you in the following videos 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.080
 bye Bye
