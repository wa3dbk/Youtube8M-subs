00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
and everything like that so it's kind of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.100 
and everything like that so it's kind of
restricted<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.939> case<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.960> also

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
restricted in that case but it's also

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.450 
restricted in that case but it's also
not<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> cost<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.920> money<00:01:53.130> over<00:01:53.220> time
