00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.809
 Hello everyone, you and Eustace today 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.559
 we will test 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.270
 the coolest game steering wheel in the world is this 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.119
 same those g27 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.080
 the steering wheel set itself consists of pedals 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.070
 power steering and console switching 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.369
 gears 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.160
 let's take a look at them one by one 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.769
 The first is power, everything is simple and reliable 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.980
 worth noting and very long cables 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.559
 what undoubtedly pleases further with us 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.590
 the gear shift console it has 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.280
 a lot of buttons themselves joysticks 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.460
 lever arm 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.550
 6 forward gears with familiar movements and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.399
 reverse gear by pushing the lever all as 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.039
 in a race car the levers have leather 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.129
 handmade braid attached to the table 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.590
 very reliable three points 2 from which 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.859
 have latches 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.770
 further we have pedals here too 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.990
 same cool firstly they are metallic in 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.920
 second everyone has a different degree 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.460
 pressing 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 for example gas light arc brakes and 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.610
 medium adhesion by itself 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.990
 this part is very bulky does not creak 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:27.140
 has a comfortable hiding support for the carpet 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.689
 Well, actually the steering wheel itself 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.390
 force feedback meaning you 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.960
 you will obviously feel a loss of grip 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.420
 expensive 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.100
 weight shift cars when cornering and 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.380
 much more 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.990
 helical engagement eliminates 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.600
 extraneous sounds roles and color 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.750
 RPM indicators are also very happy 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.590
 handmade leather braid which 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.590
 covered the whole wheel its diameter is 28 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.110
 centimeters angle of rotation from 40 to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.630
 nine hundred degrees which allows 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.770
 twist it you have half a turn in 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.829
 each side 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.140
 in conclusion it is worth noting that this is bruce 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.630
 whether the best I've ever tested 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.310
 Of course it is impossible to transfer all those 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.709
 feelings of use 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.330
 but believe me I am still in 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.670
 wild ecstasy from taxiing like a load 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.710
 ege in euro track simulator such from 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.180
 dynamic off-road racing and 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.580
 finland in dirt 3 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.380
 he has his own play allows 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.840
 fully customize everything 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.750
 optical coding gives accurate and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.560
 reliable control in any situation 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.570
 I definitely recommend it is worth it 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.820
 an example of this manipulator can be 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.340
 look at the video that I recorded 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.560
 first person and used there 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.470
 playing dirt 3 can go by 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.620
 annotations and see everything actually 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.900
 it's very cool and fascinating also i 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.640
 I want to thank the logging company for 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.020
 provided miracle device 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.910
 and you for likes and views and subscriptions 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.910
