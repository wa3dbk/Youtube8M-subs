00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.689 
these wands view cameras can support up
to<00:00:54.989> 32gb<00:00:56.269> which<00:00:57.269> is<00:00:57.479> a<00:00:57.719> pretty<00:00:58.710> big<00:00:59.039> size<00:00:59.339> for

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
to 32gb which is a pretty big size for

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.710 
to 32gb which is a pretty big size for
recording<00:01:00.089> a<00:01:00.149> lot<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.300> videos

a lot of these videos are recorded

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.100 
a lot of these videos are recorded
through<00:01:03.580> motion<00:01:03.940> detection<00:01:04.300> so<00:01:04.570> they<00:01:04.809> do<00:01:04.870> not

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
through motion detection so they do not

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.100 
through motion detection so they do not
consume<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.860> much<00:01:05.920> space<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:07.750> as<00:01:07.900> we<00:01:08.080> open

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
consume that much space so as we open

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.550 
consume that much space so as we open
the<00:01:08.620> back<00:01:09.220> cover<00:01:09.250> we<00:01:09.670> see<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:10.000> there's<00:01:10.210> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the back cover we see that there's a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.320 
the back cover we see that there's a
moisture<00:01:11.560> pack<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.400> help<00:01:12.610> absorb<00:01:12.880> moisture

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
moisture pack to help absorb moisture

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
moisture pack to help absorb moisture
and<00:01:13.900> keep<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.290> insides<00:01:15.010> very<00:01:15.580> dry

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and keep the insides very dry

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.240 
and keep the insides very dry
and<00:01:17.869> we<00:01:18.869> got<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.170> careful<00:01:19.380> removing<00:01:20.130> these

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and we got to be careful removing these

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.249

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
because we do not want to pull hard and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.510 
because we do not want to pull hard and
tug<00:01:22.950> hard<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.580> break<00:01:23.909> any<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> wires<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.520> so

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
tug hard to break any of the wires so so

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
tug hard to break any of the wires so so
we<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.060> right<00:01:27.299> over<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.689> here's<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
SD card slot you can add up to 32 GBS

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.399 
SD card slot you can add up to 32 GBS
and<00:01:32.189> we're<00:01:32.970> gonna<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.299> adding<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.930> case<00:01:34.140> a
