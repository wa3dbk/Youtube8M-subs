all<00:00:06.720> right<00:00:06.839> today<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:07.140> going<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> do<00:00:07.379> another

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
all right today I'm going to do another

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.160 
all right today I'm going to do another
test<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.130> parabolic<00:00:08.670> solar<00:00:08.849> cooker<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:10.019> my

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
test of my parabolic solar cooker in my

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.839 
test of my parabolic solar cooker in my
last<00:00:10.380> video<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.920> did<00:00:11.040> about<00:00:11.370> this

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
last video that I did about this

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.030 
last video that I did about this
I<00:00:12.410> mentioned<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.530> need<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.860> use<00:00:14.009> a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
I mentioned that I need to use a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.860 
I mentioned that I need to use a
different<00:00:14.250> method<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:15.000> mounting<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.330> pan<00:00:15.599> so

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
different method of mounting the pan so

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.470 
different method of mounting the pan so
today<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.289> using<00:00:16.500> my<00:00:16.710> camera<00:00:17.100> tripod<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:18.359> do

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
today I'm using my camera tripod to do

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.880 
today I'm using my camera tripod to do
that<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> work<00:00:19.740> out

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that and I think it's going to work out

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.429 
that and I think it's going to work out
just<00:00:19.949> fine<00:00:20.840> today<00:00:21.840> I'm<00:00:22.020> gonna<00:00:22.170> cook<00:00:22.380> some

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
just fine today I'm gonna cook some

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.349 
just fine today I'm gonna cook some
Italian<00:00:23.070> sausage<00:00:23.279> along<00:00:23.640> with<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.090> peppers

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
Italian sausage along with some peppers

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.420 
Italian sausage along with some peppers
and<00:00:24.390> onions<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:25.619> gonna<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.949> ahead<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.279> put

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and onions so I'm gonna go ahead and put

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.250 
and onions so I'm gonna go ahead and put
it<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> tripod<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.930> how<00:00:28.050> long<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
it on the tripod and see how long it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.179 
it on the tripod and see how long it
takes<00:00:30.170> one<00:00:31.170> thing<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.380> was<00:00:31.500> concerned<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:31.949> is

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
takes one thing I was concerned about is

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.430 
takes one thing I was concerned about is
how<00:00:32.219> much<00:00:32.489> Sun<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.059> tripod<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.989> block<00:00:34.170> but

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
how much Sun this tripod would block but

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.780 
how much Sun this tripod would block but
I<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.829> gonna<00:00:34.920> work<00:00:35.100> out<00:00:35.250> pretty<00:00:35.430> well

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I see it's gonna work out pretty well

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.330 
I see it's gonna work out pretty well
there's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.450> little<00:00:36.690> bit<00:00:36.870> blocked<00:00:37.770> right<00:00:38.040> here

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
there's a little bit blocked right here

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670 
there's a little bit blocked right here
and<00:00:38.489> also<00:00:38.610> there's<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> shadow<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.719> cast<00:00:40.440> by

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and also there's a shadow here cast by

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.290 
and also there's a shadow here cast by
the<00:00:40.739> leg<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the leg and then a little bit of a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.850 
the leg and then a little bit of a
shadow<00:00:42.510> back<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:44.309> comes<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> pan

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
shadow back here that comes from the pan

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
shadow back here that comes from the pan
the<00:00:46.860> reason<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.340> works<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.789> pretty<00:00:48.000> good<00:00:48.210> as

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the reason this works out pretty good as

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.170 
the reason this works out pretty good as
these<00:00:48.510> satellite<00:00:48.989> dishes<00:00:49.200> are<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.559> perfect

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
these satellite dishes are not perfect

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.680 
these satellite dishes are not perfect
parabolic<00:00:51.180> shape<00:00:51.469> they<00:00:52.469> actually<00:00:53.690> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
parabolic shape they actually the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.330 
parabolic shape they actually the
satellite<00:00:55.110> signal<00:00:55.500> would<00:00:55.620> normally<00:00:55.949> come<00:00:56.160> in

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
satellite signal would normally come in

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
satellite signal would normally come in
from<00:00:56.579> what<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> top<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.570> dish<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
from what is the top of the dish and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
from what is the top of the dish and
then<00:00:57.960> bounce<00:00:58.199> back<00:00:58.590> toward<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> bottom<00:00:59.340> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
then bounce back toward the bottom of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670 
then bounce back toward the bottom of
the<00:00:59.640> dish<00:00:59.789> where<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> receivers<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.440> so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the dish where the receivers at and so

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
the dish where the receivers at and so
because<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.090> thing

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
because of that I have this thing

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.640 
because of that I have this thing
pointed<00:01:03.719> straight<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> sun's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
pointed straight up but the sun's

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
pointed straight up but the sun's
actually<00:01:04.979> had<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> slight<00:01:05.369> angle<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> can

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
actually had a slight angle so it can

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.850 
actually had a slight angle so it can
come<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.020> between<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.350> legs<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
come in here between the legs of the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.850 
come in here between the legs of the
tripod<00:01:08.100> without<00:01:08.840> getting<00:01:09.840> blocked<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.409> then

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
tripod without getting blocked and then

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
tripod without getting blocked and then
it<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.159> bounce<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> pan<00:01:12.330> which

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
it can bounce up here to the pan which

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
it can bounce up here to the pan which
can<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.409> off-center<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> little<00:01:14.220> bit<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.670> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
can be off-center a little bit so I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.520 
can be off-center a little bit so I
think<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:15.930> gonna<00:01:16.110> work<00:01:16.229> out

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
think this is actually gonna work out

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.910 
think this is actually gonna work out
well<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:17.009> use<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> tripod<00:01:18.619> all<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
well for use with a tripod all right the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.230 
well for use with a tripod all right the
food's<00:01:20.130> been<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.549> about<00:01:20.700> ten<00:01:20.909> minutes

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
food's been in there about ten minutes

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.570 
food's been in there about ten minutes
and<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> lid<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> pan<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.340> steamed

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and I see the lid of the pan is steamed

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.830 
and I see the lid of the pan is steamed
up<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.720> ahead

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
up a little bit so I'm going to go ahead

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
up a little bit so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:25.080> open<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> stir<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.280> around<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and open it up and stir it around a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:02:00.760 
and open it up and stir it around a
little<00:01:26.759> bit<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.960> doing

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.859 

kids<00:02:01.399> been<00:02:01.579> about<00:02:01.759> 25<00:02:02.180> minutes<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.719> this

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
kids been about 25 minutes and this

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.230 
kids been about 25 minutes and this
looks<00:02:03.109> pretty<00:02:03.289> much<00:02:03.530> done<00:02:03.969> all<00:02:04.969> the<00:02:05.060> meat

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
looks pretty much done all the meat

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.819 
looks pretty much done all the meat
looks<00:02:05.450> Brown<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.109> see<00:02:06.259> it's<00:02:06.380> boiling<00:02:06.590> a

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
looks Brown and I see it's boiling a

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.169 
looks Brown and I see it's boiling a
little<00:02:07.009> bit<00:02:07.130> there<00:02:07.310> in<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:07.460> middle<00:02:07.759> but<00:02:07.939> I'm

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
little bit there in the middle but I'm

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.430 
little bit there in the middle but I'm
gonna<00:02:08.330> stir<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.569> around<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.869> little<00:02:08.929> bit<00:02:09.200> and

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
gonna stir it around a little bit and
