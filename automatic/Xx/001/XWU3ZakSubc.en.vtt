there these doors
I<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> costs<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.280> like

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
I think the costs on them was like

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
I think the costs on them was like
sixteen<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.360> seventeen<00:00:36.390> thousand<00:00:37.320> dollars<00:00:37.350> it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
sixteen or seventeen thousand dollars it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.980 
sixteen or seventeen thousand dollars it
was<00:00:37.890> pretty<00:00:38.190> expensive

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.710
