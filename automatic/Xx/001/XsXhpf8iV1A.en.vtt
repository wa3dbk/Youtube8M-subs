guys but kaboom put up a good fight so
what<00:03:07.170> kind<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.380> went<00:03:07.530> wrong<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.920> well<00:03:08.820> I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
what kind of went wrong for you well I

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.210 
what kind of went wrong for you well I
think<00:03:09.480> our<00:03:10.380> team<00:03:10.590> played<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> little<00:03:11.040> bit

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
think our team played a little bit

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.800 
think our team played a little bit
greedily<00:03:11.459> we<00:03:11.760> had<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> huge<00:03:12.150> advantage<00:03:12.510> but

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
greedily we had a huge advantage but

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.120 
greedily we had a huge advantage but
everyone<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.140> wanted<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.590> keep<00:03:13.740> doing<00:03:13.980> their

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
everyone just wanted to keep doing their

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.500 
everyone just wanted to keep doing their
own<00:03:14.160> thing<00:03:14.310> instead<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.060> grouping<00:03:15.420> and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
own thing instead of grouping and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.870 
own thing instead of grouping and
working<00:03:15.780> as<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> unit<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:17.310> caught<00:03:17.580> us<00:03:17.730> off

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
working as a unit and I caught us off

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.370 
working as a unit and I caught us off
one<00:03:18.269> time<00:03:18.480> really<00:03:18.690> bad<00:03:18.840> where<00:03:18.989> he<00:03:19.050> lost<00:03:19.200> two

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
one time really bad where he lost two

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.259 
one time really bad where he lost two
turrets<00:03:19.650> got<00:03:19.980> three<00:03:20.280> kills<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.730> not<00:03:20.820> all<00:03:20.970> that

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
turrets got three kills and not all that

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.479 
turrets got three kills and not all that
so<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.350> weren't<00:03:22.500> playing<00:03:22.769> collectively

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
so we just weren't playing collectively

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.190 
so we just weren't playing collectively
as<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> team<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.450> kind<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.720> heard<00:03:24.840> us<00:03:24.989> for<00:03:25.170> a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
as a team and I kind of heard us for a

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.860 
as a team and I kind of heard us for a
bit<00:03:25.410> um<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.970> theory<00:03:27.269> also<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.750> should

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
bit um well in theory also this should

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.210 
bit um well in theory also this should
have<00:03:28.019> been<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.170> good<00:03:28.350> warm-up<00:03:28.709> game<00:03:28.920> for<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
have been a good warm-up game for the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.830 
have been a good warm-up game for the
game<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:29.610> coming<00:03:29.880> later<00:03:30.000> versa<00:03:30.420> najin

game that is coming later versa najin
shield<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.530> important<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.250> how<00:03:32.400> does

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
shield it's so important so how does

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.770 
shield it's so important so how does
that<00:03:32.580> change<00:03:32.700> your<00:03:32.970> attitude<00:03:33.360> going<00:03:33.540> into

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
that change your attitude going into

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.050 
that change your attitude going into
that<00:03:33.930> well<00:03:34.709> our<00:03:35.370> next<00:03:35.489> games<00:03:35.760> going<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.000> be

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
that well our next games going to be

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.449 
that well our next games going to be
much<00:03:36.269> harder<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.870> if<00:03:37.380> we<00:03:37.500> play<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.100> same<00:03:38.250> way

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
much harder and if we play the same way

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.340 
much harder and if we play the same way
we'll<00:03:38.640> probably<00:03:38.880> lose<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:39.959> have<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.200> pick

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
we'll probably lose so we have to pick

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.729 
we'll probably lose so we have to pick
