 court you know today is Tuesday is played 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.009
 applications reviews issue 'that or 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.590
 some tutorial or some little thing 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.180
 related to the world of good mac 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.250
 Today I am going to talk about an application 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.899
 which is called reflector is an application 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.390
 Well, it's good that in many of you 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.100
 you are asking me how I record my 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.649
 videos as I put my screen 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.300
 iphone or from my ipad on the screen of the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.890
 computer and then how he recorded the videos 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.290
 Well, I just do it with this 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.450
 application I do it with the application 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.310
 reflector before called reflection now 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.230
 it's called a reflector, I made you a video 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.030
 in the past talking about reflection but 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.530
 good as the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.329
 application and now they have changed the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.800
 name is now called reflector and also 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.760
 you ask me a lot and so it's good 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.149
 I'm going to update a little bit the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.829
 information of this application not good 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.350
 see that just to see the 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.990
 our team's screen in 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.799
 our on our computer we need 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.020
 have air play mirroring and the the first 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.370
 link works from the iphone 4s in 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.890
 forward and from 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.050
 2 onwards other equipment such as 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.580
 iphone 4 have to go play what happens 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.110
 that do not have mirroring this that he wants 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.090
 say that we can use this 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.150
 application but only to pass the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.440
 sound of music or videos that 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.390
 we are reproducing in 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.310
 our iphone 4 for example at 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.600
 computer we will watch the videos but 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.580
 without any problem 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.740
 let's listen to the audio the podcast the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.050
 music what we want that yes 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.250
 the springboard and the applications such 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.000
 which we will not be able to see in the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.400
 screen 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.190
 that's called mirroring making a mirror 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.500
 of the team's screen I'm at 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.730
 computer and well this is activated from 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.250
 the following way we go to the 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.770
 multitasking we do double tap and fix 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.810
 that we slide for this side we have to 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.230
 this little button that is the air play and 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.080
 note that we give mac and activate 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.180
 the duplication that in English is mirror and 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.130
 do not 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.380
 we give the ok and fijaros here and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.600
 Well then we screen our 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.570
 ios team and that's how I record the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.680
 reviews applications ios good 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.540
 this application the truth is that it is 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.550
 quite complete and it is very configurable 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.860
 let's see how this is configured 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.380
 application let's put this for a 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.850
 side here that does not bother us and good 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.050
 fixes the ones that we 're going first 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.950
 the vice from here we will be able to put 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.720
 in full screen this window does not stop 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.880
 see well the little buttons we see 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.900
 Normally we are not going to be able to 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.370
 close the connection 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.380
 this is good so we can not 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.209
 see the screen of our team I is 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.650
 that we have to go again like you 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.170
 I said before to the options of 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.010
 gameplay and give duplication 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.840
 see what cyclic marking equipment is 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.580
 always show up we can tell 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.440
 that puts us frame or that does not put us 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.270
 frame we can also tell you that the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.580
 frame be black or white 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.110
 let's leave it in black now fix 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.880
 that we can record from here if you want 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.010
 do good video tutorials of 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.989
 applications of the fixes that you are going 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.700
 to be able to do only with reflection to 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.810
 I like doing it with screen flow and 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.370
 I told you about writing flow the week 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.170
 last but good you can do it 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.760
 also with this application only 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.189
 will record the screen 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.019
 on youtube and you do not notice that here 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:17.260
 we are going to be able to resize a little 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.439
 in the frame of the iphone or fix that 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.239
 we will put to make it look butt to 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.980
 maximum possible in this way if we do 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.420
 we put it in full screen too 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.280
 it goes to the maximum possible so that's how I 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.829
 I record because I like to see it more 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.049
 possible to make them more visible 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.140
 videos and notice that we are going to 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.290
 can put on half side to make it look 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.329
 in the middle of space I'm not to like 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.819
 you want good here we can 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.650
 put the automatic orientation 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.970
 put it in the nes key little in portrait 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.709
 I have it in automatic then 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.379
 when I open an application a 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.459
 video game that looks on its side yes no 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.680
 simply the iphone is turned 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.849
 automatically the magnifying screen the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.319
 true that he has nothing else this is 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.019
 everything we can do but to me 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.519
 it seems quite understandable and for me 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.650
 is essential, as you already know for 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.239
 record all videos reviews not good 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.590
 here we have little things so much we are going to 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.319
 go to the preferences and we will see a 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.389
 how is this configured? 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.069
 you obviously need to have a team 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.530
 compatible with the play and also you have 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.060
 than having the computer and the computer ios 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.980
 connected to the same router 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.419
 for wifi by cable or whatever you want 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.820
 obviously the team will be 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.380
 connected by wifi but the computer the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.060
 mac or windows because this application 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.950
 it also works on windows you have to 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.290
 be connected or cable or wifi 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.910
 as we want, not good here 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.620
 we can mark a little bit all these 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.590
 resolutions do not fix that is already 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.320
 prepared for iphone 5 not me what 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.970
 I have on my device in this resolution a 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.440
 it works for me like this when they have the 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.910
 iphone 5 well then we'll see to see if 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.800
 It serves me and I have to change to this one 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.750
 I probably have it that way and for the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.060
 iphone and for the ipad, well, I think 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.320
 that looks pretty good here you can 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.660
 put the name that you want 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.000
 this name let's go here next 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.410
 this name to say that is the one that is going 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.080
 to see here when we go to the 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.760
 multitasking we slide we go to the 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.729
 option to go play note that down here 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.440
 It makes me great because if I put here 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.510
 macintosh here I would put a macintosh 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.040
 of agreement is simply for this 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.840
 Good addition we can put a 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.160
 no password to anyone 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.570
 can be put in our computer and 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.580
 put your screen on our computer 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.919
 no, we can also tell you that when 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.870
 start the connection let's put it in full 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.000
 screen this I do not do it I do it 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.600
 manually there is a keyboard shortcut that 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.540
 is 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.310
 efe command and we put on the screen of 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.020
 reflection to full screen what is 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.520
 how I do it and when we put it 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.170
 full screen we can tell you that 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.180
 put us a solid background color or 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.400
 well that we take the bottom that we 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.350
 we have on the desk 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.630
 I have the background of the desk to me 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.050
 like it more like that and the truth is that nothing 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.759
 plus 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.199
 this is the application of reflection is 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.150
 everything he does 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.770
 if you want to make video reviews is a 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.199
 application for me essential because 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.060
 I do not like those videos that are 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.710
 recorded with camera and such in some 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.449
 points there is little illumination I do not know to me 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.210
 I like doing it more like that I think it looks 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.350
 much better and good even if you do not want 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.820
 make videos reviews is an application 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.830
 quite interesting so good for 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.199
 example to see your photos of 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.380
 iphone or ipad on the mac passing the 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.910
 by going play not like good end 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.580
 this application what it does is convert 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.740
 the on the mac in a receiver or the equipment 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.270
 of windows in an air play receiver 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.880
 so we 're going to turn it into a kind 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.160
 of apple tv in this sense I love it for 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.990
 me is a pretty good application that 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.789
 Of course I recommend you for all 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.100
 those that you like this to share 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.599
 for the play with the computer and nothing 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.740
 more this application does not also have here 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.110
 I'm going to say goodbye I hope that I have 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.090
 liked the review and we'll see in 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.570
 next video of course if you want 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.570
 goodbye
