00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.319
 This sector is tips and tricks that shows you how to draw accurately 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.929
 infects 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.929
 as example characters are the horizontal bar 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.230
 the measures that made this up to appear on the screen 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.519
 but if not me 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.890
 want to hear a new court case sign more precisely on the lower right corner 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.630
 also catches on exactly that point 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.249
 we have to take care 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.859
 that of this 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.879
 that is the palette window 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.410
 it's trixie talent that he likes 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.160
 because restrictions that determine where you can put in short on which dots a 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.570
 regular viewers mean something new 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.729
 but if I select here on the horizontal bar 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.090
 and I want to start at the bottom right with her husband off 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.210
 then there comes close by then he is already waiting for some dots 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.370
 and to show that he did well or did well 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.920
 gripped, it also shows in the text box in this case on the right 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.520
 at the bottom so if I do not place then I know that I am exactly at the tip on the right 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 start at the bottom 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.439
 from the rooftops with the new road 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.090
 they make new ones 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.830
 that also demanded 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.220
 so that I am in the middle of that new right to get help from the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.290
 right side 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.290
 to make a new judge there 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.580
 then I go but points towards the center 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.920
 then he says to click more on their tracks 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 and we make a new rectangle 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.050
 well if that from rompuy insist that this point is at the top right 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.200
 place 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.310
 bottleneck top left 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.579
 so i dont agree can zoom in the judge closes it 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.140
 neat to I know that connects 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.560
 because I have just seen that fekter indicated on what points it said 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.190
 it's that way you can of course draw 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.790
 but the four that are best recommended here are the four that are dark gray 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.990
 on the disk to object 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.620
 five competition points 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.800
 ye points 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 he grabs to the side 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.940
 these settings outside of stick superette also make these objects easy 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.910
 can move 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.120
 they can make the lens pick up at the top left in this text below 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.440
 releasing her also applies to what inditex boxes has indicated that it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.840
 top left bottom right corner authenticity check if it's still hours 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.830
 have signed 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.829
 because I just know that's right 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.299
 if I miss what is required 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.299
 whatever this is not indicated in text so that way you know exactly 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.249
 whether you have drawn correctly
