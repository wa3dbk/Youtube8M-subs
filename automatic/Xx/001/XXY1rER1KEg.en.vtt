are<00:00:44.579> thinned<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.750> damaged<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.910> split

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
are thinned out and damaged if the split

are thinned out and damaged if the split
ends<00:00:48.180> persist<00:00:48.989> meaning<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.010> don't<00:00:50.340> cut

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
ends persist meaning if you don't cut

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.049 
ends persist meaning if you don't cut
off<00:00:50.850> those<00:00:51.270> split<00:00:51.660> ends<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.579> answer<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
off those split ends so the answer to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.680 
off those split ends so the answer to
that<00:00:54.300> question<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.170> simple<00:00:55.860> yes<00:00:56.570> trimming<00:00:57.570> out

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.590 
that question is simple yes trimming out
here<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.020> very<00:00:58.500> important<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.180> necessary

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
here is very important but not necessary

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.560 
here is very important but not necessary
to<00:01:00.660> make<00:01:01.050> our<00:01:01.260> hair<00:01:01.500> grow<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.699> important<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
continue to grow okay so it's going to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
continue to grow okay so it's going to
continue<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.210> accumulate<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.990> noticeable

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it is that's the length is going to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.440 
it is that's the length is going to
remain<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.310> said<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.270> would

remain so now with that said I would

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.450 
remain so now with that said I would
like<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:49.140> over<00:01:49.409> some<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.860> important

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
like to go over some very important

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.760 
like to go over some very important
facts<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.930> need<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> keep<00:01:52.500> certain

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
facts because we need to keep certain

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.340 
facts because we need to keep certain
things<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.369> mind<00:01:53.700> although<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.630> important

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
things in mind although it's important

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.770 
things in mind although it's important
to<00:01:55.439> trim<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.740> hair<00:01:55.890> trimming<00:01:56.759> our<00:01:57.060> hair<00:01:57.450> too

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
to trim my hair trimming our hair too

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.620 
to trim my hair trimming our hair too
frequently<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.920> actually<00:01:59.630> unnecessary

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
frequently is actually unnecessary

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
frequently is actually unnecessary
because<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:01.860> begin<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> cut<00:02:02.610> off

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
because that's how we begin to cut off

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.450 
because that's how we begin to cut off
the<00:02:03.000> length<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.990> we've<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.740> achieved

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the length that we've you know achieved

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.540 
the length that we've you know achieved
so<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.899> important<00:02:07.469> not<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.770> trim<00:02:08.520> my

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
so it's very important not to trim my

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.270 
so it's very important not to trim my
hair<00:02:08.670> too<00:02:09.060> frequently<00:02:09.720> meaning<00:02:10.229> once<00:02:10.739> once

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
hair too frequently meaning once once

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
hair too frequently meaning once once
every<00:02:11.550> week<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.300> too<00:02:12.540> frequently<00:02:13.020> once<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
every week is too frequently once I

it from getting damaged at least ninety

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.690 
it from getting damaged at least ninety
nine<00:03:39.510> point<00:03:39.840> nine<00:03:40.019> percent<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.190> time<00:03:41.430> and

nine point nine percent of the time and
that's<00:03:42.239> guaranteed<00:03:43.040> okay<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.700> in<00:03:45.000> theory<00:03:45.510> if<00:03:45.840> I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
that's guaranteed okay so in theory if I

hair never gets damaged you know we
basically<00:03:49.019> would<00:03:49.620> never<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.340> trim<00:03:50.700> it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
basically would never have to trim it

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.120 
basically would never have to trim it
but<00:03:51.510> I'm<00:03:51.840> not<00:03:52.109> going<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.290> go<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.650> far<00:03:52.709> because

but I'm not going to go that far because

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.770 
but I'm not going to go that far because
we<00:03:53.400> are<00:03:53.579> humans<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:54.329> always<00:03:54.480> going<00:03:54.720> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
we are humans and it's always going to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.360 
we are humans and it's always going to
be<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.900> little<00:03:55.140> bit<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.530> breakage<00:03:55.950> here<00:03:56.190> and

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
be a little bit of breakage here and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.190 
be a little bit of breakage here and
there<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.579> little<00:03:56.970> bit<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.390> split<00:03:57.630> ends<00:03:57.840> you

there a little bit of split ends you

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.890 
there a little bit of split ends you
know<00:03:58.350> we're<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.530> human<00:03:58.950> but<00:03:59.750> basically<00:04:00.750> what

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
know we're just human but basically what

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.259 
know we're just human but basically what
