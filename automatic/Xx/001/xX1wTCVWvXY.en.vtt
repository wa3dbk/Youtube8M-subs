00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.679
 if you want to know how to transform 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.799
 normal quinces boyfriend style 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.240
 jeans dating the video what 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.600
 you need to do it are jeans 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.020
 a pair of scissors a tweezers and a 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.020
 down I 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.280
 The first thing I did was put on pants 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.260
 upside down and mark some points of 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.910
 diagonal way to where 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.690
 approximately I wanted it to be the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.690
 long pants 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.059
 then like the pants to be able 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.159
 cut line I have some more 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.830
 Thick some manganitas or longer 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.839
 that depends on each person but if 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.580
 all must cover several parts the 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.699
 long pants to make it look 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.699
 best 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.460
 it's exactly the same on the other side if 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.170
 they do not look perfect no matter what the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.090
 point that is going to transfers naturally 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.860
 if you have some bigger ones and that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.860
 other said is much better 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:51.939
 and an intuition to cut the lines that 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.649
 we wanted along the pants what 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.090
 let's turn around let's cut the 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.869
 line that we had marked with the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.869
 points previously 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.959
 this step is the maternal one so 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.840
 you have to have a little patience 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.400
 but it really is not nothing there is what 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.069
 you have to do is to take out the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.750
 little blue streaks up to leave 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.750
 horizontally all the targets 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.070
 and sheriff point has great club not you 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.300
 worry there are some laps left 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.370
 blue and visit them later if you look 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.959
 well you have to pull straight illicit 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.280
 to make it easier to go out without a night 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.280
 who is waiting so much the track 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.690
 after you are done with that we will 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.270
 to trim the trousers of the part of 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.170
 down marks a line up to the long 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.170
 where do you want me to be 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.099
 and obviously this is the same as the other 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.720
 side so that I stay at the same 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.620
 height then the pants pegadito to the 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.620
 line and from there I 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.780
 and of course we cut over the 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.780
 marked lines 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.610
 I always live to tell you but also 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.440
 we are thread and needle and on the diagonal 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.830
 that we have cut previously we are going 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.830
 To sew 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.380
 to reinforce this part what I did for 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.910
 sew from top to bottom and then from 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.020
 down up on the same line 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.020
 to prevent it from breaking 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.810
 after sewing by both parties 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.190
 that is the result so if you see something 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.190
 boy but he will not even notice 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.830
 This is a very easy and quick way to 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.600
 renew your synte there is no need to 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:50.200
 buy new ones or throw away those that you no longer 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:51.820
 like and look down the bottom 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.729
 doubles and you do not notice at all that 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.919
 it is a little crooked 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.449
 like he did the golf style in zinc I 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.249
 I used some pants that I had left 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.439
 a little big so they would see each other a lot 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:03.089
 better so if you also want 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.469
 create this style I recommend you 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:06.860
 choose ones that you have left a bit 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.860
 big 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.590
