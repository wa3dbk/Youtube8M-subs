application to us okay and that's the

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.380 
application to us okay and that's the
key<00:00:44.140> thing<00:00:44.190> browser<00:00:45.190> technologies<00:00:45.850> in<00:00:46.240> an

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
key thing browser technologies in an

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.720 
key thing browser technologies in an
application<00:00:46.540> space<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.980> write<00:00:48.160> it<00:00:48.280> markup

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
application space you write it markup

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.220 
application space you write it markup
you<00:00:48.850> don't<00:00:49.000> write<00:00:49.150> it<00:00:49.180> with<00:00:49.390> C++<00:00:52.230> more

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
you don't write it with C++ more

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.520 
you don't write it with C++ more
accessible<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.130> make<00:00:54.760> custom

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
accessible to make custom

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.259 
accessible to make custom
dedicated<00:00:57.530> applications<00:00:59.710> then<00:01:01.089> do<00:01:02.089> you<00:01:02.180> have

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
dedicated applications then do you have

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:10.490 
dedicated applications then do you have
some<00:01:02.480> other<00:01:02.989> example<00:01:03.710> looking

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.460 

so<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.190> is<00:01:11.220> um<00:01:11.550> actually<00:01:12.510> Reuters<00:01:13.050> widget

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so this is um actually Reuters widget

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.040 
so this is um actually Reuters widget
they<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.950> created<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.960> going

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
they they created this it's just going

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.270 
they they created this it's just going
to<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.200> ahead<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.500> headlines

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.020 

it's<00:01:21.280> halfway<00:01:21.820> between<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.930> browser<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:24.220> feeds

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
it's halfway between a browser and feeds

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.670 
it's halfway between a browser and feeds
into<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.380> they've<00:01:26.560> made<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:27.040> widget<00:01:27.550> that<00:01:28.060> does

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
into so they've made a widget that does

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
into so they've made a widget that does
news<00:01:29.680> feeds<00:01:29.920> type<00:01:31.200> capabilities

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
news feeds type capabilities

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.710 
news feeds type capabilities
professional

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.920 

and<00:01:38.260> it<00:01:38.380> brings<00:01:38.530> down<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> day

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.710 

okay<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.070> running<00:01:44.370> so<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.450> looks<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
okay so this is running so it looks a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.890 
okay so this is running so it looks a
lot<00:01:45.870> like<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.250
