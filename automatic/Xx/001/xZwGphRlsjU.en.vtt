 We are writing the year 1948, the Germans are slowly gaining ground again 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.999
 under the feet also Franz Bierbichler Junior 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.990
 he works at a brewery 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.830
 and his company car is even a Mercedes his working day starts though 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.310
 early at half past six 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.539
 but in this hard time he is happy ever a secured one 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.539
 To have income 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
 ca 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.170
 So go with the Mercedes 170 German and continue to the editions 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.560
 The post-war era was to connect people like Franz Bierbichler 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.210
 reliant 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.210
 only then could the economy regain momentum 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.810
 of course, the reconstruction of Germany will also benefit the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.120
 Breweries no wonder because one is worked hard for each one 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.120

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.799
 The Mercedes-tuner 70 Mrs. Grit Chen Wagen from 1948 corresponds to that since 1936 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590
 built pre-war models 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.590
 and you can see that in many details 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.350
 as early as 1946, the lady Benz AG took the production despite the most difficult conditions 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.280
 again at first there was no electricity no coal neither state nor 1 2 yet 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.550
 Luckily, not all production halls and supplies are in ruins 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.289
 and ashes 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.509
 so there was the Mercedes hundred 70 next to the coach soon as a van 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 Sedan and convertible 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.739
