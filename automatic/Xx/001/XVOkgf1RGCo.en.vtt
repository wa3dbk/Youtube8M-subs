00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it before just to see how much was left

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.310 
it before just to see how much was left
on<00:00:26.790> the<00:00:27.000> map<00:00:27.210> because<00:00:27.689> i<00:00:27.869> wanted<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.169> know<00:00:28.290> if

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
on the map because i wanted to know if

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.859 
on the map because i wanted to know if
it<00:00:28.529> was<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:29.119> reasonable<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.390> bring<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.689> another

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it was a reasonable to bring in another

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.160 
it was a reasonable to bring in another
player<00:00:31.200> or<00:00:31.439> not<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.090> i<00:00:33.090> looked<00:00:33.600> through<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
player or not and i looked through and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.380 
player or not and i looked through and
this<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.980> literally<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> last<00:00:35.700> chamber<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
this is literally the last chamber of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.160 
this is literally the last chamber of
the<00:00:36.570> map<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> i<00:00:38.489> decided<00:00:39.120> against<00:00:39.660> bringing<00:00:39.960> in

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the map so i decided against bringing in

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.600 
the map so i decided against bringing in
another<00:00:40.410> person<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> play<00:00:41.160> through<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> with

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
another person to play through it with

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.520 
another person to play through it with
me<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.030> i<00:00:42.149> will<00:00:42.210> save<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> next<00:00:43.140> map

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
me and i will save that for the next map

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.860 
me and i will save that for the next map
which<00:00:43.770> I've<00:00:43.920> already<00:00:44.100> picked<00:00:44.460> out<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
which I've already picked out and it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
which I've already picked out and it

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
than I normally do and it's because I've

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.299 
than I normally do and it's because I've
solved<00:01:00.659> my<00:01:00.960> framerate<00:01:01.649> issues<00:01:01.980> while

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
solved my framerate issues while

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
solved my framerate issues while
recording<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.300> recording<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.929> fraps

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
recording I'm now recording with fraps

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.290 
recording I'm now recording with fraps
at<00:01:05.300> 62<00:01:06.300> 30fps<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.590> depends<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.300> what's

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
at 62 30fps it really depends on what's

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.520 
at 62 30fps it really depends on what's
happening<00:01:09.690> in<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> background<00:01:10.050> of<00:01:10.470> my

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
happening in the background of my

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.649 
happening in the background of my
computer<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> time<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.120> I<00:01:12.210> feel<00:01:12.479> like

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
computer at the time and if I feel like

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.620 
computer at the time and if I feel like
turning<00:01:12.840> everything<00:01:13.170> off<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.850> think<00:01:14.850> during

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
turning everything off I think during

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.070 
turning everything off I think during
here<00:01:15.930> you'll<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.590> switch<00:01:17.100> from<00:01:17.370> 30<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.780> 60<00:01:18.780> like

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
here you'll I switch from 30 to 60 like

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.860 
here you'll I switch from 30 to 60 like
mid<00:01:19.350> video<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.150> you'll<00:01:21.150> probably<00:01:21.390> notice<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
mid video and you'll probably notice it

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.290 
mid video and you'll probably notice it
when<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.080> some<00:01:22.530> lag<00:01:23.160> at<00:01:23.550> there's<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.150> point

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
when I get some lag at there's one point

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.730 
when I get some lag at there's one point
where<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.510> know<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.720> get<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.050> really<00:01:25.320> bad<00:01:25.560> luck

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
where I know I get like really bad luck

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.500 
where I know I get like really bad luck
for<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.980> few<00:01:26.130> seconds<00:01:26.520> that's<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
for a few seconds that's when it

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.590 
for a few seconds that's when it
switches<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:27.900> 30<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.620> 60<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.730> if<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.480> do

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
switches from 30 to 60 so if you do

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.060 
switches from 30 to 60 so if you do
notice<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.080> like<00:01:31.230> right<00:01:31.410> here<00:01:31.650> i<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.980> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
notice that like right here i think it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.770 
notice that like right here i think it
was<00:01:32.130> happening<00:01:33.890> that's<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.270> that's<00:01:36.270> why<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
was happening that's that that's why it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.390 
was happening that's that that's why it
happened<00:01:37.350> anyways<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> mean<00:01:40.920> this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
happened anyways so you know I mean this

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.850 
happened anyways so you know I mean this
is<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.000> pretty<00:01:42.270> easy<00:01:42.510> chamber<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
is actually a pretty easy chamber and it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
is actually a pretty easy chamber and it
makes<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> lot<00:01:44.430> easier<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.060> you're

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
makes it a lot easier now that you're

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.720 
makes it a lot easier now that you're
recording<00:01:45.690> at<00:01:45.990> its<00:01:46.140> decent<00:01:46.650> framerate<00:01:47.130> so

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
recording at its decent framerate so

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.540 
recording at its decent framerate so
it's<00:01:48.660> pretty<00:01:48.900> sweet<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.860> do<00:01:49.920> apologize<00:01:50.250> for

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
really plan out the the video too much

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.480 
really plan out the the video too much
to<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.720> fact<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.080> i<00:02:01.230> would<00:02:01.440> have<00:02:01.590> each<00:02:02.010> video

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
to the fact that i would have each video

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.140 
to the fact that i would have each video
be<00:02:02.790> 10<00:02:03.090> minutes<00:02:03.360> long<00:02:03.690> so<00:02:05.030> unfortunately<00:02:06.030> this
