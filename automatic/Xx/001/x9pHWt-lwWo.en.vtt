 hi how are you again in your 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.450
 sequence of recipes and cooking courses 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.550
 Peruvian dotcom in this opportunity to be 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.880
 human with milk that is a very dessert 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.500
 typical and very rich international and we're going 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.540
 to proceed to explain the ingredients 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.780
 that we are going to use and I already have each one 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.900
 already as living approximately a few 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.230
 liter and a half of water 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.020
 here we have a cup and a half of rice and 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.600
 than in a normal cup 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.940
 and that is what we are going to throw at each 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.860
 living first before we are going to give 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.260
 throw cinnamon and cloves already 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.780
 I have the nails of the clove already 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.450
 It will be about two twigs and about five or 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.239
 six cloves not much either 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.090
 we have to save this recipe what is 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 evaporated milk and if they did not have milk 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.760
 evaporated only fresh milk already 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.460
 then we use condensed milk and to 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.850
 give it a little more consistency and 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.470
 thickness and taste too and sweetness too 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.490
 use raisins to sate 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.800
 blondes or if they had black raisins and 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.950
 more sugar already thrown almost at the end 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.190
 and what we're going to throw is beaten egg 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.010
 well beaten and we'll be throwing it for 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.450
 that also has consistency then 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.840
 what we are going to do now is let's 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 throw him 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 the cinnamon and the clove we already throw the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 cinnamon and nokia 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.950
 then we put the nail and go to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.950
 add the rice 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.010
 rice is always necessary to wash 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.000
 take a little 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.000
 I admire sometimes 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.710
 we no longer need all the rice 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.550
 and let's leave for the merger mind in 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.910
 about 30 minutes 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.560
 time without the rice is already well cooked 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.560
 and reduced 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.980
 it's just that we're going to throw the rest of 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.210
 the ingredients but also the same 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.300
 step by step way 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.100
 already then we move and between a while 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.760
 we move again to give us the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.269
 rice 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.569
 then we leave this already and it is not 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.150
 but only after you cover 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.000
 we put a side because if we are not 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.739
 is going to pass then we leave that pre 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.739
 Cooked probably 30 minutes 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.269
 the half hour of our 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.099
 cooking another rice with milk makes 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.910
 about ten thousand I put the raisins are already 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:04.790
 here the raisins and then the raisins 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.790
 also already taking a little more 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.640
 the size a little bigger everything 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.160
 that we are going to throw him now is the sugar 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.970
 already 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.970
 we are going to throw 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.840
 The three tablespoons of sugar can be 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.630
 If you did not have white rafael 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.810
 blond sugar about three tablespoons of 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.810
 sugar 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.730
 well how bad then we mix and 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.090
 there we are going to throw the milk 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.760
 condition of volume but fresh milk 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.760
 no more if they did not have new milk slice 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.250
 and then pour the milk 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.250
 condensed 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.240
 milk is in the necessary amount 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.240
 it is not necessary to put waste 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.630
 at about 200 nothing like 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.280
 what is condensed milk 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.659
 And we cast him according to taste 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.919
 I touched it I'll take 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.919
 1 2 3 tablespoons 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.670
 then now we keep moving and what 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.280
 what to fight finally is 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.720
 the beaten egg 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.720
 all good 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.890
 i 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.020
 therefore so much 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.380
 and until then what still follows 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.700
 throwing is we throw in militia and go 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.700
 quickly removing 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.960
 this is in order that it be in all the 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.160
 point with a little bit of consistency and 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.290
 it's also flavored 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.290
 so 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.290
 all right 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:51.140
 sprinkle with pretty cinnamon and nothing 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.140
 more and we will do 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:03.550
 seen there we have a very dessert 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.550
 exquisite and very traditional 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.389
