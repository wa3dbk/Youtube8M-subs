able to Remax really fast look how many
resources<00:00:28.949> floating<00:00:29.580> right<00:00:29.670> now<00:00:29.820> there's

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
resources floating right now there's

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.939 
resources floating right now there's
still<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> pretty<00:00:30.990> large<00:00:31.199> battle<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.769> on

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
here the zerglings really chew on

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.700 
here the zerglings really chew on
through<00:00:33.690> those<00:00:33.840> stalkers<00:00:34.079> pretty<00:00:34.440> fast

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
through those stalkers pretty fast

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
through those stalkers pretty fast
stalkers<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:35.820> now<00:00:35.880> pressing<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.600> trying

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
stalkers are now pressing up here trying

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.930 
stalkers are now pressing up here trying
to<00:00:37.200> kill<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.500> much<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:37.950> there's<00:00:38.700> not

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to kill as much as they can there's not

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
to kill as much as they can there's not
much<00:00:39.210> left<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> field<00:00:39.870> right<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.320> sin

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
much left on the field right now for sin

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.080 
much left on the field right now for sin
so<00:00:40.680> he<00:00:40.770> needs<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.340> careful<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
so he needs to be kind of careful and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
so he needs to be kind of careful and
not<00:00:42.840> give<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.230> away<00:00:43.500> because<00:00:43.680> his

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
not give this away because his

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
not give this away because his
engagements<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.700> not<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.180> he

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
engagements are not going the way he

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.479 
engagements are not going the way he
wants<00:00:45.690> them<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.960> become<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:46.890> banding<00:00:47.250> drops

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
wants them to become more banding drops

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.130 
wants them to become more banding drops
for<00:00:47.730> dropping<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.360> run<00:00:48.570> side<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> force

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
for dropping on the run side the force

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.950 
for dropping on the run side the force
shields<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.030> sin<00:00:51.030> does<00:00:51.360> drop<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> rest<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
shields and sin does drop the rest of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.029 
shields and sin does drop the rest of
them<00:00:52.079> off<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.289> doesn't<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.770> enough<00:00:52.890> damage

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
them off and doesn't do enough damage

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.270 
them off and doesn't do enough damage
with<00:00:53.520> those<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.059> sin<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.870> floating<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.829> many

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
with those so sin is floating so many

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.779 
with those so sin is floating so many
resources<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.440> it's<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:59.250> insane

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
resources right now it's really insane

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.209 
resources right now it's really insane
the<00:01:00.629> Colossus<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.230> now<00:01:01.379> pressing<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:02.010> here

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the Colossus are now pressing up here

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
the Colossus are now pressing up here
he's<00:01:02.699> probably<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> kill<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.840> gold

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
he's probably going to kill this gold

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.100 
he's probably going to kill this gold
and<00:01:04.500> sin<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:06.060> able<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.510> put<00:01:06.659> his<00:01:06.810> army

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and sin is just not able to put his army

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.480 
and sin is just not able to put his army
together<00:01:07.229> quick<00:01:07.619> now<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
together quick now so you can see the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.070 
together quick now so you can see the
frailty<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> those<00:01:09.180> bailing<00:01:09.510> drops<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.960> they

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
frailty of those bailing drops if they

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
frailty of those bailing drops if they
don't<00:01:10.229> actually<00:01:10.470> hit<00:01:10.860> stuff<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.280> they're

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
don't actually hit stuff like they're

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.880 
don't actually hit stuff like they're
supposed<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.930> it's<00:01:12.930> pretty<00:01:13.200> hard<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.590> control

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
supposed to it's pretty hard to control

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.330 
supposed to it's pretty hard to control
its<00:01:14.100> kind<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.490> awkward<00:01:14.700> micro<00:01:15.979> but<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.130> comes

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
its kind of awkward micro but up comes

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700

enough<00:02:24.030> he<00:02:24.569> still<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> observer

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
but only three as you can see is very

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.740 
but only three as you can see is very
skimpy<00:03:22.819> sins<00:03:23.819> just<00:03:24.090> trying<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.389> pull<00:03:24.569> anything

together<00:03:25.170> he<00:03:25.530> possibly<00:03:25.739> can<00:03:26.099> right<00:03:26.280> now<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.609> I

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
together he possibly can right now but I

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.920 
together he possibly can right now but I
think<00:03:26.700> he<00:03:27.030> knows<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.239> he's<00:03:27.510> pretty<00:03:27.750> far

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930

I've<00:04:08.980> come<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.340> brood<00:04:09.580> lords<00:04:09.850> trying<00:04:10.150> to

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
I've come the brood lords trying to

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.540 
I've come the brood lords trying to
siege<00:04:11.170> these<00:04:11.500> stalkers<00:04:11.800> just<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.160> little<00:04:12.430> bit

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
siege these stalkers just a little bit

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.520 
siege these stalkers just a little bit
actually<00:04:13.210> pushing<00:04:13.780> them<00:04:13.900> off<00:04:13.990> pretty<00:04:14.290> well

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
actually pushing them off pretty well

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.740 
actually pushing them off pretty well
but<00:04:15.190> once<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.580> good<00:04:15.760> blink<00:04:16.030> gets<00:04:16.209> up<00:04:16.359> there<00:04:16.510> this

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
but once a good blink gets up there this

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.500 
but once a good blink gets up there this
could<00:04:16.989> be<00:04:17.140> too<00:04:17.380> much<00:04:17.620> for<00:04:18.090> sin<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.209> be<00:04:19.239> able<00:04:19.329> to

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
could be too much for sin to be able to

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.660 
could be too much for sin to be able to
deal<00:04:19.720> with<00:04:19.750> here<00:04:20.500> comes<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.859> blink<00:04:21.100> right<00:04:21.549> on
