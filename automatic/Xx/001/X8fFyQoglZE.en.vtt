00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.599
 Heidi he 

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:02.929
 and 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.260
 welcome to the Bundesliga tips 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.950
 12 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.950
 So the twelfth game day 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:12.099
 the opening game of this 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.069
 twelfth game day is 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:15.759
 Borussia Dortmund 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.109
 the Hamburg sports club 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.659
 and the top match he is between will be FSV Mainz 05 and Hannover 96 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.179
 add my jobs 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.769
 first play like that 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.050
 Opening match Espa day is 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.310
 eg me 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.910
 the Dortmund wins 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 and with one 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.399
 next meeting 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.880
 is between 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.610
 Werder Bremen and Eintracht Frankfurt 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.660
 and at this meeting there were in the 2008 season 2009 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 15 0 to bring victories 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.860
 but 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.350
 Accordingly, no good performance was shown on 6 0 against Stuttgart 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.720
 we lost 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.780
 Svenja is not played well 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.380
 So I think that Frankfurt decided the game 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 with Ralf threesome 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.020
 the next game is between VfL Wolfsburg and BAFTA 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.180
 Schneider-Kempf 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.110
 Borns the Schalke won last in Wolfsburg in 2009 13 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.290
 Accordingly, very long ago but I think that process 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.750
 A draw does not go out any more 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 a 2 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.100
 the next meeting 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 between the Festeis of Cologne and Borussia Mönchengladbach 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 to keep this carpet 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.179
 the next batch will be RST 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:15.599
 FC Kaiserslautern 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.059
 &amp; Cie 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:22.399
 The monument to VfB Stuttgart will fall six goals 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.599
 more doubtful and four stumbled 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 So rather in Stuttgart with 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.739
 the next match is between FC St Pauli and 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.639
 Bayer Leverkusen RPO 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.849
 only in this encounter a freak 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.089
 Fürth in Leverkusen 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.779
 Hamburg 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.309
 but that will change now 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.759
 the video or 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.519
 because Pauli are lying 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.609
 have a 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.609
 2 inches 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.119
 Topgame of this game day 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:13.149
 not more FSV Mainz 05 against Hannover 96 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.259
 I think the Mainz will win 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.959
 Two to Zero 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.449
 since Hannover the last five matches 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.359
 only one won 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.059
 the first is merely an encounter between 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.629
 the TSG Hoffenheim and topics SC Freiburg 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.859
 and yet thinks is the leader 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.559
 the home table 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:49.209
 and 7 again bad at home and that with a 13 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.130
 their last match of the matchday 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.550
 between FC Bayern Munich and the last building 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.429
 do not draw any more 2 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.499
 These were my tips for the twelfth matchday 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.319
 writes comments again 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.279
 Postl base 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:27.089
 and then we'll see each other again a great player
