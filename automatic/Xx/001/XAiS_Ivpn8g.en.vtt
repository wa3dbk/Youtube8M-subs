00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.650
 Katharina is a magician who works with 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.930
 strong skill that the peculiarity that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.540
 It has is that it hits the body to body 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 how can you be married and with the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.740
 proper combination of spells can 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.740
 do a destitute amount of damage 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.239
 passive craving after a murder helps 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.770
 catarina wins 25 gold and its 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.559
 cooling are reduced by 15 seconds 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.390
 that is , we can launch again the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.960
 q and the e to try to get more 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.960
 murders 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.710
 with votina leaves catalina a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.350
 knife throws bug that bounces between 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.770
 the objectives with the w canon effect 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.380
 secondary that we will explain later 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.130
 lightning speed catarina teleport 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.900
 to your target inflicting damage or 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.820
 they simply teleport dowry with the 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.850
 w gained a side effect that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.400
 we will explain w instincts later 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 killers this skill generates a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.990
 passive in caterina that what it does is 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.550
 increases the damage also if we activate it 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.040
 before launching any of the other 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.320
 skills such as cv the leaves re 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.140
 voters or the lightning speed 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 these gain side effects as per 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.550
 example is leaves bounce test reduces the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.320
 cure 50% and with and with the speed 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.380
 of lightning what we do is reduce the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.170
 damage we receive 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.899
 mortal lotus with the total catarina 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.579
 he stays there, he stops, punishing a 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.189
 spell that what it does is it's going 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.680
 throwing daggers at one two or three enemies 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.900
 that are close to her by entering 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.000
 an amount equal to 30% of your app 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.970
 well our online attitude should be 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.880
 rather passive 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.410
 at the end at the end of the subjects 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.340
 try to take the last blow with 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.369
 our sheet bounce teo the q 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.379
 and more or less you have to mentalize that 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.239
 we will receive a lot of damage 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.239
 you can only the three portions of life 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.460
 as if we see that the other magician does not 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.180
 It does a lot of damage and we want to play a 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.100
 little bit more aggressive at level 2 we 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.740
 from level 2 that is when we have 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.950
 and to the two main skills we 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.550
 we approach a little bit we launch the cv and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.210
 automatically the e for backwards in 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.920
 a subject of ours or in the subject 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.140
 closest enemy and so we can 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.980
 inflicting a little bit of damage so that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.959
 go so comfortable the other magician and more or 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.330
 least try to live up to him 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.450
 because until level 6 we will not have 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.720
 enough damage to kill him and it's 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:07.190
 important to throw away the potions of life 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.190
 and yes yes the other and if the other magicians 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.370
 we see that he has stretching the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.709
 life position we use the w and the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.819
 kÃ¼r on him with him as previous of 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.819
 approach to reduce the healing and 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:28.230
 well because he healed 50 percent 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.030
 less with the w and the cv then we will do 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.220
 that wasted life potions and that 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.430
 have to use more or even that 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.549
 have to go to the base and they were 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.599
 basically that's all in the line to 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.400
 level 6 the thing changes not us anymore 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.710
 we have enough potential 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.200
 to kill a magician sobradamente and 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.120
 the combo uses the essential combo of 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.780
 Catalina is throwing the knife 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.620
 throwing jump with w 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:05.120
 and if you see that it escapes flash and as 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:09.270
 we have seen here flash and the ultimate 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:15.360
 and inflicts indecent year amounts 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:17.610
 and you're good from level 6 and 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.600
 we have enough potential as 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.910
 to kill a magician more then 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.160
 we will use everything to get our 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.410
 deaths is to say 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.890
 we will throw the voter blade before 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.470
 to approach the combo of the w and the e 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.400
 to reduce the damage received in case of 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.170
 some casual hit and throw us if 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.420
 we see that we do not reach the objective 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.570
 launch flash to get closer and now 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.200
 directly the entire combo if we see 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.380
 that still eludes us he will reach us 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.570
 the right range to launch the ignite and 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.780
 with a little bit of luck we will take out the 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.750
 death that will be necessary at the beginning 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.750
 with one with one or two deaths we're going already 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.260
 well enough because if they have not 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.820
 exceeded a lot in farm yo 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.820
 and the thing will not go wrong 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.670
 as objects for catarina at the beginning 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.230
 of the game we will choose boots and three 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.480
 life positions that will give us a little 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.890
 more survival to the line to 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.870
 try to make enough money as 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.450
 to buy the revolver and not have to 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.660
 Go back and buy more potions like 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.700
 second base we will try to finish the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.520
 boots and make them like boots 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.670
 penetration and buy some of the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.110
 components of the banksy deadly cap 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.240
 then we will finish the deadly cap and 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.510
 we will start the bass the cane of relive 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.970
 always by the giant belt after 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.730
 we will finish the saber and we will remember 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:58.100
 launch the passive when we use the 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:01.260
 last and the after the vacuum cup 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.450
 as last we can choose a scepter 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.160
 abyssal or if not for a guardian angel 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.550
 that will give us more survival and 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.750
 we will get resuscitated 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.480
 good now to finalize the guide we're going 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.660
 to see what a ladybird can do 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.630
 more or less devised 50 and good here 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.760
 our hours do not start 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.610
 we started a team fight is they have the 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.280
 carry I approach like someone who does not want 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.050
 the thing 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.409
 and here I hope they come together 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:36.909
 important and there you already throw everything you're 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:41.389
 the amount of damage is more or less 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:43.550
 tremendous already and as the times of 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.240
 reuse are not very very 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.190
 big 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.670
 because also with the passive 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.660
 every flour is bestial reduces 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.240
 cooling and in a team lack of 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.820
 time to throw to the best if you have 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.820
 luck and you get a triple you get 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.730
 what do you do, you can throw several 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:10.300
 hit schultis good as cherry on top 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:12.730
 the guide here a good triple of what 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.800
 you have to try to evade more or 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.770
 less if you put yourself in the background without your 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.900
 team you sell you will get a bible or 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.400
 one double or one triple and you can still 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.490
 come out alive 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:28.490
 always try to focus on the 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.360
 harris to that of wallace to try 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.360
 destroy it well
