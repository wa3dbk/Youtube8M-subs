00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.479 
we we just we want to just do a good
relay<00:03:03.769> whatever<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.920> place<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:07.159> we<00:03:08.159> think<00:03:08.370> to

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
relay whatever the place and we think to

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.479 
relay whatever the place and we think to
the<00:03:08.640> Future<00:03:08.970> team<00:03:09.239> without<00:03:10.099> incident<00:03:11.099> in<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the Future team without incident in the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.119 
the Future team without incident in the
in<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.390> next<00:03:13.200> next<00:03:13.650> next<00:03:13.829> year<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.849> it's<00:03:15.510> a

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
in the next next next year so it's a

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.659 
in the next next next year so it's a
opportunity<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.280> test<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.879> new<00:03:18.150> new<00:03:18.810> relay<00:03:19.139> with

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
opportunity to test a new new relay with

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:24.110 
opportunity to test a new new relay with
with<00:03:20.669> a<00:03:20.700> new<00:03:21.060> new<00:03:21.419> guy<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.889> we'll<00:03:22.889> see<00:03:23.069> do<00:03:24.060> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
with a new new guy and we'll see do you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.729 
with a new new guy and we'll see do you
know<00:03:24.419> already<00:03:24.660> your<00:03:25.049> position<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.829> relay

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
know already your position in the relay

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.300 
know already your position in the relay
perhaps<00:03:28.739> we<00:03:29.609> don't<00:03:29.760> know<00:03:30.709> perhaps<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.669> two

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
perhaps we don't know perhaps on the two

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.460 
perhaps we don't know perhaps on the two
the<00:03:35.310> two<00:03:35.340> first<00:03:35.669> but<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.180> don't<00:03:36.810> know<00:03:36.959> perhaps
