pretty nice the port as you can see

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.680 
pretty nice the port as you can see
isn't<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> regular<00:00:51.180> cord<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> a

length is 10 um wait now chordoma to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
length is 10 um wait now chordoma to
core<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.680> uh<00:01:11.130> oh<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.119> hundred

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
core it's uh oh it's a hundred

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
core it's uh oh it's a hundred
centimeters<00:01:13.200> plus<00:01:13.350> minus<00:01:13.740> five<00:01:14.130> centimeters

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
so you may get 10 100 centimeters or 105

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.370 
so you may get 10 100 centimeters or 105
or<00:01:19.880> 95<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.450> depending<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.810> where<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> it

can't<00:05:03.920> show<00:05:04.130> you<00:05:04.160> that<00:05:04.250> well<00:05:04.610> with<00:05:05.120> my<00:05:05.570> actual

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
can't show you that well with my actual

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.640 
can't show you that well with my actual
ones<00:05:06.460> but<00:05:07.460> there's<00:05:07.670> the<00:05:07.820> button<00:05:08.170> them<00:05:09.170> and<00:05:09.560> the

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
ones but there's the button them and the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.860 
ones but there's the button them and the
microphones<00:05:10.160> on<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.490> opposite<00:05:10.880> side<00:05:11.120> there's

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
microphones on the opposite side there's

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.850 
microphones on the opposite side there's
the<00:05:12.050> 3.5<00:05:12.680> millimeter<00:05:13.120> gold-plated<00:05:14.120> jack<00:05:14.860> this

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
the 3.5 millimeter gold-plated jack this

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.100 
the 3.5 millimeter gold-plated jack this
and<00:05:16.370> there's<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.820> splitter<00:05:17.090> has<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.570> cut<00:05:18.080> on

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
and there's the splitter has a cut on

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.890 
and there's the splitter has a cut on
the<00:05:18.560> cable<00:05:18.800> splitter<00:05:19.280> built<00:05:19.550> in<00:05:19.730> and<00:05:20.000> they

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
the cable splitter built in and they

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.630 
the cable splitter built in and they
show<00:05:21.110> it<00:05:21.260> in<00:05:21.410> just<00:05:21.620> all<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.920> other<00:05:22.040> colors<00:05:22.340> and

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
show it in just all the other colors and

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.730 
show it in just all the other colors and
what<00:05:22.760> it<00:05:22.880> would<00:05:23.000> look<00:05:23.150> like<00:05:23.410> then<00:05:24.410> this<00:05:24.560> is

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
what it would look like then this is

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.260 
what it would look like then this is
what<00:05:24.890> you<00:05:25.040> get<00:05:25.280> when<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.550> actually<00:05:25.730> buy<00:05:26.210> the

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
what you get when you actually buy the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.620 
what you get when you actually buy the
hand<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:27.410> headphones<00:05:27.830> get<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.820> manual<00:05:29.270> a

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
hand the headphones get the manual a

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.770 
hand the headphones get the manual a
limited<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:30.710> one<00:05:30.919> year<00:05:31.220> warranty<00:05:31.520> so<00:05:32.450> say<00:05:32.630> they

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
limited to one year warranty so say they

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.110 
limited to one year warranty so say they
break<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:33.380> it's<00:05:33.980> not<00:05:34.160> like<00:05:34.340> your<00:05:34.580> fault<00:05:34.910> like

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
break and it's not like your fault like

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.820 
break and it's not like your fault like
if<00:05:35.240> you<00:05:35.390> actually<00:05:35.600> like<00:05:36.020> take<00:05:36.260> them<00:05:36.410> and<00:05:36.530> smash

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
if you actually like take them and smash

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.950 
if you actually like take them and smash
them<00:05:36.860> that's<00:05:37.700> your<00:05:37.910> fault<00:05:38.120> if<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.450> drop<00:05:38.780> them

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
them that's your fault if you drop them

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.930 
them that's your fault if you drop them
and<00:05:39.140> they<00:05:39.230> break<00:05:39.440> it's<00:05:40.160> your<00:05:40.370> fault<00:05:40.580> but<00:05:40.790> these

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
and they break it's your fault but these

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.060 
and they break it's your fault but these
probably<00:05:41.480> won't<00:05:41.840> break<00:05:42.169> just<00:05:42.440> by<00:05:42.650> falling

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
probably won't break just by falling

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.900 
probably won't break just by falling
because<00:05:43.760> these<00:05:44.030> are<00:05:44.210> actually<00:05:44.990> metal<00:05:45.910> give

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
because these are actually metal give

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.250 
because these are actually metal give
you<00:05:47.030> a<00:05:47.060> cheap<00:05:48.820> these<00:05:49.820> probably<00:05:50.630> won't<00:05:50.960> break

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
you a cheap these probably won't break

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.980 
you a cheap these probably won't break
just<00:05:51.440> dropping<00:05:52.190> but<00:05:52.850> if<00:05:52.970> you<00:05:53.120> like<00:05:53.300> smash<00:05:53.750> them

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
just dropping but if you like smash them

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.450 
just dropping but if you like smash them
or<00:05:54.110> something<00:05:54.230> intentionally<00:05:55.010> they<00:05:55.220> will

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
or something intentionally they will

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.210 
or something intentionally they will
break<00:05:55.760> but<00:05:56.750> if<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:57.020> like<00:05:57.290> if<00:05:57.590> all<00:05:57.710> of<00:05:57.740> a<00:05:57.860> sudden

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
break but if you like if all of a sudden

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.310 
break but if you like if all of a sudden
maybe<00:05:58.460> one<00:05:58.880> year<00:05:58.910> is<00:05:59.480> all<00:05:59.750> of<00:05:59.840> a<00:05:59.870> sudden<00:06:00.110> messed

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
maybe one year is all of a sudden messed

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.500 
maybe one year is all of a sudden messed
up<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.650> it's<00:06:00.830> because<00:06:01.130> like<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.520> cord<00:06:01.880> is

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
up and it's because like the cord is

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.770 
up and it's because like the cord is
like<00:06:02.570> cut<00:06:03.050> almost<00:06:03.230> like<00:06:03.650> in<00:06:03.980> t<00:06:04.310> really<00:06:04.780> then

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
like cut almost like in t really then

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.300 
like cut almost like in t really then
yeah<00:06:06.020> you<00:06:06.050> can<00:06:06.320> sign<00:06:06.500> it<00:06:06.680> didn't<00:06:06.919> in<00:06:07.010> the<00:06:07.130> one
