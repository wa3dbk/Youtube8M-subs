00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.460
 follows nikola gavric fishing guide 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.769
 high saone on the set of activists 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.360
 we are currently on the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.059
 shore of the lake's pike water 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.100
 field of the can farm and whose 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.590
 class now it's autumn the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.939
 pike enters into activity these jellies on 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.560
 morning the leaves have fallen 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.990
 so here we start having a beautiful 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.500
 a nice pike activity 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.109
 nice hunt 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.109
 the fish are biting but you have to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 present them with a size 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.360
 quite consistent size for the average 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 for pike he will reach a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.710
 twenty centimeters between 15 and 15 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 and 25 centimeters 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 so we'll see a little bit there how 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.280
 I do for fishing this type of plan 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.610
 of water so the characteristics of these 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.489
 ponds is that they have so its of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.430
 very low surface on average 2 to 3 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 hectares and especially of very low 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 depth also so we'll have a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.600
 problem as a fisherman or time 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.339
 it is to present growlers but to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 shallow depths 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.830
 so we can not use 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.540
 montages classic style j guesde 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.979
 because in general to mount 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 their two of theirs that size 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.270
 we will end up with big 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.520
 hooks certainly but also a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.930
 big fat a big fat 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.049
 not what we are not going to be 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.490
 all paying on areas on areas 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.560
 very shallow as one ensures its 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.439
 ponds the texan hooks we're going 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.470
 use for wholesale assembly their 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.720
 chad type so are the two weeks 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.560
 bay throughout that of bmc 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.909
 so there is the normal version so there is 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.340
 just by cons what is very 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.840
 interesting is the system pulls 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.700
 cap that will allow a very very 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.740
 good retention of their sweat on the hook 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.500
 so this one here is a texan hook 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.329
 it's just the system of the task that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.180
 differs the second swing bay touques 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.250
 has lead on the stem of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.140
 the hook which will allow him to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.969
 stabilize the swimming of their 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.580
 big cat who sometimes have a very 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.000
 very big 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.430
 rowling what they see this lead is going 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.590
 replay the role of a who on on 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.190
 the hook can also be moved 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.170
 on the ramp 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.750
 we can position it in the lead for 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.970
 to have a swimming type dead manhandled his 4th 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.480
 jerky or when fishing in linear 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.360
 so we put the lead on the belly 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.080
 from their for peace frozen fishing in 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.150
 linear to stabilize flax and 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.280
 third is paying everything is a swing 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.650
 beasts whose who is who is leaded on 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.810
 the ramp and who also has a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.480
 small a small palette for a 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.120
 optimal mount there is a little trick if 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.959
 theirs is not already split 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.170
 I advise to do a little 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.880
 knife incision so it will 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.980
 that theirs is not constrained by 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.060
 by the hook so we do a little 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.040
 incision on the back where the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.890
 their or the hook will come out and 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.959
 also on the belly 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.120
 we are alone we do it well 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.810
 linear I pile hair to where 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.810
 the hook will come out 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.810
 then we understand the hook we go the 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.200
 we will use the little pull 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.860
 cap for the to fix the head of 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.280
 pain once we did that so we 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.160
 can we introduce the hook on the on the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.780
 swimmer fish to see where 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.150
 the hook must come out once 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.640
 goes the pic is then so we take advantage of 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.130
 the little ford we did under the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.940
 belly of theirs to pass the hook and 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.350
 it comes out on the back of theirs the same 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.269
 always the same in the form we have 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.390
 done and once we did this editing 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.459
 here it is seen that the time is 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.769
 really presents very well it's not 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.060
 at all against a parent by the hook 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.890
 and he can really have a swim 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.480
 very very kind to the hook is good 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.310
 dimensioned in relation to the size of the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.290
 theirs and what makes we still 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.549
 very good chances of success at 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.500
 moment of the attack 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.650
 releasing very easily to allow 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.239
 anchoring in the mouth of the fish 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.010
 this is not the case it will not be the case with 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.130
 all theirs if you want to ride 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.930
 really a very very big here they are 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.250
 when we really spend the size the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.870
 size above 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.150
 while they are very bulky very 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.160
 long and very bulky so that's fine 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.010
 begin to put a concern since the 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.700
 the arming with the string gates is 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.310
 ineffective 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.860
 so what are we going to do in this case 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.080
 simply so we did well 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.880
 our fantasy on our knife photo on 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.370
 theirs so this time I'm doing it to 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.510
 longer sentence 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.980
 I am three centimeters more 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.770
 more to be able to add a triple that 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.780
 will complete the armament on the back on the 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.270
 back of theirs and so that's number 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.169
 one on which I put so a small 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:59.780
 guen silicone and then just 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:03.770
 simply to pass the triple ya on 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.780
 the tip of the swing bay touques and so 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.810
 there we had we did our small slit 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.270
 so just slide the triple in 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.230
 the little slit and so theirs the 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:18.110
 find perfectly armed with 2 both 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.700
 tips of the triple on the back so here 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.970
 we will see a little how it swims in 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.970
 water now 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.389
 hop 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.720
 at 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
 at 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.440
 at 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.660
 at 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.750
 at
