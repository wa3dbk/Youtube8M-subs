00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.460
 at the same time your friends my name is denis 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.240
 fights you are on the pitfall channel 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.100
 aif.ru 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.939
 we 'll talk about how 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.189
 train your games games this sick 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.869
 a question of so many people and maybe 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.359
 if you have been to the gym then you 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.589
 have seen some comrades train 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.179
 calf standing or playing sitting well in general 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.450
 here you need to give a very important explanation 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.059
 the very beginning the fact is that both 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.289
 simulator in general trains not quite 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.050
 same muscles 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.969
 because if a man holds his leg 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.100
 unbent at the knee that is 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.570
 if he do exercise with him 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.510
 the screen really works 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.399
 but if a person's leg is bent in 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.850
 the knee joint then does not work 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.219
 caviar 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.129
 that muscle works which is under 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.749
 caviar it is called soleus then 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:04.720
 there is the most important thing we need to understand 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:06.670
 performing this exercise lifting on and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.920
 beautifully is that it 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.660
 exercise not on games this exercise on 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.670
 that muscle which is under 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:20.050
 caviar which is longer here it goes 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.970
 under the calf, it is attached below and located 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.700
 actually here by this one 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.320
 massive our cut yet how are you 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.080
 understand and very important to train 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.150
 because if you will have a very 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.490
 big soleus and respectively 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.340
 it will cause it to be 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.200
 stick out your circle the game will 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.940
 look more massive and here's 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.760
 an exercise that trains flounder 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.690
 you can see it now sitting on the calf 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.240
 what are the nuances 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.340
 and the most important nuance is 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.190
 that the exercise is performed in a very 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.210
 short amplitude 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.340
 see how short we have 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.840
 amplitude 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.670
 that is, if we raise the biceps at 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.190
 we have a big amplitude 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.260
 and if we raise at the expense of our 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.810
 flounder guilt tom slab yes much shorter to 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.670
 it says something about that for one thing and that 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.460
 same time we will perform fewer reps 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.920
 because amplitude is shorter than that 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.740
 the conclusion that we need in this exercise 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.950
 do more reps if in the usual 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.650
 exercise we do 6 12 reps then 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.640
 in this exercise we need to do 10 20 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.860
 reps i always recommend this 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.200
 exercise using large enough 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.510
 weights because our kampala is visible all 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.330
 our legs and the edge are very strong muscular 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.240
 groups and in every possible way avoid any 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.190
 jerking movements that is sat down and how 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.380
 machine very smoothly perform 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.010
 exercise top point doing peak 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.340
 cut by a second at the lowest point 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.230
 stretch our muscles and in such a smooth 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.150
 Mode try to make at least 10 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.490
 reps if you get 15-20 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.290
 it's still a ray 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.430
 and after some time you will start 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.610
 feel burning after that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.000
 to cut 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.460
 amplitude of movement and finally finish 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.640
 your flounder is a prominent exercise 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:24.280
 partial amplitude after you 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.860
 finish doing this exercise i 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.990
 I recommend you stretch your game and 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.030
 soleus to stretch 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.910
 our games flounder visible need to pull 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.060
 sock yourself it can be done either 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:42.880
 artificially or something i personally do more often 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.420
 all i'm pushing i rest my sock on 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.910
 thing 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.220
 and I lean to this subject 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.250
 accordingly, it happens to me 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.610
 stretching the false muscles there is another 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.510
 option you can leave your foot back 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.560
 and most lean forward 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.810
 accordingly in this position again 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.160
 stretching occurs 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.590
 appropriate muscles and why is it 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.220
 done as we worked in partial 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.340
 amplitude 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.920
 our muscles begin to enslave it neither 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.990
 good and not bad adaptation 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.390
 any athlete to show 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.220
 great strength 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.140
 the muscle is forced to work partial 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.579
 shortened amplitude respectively 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.550
 when the muscle works shortened 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.870
 amplitude it loses its flexibility 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.180
 enslaves to this not 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.850
 it happened you need to either work in 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.310
 full amplitude either b constantly 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.710
 stretch this muscle after exercise 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.080
 what is especially important in this exercise 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.350
 so how do we work in a very short 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.460
 amplitude in general is a lift on us and 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.460
 sit baby
