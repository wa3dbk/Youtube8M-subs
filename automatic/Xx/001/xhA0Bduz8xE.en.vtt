00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.109 

what<00:01:01.830> yeah<00:01:02.830> it's<00:01:03.009> got<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.189> full<00:01:03.430> system<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.909> crop

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
what yeah it's got a full system of crop

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.450 
what yeah it's got a full system of crop
pitch<00:01:04.420> exhaust<00:01:04.839> with<00:01:05.439> a<00:01:05.470> Power<00:01:05.770> Commander<00:01:06.070> was

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
pitch exhaust with a Power Commander was

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.580 
pitch exhaust with a Power Commander was
dyno<00:01:06.729> tuned<00:01:07.060> so<00:01:07.689> that's<00:01:07.840> about<00:01:07.990> 10<00:01:08.320> horsepower

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
dyno tuned so that's about 10 horsepower

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.190 
dyno tuned so that's about 10 horsepower
more<00:01:08.979> right<00:01:09.189> there<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.600> I'm<00:01:10.720> pushing<00:01:10.900> out

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
more right there so I'm pushing out

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.580 
more right there so I'm pushing out
probably<00:01:11.909> 130<00:01:12.909> horsepower<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:14.350> do<00:01:14.409> you<00:01:14.470> got

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
probably 130 horsepower what do you got

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.510 
probably 130 horsepower what do you got
on<00:01:14.619> yours

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:34.210

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.339 

yeah<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> think<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.760> weighs<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.269> 400<00:03:34.200> or

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
yeah I think this weighs like 400 or

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.910 
yeah I think this weighs like 400 or
something<00:03:36.379> so<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.409> was<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> little

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
something so that was a little

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.910 
something so that was a little
interesting<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:40.019> guy's<00:03:40.200> bike<00:03:40.439> was<00:03:40.650> kind<00:03:40.829> of

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
interesting the guy's bike was kind of

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.259 
interesting the guy's bike was kind of
clapped<00:03:41.159> out<00:03:41.370> though<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.579> mean<00:03:41.819> if<00:03:41.939> you<00:03:42.030> didn't

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
clapped out though I mean if you didn't

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.580 
clapped out though I mean if you didn't
notice<00:03:42.390> there's<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> bunch<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.019> stickers<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
notice there's a bunch of stickers on it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.830 
notice there's a bunch of stickers on it
and<00:03:44.189> when<00:03:44.370> he<00:03:44.400> breaks<00:03:44.640> he<00:03:44.939> was<00:03:45.060> pulsing<00:03:45.569> his

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
and when he breaks he was pulsing his

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.600 
and when he breaks he was pulsing his
rear<00:03:46.079> brake<00:03:46.319> instead<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:46.920> staying<00:03:47.159> on<00:03:47.400> it

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
rear brake instead of just staying on it

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.960 
rear brake instead of just staying on it
I<00:03:47.790> assume<00:03:48.329> because<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:49.700> something's<00:03:50.700> leaking

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
I assume because is something's leaking

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.490 
I assume because is something's leaking
and<00:03:51.299> he's<00:03:51.390> losing<00:03:51.540> pressure<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.170> he<00:03:52.260> has<00:03:52.349> to

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
and he's losing pressure so he has to

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.440 
and he's losing pressure so he has to
pump<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.040> way<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.670> builds<00:03:54.150> up<00:03:54.420> pressure

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
pump it that way it builds up pressure

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.390 
pump it that way it builds up pressure
in<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.870> fluid<00:03:55.079> pushes<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.620> Pistons<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.310> then

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
in the fluid pushes the Pistons and then

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.789 
in the fluid pushes the Pistons and then
it<00:03:56.519> releases<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.599> pressure<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:58.500> then<00:03:58.590> he<00:03:58.680> has

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
it releases the pressure and then he has

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.380 
it releases the pressure and then he has
to<00:03:58.980> pump<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.459> again<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.849> keep<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.030> pressure

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
to pump it again to keep the pressure

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.960 
to pump it again to keep the pressure
going<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.680> his<00:04:01.920> bike<00:04:02.099> was<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.310> little<00:04:02.579> clapped<00:04:02.819> I

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
going so his bike was a little clapped I

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.879 
going so his bike was a little clapped I
said<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.420> had<00:04:03.540> some<00:04:03.840> computer<00:04:04.500> issue<00:04:04.680> or

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
said it had some computer issue or

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.970 
said it had some computer issue or
whatever<00:04:05.040> but<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.700> know<00:04:06.319> it<00:04:07.319> was<00:04:07.440> still<00:04:07.709> fun

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
I have to get it to like eight or ten

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.779 
I have to get it to like eight or ten
thousand<00:04:19.079> rpms<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.799> launch<00:04:20.010> properly

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
thousand rpms just to launch properly

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.969 
thousand rpms just to launch properly
and<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.690> burns<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.079> crap<00:04:22.380> out<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.590> your<00:04:22.740> clutch

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
clutch just for a super drag race

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.390 
clutch just for a super drag race
because<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.240> never<00:04:27.449> do<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.930> only<00:04:28.620> go<00:04:28.800> fast<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.310> a
