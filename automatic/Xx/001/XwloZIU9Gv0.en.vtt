00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:09.769
 the living of poems and the novels photos 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.769
 planets that rain that moves 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.350
 and how are they and I hope they are 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.529
 very good the god or some secret of 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.380
 caliber dance eight warfare let's see 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.360
 to a ghost to a ghost soldier to 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.010
 be more specific and the only thing 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.140
 we have to do to see this is to go to 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.419
 map of ritter and put us in mode 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.189
 viewer that by the way for those who 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.350
 what will the viewer try to do 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.430
 you do not have it from the beginning what 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.500
 you have to activate from the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.660
 configuration of the game in mode 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.430
 local for those who will try it and 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.460
 they do not find the viewer mode like me 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.350
 I was like 20 minutes there like a fool 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.519
 and trying to put viewer mode up 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.859
 that I realized it was in 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.769
 configuration as we go to this 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.019
 mountain and we have to get under the 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.210
 This is how cool you get on the mountain map 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.609
 The only thing I do know is how to push the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.530
 mountain pushes pushes boom you get and 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.899
 you are going to see everything very strange you will be 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.200
 down the map that looks pretty cool 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.090
 but by the way you're going to get dizzy 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.680
 I very much was a time when if 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.780
 I started to hurt my head 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.180
 like half an hour trying to take the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.250
 better angle of this was even 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.230
 trying to take it up close 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.480
 it's something very interesting and for that reason 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.310
 I think it's something super cool of the game 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.380
 as I tell you they just go down the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.870
 mountain and they will be there moving 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.880
 until in the center they find this 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.400
 I'm going to zoom in on that figurine 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.540
 they go more or less to what I mean 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.000
 logically you can see that it is a 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.760
 soldier is like the shadow of a soldier 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.950
 and you can see very well that it's something 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.420
 do not go to say there is no roe there is nothing 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.400
 there is nothing clear that there is something 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.140
 hard to see there were people who started 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.850
 say that you're a lenderman because of the fact 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.369
 that when you approach you start to move 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.990
 the entire screen and disappears more than 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.540
 nothing is a soldier who is below the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.759
 Retweet map is super interesting 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.649
 who knows why it 's there and what's more 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.080
 rare is that it makes you bothered 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.720
 to put it in a very difficult place of 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.850
 see is like two layers below the map 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.130
 it is not at first sight because 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.410
 example there were already waterfalls or boats things 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.900
 so the times then then the soldier 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.540
 it's like very hidden I do not know if this is 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.970
 some interest or something that they left 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.880
 just for leaving super interesting this 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.370
 little ghost soldier because if he 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.240
 you see from afar it looks like a ghost that's why 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.220
 I said ghost 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.960
 that looks cooler if I put a ghost 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.910
 besides that the ego has the form of 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.910
 ghost and I am a ghost 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.040
 you know you know you're super bastard what 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.980
 that has this set of secrets there 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.410
 several very good so I would like no 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.780
 I know if always but even upload some 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.150
 two more that are very cool just that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.520
 for some reason this game more and feel 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.200
 bad I do not know if he's possessed or something 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.180
 but when I play carlos de uri me 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.430
 my head starts to hurt 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.500
 happened to me when I was recording antier me 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.270
 happened when I was going to record something else 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.640
 his head began to hurt when he played 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.410
 call of duty I do not know if there is a 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.570
 spirit that says look when it roe 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.030
 game is going to hurt your head who knows 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.980
 the secret the truth is very difficult to 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.200
 see and you start to stress when I 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.730
 you want to record mostly because of the fact 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.040
 how do I tell you that you start 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.080
 remove as they see just move tantito the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.390
 lever and starts to disappear it 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.940
 starts to cheat, it starts to move this 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.680
 is a soldier is the model of a soldier 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.900
 at first I thought it was like a child 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.970
 or a monster or something like that to do the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.050
 video a bit more accurate and that after 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.050
 do not tell me 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.210
 I was a kitten, you were wrong and I was there 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.280
 shit I said it was a dog because to 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.820
 sometimes he did not investigate as well and things happen 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.230
 A) Yes 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.450
 this time I tried to do the best 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.340
 I could be a soldier I saw that a 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.550
 person said that this soldier was there 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.260
 because when they make the game they use 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.450
 this type of models to see if the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.820
 soldiers fit in places that I do not know if 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.860
 be true or not be true it makes sense 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.840
 what makes me weird is because I do not 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.670
 disappeared and they left it as 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.860
 to the bottom of the map in the center of 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.110
 map a soldier in the call of your and 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.730
 advanced warfare the hidden very cool 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.530
 so far I'm going to leave this secret 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.660
 remember that if you are very good for 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.150
 comment and want to keep seeing secrets 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.650
 from time to time of varied games that 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.240
 call me attention just leave your me 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.800
 like and so I say oh look gave it to me 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.600
 I already know that he wants to continue seeing 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.430
 secrets if you want to comment something 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.650
