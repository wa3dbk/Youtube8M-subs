easy that one actually wasn't too bad I
think<00:03:59.210> the<00:03:59.450> worst<00:03:59.660> way<00:03:59.870> a<00:03:59.900> whole<00:04:00.260> lot<00:04:00.500> was<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
think the worst way a whole lot was the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.600 
think the worst way a whole lot was the
one<00:04:02.330> prior<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:03.200> one<00:04:03.440> number<00:04:04.540> for<00:04:06.610> the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
one prior to this one number for the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.890 
one prior to this one number for the
whole<00:04:07.730> series<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.270> think<00:04:08.330> that<00:04:08.570> was<00:04:08.690> probably

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
whole series I think that was probably

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.880 
whole series I think that was probably
the<00:04:09.020> most<00:04:09.200> difficult<00:04:11.410> continue<00:04:12.410> I'm<00:04:12.680> gonna

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
the most difficult continue I'm gonna

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.170 
the most difficult continue I'm gonna
have<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.040> little<00:04:13.190> drop<00:04:13.520> of<00:04:15.550> I'm<00:04:16.550> gonna<00:04:16.790> service
