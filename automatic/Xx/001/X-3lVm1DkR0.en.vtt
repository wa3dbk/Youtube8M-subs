00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.250 
you all right the basics for the trick
the<00:00:39.739> way<00:00:39.860> I<00:00:39.890> see<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:40.220> at<00:00:40.400> least<00:00:40.550> is<00:00:40.760> uh<00:00:40.930> you<00:00:41.930> need

the way I see it at least is uh you need

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.640 
the way I see it at least is uh you need
50<00:00:42.559> 50s<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.280> rock<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:43.970> roll's<00:00:44.150> it's<00:00:44.590> for<00:00:45.590> the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
50 50s and rock and roll's it's for the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.140 
50 50s and rock and roll's it's for the
feeble<00:00:45.950> grind<00:00:46.129> when<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.430> come<00:00:46.580> in<00:00:46.700> forward

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
feeble grind when you come in forward

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.549 
feeble grind when you come in forward
it's<00:00:47.330> a<00:00:47.390> lot<00:00:47.570> like<00:00:47.750> a<00:00:47.780> rock<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:48.050> roll<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.440> way

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
it's a lot like a rock and roll the way

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.790 
it's a lot like a rock and roll the way
you<00:00:48.700> use<00:00:49.700> your<00:00:49.850> back<00:00:50.000> foot

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
you use your back foot

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.920 
you use your back foot
so<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.520> feeble<00:00:52.820> grind<00:00:53.060> you<00:00:53.330> want<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.630> go<00:00:53.780> up

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
so the feeble grind you want to go up

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.030 
so the feeble grind you want to go up
like<00:00:53.990> a<00:00:54.110> 50/50<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.130> grow<00:00:55.730> your<00:00:55.940> front<00:00:56.240> foot<00:00:57.040> up

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
like a 50/50 and grow your front foot up

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.060 
like a 50/50 and grow your front foot up
over<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.700> coping<00:00:59.200> so<00:01:00.200> that<00:01:00.350> your<00:01:00.500> rail<00:01:00.710> hits

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
over the coping so that your rail hits

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.850 
over the coping so that your rail hits
and<00:01:02.060> then<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:02.660> want<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:02.930> swing<00:01:03.320> your<00:01:03.590> arm

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
and then you want to swing your arm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.360 
and then you want to swing your arm
around<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.640> pull<00:01:04.970> your<00:01:05.150> nose<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.870> and<00:01:06.530> come

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
around to pull your nose in and come

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.680 
around to pull your nose in and come
down<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.700> wall<00:01:07.850> like<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.180> would<00:01:08.300> from<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:08.510> rock

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
down the wall like you would from a rock

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.980 
down the wall like you would from a rock
and<00:01:08.840> roll<00:01:08.990> or<00:01:09.310> fifty-fifty<00:01:10.310> or<00:01:10.370> kick<00:01:10.610> turn<00:01:10.990> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
and roll or fifty-fifty or kick turn the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.320 
and roll or fifty-fifty or kick turn the
hardest<00:01:12.350> thing<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:12.620> think<00:01:12.800> is<00:01:12.890> about<00:01:13.330> getting

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
hardest thing I think is about getting

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.630 
hardest thing I think is about getting
enough<00:01:14.660> power<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:15.950> pressure<00:01:16.160> on<00:01:16.370> your<00:01:16.460> back

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
enough power and pressure on your back

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.340 
enough power and pressure on your back
foot<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:17.630> can<00:01:17.750> actually<00:01:17.840> bring<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.229> back

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
foot so you can actually bring it back

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.010 
foot so you can actually bring it back
around<00:01:18.619> without<00:01:19.100> slipping<00:01:19.460> out

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
around without slipping out

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.120 
around without slipping out
all<00:01:21.020> right<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.260> definitely<00:01:21.680> don't<00:01:21.770> want<00:01:22.040> to

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
all right you definitely don't want to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.780 
all right you definitely don't want to
get<00:01:22.960> where<00:01:23.960> your<00:01:24.080> front<00:01:24.380> wheels<00:01:25.040> track<00:01:25.580> out

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
get where your front wheels track out

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.249 
get where your front wheels track out
onto<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.240> deck<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.720> pulls<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.080> board

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
onto the deck and it pulls the board

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.920 
onto the deck and it pulls the board
away<00:01:27.410> from<00:01:27.440> you<00:01:27.770> it's<00:01:28.520> kind<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.759> a<00:01:28.910> lame<00:01:29.600> slam

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
away from you it's kind of a lame slam

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.680 
away from you it's kind of a lame slam
if<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:30.229> do<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.790> other<00:01:31.820> thing<00:01:32.149> is<00:01:32.300> if<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.479> come

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
if you do the other thing is if you come

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.150 
if you do the other thing is if you come
around<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.320> don't<00:01:33.619> bring<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> board<00:01:34.009> around

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
around and don't bring the board around

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.490 
around and don't bring the board around
far<00:01:34.430> enough<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.850> can<00:01:34.970> whip<00:01:35.270> out<00:01:35.420> on<00:01:36.200> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
far enough you can whip out on the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.490 
far enough you can whip out on the
bottom<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.190> transition<00:01:38.259> another<00:01:39.259> good

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
bottom of the transition another good

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.350 
bottom of the transition another good
thing<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:39.770> try<00:01:40.250> is<00:01:40.310> rock<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:40.850> roll<00:01:41.030> board

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
thing that try is rock and roll board

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.490 
thing that try is rock and roll board
slides<00:01:41.600> if<00:01:41.780> you're<00:01:41.869> having<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.110> hard<00:01:42.259> time<00:01:42.290> with

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
slides if you're having a hard time with

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.590 
slides if you're having a hard time with
a<00:01:42.530> feeble<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:43.580> kind<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:43.910> a<00:01:44.000> mix<00:01:44.210> between<00:01:44.300> a

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
a feeble it's kind of a mix between a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.490 
a feeble it's kind of a mix between a
50/50<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:45.920> rock<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.280> roll<00:01:46.369> board<00:01:46.610> slide

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
50/50 and a rock and roll board slide

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.010 
50/50 and a rock and roll board slide
so<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.490> find<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.090> easier<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.420> do<00:01:50.510> on<00:01:50.540> Bert<00:01:50.900> I

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
so I find it easier to do on Bert I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.910 
so I find it easier to do on Bert I
learned<00:01:51.230> it<00:01:51.350> on<00:01:51.440> Bert

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
learned it on Bert

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.680 
learned it on Bert
I<00:01:51.950> probably<00:01:52.520> forced<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.150> shitty<00:01:53.360> one<00:01:53.540> on<00:01:53.630> a

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
I probably forced the shitty one on a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.360 
I probably forced the shitty one on a
mini-ramp<00:01:53.900> once<00:01:54.230> upon<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.470> time<00:01:54.710> but

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.030 

it<00:01:57.820> has<00:01:57.970> more<00:01:58.180> speed<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.230> it's<00:01:59.500> funner<00:01:59.770> you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
it has more speed and it's funner you

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.130 
it has more speed and it's funner you
can<00:02:00.190> really<00:02:00.550> kind<00:02:00.670> of<00:02:00.820> do<00:02:01.600> something<00:02:01.870> with<00:02:02.080> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
can really kind of do something with the
