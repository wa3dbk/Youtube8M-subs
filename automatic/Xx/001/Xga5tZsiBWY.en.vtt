00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
torque it's a as far as I'm concerned I

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.290 
torque it's a as far as I'm concerned I
know<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.020> cost<00:01:56.259> is<00:01:56.500> more<00:01:56.740> but<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.280> truly<00:01:58.060> think

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
know the cost is more but I truly think

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.810 
know the cost is more but I truly think
that<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.869> cost<00:01:59.229> it's<00:02:00.100> worth<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.429> I<00:02:00.460> mean<00:02:00.610> it's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
that that cost it's worth it I mean it's

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.300 
that that cost it's worth it I mean it's
worth<00:02:01.119> more<00:02:01.509> than<00:02:02.020> what<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.619> competition<00:02:03.220> is

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
worth more than what the competition is

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.529 
worth more than what the competition is
out<00:02:03.490> there<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.880> think<00:02:04.090> it's<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.360> best

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539
