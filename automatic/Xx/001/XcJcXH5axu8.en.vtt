 page is almost almost for the same 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.900
 purpose world so this is how it is the people 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.909
 think to put if the fans is perfect 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.650
 but to the gym and this and not really 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.030
 is that there are not two very reasons 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.769
 important for which one should 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 invest in clothes for the gym 1 the 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.449
 clear technology he always plays to your 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.970

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:10.320
 wellness and also on how 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:11.820
 like this of course a mirror for 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.430
 how much exercise has always been 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.810
 exactly good today we're going to see some 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.460
 looks that I brought that we're going to talk about 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.230
 of the materials we're going to talk about the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.850
 fabrics let's talk about some tricks 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.880
 so here we have our first 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 Incredible model as I always believe 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.900
 what is the opportunity I do not have those 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 mañón is justly are we go 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.680
 to tell if I open that I go to the gym is 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.380
 a true catwalk also side 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.790
 they should also be fashionable so it is and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.080
 it is also an investment is a very 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.270
 good investment these for example here 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.590
 this is an outfit to run what 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.510
 we are seeing the jacket the jacket 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.340
 has a reflective material that this 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.050
 it is very important for the safety of 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.180
 all while they are running over 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.680
 everything on the street and then then the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.090
 night then for example we have to 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.820
 take care of these details when a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.320
 invest how to buy what's right for 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.759
 every discipline then to run 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.020
 as long as they have reflective things 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.810
 This also works for people who 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.420
 walks on a clear bike is not very important 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 and there are also materials like in 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.149
 sea ​​water that was requested so they are 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.110
 cotton and lycra combinations that 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.660
 they absorb much faster 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 the sweat and also allow it to go 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.600
 by much faster drier what 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.100
 quantity of impressive bags for 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.410
 bring all the parts of to by 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.290
 the pressure exactly as it is not that 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.720
 today take the iPod you carry the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.120
 better your cell phone you also take her 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.510
 example has a watch is a spot bread 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.450
 this nike watch has a chip as if 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.030
 I keep here this this size yes 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.209
 this chip gets into your shoe and it 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.820
 connect by your control or you can see the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.620
 speed the time for calories 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.360
 that you are burning is a great tool 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.930
 how are you monitoring your performance 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.850
 because if it's worth a lot to invest 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.209
 in this kind of funny fun clothes 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.470
 and also this contains a high 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.820
 technology 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.770
 and all the studies that are done 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.200
 for the specific materials of each 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.810
 one of the pieces extinction and free of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.610
 the studios did that only works in your 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.890
 favor and this for example here we are 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.810
 watching a look by stella mccartney this 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.459
 it's a special line for lives 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.020
 here all the cotton that is used by 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.450
 example is organic because they doll 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.170
 It was very chic then all these clothes 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.390
 has is for yoga does not have to be the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.500
 typical chamarrita as more is softer 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.519
 but it's beaten like this 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.989
 there are also some of these pieces that 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.910
 we can incorporate in daily life the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.160
 software repression we are born 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.989
 let's think about what sport I'm going to 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.060
 play so that it will serve me better 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.530
 also how this gym suitcase is 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.930
 perfect for a weekend then 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.700
 also take advantage of this blouse by 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.860
 example here we see that they have their backs 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.720
 has this feature make it longer 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.819
 from an extract you can do it more 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.100
 portable can be longer to longer or longer 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.200
 it's up to you this clothes is precisely 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.599
 for yoga for pilates with anita is 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.580
 flexibility also that's why we're at 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.860
 see what discipline we are going to do we are going to 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.780
 do to know if we want lycra if 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.430
 We want to be able to not open our legs 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.160
 or extend the arms women 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.630
 we are starting from the support because 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.370
 We can not take the traditional with 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.380
 several because they can hurt you and 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.700
 many we grabbed and said before I do 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.900
 the oldest is visiting our knees 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.509
 and that 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.090
 helps give him a new one in clear sopor and 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.759
 besides, he does not mistreat you with people 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.190
 it was burning that they were so clear and I 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.940
 they were wearing then for example these are 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.380
 of cougar 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.850
 this is to run for example this is 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.639
 tennis has something very special are 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.610
 special for running and they are so light 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.639
 that help how many running 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.870
 this obviously reduces the time in 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.940
 the one that runs a certain distance because they are 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.139
 lighter have very good support that 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.259
 It is very important when you are looking 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.789
 tennis players have to think about what they are going 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.530
 to do is high impact or not because 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.720
 because that reflects on your knees in 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.789
 tables that's why I say to technology 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.919
 exists in gym clothes and there is 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.990
 It's worth investing for something 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.210
 I recommend that you start with an investment 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.729
 of three changes tennis can be the 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.320
 same but three changes and go 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.169
 built shopping a blouse 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.180
 tilting other things but three basic 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.520
 we buy colors like gray the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.320
 Black or navy blue are basic colors 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.180
 because it brings out a very important point 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.590
 sorry the question of tennis there 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.630
 a lot of people who buy tennis 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.350
 because they look cute and maybe they are not 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.830
 exactly the most 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.720
 suitable for the gym only do not 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.840
 it requires something that a technology that 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.040
 pay to fight exactly if by 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.830
 example in the outfit here we are seeing 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.200
 the sport and this is what I tell them 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.590
 connects with the chip that goes in the 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.360
 phoenix is look the speed measures the 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.250
 time the calories and the pace that 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.830
 you carry how are you running now in 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.440
 tennis you have a special section for 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.060
 place this down on the sole there 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.190
 is where this chip fits perfectly 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.890
 which is also included with the sport 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.630
 go hockey and if you can pass our other 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.520
 the model that brings the yoga outfit 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.040
 I want to mention something in particular 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.260
 also for example she is not the 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.450
 tennis but also to the fixed question 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.670
 of dress and is useful in radios the 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.470
 special for this type of disciplines 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.260
 as is the pilates as in the rain 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.040
 because you get there you take them away from there 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.720
 you use 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.970
 then you do not necessarily have to 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.670
 bring tennis because this is another option and 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.840
 what I say are the very casual flaps 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.570
 what and you can put them later 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.600
 for for a weekend so that already 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.529
 it becomes exact a pair of pants 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.139
 denim 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:34.239
 it would not be exactly not coming out of 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:39.909
 gym you put on some jeans and go out with 

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:41.829
 those flashes and with this super shake 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.899
 special is that with what the 

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:45.549
 fashion fans and older have 

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:48.489
 seen people who do not use state 

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:51.429
 Preparation used daily and 

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:52.959
 there all the time please have exact 

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:55.629
 have to learn that there are fans to be in 

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:57.429
 your house and movies and there are breads for 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:00.879
 go to the gym and vice versa then no 

00:06:57.429 --> 00:07:02.709
 combine we recommend you invest in 13 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:06.039
 in neutral colors and then go 

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:08.199
 building with different jackets 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:10.569
 colors and so because if you can get to 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.189
 be an investment much less wants 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:15.249
 it's a surprise proves true they 

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:17.750

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:20.270
