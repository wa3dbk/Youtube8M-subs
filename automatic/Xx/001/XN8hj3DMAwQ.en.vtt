00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.770 
off the case because they're they're not
being<00:01:37.039> effective<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.450> what<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:38.690> an

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
being effective but what it's an

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.300 
being effective but what it's an
interesting<00:01:39.020> question<00:01:39.320> Allison<00:01:39.920> is<00:01:40.070> whether

this penalty phase whether that would be

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.370 
this penalty phase whether that would be
an<00:01:45.380> appeal<00:01:45.709> that<00:01:46.280> would<00:01:46.459> be<00:01:47.119> granted<00:01:47.660> only

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
an appeal that would be granted only

what I would think right but this is the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.690 
what I would think right but this is the
part<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.239> her<00:01:56.630> uh<00:01:56.840> her<00:01:57.470> personality<00:01:58.459> that<00:01:58.640> I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
part of her uh her personality that I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.809 
part of her uh her personality that I
think<00:01:58.970> is<00:01:59.090> most<00:01:59.390> damaging<00:01:59.989> it's<00:02:00.319> her<00:02:00.819> desire

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
think is most damaging it's her desire

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.609 
think is most damaging it's her desire
to<00:02:02.000> control<00:02:02.330> everything<00:02:02.660> I<00:02:02.929> think<00:02:03.140> that's<00:02:03.319> why

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
to control everything I think that's why

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.620 
to control everything I think that's why
that's<00:02:03.979> what<00:02:04.220> came<00:02:04.429> out<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:04.910> her<00:02:05.149> killing

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's what came out in her killing

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.169 
that's what came out in her killing
Travis<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.920> think<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.220> whole<00:02:07.369> reason<00:02:07.789> why<00:02:07.940> she

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
Travis I think the whole reason why she

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.029 
Travis I think the whole reason why she
did<00:02:08.360> was<00:02:08.539> because<00:02:08.840> he<00:02:09.050> was<00:02:09.229> no<00:02:09.440> longer<00:02:09.830> within

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
did was because he was no longer within

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.640 
did was because he was no longer within
her<00:02:10.310> control<00:02:10.670> he<00:02:10.819> was<00:02:10.910> exhibiting<00:02:11.209> freedom<00:02:12.170> to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
her control he was exhibiting freedom to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.650 
her control he was exhibiting freedom to
walk<00:02:12.800> away<00:02:13.010> which<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.730> course<00:02:13.790> he<00:02:14.180> had<00:02:14.450> that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
walk away which of course he had that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.229 
walk away which of course he had that
right<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.080> do<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:16.160> since<00:02:16.550> he<00:02:16.730> got<00:02:16.940> away<00:02:17.060> from

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
right to do but since he got away from

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.420 
right to do but since he got away from
her<00:02:17.540> she<00:02:18.170> didn't<00:02:18.440> want<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.739> happen<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.160> he

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
her she didn't want that to happen so he

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.490 
her she didn't want that to happen so he
needed<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.879> suffer<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.390> think<00:02:20.629> in<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.349> end

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
needed to suffer and I think in the end

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.170 
needed to suffer and I think in the end
what<00:02:21.860> she's<00:02:22.129> doing<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.640> same<00:02:22.819> thing<00:02:22.879> to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
what she's doing is the same thing to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.800 
what she's doing is the same thing to
herself<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.920> really<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.670> really<00:02:25.819> going<00:02:26.629> to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
herself it's really it's really going to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.710 
herself it's really it's really going to
make<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.050> easier<00:02:27.800> for<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.280> jury<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.910> her

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
make it easier for the jury to her

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.260 
make it easier for the jury to her
behavior<00:02:30.200> today<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:30.980> think<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.610> going<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> make

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
behavior today I think is going to make

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.000 
behavior today I think is going to make
it<00:02:32.420> easier<00:02:32.780> for<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.080> jury<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.530> give<00:02:33.709> her<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
it easier for the jury to give her the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.850 
it easier for the jury to give her the
death<00:02:34.190> penalty<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.629> said<00:02:35.870> before<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.620> don't

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
death penalty as I said before I don't

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.740 
death penalty as I said before I don't
want<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.520> see<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.849> happen<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.450> because<00:02:38.720> I

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
want to see that happen just because I

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.869 
want to see that happen just because I
don't<00:02:39.020> agree<00:02:39.110> with<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.470> death<00:02:39.650> penalty<00:02:39.879> but

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
don't agree with the death penalty but

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.920 
don't agree with the death penalty but
when<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:42.580> basically<00:02:43.580> completely<00:02:44.209> disrespect

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
when you basically completely disrespect

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.539 
when you basically completely disrespect
your<00:02:45.079> own<00:02:45.200> attorneys<00:02:45.680> when<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.250> things

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
your own attorneys when you do things

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.820 
your own attorneys when you do things
that<00:02:46.700> are<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.230> easy<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.530> use<00:02:48.680> against<00:02:49.219> you

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
that are so easy to use against you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.620 
that are so easy to use against you
