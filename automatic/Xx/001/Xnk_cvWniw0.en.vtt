00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.580 
the proper torque setting once stop and
don't<00:02:32.950> continue<00:02:33.519> tightening<00:02:34.319> beyond<00:02:35.319> that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
don't continue tightening beyond that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.380 
don't continue tightening beyond that
otherwise<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.610> bushing<00:02:36.940> could<00:02:37.060> be<00:02:37.150> over

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
otherwise the bushing could be over

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.630 
otherwise the bushing could be over
inserted<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.019> hub<00:02:38.519> resulting<00:02:39.519> in

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
inserted in the hub resulting in

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.240 
inserted in the hub resulting in
cracking<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.410> stop<00:02:41.650> once<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> bolt

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
cracking so just stop once the bolt

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.180 
cracking so just stop once the bolt
torque<00:02:42.519> has<00:02:42.640> been<00:02:42.880> reached

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
torque has been reached

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.710 
torque has been reached
there<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> second<00:02:45.790> set<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:45.970> holes<00:02:46.269> in<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
there is a second set of holes in the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.910 
there is a second set of holes in the
bushing<00:02:47.310> flange<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:49.660> are<00:02:49.810> threaded<00:02:50.170> these

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
bushing flange that are threaded these

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.470 
bushing flange that are threaded these
are<00:02:51.190> for<00:02:51.400> removing<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.910> bushing<00:02:52.239> from<00:02:52.329> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
are for removing the bushing from the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.160 
are for removing the bushing from the
ship<00:02:53.430> remove<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:54.730> remove<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.180> ship<00:02:55.810> then

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
ship remove it to remove a ship then

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.770 
ship remove it to remove a ship then
remove<00:02:56.859> the<00:02:57.190> installation<00:02:57.579> bolts<00:02:58.269> place<00:02:58.540> them

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
remove the installation bolts place them

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.400 
remove the installation bolts place them
in<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.079> threaded<00:02:59.920> holes<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.290> tighten<00:03:02.290> them

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
in the threaded holes and tighten them

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.550 
in the threaded holes and tighten them
evenly<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.660> pushes<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.810> ship<00:03:05.019> off<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.440> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
evenly and it pushes the ship off of the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.210 
evenly and it pushes the ship off of the
bushing<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:08.970> hope<00:03:09.970> this<00:03:10.120> has<00:03:10.299> been<00:03:10.329> interesting
