around<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.560> edges<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.590> do<00:02:55.549> some<00:02:56.090> shading

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
around the edges and do some shading

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.880 
around the edges and do some shading
really<00:02:56.870> quickly<00:02:59.079> because<00:03:00.079> there's<00:03:00.440> an<00:03:00.560> open

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
really quickly because there's an open

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.640 
really quickly because there's an open
pattern<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> text<00:03:02.360> if<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.019> didn't<00:03:03.379> do<00:03:03.470> that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
pattern in the text if I didn't do that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.130 
pattern in the text if I didn't do that
you<00:03:03.799> would<00:03:03.950> not<00:03:04.099> have<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.459> really<00:03:04.819> good<00:03:05.180> crisp

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
you would not have a really good crisp

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.619 
you would not have a really good crisp
image<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:07.430> where<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.790> flowers<00:03:08.180> are<00:03:08.360> going<00:03:08.390> to

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
image of where the flowers are going to

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:15.009 
image of where the flowers are going to
lie<00:03:08.840> down<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:14.299> just<00:03:14.329> pulling<00:03:14.900> it

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
lie down and I'm just pulling it

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.460 
lie down and I'm just pulling it
outwards<00:03:16.150> not<00:03:17.150> too<00:03:17.359> worried<00:03:17.599> because<00:03:17.989> this<00:03:18.319> is

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
outwards not too worried because this is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.869 
outwards not too worried because this is
such<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.680> light<00:03:18.950> color<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.459> going<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.730> look

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
such a light color it's going to look

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:27.640 
such a light color it's going to look
nice<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.329> soft

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.509 

I'll<00:03:28.310> just<00:03:28.489> scrub<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.819> out<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.360> little<00:03:29.390> bit

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
I'll just scrub it out just a little bit

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.520 
I'll just scrub it out just a little bit
with<00:03:31.519> my<00:03:31.670> dry<00:03:31.879> brushing<00:03:32.269> technique<00:03:35.379> and<00:03:36.379> then

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
with my dry brushing technique and then

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.570 
with my dry brushing technique and then
when<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.739> pick<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.010> up

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
when you pick it up

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.130 
when you pick it up
voila<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.140> have<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.410> perfect<00:03:40.129> image<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.720> where

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
voila you have a perfect image and where

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.250 
voila you have a perfect image and where
we<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.500> come<00:03:42.650> back<00:03:42.800> in<00:03:43.069> and<00:03:43.340> stamp<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.810> detail

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
we can come back in and stamp the detail

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.420 
we can come back in and stamp the detail
lines<00:03:45.730> now<00:03:46.730> in<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.269> in<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.319> previous<00:03:48.739> video<00:03:48.950> I

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
lines now in this in a previous video I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.150 
lines now in this in a previous video I
had<00:03:50.239> created<00:03:50.870> interest<00:03:51.349> in<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.680> background

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
had created interest in the background

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.729 
had created interest in the background
and<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:53.750> we're<00:03:54.140> going<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.440> use<00:03:54.830> our

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
and so to this we're going to use our

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.400 
and so to this we're going to use our
template<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:58.510> again<00:03:59.510> I've<00:03:59.720> marked<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.140> if<00:04:00.290> I

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
template and again I've marked it if I

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.170 
template and again I've marked it if I
knew<00:04:00.620> if<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:01.040> were<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.310> go<00:04:01.459> like<00:04:01.610> this<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.970> could

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
knew if I were to go like this I could

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.030 
knew if I were to go like this I could
see<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:03.019> would<00:04:03.140> be<00:04:03.200> upside<00:04:03.620> down<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.010> I

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
see that it would be upside down so I

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.370 
see that it would be upside down so I
want<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.280> make<00:04:04.400> sure<00:04:04.569> that<00:04:05.569> I've<00:04:05.720> got<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:06.110> lined

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
want to make sure that I've got it lined

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.990 
want to make sure that I've got it lined
properly<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.860> I<00:04:09.950> need<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.250> come<00:04:10.400> in<00:04:10.579> with<00:04:10.849> some

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
properly and I need to come in with some

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.870 
properly and I need to come in with some
of<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:12.250> light<00:04:13.250> blue<00:04:13.519> color<00:04:13.819> now<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.790> I'm

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
of that light blue color now and I'm

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.830 
of that light blue color now and I'm
actually<00:04:17.120> going<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.600> command<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.440> base<00:04:18.709> coded

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.629 

and<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:24.139> use<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.500> same<00:04:24.710> sponge<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.160> don't<00:04:25.340> care

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
and I use the same sponge I don't care

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.879 
and I use the same sponge I don't care
that<00:04:26.120> it's<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.479> little<00:04:26.630> bit<00:04:26.750> dirty<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:30.740> will

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
that it's a little bit dirty it will

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.560 
that it's a little bit dirty it will
just<00:04:31.039> give<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.370> really<00:04:31.550> pretty<00:04:31.910> variegated

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
just give it a really pretty variegated

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.400 
just give it a really pretty variegated
look<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.410> can<00:04:33.800> either<00:04:33.979> tape<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.580> down<00:04:34.930> or<00:04:35.930> I

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
look so I can either tape this down or I

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.440 
look so I can either tape this down or I
can<00:04:36.830> hold<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.610> I'm<00:04:37.700> going<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:38.000> just<00:04:38.270> hold

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
can hold it and I'm going to just hold

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.350 
can hold it and I'm going to just hold
it<00:04:38.630> into<00:04:38.780> place<00:04:39.669> and<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.760> may<00:04:40.910> want<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.240> make

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
it into place and I may want to make

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.850 
it into place and I may want to make
sure<00:04:41.419> I<00:04:41.570> have<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:41.870> exactly<00:04:42.380> where<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.560> want<00:04:42.770> it

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
sure I have it exactly where I want it

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:54.100 
sure I have it exactly where I want it
and<00:04:43.070> then<00:04:43.820> I'll<00:04:43.970> go<00:04:44.210> around<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.570> edges<00:04:44.750> first

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:06.869 

my<00:04:54.680> real<00:04:54.860> out<00:04:55.009> is<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.370> need<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.759> need<00:04:56.419> paint

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:06.879 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.359 

and<00:05:07.089> I<00:05:07.509> rather<00:05:07.749> like<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.709> little<00:05:09.099> bit<00:05:09.249> of

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:09.369 
and I rather like that a little bit of

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:10.889 
and I rather like that a little bit of
the<00:05:09.490> writing<00:05:09.849> is<00:05:10.029> showing<00:05:10.360> through<00:05:10.629> so<00:05:10.809> I'm

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:10.899 
the writing is showing through so I'm

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:12.570 
the writing is showing through so I'm
going<00:05:11.169> to<00:05:11.229> leave<00:05:11.439> that<00:05:11.740> I'm<00:05:11.949> only<00:05:12.069> going<00:05:12.550> to

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
going to leave that I'm only going to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.969 
going to leave that I'm only going to
put<00:05:12.819> one<00:05:13.059> application<00:05:13.779> of<00:05:13.899> color<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:14.379> if<00:05:14.889> I

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
put one application of color and if I

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.929 
put one application of color and if I
wanted<00:05:15.189> a<00:05:15.309> more<00:05:15.490> app<00:05:15.729> okay

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:17.939 
wanted a more app okay

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:19.769 
wanted a more app okay
application<00:05:18.939> what<00:05:19.059> I<00:05:19.089> could<00:05:19.330> do<00:05:19.419> is<00:05:19.569> allow

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:19.779 
application what I could do is allow

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:23.249 
application what I could do is allow
this<00:05:19.959> to<00:05:20.199> dry<00:05:20.229> and<00:05:21.089> then<00:05:22.089> come<00:05:22.300> back<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.990> put

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
this to dry and then come back and put

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.540 
this to dry and then come back and put
another<00:05:23.289> coat<00:05:24.129> on

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
another coat on

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.209 
another coat on
but<00:05:25.330> in<00:05:25.569> just<00:05:25.839> a<00:05:25.929> short<00:05:26.080> period<00:05:26.199> of<00:05:26.559> time<00:05:26.619> I've

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
but in just a short period of time I've

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.169 
but in just a short period of time I've
used<00:05:27.279> my<00:05:27.729> template<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:29.800> base<00:05:30.009> coat<00:05:30.399> on<00:05:30.909> your

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:31.179 
used my template to base coat on your

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:34.739 
used my template to base coat on your
color<00:05:31.479> and<00:05:31.929> in<00:05:32.589> here<00:05:33.069> I've<00:05:33.339> used<00:05:33.610> my<00:05:33.879> mask<00:05:34.119> to
