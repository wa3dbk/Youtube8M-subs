00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.140 
my commentary because I was going to do
this<00:02:52.380> anyway<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.070> there<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.370> was<00:02:53.430> over<00:02:53.880> my<00:02:53.970> pack

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
this anyway and there I was over my pack

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.580 
this anyway and there I was over my pack
luck<00:02:54.330> wasn't<00:02:54.540> carrying<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:54.990> from<00:02:55.110> last<00:02:55.200> week

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
luck wasn't carrying on from last week

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.460 
luck wasn't carrying on from last week
and<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:56.310> actually<00:02:56.460> did<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:57.750> pretty<00:02:58.170> damn

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
and it actually did so I'm pretty damn

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.560 
and it actually did so I'm pretty damn
happy<00:02:58.620> about<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.070> one<00:02:59.280> more<00:02:59.490> thing<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.910> I

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
happy about that one more thing and I

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.210 
happy about that one more thing and I
think<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:01.020> one<00:03:01.230> more<00:03:01.410> team<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.740> season<00:03:01.890> left

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
think is one more team this season left

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.310 
think is one more team this season left
with<00:03:02.430> after<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:02.850> one<00:03:03.060> which<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:04.080> EA

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
with after this one which is the EA

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.340 
with after this one which is the EA
Sports<00:03:04.860> FC<00:03:05.430> which<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:06.720> might<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:06.990> seen<00:03:07.080> me

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
Sports FC which you might have seen me

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.080 
Sports FC which you might have seen me
tweet<00:03:07.560> bad<00:03:07.710> on<00:03:07.860> Twitter<00:03:08.130> but<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.730> think<00:03:08.970> it's

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
tweet bad on Twitter but I think it's

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.340 
tweet bad on Twitter but I think it's
premature<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.510> best<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.930> best<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.290> you

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
premature the best of the best so you

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.290 
premature the best of the best so you
get<00:03:10.470> Ronaldo<00:03:10.860> Suarez<00:03:11.400> left<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:11.850> Ibrahimovic

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
get Ronaldo Suarez left on Ibrahimovic

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.540 
get Ronaldo Suarez left on Ibrahimovic
messy<00:03:12.720> all<00:03:13.380> players<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.100> one<00:03:14.130> team

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.170 
and like I think they covered the
reserves<00:03:16.620> as<00:03:16.770> well<00:03:16.950> waiting<00:03:17.700> game<00:03:17.820> impacts
