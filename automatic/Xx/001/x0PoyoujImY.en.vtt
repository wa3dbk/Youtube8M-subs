00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
 right here 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.280
 yoth observes pulling champions 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.420
 find especially that the me simonard in 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.540
 3 on pc for a video hatch that you 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.949
 lets as you see to have fifteen 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.890
 classes for weapons to have all the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.949
 titles and emblem to choose under 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.960
 prestige to choose his grade to have 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.550
 all a little bit pro practically 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.170
 everything but a few small ones ie 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.230
 the accessories so where you see 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.970
 that I have the emblem titles call of duty 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.580
 and liszt so you have everything as me 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.160
 then on pc there is no call of duty 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.860
 elite but hey there with the hac we have them 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 anyway and I you rope are 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.310
 rather not bad so to do so 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.820
 you have to start obviously call 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.790
 of duty 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.950
 then have at your disposal 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.410
 software that often the description of 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.740
 the video I invite you to throw a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.780
 eye 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.190
 So there you see I'm bleachers 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 so we will end up on my pc so 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.820
 of software I will analyze them for 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.729
 for you not to say that after 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.370
 they have viruses or other ceded 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 just water singh ii has for double v3 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.220
 so there the first there is nothing and the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.930
 second also so you have to 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.870
 lancers during the first software 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.700
 you choose the prestige so the 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.250
 available extras are from 0 to 20 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.490
 for my part to test the I put the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.620
 set and we press right next so that's it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.320
 we put prestige crack of a Toulouse 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.020
 I do not see very well since there I am 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.940
 with them this megalo does the same for all 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.590
 the other stuff you want so 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.280
 after you go into our hearts you 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.720
 have us press on title and emblem 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.720
 to unlock all the emblem titles 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.790
 so it's not going to work directly 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.540
 to actualize actually make you a 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.250
 part online 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.479
 then once the game is over 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.929
 would like all of your transit 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.780
 excuse me so here you see that the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.950
 not very good practice 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.819
 So here she is the eggs that's the call 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.740
 of duty elite 1 the clocks they are 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.880

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.650
 little check to unlock everything or 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.910
 we really all all all fifteen 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.260
 classes all trumps gold weapons 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.520

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.900
