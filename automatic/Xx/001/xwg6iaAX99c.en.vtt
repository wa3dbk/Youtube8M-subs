he was ready for a full speed run so
here<00:00:20.840> it<00:00:20.960> is

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.560 

I've<00:03:21.310> just<00:03:21.550> driven<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.790> Honda<00:03:22.000> fall<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.240> one<00:03:22.360> car

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
I've just driven a Honda fall in one car

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.260 
I've just driven a Honda fall in one car
around<00:03:22.870> Silverstone<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:24.460> was<00:03:24.610> absolutely

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
around Silverstone and it was absolutely

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.220 
around Silverstone and it was absolutely
mind-blowing

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
mind-blowing

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.710 
mind-blowing
I<00:03:26.820> really<00:03:27.820> don't<00:03:28.090> think<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.510> appreciate

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
I really don't think you can appreciate

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.520 
I really don't think you can appreciate
how<00:03:29.280> fast<00:03:30.280> these<00:03:30.460> things<00:03:30.520> are<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.120> how<00:03:31.690> well

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
how fast these things are and how well

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.870 
how fast these things are and how well
they<00:03:32.680> stopped<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.160> how<00:03:33.310> fast<00:03:33.550> they<00:03:33.670> will<00:03:33.730> go

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
they stopped and how fast they will go

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.660 
they stopped and how fast they will go
around<00:03:34.000> corners<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.660> did<00:03:35.230> two<00:03:35.470> laps<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:36.460> my

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
around corners I did two laps and my

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.400 
around corners I did two laps and my
neck<00:03:36.910> was<00:03:37.120> completely<00:03:37.750> knackered<00:03:37.960> going

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
neck was completely knackered going

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.530 
neck was completely knackered going
through<00:03:38.620> wicker<00:03:38.950> answering<00:03:39.430> cops<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.420> they

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
through wicker answering cops so they

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.870 
through wicker answering cops so they
had<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.750> put<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.900> little<00:03:40.990> what<00:03:41.470> they<00:03:41.560> call

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
had to put a little what they call

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.150 
had to put a little what they call
clifton<00:03:42.880> pad<00:03:43.290> where<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:44.320> can<00:03:44.500> kind<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.770> lean<00:03:44.980> up

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
clifton pad where I can kind of lean up

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.680 
clifton pad where I can kind of lean up
against<00:03:45.520> it<00:03:45.640> like<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.940> which<00:03:46.420> made<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> big

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
against it like this which made a big

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.650 
against it like this which made a big
difference<00:03:46.900> Ashley<00:03:47.410> but<00:03:47.920> now<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.280> mean<00:03:48.660> it's

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
difference Ashley but now I mean it's

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.430 
difference Ashley but now I mean it's
pretty<00:03:49.840> special

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
pretty special

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.190 
pretty special

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
very very smooth you've ever done Road

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.750 
very very smooth you've ever done Road

remotely<00:03:55.420> can<00:03:55.660> play<00:03:55.840> well<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.320> drove<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.650> chair

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
remotely can play well I drove the chair

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.010 
remotely can play well I drove the chair
around<00:03:57.100> Barcelona<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.120> didn't<00:03:58.870> have<00:03:58.990> a

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
around Barcelona but I didn't have a

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.500 
around Barcelona but I didn't have a
clue<00:03:59.350> which<00:03:59.560> way<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.860> track<00:04:00.070> win<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.120> I

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
clue which way the track win so and I

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.220 
clue which way the track win so and I
got<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.290> culture<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.680> many<00:04:03.070> laps<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:04.780> no<00:04:04.960> really

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
got a culture of many laps so no really

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.660 
got a culture of many laps so no really
that<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.590> doesn't<00:04:05.890> compare<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.340> at<00:04:06.490> all

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
that that doesn't compare to this at all

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.280 
that that doesn't compare to this at all
because<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.150> knew<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:07.600> circuit<00:04:08.020> of<00:04:08.110> it

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
because I I knew this circuit of it

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.160 
because I I knew this circuit of it
which<00:04:08.560> helps<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.400> lot<00:04:09.520> but<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.630> McLaren<00:04:11.050> have

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
which helps a lot but I McLaren have

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.599 
which helps a lot but I McLaren have
Danny<00:04:11.320> like<00:04:11.590> it

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609
