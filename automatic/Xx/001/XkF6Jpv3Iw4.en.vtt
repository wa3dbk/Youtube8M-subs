00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.730
 we were looking for in the tomatoes I came to 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.680
 me a memory once I went to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.780
 camp when I was little and that 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.370
 We were in Valle de Bravo, we did not know 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.129
 it was a day that was raining 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.780
 campsites the campfire and today the 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.519
 I want to ride and I want to give it to you 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.189
 you so that that moment is also yours 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.870
 and what I'm going to have to bring the tomatoes to 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.769

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.769
 little chicken background 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.329
 well here we have liquefied part of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.159
 what is going to be our cream are we going to 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.079
 stew I'm going to take some fat 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.680
 to a pot that is previously 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:15.420
 hot and I'm going to place a strainer and 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.420
 I will start to pass my cream 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.079

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.420

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.880
 and simply to reinforce the taste of 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.760
 what we had done 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.350
 a few basil leaves but these 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.570
 I'm just going to leave them like this 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.520
 the cream will give the body that 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.620
 we are looking for let's wait for 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.240

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.360
 goat cheese with a little basil 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.610
 it's going to go super well with the cream that 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.420
 We did as we will make super 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.010

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.650
 I will take a sprig of basil the 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.470
 I'm going to break and I'm going to put him but 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.090
 little bit of olive oil the cream if 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.739
 you want you can finish it with a 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.200
 little olive oil in the part 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.200

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.110
 taste color and you're ready to 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.370
 taste remember that we had said in 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.470
 a principle that we were going to give 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.120
 personality to all the dishes and the 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.130
 today's dish has it has that 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.510
 memory personality of that afternoon 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.370
 rainy when I left 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.650
 camp and today I want to share it 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.750
 with you and that is simply what we are going to 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.540
 serve in something other than a shopper 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.540
 In a little story you will see how good they look 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.509

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.090
 we make today see nothing more 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.520
 a great menu made with ideas from the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.979
 memories I had in the past how about 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.110

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.550
 the pears and the apples in cider and that 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.190
 chestnut puree that will give you the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.229
 precise memory of would be in Madrid what 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.110
 such the couscous with the squid rings 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.000
 something refreshing crunchy and that too 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.729
 It has a citrus touch and to finish 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.379
 we have that roasted tomato cream 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.289
 that brings back memories of childhood 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:37.120
 and that the truth nothing more than to see me 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.620
 transports that moment my name is 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.050
