for<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:01.949> week's<00:00:02.220> breakdown<00:00:02.399> we're<00:00:02.939> going<00:00:03.060> to

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
for this week's breakdown we're going to

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.210 
for this week's breakdown we're going to
take<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> look<00:00:03.720> at<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.929> simple<00:00:04.170> passing<00:00:04.680> concept

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
take a look at a simple passing concept

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.860 
take a look at a simple passing concept
that<00:00:05.339> we<00:00:05.460> like<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.819> run<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.299> attack<00:00:06.600> zone

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
that we like to run to attack zone

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.179 
that we like to run to attack zone
coverage<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.560> name<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.859> passing

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
coverage and the name of the passing

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.850 
coverage and the name of the passing
concept<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.820> called<00:00:09.000> curl<00:00:09.330> flats<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.500> let's<00:00:10.710> go

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
concept is called curl flats so let's go

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.100 
concept is called curl flats so let's go
ahead<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.099> take<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> look<00:00:11.670> at<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.269> far<00:00:13.080> as

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
ahead and take a look at it as far as

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.780 
ahead and take a look at it as far as
the<00:00:13.320> default<00:00:13.650> pass<00:00:13.860> routes<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.610> look

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the default pass routes and as you look

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
the default pass routes and as you look
here<00:00:15.089> we're<00:00:15.690> gonna<00:00:15.809> work<00:00:16.049> our<00:00:16.230> way<00:00:16.379> from<00:00:16.440> left

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
here we're gonna work our way from left

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.230 
here we're gonna work our way from left
to<00:00:17.039> right<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.520> you're<00:00:17.760> gonna<00:00:17.850> see<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
to right and you're gonna see that the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.900 
to right and you're gonna see that the
split<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.840> he<00:00:19.020> runs<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.350> curl<00:00:19.590> route<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.189> then

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
split in he runs a curl route and then

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.519 
split in he runs a curl route and then
you<00:00:21.060> also<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> slot<00:00:21.869> receiver<00:00:21.900> here

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you also have the slot receiver here

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.200 
you also have the slot receiver here
who's<00:00:22.800> gonna<00:00:22.949> run<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> flat<00:00:23.609> route<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.060> have

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
who's gonna run a flat route so you have

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.820 
who's gonna run a flat route so you have
the<00:00:24.390> curl<00:00:24.660> combination<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.410> curl<00:00:25.590> flat

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the curl combination a curl flat

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.349 
the curl combination a curl flat
combination<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.550> over<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> left<00:00:27.269> side

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
combination here over on the left side

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.269 
combination here over on the left side
of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.599> field<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.109> then<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.920> look<00:00:29.070> over

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of the field and then if you look over

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.470 
of the field and then if you look over
here<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:29.789> side<00:00:30.060> you're<00:00:30.240> gonna<00:00:30.330> get

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
here on the right side you're gonna get

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.089 
here on the right side you're gonna get
that<00:00:30.599> same<00:00:30.810> curl<00:00:31.080> flat<00:00:31.349> combination<00:00:31.920> here's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that same curl flat combination here's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.530 
that same curl flat combination here's
the<00:00:32.219> tied<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.669> he's<00:00:32.880> gonna<00:00:32.969> go<00:00:33.210> ahead<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.420> run

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the tied in he's gonna go ahead and run

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
the tied in he's gonna go ahead and run
the<00:00:33.660> flat<00:00:33.870> route<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> outside

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the flat route and then to the outside

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.069 
the flat route and then to the outside
of<00:00:35.850> him<00:00:36.000> which<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> flanker<00:00:36.780> he's<00:00:36.930> going

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
of him which is the flanker he's going

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.450 
of him which is the flanker he's going
to<00:00:37.140> run<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> curl<00:00:37.559> route<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> curl

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
to run the curl route so you get to curl

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.310 
to run the curl route so you get to curl
flat<00:00:38.760> over<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.540> towards<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.079> side

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
flat over here towards the right side

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.319 
flat over here towards the right side
and<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.219> known<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.430> mere<00:00:41.790> pass<00:00:42.000> routes

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and this is known as mere pass routes

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.549 
and this is known as mere pass routes
meaning<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.260> exact<00:00:43.530> same

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
meaning that you have the exact same

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
meaning that you have the exact same
pass<00:00:44.010> routes<00:00:44.340> being<00:00:44.579> ran<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.059> both<00:00:45.270> sides<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
pass routes being ran on both sides of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
pass routes being ran on both sides of
the<00:00:45.780> field<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.280> those<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.579> guys<00:00:47.700> who

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the field so for those of you guys who

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.160 
the field so for those of you guys who
are<00:00:47.940> looking<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.270> read<00:00:48.390> coverages<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
are looking to read coverages or have a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
are looking to read coverages or have a
hard<00:00:49.350> time<00:00:49.469> reading<00:00:49.710> coverages<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.520> can

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
hard time reading coverages you can

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.119 
hard time reading coverages you can
pretty<00:00:51.870> much<00:00:51.960> run<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.379> type<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> plague<00:00:52.949> in

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
pretty much run this type of plague in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.439 
pretty much run this type of plague in
zone<00:00:53.399> coverage<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.149> you're<00:00:54.360> gonna

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
zone coverage and know that you're gonna

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.119 
zone coverage and know that you're gonna
have<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> exact<00:00:55.079> same<00:00:55.110> pass<00:00:55.530> routes<00:00:55.800> being

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
have the exact same pass routes being

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.549 
have the exact same pass routes being
ran<00:00:56.340> making<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> pretty<00:00:57.420> easy<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.870> far<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.109> we

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
ran making it pretty easy as far as we

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
ran making it pretty easy as far as we
read<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.760> what<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.210> about<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
read so that's what I like about this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.029 
read so that's what I like about this
particular<00:01:00.809> passing<00:01:01.289> concept<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:01.949> it's

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
particular passing concept because it's

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.889 
particular passing concept because it's
very<00:01:02.160> simple<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:03.180> either<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.420> high<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.840> low

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
very simple it's either a high or low

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.780 
very simple it's either a high or low
and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> inside<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.700> those

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and then to the inside of those

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.340 
and then to the inside of those
receivers<00:01:06.210> here<00:01:06.659> we're<00:01:06.930> gonna<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.260> guy

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
receivers here we're gonna have this guy

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.600 
receivers here we're gonna have this guy
right<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> running<00:01:08.220> back<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
right here which is the running back and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.500 
right here which is the running back and
he's<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.030> ahead<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.299> run<00:01:09.420> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
he's going to go ahead and run this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.960 
he's going to go ahead and run this
delayed<00:01:09.869> curl<00:01:10.170> route<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> backfield

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
delayed curl route out of the backfield

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.920 
delayed curl route out of the backfield
so<00:01:11.970> let's<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.479> take<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> look<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so let's go and take a look at the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.910 
so let's go and take a look at the
defense<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> we're<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> run<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
defense that we're going to run this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.289 
defense that we're going to run this
against<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.310> least<00:01:14.340> two<00:01:14.520> coverages<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
against at least two coverages and this

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.820

is<00:01:15.420> covered<00:01:15.720> three<00:01:15.900> covers<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.590> see

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
is covered three covers as you can see

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.440 
is covered three covers as you can see
it's<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.310> base<00:01:17.490> cover<00:01:17.790> three<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> say

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
it's just a base cover three when I say

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.109 
it's just a base cover three when I say
base<00:01:19.009> meaning<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.820> flat

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
base meaning that you have to flat

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.310 
base meaning that you have to flat
defenders<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> three

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
defenders and then you have the three

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.780 
defenders and then you have the three
deep<00:01:22.500> coverage<00:01:22.830> such<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.700> your

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
deep coverage such as you see on your

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.539 
deep coverage such as you see on your
screen<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> things<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.920> cover

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
screen now one of the things about cover

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
screen now one of the things about cover
three<00:01:26.729> coverage<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.900> pretty<00:01:28.080> easy<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
three coverage is it's pretty easy to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.499 
three coverage is it's pretty easy to

going to notice is that you're gonna
have<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.360> high<00:01:33.570> safety<00:01:33.869> nets<00:01:34.170> case<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.500> going

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
have a high safety nets case it's going

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.140 
have a high safety nets case it's going
to<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> free<00:01:35.070> safety<00:01:35.280> play<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.970> deep

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
to be the free safety play in the deep

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.090 
to be the free safety play in the deep
middle<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.869> then<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.740> look<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
middle there and then if you look at the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920 
middle there and then if you look at the
two<00:01:38.280> corners<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.060> they're<00:01:39.689> gonna<00:01:39.780> be

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
two corners here they're gonna be

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.539 
two corners here they're gonna be
playing<00:01:40.079> about<00:01:40.439> eight<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> seven<00:01:41.070> seven<00:01:41.430> eight

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
playing about eight to seven seven eight

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.609 
playing about eight to seven seven eight
yards<00:01:41.850> off<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> line<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.329> scrimmage<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
yards off the line of scrimmage and you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.010 
yards off the line of scrimmage and you
can<00:01:43.740> kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.189> right<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.210> lot<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
can kind of see right there so a lot of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.690 
can kind of see right there so a lot of
times<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.500> tells<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.890> cover<00:01:47.070> three<00:01:47.460> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
times that tells you it's cover three so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.069 
times that tells you it's cover three so
you<00:01:47.820> should<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.240> off<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> bat<00:01:48.689> once

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you should know right off the bat once

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.139 
you should know right off the bat once
you<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> pretty<00:01:51.030> good

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
you see this that you have a pretty good

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
you see this that you have a pretty good
diet<00:01:51.420> idea<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.320> your<00:01:52.470> opponent's<00:01:52.829> coming

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
diet idea that your opponent's coming

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.859

the only other defender you may have to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.210 
the only other defender you may have to
watch<00:03:24.690> for<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.110> occasion<00:03:25.590> might<00:03:25.980> be<00:03:26.130> an

outside linebacker or a linebacker in

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.090 
outside linebacker or a linebacker in
this<00:03:27.930> case<00:03:28.110> his<00:03:28.260> linebacker<00:03:28.680> here<00:03:28.950> he's

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
this case his linebacker here he's

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.890 
this case his linebacker here he's
dropping<00:03:29.400> back<00:03:29.489> in<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.700> hook<00:03:29.790> zone<00:03:30.030> watch<00:03:30.720> to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
dropping back in the hook zone watch to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.330 
dropping back in the hook zone watch to
see<00:03:30.930> if<00:03:31.140> he<00:03:31.260> drops<00:03:31.530> into<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:31.890> area<00:03:32.130> here<00:03:32.160> he

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
see if he drops into this area here he

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.590 
see if he drops into this area here he
probably<00:03:32.579> won't<00:03:32.850> he'll<00:03:33.120> probably<00:03:33.239> come<00:03:33.450> in

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
probably won't he'll probably come in

probably won't he'll probably come in
this<00:03:33.720> area<00:03:33.989> here<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.320> then<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.310> should

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
this area here and then that should

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.640

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
is the flanker and we could have threw

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.199 
is the flanker and we could have threw
over<00:03:50.100> this<00:03:50.190> area<00:03:50.370> here<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.700> completed<00:03:51.090> as

right there
and<00:04:52.169> that's<00:04:52.620> where<00:04:52.770> we're<00:04:52.860> in<00:04:52.919> throw<00:04:53.100> right

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
and that's where we're in throw right

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.500 
and that's where we're in throw right
there<00:04:53.430> in<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:53.639> area<00:04:53.850> there<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.000> complete<00:04:54.389> it

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
there in that area there and complete it

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.990 
there in that area there and complete it
so<00:04:54.750> definitely<00:04:55.650> worth<00:04:55.949> taking<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.400> look<00:04:56.430> as<00:04:56.760> far

so definitely worth taking a look as far

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.490 
so definitely worth taking a look as far
