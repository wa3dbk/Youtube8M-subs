00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.080

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.750
 I will try the Precure turn in front 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.470
 I compromise the first scan button 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.730
 It is also a package 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.730
 Primarily first saw 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.160
 Then one time repeatedly on the back 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.870

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.220
 It has been a well treated in this state 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.909

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.299

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.299
 Let's see the read is complete on pdf 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.670
 This is the first page 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.370

 Images will be transferred to iphone ipad in battle 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:02.510
 I would like to use the one I think is the most convenient it is a cd booklet 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.960
 is 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:11.819
 This is a booklet for an nhk show I borrowed for my daughter, but I look at it 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:18.739
 I'm not pdf but possible 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.739
 Set the file format you want to read in mode to jpeg 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.630
 It's not like the arm, but it's pf chang or jpeg . 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.300
 Let's take a good shot 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.780
 There is only this thickness 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 But 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.080
 While adjusting the pension slightly because it will become thickened reverse skin 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.510

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.700

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:34.400
 As it is saved by jpeg as it is and says 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:38.200
 Ipad is actually saved while converting to pdf 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.200

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.140

 End-of-life care, etc. with eyes and two that had been using a flat bed scanner is very time 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.030

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:25.480
 20 pages now for now 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.480
 In other words, reading of 10 pages of the document was finished 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.750
 It had been buried all Yes we are im processing 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.790

 I will see that I understand that it is included 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.790
 It is very beautiful 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.390
 I am not pass even one by one 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.090
