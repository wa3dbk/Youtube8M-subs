00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.670 

so<00:00:07.270> here's<00:00:07.479> a<00:00:07.540> quick<00:00:07.840> and<00:00:08.050> accurate<00:00:08.200> way<00:00:08.530> to

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
so here's a quick and accurate way to

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.580 
so here's a quick and accurate way to
install<00:00:09.250> hinges<00:00:09.820> without<00:00:10.480> measuring<00:00:11.049> and<00:00:11.290> the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
install hinges without measuring and the

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.930 
install hinges without measuring and the
only<00:00:11.740> thing<00:00:11.889> we<00:00:11.980> need<00:00:12.100> to<00:00:12.219> do<00:00:12.309> is<00:00:12.430> transfer

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
only thing we need to do is transfer

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.150 
only thing we need to do is transfer
marks<00:00:13.269> from<00:00:13.450> one<00:00:13.690> piece<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:14.110> another<00:00:14.230> and<00:00:14.799> it's

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
marks from one piece to another and it's

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.040 
marks from one piece to another and it's
incredibly<00:00:15.700> accurate<00:00:15.969> very<00:00:16.480> quick

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
incredibly accurate very quick

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.170 
incredibly accurate very quick
it<00:00:17.290> does<00:00:17.529> require<00:00:17.740> however<00:00:18.610> a<00:00:18.700> little<00:00:18.970> bit<00:00:19.090> of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
it does require however a little bit of

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.150 
it does require however a little bit of
planning<00:00:19.509> on<00:00:19.810> your<00:00:19.930> part<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.650> make<00:00:20.800> sure<00:00:20.830> you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
planning on your part to make sure you

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.740 
planning on your part to make sure you
know<00:00:21.310> exactly<00:00:21.430> how<00:00:22.240> you're<00:00:22.449> going<00:00:22.570> to<00:00:22.630> be

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
know exactly how you're going to be

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.990 
know exactly how you're going to be
doing<00:00:23.080> this<00:00:23.170> later<00:00:23.380> on<00:00:23.500> down<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:23.800> road<00:00:23.980> now<00:00:24.730> in

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
doing this later on down the road now in

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.910 
doing this later on down the road now in
this<00:00:25.210> particular<00:00:25.720> example<00:00:25.840> I've<00:00:26.380> got

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
this particular example I've got

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.830 
this particular example I've got
mortises<00:00:27.519> already<00:00:28.090> in<00:00:28.240> the<00:00:28.359> side<00:00:28.539> of<00:00:28.720> my

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
mortises already in the side of my

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.750 
mortises already in the side of my
cabinet<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.500> I<00:00:29.890> need<00:00:30.039> to<00:00:30.130> transfer<00:00:30.609> those

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
cabinet and I need to transfer those

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.970 
cabinet and I need to transfer those
locations<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.779> those<00:00:31.869> mortises<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.559> the<00:00:32.739> door

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
locations of those mortises to the door

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.520 
locations of those mortises to the door
so<00:00:33.519> that<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.790> hinge<00:00:34.030> is<00:00:34.210> line<00:00:34.420> exactly<00:00:34.870> the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
so that the hinge is line exactly the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.229 
so that the hinge is line exactly the
same<00:00:35.769> location<00:00:36.400> on<00:00:36.489> both<00:00:36.550> if<00:00:36.879> it's<00:00:36.970> even

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
same location on both if it's even

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.570 
same location on both if it's even
slightly<00:00:37.659> off<00:00:37.839> those<00:00:38.559> hinges<00:00:38.830> are<00:00:39.040> not<00:00:39.220> going

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
slightly off those hinges are not going

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.670 
slightly off those hinges are not going
to<00:00:39.699> work<00:00:39.909> properly<00:00:40.210> so<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:41.199> way<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:41.470> I<00:00:41.500> like

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
to work properly so the way that I like

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.860 
to work properly so the way that I like
to<00:00:41.830> do<00:00:41.949> this<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.370> by<00:00:42.699> using<00:00:42.729> center<00:00:43.629> lines

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
to do this is by using center lines

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.259 
to do this is by using center lines
instead<00:00:44.559> of<00:00:44.620> marking<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.100> absolute<00:00:45.729> start

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
instead of marking the absolute start

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.660 
instead of marking the absolute start
and<00:00:46.479> stop<00:00:47.049> location<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.920> each<00:00:48.100> hinge<00:00:48.460> and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
and stop location of each hinge and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.310 
and stop location of each hinge and
measuring<00:00:49.150> and<00:00:49.330> trying<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.690> transfer<00:00:50.170> those

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
measuring and trying to transfer those

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.259 
measuring and trying to transfer those
numbers<00:00:50.680> I'm<00:00:51.100> doing<00:00:51.549> everything<00:00:51.760> based<00:00:52.089> on

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
numbers I'm doing everything based on

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.689 
numbers I'm doing everything based on
center<00:00:52.690> points<00:00:53.080> so<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.199> if<00:00:53.559> I<00:00:53.890> align<00:00:54.519> this

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
center points so that if I align this

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.520 
center points so that if I align this
little<00:00:54.970> jig<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.269> I<00:00:55.479> made<00:00:55.659> for<00:00:55.839> my<00:00:55.900> router<00:00:56.260> if

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
little jig that I made for my router if

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.160 
little jig that I made for my router if
I<00:00:56.949> align<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:57.489> with<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.790> Center<00:00:58.180> Point<00:00:58.390> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
I align that with that Center Point the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.770 
I align that with that Center Point the
base<00:00:59.799> of<00:01:00.040> the<00:01:00.430> router<00:01:00.610> starts<00:01:01.299> and<00:01:01.479> stops

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
base of the router starts and stops

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.630 
base of the router starts and stops
based<00:01:02.170> on<00:01:02.379> where<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.559> have<00:01:02.769> my<00:01:02.949> stops<00:01:03.250> placed

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
based on where I have my stops placed

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.640 
based on where I have my stops placed
but<00:01:04.210> all<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.479> need<00:01:04.720> to<00:01:04.869> do<00:01:04.989> is<00:01:05.140> line<00:01:05.350> up<00:01:05.530> my

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
but all I need to do is line up my

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.410 
but all I need to do is line up my
center<00:01:06.040> line<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.549> jig<00:01:06.760> with<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.090> center

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
center line on the jig with the center

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.540 
center line on the jig with the center
line<00:01:07.600> on<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.260> workpiece<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:09.160> if<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.370> can

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
line on the workpiece so if I can

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.400 
line on the workpiece so if I can
transfer<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.660> center<00:01:10.960> line<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.290> these

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
transfer the center line of these

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.980 
transfer the center line of these
existing<00:01:12.010> mortises<00:01:12.520> here<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:13.330> my<00:01:13.510> new<00:01:13.690> door

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
existing mortises here to my new door

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.740 
existing mortises here to my new door
and<00:01:14.320> then<00:01:14.710> put<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.400> jig<00:01:15.640> on<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.330> door<00:01:16.480> like

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
and then put the jig on to the door like

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.960 
and then put the jig on to the door like
so<00:01:17.020> I<00:01:17.260> should<00:01:17.770> be<00:01:17.830> able<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.040> get<00:01:18.160> those<00:01:18.340> the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
so I should be able to get those the

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.760 
so I should be able to get those the
mortises<00:01:19.390> placed<00:01:19.690> in<00:01:19.870> exactly<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.620> right

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
mortises placed in exactly the right

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.340 
mortises placed in exactly the right
position<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:22.090> all<00:01:22.240> starts<00:01:22.600> by<00:01:22.660> placing<00:01:23.230> the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
position it all starts by placing the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.280 
position it all starts by placing the
door<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.910> location<00:01:25.480> that<00:01:25.810> we<00:01:25.960> want<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.260> to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
door in the location that we want it to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.890 
door in the location that we want it to
be<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:27.340> see<00:01:27.490> we<00:01:27.640> can<00:01:27.790> measure<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.630> try

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
be you see we can measure this and try

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.930 
be you see we can measure this and try
and<00:01:29.050> Mark<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.380> all<00:01:29.500> out<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:29.920> for<00:01:30.070> me<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
and Mark it all out but for me the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.760 
and Mark it all out but for me the
dummy-proof<00:01:31.240> way<00:01:31.720> of<00:01:31.870> doing<00:01:32.170> this<00:01:32.290> is<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.620> make

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
dummy-proof way of doing this is to make

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.010 
dummy-proof way of doing this is to make
sure<00:01:32.800> that<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.310> door<00:01:33.520> is<00:01:33.550> in<00:01:33.940> exactly<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
sure that the door is in exactly the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.140 
sure that the door is in exactly the
position<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.590> we<00:01:35.740> will<00:01:35.890> want<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.340> be<00:01:36.520> as<00:01:37.090> a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
position that we will want it to be as a

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.050 
position that we will want it to be as a
final<00:01:37.630> result<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.050> I<00:01:38.860> stabilize<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.940> and

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
final result so I stabilize it and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.940 
final result so I stabilize it and
immobilize<00:01:40.659> it<00:01:40.870> in<00:01:41.020> position<00:01:41.590> so<00:01:41.800> that<00:01:41.830> I

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
immobilize it in position so that I

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.250 
immobilize it in position so that I
could<00:01:42.159> transfer<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.610> marks<00:01:42.850> accurately<00:01:43.600> now

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
could transfer the marks accurately now

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.380 
could transfer the marks accurately now
you<00:01:44.320> can<00:01:44.560> use<00:01:44.680> little<00:01:44.980> thin<00:01:45.190> strips<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:45.970> veneer

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
you can use little thin strips of veneer

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.290 
you can use little thin strips of veneer
of<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:47.409> know<00:01:47.500> drum<00:01:47.800> sanded<00:01:48.250> strips<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.120> wood

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
of you know drum sanded strips of wood

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.000 
of you know drum sanded strips of wood
if<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.479> wanted<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:50.110> just<00:01:50.320> have<00:01:50.680> an<00:01:50.830> old

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
if you wanted to I just have an old

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.130 
if you wanted to I just have an old
feeler<00:01:51.729> gauge<00:01:52.000> set<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.510> I'm<00:01:52.600> using<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.110> I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
feeler gauge set that I'm using and I

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.660 
feeler gauge set that I'm using and I
just<00:01:53.530> took<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.740> all<00:01:53.860> apart<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.460> I'm<00:01:54.520> just

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
just took it all apart and I'm just

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.270 
just took it all apart and I'm just
using<00:01:54.820> these<00:01:55.120> as<00:01:55.390> shims<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.440> idea<00:01:56.710> here<00:01:57.100> is<00:01:57.220> to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
using these as shims the idea here is to

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.790 
using these as shims the idea here is to
shim<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.000> door<00:01:58.180> so<00:01:58.930> it's<00:01:59.140> centered<00:01:59.380> in

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
shim the door so it's centered in

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.880 
shim the door so it's centered in
exactly<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.880> way<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.240> want<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.860> okay<00:02:02.860> I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
exactly the way that you want it okay I

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.950 
exactly the way that you want it okay I
put<00:02:03.159> one<00:02:03.400> set<00:02:03.700> at<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.940> bottom<00:02:04.299> doesn't<00:02:04.659> matter

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
put one set at the bottom doesn't matter

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.469 
put one set at the bottom doesn't matter
what<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.290> number<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.790> just<00:02:07.060> matters<00:02:07.360> that

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
what the number is it just matters that

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.169 
what the number is it just matters that
your<00:02:07.630> door<00:02:07.900> is<00:02:08.319> centered<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.340> completely

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
your door is centered and completely

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.270 
your door is centered and completely
immobilized<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:11.590> metal<00:02:11.860> ones<00:02:12.010> are<00:02:12.129> a<00:02:12.159> little

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
immobilized the metal ones are a little

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.460 
immobilized the metal ones are a little
bit<00:02:12.459> slippery<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.260> probably<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.350> only

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
bit slippery so it's probably the only

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.490 
bit slippery so it's probably the only
disadvantage<00:02:14.830> here<00:02:15.930> okay<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.319> it<00:02:17.410> at

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
disadvantage here okay so I have it at

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.600 
disadvantage here okay so I have it at
the<00:02:17.590> bottom

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the bottom

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.980 
the bottom
and<00:02:18.700> now<00:02:18.790> I'm<00:02:18.850> going<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.060> insert<00:02:19.360> these<00:02:19.600> at<00:02:19.900> the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
and now I'm going to insert these at the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.020 
and now I'm going to insert these at the
top<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:21.160> that's<00:02:21.340> going<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> lock<00:02:21.820> everything

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
top and that's going to lock everything

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.630 
top and that's going to lock everything
in<00:02:22.390> place<00:02:25.680> see<00:02:28.920> now<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.100> not<00:02:30.220> going<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.520> move

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
in place see now it's not going to move

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.500 
in place see now it's not going to move
and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.890> from<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.220> point<00:02:33.520> it's<00:02:33.940> as<00:02:34.090> easy<00:02:34.330> as

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
and then from this point it's as easy as

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.910 
and then from this point it's as easy as
transferring<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.290> centerline<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.280> door

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.320 

now<00:02:41.920> with<00:02:42.070> these<00:02:42.160> center<00:02:42.460> lines<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.850> place<00:02:43.090> all

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
now with these center lines in place all

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.410 
now with these center lines in place all
I<00:02:43.390> need<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.370> attach<00:02:45.370> my<00:02:45.580> jig<00:02:45.910> start<00:02:46.300> up
