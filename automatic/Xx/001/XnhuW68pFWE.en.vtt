00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
that now given this study well actually

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.770 
that now given this study well actually
the<00:00:47.550> study<00:00:47.730> didn't<00:00:48.030> look<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.570> time

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the study didn't look at what time

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
the study didn't look at what time
people<00:00:49.110> eat<00:00:49.289> their<00:00:49.500> food<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.370> very

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
people eat their food it was really very

people eat their food it was really very
focused<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.629> giving<00:00:52.230> kids<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.620> very<00:00:52.920> specific

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
focused on giving kids a very specific

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.450 
focused on giving kids a very specific
type<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.910> omega-3<00:00:54.329> called<00:00:54.840> DHA<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.370> was

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
type of omega-3 called DHA and it was

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
type of omega-3 called DHA and it was
what<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.610> call<00:00:56.789> an<00:00:56.879> interventional<00:00:57.750> trial

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
what we call an interventional trial

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.810 
what we call an interventional trial
where<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.500> kids<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> some<00:00:59.550> kids

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
where some kids got it and some kids

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.569 
where some kids got it and some kids
didn't<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.289> profound<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
didn't and what was so profound is the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
didn't and what was so profound is the
authors<00:01:02.969> found<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.480> when<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> kids

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
authors found that when the kids

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.520 
authors found that when the kids
received<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.519> type<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.970> omega-3<00:01:06.450> called<00:01:06.900> DHA

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
received this type of omega-3 called DHA

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.649 
received this type of omega-3 called DHA
their<00:01:08.220> reading<00:01:08.640> performance<00:01:08.820> really

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
their reading performance really

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.230 
their reading performance really
exploded<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> their<00:01:10.920> behavior<00:01:11.490> settled<00:01:12.090> down

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
exploded and their behavior settled down

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.810 
exploded and their behavior settled down
so<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.380> dramatic<00:01:14.070> finding<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so it's really a dramatic finding and it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
so it's really a dramatic finding and it
was<00:01:14.939> obviously<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.689> recently<00:01:16.110> published

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
was obviously just recently published

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.370 
was obviously just recently published
and<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.770> well<00:01:16.950> point<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:17.390> really<00:01:18.390> taking

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and as you well point out really taking

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.499 
and as you well point out really taking
the<00:01:19.470> world<00:01:19.650> by<00:01:19.740> storm<00:01:19.939> all<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.060> talk<00:01:21.299> about

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the world by storm all right talk about

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.800 
the world by storm all right talk about
DHA<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.229> had<00:01:22.500> mentioned<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:23.790> what<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.659> an

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
DHA you had mentioned it's what it's an

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.240 
DHA you had mentioned it's what it's an
oil<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:25.979> oils<00:01:28.040> DHA<00:01:29.040> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
oil is that right or it's in oils DHA is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.429 
oil is that right or it's in oils DHA is
one<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> omega-3s<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.020> unique

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
one of the omega-3s it's a unique

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.030 
one of the omega-3s it's a unique
omega-3<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> study<00:01:33.090> actually<00:01:33.600> used<00:01:34.040> DHA

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
omega-3 and the study actually used DHA

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
omega-3 and the study actually used DHA
that<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.310> derived<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.820> algae<00:01:36.140> turns<00:01:37.140> out

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that is derived from algae turns out

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.469 
that is derived from algae turns out
that<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> lot<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> algae<00:01:38.909> DHA

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that there are a lot of algae DHA

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.870 
that there are a lot of algae DHA
products<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> market<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.950> isn't<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.729> if

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
products on the market so it isn't as if

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.539
