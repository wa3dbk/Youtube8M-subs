that I'm not a huge fan of the helmet

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.139 
that I'm not a huge fan of the helmet
got<00:00:58.500> heavier<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.070> closer<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.609> four<00:00:59.969> pounds

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
got heavier it's closer to four pounds

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 
got heavier it's closer to four pounds
now<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.870> actually<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.199> three<00:01:01.620> pounds<00:01:02.100> 15

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
now it's actually like three pounds 15

now it's actually like three pounds 15
ounces<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.940> change<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.750> about<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.260> ounce

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
ounces in change that's about an ounce

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.010 
ounces in change that's about an ounce
and<00:01:04.920> change<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.880> from<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> older<00:01:06.420> version<00:01:06.750> but

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and change up from the older version but

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
and change up from the older version but
guys<00:01:07.170> keep<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.619> mind<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.310> heavy<00:01:08.580> helmet

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
guys keep in mind that's a heavy helmet

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
guys keep in mind that's a heavy helmet
and<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> modular<00:01:10.380> factor<00:01:10.799> it's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and if you need the modular factor it's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.469 
and if you need the modular factor it's
going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> come<00:01:11.310> into<00:01:11.460> play<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> will<00:01:12.360> get

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
going to come into play but it will get

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.090 
going to come into play but it will get
heavy<00:01:12.689> over<00:01:12.960> time<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.439> part<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> reason

heavy over time and part of the reason

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
heavy over time and part of the reason
is<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.340> other<00:01:14.640> premium<00:01:14.939> modulars<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.659> the

venturi out of the back but if we look
at<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> top<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> different<00:01:32.850> vent

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030

other thing you know we have moved to
the<00:01:46.619> n91<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.700> has<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.930> neutral

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the n91 which now has more of a neutral

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
the n91 which now has more of a neutral
fit<00:01:49.799> shape<00:01:50.009> which<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
fit shape which I really like it was a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
fit shape which I really like it was a
little<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.810> round<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.710> guys

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
little bit more round here some guys

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.590 
little bit more round here some guys
like<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> round<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.640> find<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> neutral

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
like the round I find that the neutral

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.030 
like the round I find that the neutral
to<00:01:54.659> intermediate<00:01:55.229> shape<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.920> fit

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
to intermediate shape it's going to fit

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.410 
to intermediate shape it's going to fit
more<00:01:56.219> riders<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.060> good<00:01:57.210> thing

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
more riders I think that's a good thing

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.730 
more riders I think that's a good thing
but<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> way<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.170> they've<00:01:58.320> done<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
but the way that they've done the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
but the way that they've done the
internal<00:01:59.490> lining<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.600> a

internal lining here it's actually a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
internal lining here it's actually a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
updated vent scheme out the back which I

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.039 
updated vent scheme out the back which I
do<00:02:57.459> like<00:02:57.850> with<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.030> more<00:02:58.239> pronounced<00:02:58.569> spoiler

do like with a more pronounced spoiler
then<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.530> have<00:02:59.709> your<00:02:59.950> singular<00:03:00.400> vent<00:03:00.640> here<00:03:00.970> on

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
then you have your singular vent here on

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.910 
then you have your singular vent here on
the<00:03:01.390> front<00:03:01.630> down<00:03:01.780> here<00:03:01.989> along<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.200> chin<00:03:02.500> when

face ability and if we look here along

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.070 
face ability and if we look here along
the<00:03:08.709> left<00:03:08.739> you're<00:03:09.310> going<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.670> have<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:10.080> slide

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the left you're going to have this slide

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.750 
the left you're going to have this slide
which<00:03:11.680> allows<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.190> bring<00:03:12.459> down<00:03:12.610> the

which allows you to bring down the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.680 
which allows you to bring down the
drop-down<00:03:13.120> Sun<00:03:13.360> Visor

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
drop-down Sun Visor

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.509 
drop-down Sun Visor
now<00:03:14.019> we<00:03:14.080> do<00:03:14.410> know<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.769> adding<00:03:15.130> more<00:03:15.160> weight

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
now we do know that adding more weight

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.640 
now we do know that adding more weight
you<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:16.269> function<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:17.110> comes<00:03:17.380> par

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
you have this function that comes par

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.780 
you have this function that comes par
for<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.829> course<00:03:18.040> but<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.370> allows<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:18.760> to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
for the course but it allows you to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.009 
for the course but it allows you to
never<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.239> change<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.750> shield

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019

something a lot of folks really like

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.599 
something a lot of folks really like
it's<00:03:21.880> kind<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.150> all-in-one<00:03:22.780> package

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
it's kind of that all-in-one package

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.319 
it's kind of that all-in-one package
depending<00:03:24.609> on<00:03:24.700> if<00:03:24.820> you're<00:03:24.910> looking<00:03:25.180> with<00:03:25.299> a

depending on if you're looking with a
drop-down<00:03:26.170> Sun<00:03:26.440> Visor<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.859> would<00:03:26.950> be<00:03:27.040> one<00:03:27.160> of

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
drop-down Sun Visor that would be one of

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.800 
drop-down Sun Visor that would be one of
the<00:03:27.310> big<00:03:27.430> upgrades<00:03:27.820> over<00:03:28.269> something<00:03:28.600> like<00:03:28.630> the

it's<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:50.980> nice<00:03:51.190> add-on<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.030> don't<00:03:52.209> have

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
it's a nice add-on that you don't have

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.180 
it's a nice add-on that you don't have
to<00:03:52.420> pay<00:03:52.540> for<00:03:52.569> layer<00:03:52.930> later<00:03:53.500> that's<00:03:53.739> actually

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
to pay for layer later that's actually

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.099 
to pay for layer later that's actually
in<00:03:54.250> my<00:03:54.340> opinion<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.730> nice<00:03:54.880> value<00:03:55.269> add<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:56.019> then

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
in my opinion a nice value add and then

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.080 
in my opinion a nice value add and then
look<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.380> your<00:03:56.470> eye<00:03:56.530> port<00:03:56.980> solid<00:03:57.430> gasket<00:03:57.850> same

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
will call out though is it's very
