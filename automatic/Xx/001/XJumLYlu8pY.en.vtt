of<00:04:45.419> these<00:04:45.600> headphones<00:04:45.840> which<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.470> I<00:04:46.680> guess

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
of these headphones which is I guess

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.700 
of these headphones which is I guess
mostly<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.639> most<00:04:47.880> important<00:04:48.389> part<00:04:48.630> of<00:04:48.840> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
mostly the most important part of the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.909 
mostly the most important part of the
video<00:04:49.980> i<00:04:50.070> guess<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:51.780> bozo<00:04:52.200> e2<00:04:52.530> headphones

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
video i guess the bozo e2 headphones
