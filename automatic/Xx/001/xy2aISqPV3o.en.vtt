00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.770 
we have our system powered off so we're
going<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> go<00:02:46.150> ahead<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.420> hit<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.600> start

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
going to go ahead and hit the start

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.420 
going to go ahead and hit the start
button<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.830> see<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.130> actually

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
button and we can see it's actually

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.030 
button and we can see it's actually
turned<00:02:51.580> on<00:02:51.730> our<00:02:51.880> system<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.680> here<00:02:53.890> it's

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
turned on our system and so here it's

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.770 
turned on our system and so here it's
gonna<00:02:54.130> say<00:02:54.370> detecting<00:02:55.120> memory<00:02:55.480> check<00:02:56.440> CPU<00:02:57.070> and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
gonna say detecting memory check CPU and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.060 
gonna say detecting memory check CPU and
it's<00:02:58.780> actually<00:02:59.050> going<00:02:59.200> through<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.440> process

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
it's actually going through the process

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.820 
it's actually going through the process
initializing<00:03:00.640> USB<00:03:01.150> loading<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.020> VGA<00:03:02.350> bios

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
initializing USB loading the VGA bios

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.920 
initializing USB loading the VGA bios
and<00:03:03.130> we<00:03:04.000> can<00:03:04.150> see<00:03:04.270> now<00:03:04.300> our<00:03:04.450> system<00:03:04.870> is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
and we can see now our system is

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.890 
and we can see now our system is
actually<00:03:05.020> coming<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.500> initializing<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.400> ROM

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
actually coming on initializing the ROM

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.350 
actually coming on initializing the ROM
and<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:09.220> actually<00:03:09.610> going<00:03:09.820> through<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
and it's actually going through the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360 
and it's actually going through the
entire<00:03:10.630> process<00:03:10.930> letting<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.650> know<00:03:11.830> whether

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
entire process letting you know whether

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.160 
entire process letting you know whether
your<00:03:12.580> system<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:12.970> halt<00:03:13.209> or<00:03:13.570> having<00:03:13.930> an<00:03:14.020> issue

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
your system is halt or having an issue

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.600 
your system is halt or having an issue
now<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:14.980> event<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.280> there<00:03:15.430> was<00:03:15.580> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
now in the event that there was a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.670 
now in the event that there was a
problem<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.450> actually<00:03:16.870> will<00:03:16.989> alert<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.650> to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
problem it actually will alert you to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.670 
problem it actually will alert you to
that<00:03:17.860> here<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.390> actually<00:03:19.570> told<00:03:19.870> us<00:03:20.019> it's

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
that here but it's actually told us it's

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.759 
that here but it's actually told us it's
now<00:03:21.150> successfully<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:23.019> know<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.320> we're

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
now successfully so we know that we're

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.170 
now successfully so we know that we're
actually<00:03:23.890> going<00:03:24.190> into<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.549> operating<00:03:24.880> system

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
actually going into the operating system

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.750 
actually going into the operating system
without<00:03:25.239> any<00:03:25.540> issues<00:03:25.959> now<00:03:26.650> from<00:03:26.890> here<00:03:27.250> one<00:03:27.700> of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
without any issues now from here one of

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.280 
without any issues now from here one of
the<00:03:27.850> other<00:03:28.030> cool<00:03:28.269> aspects<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.080> like<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
the other cool aspects is that I like to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.840 
the other cool aspects is that I like to
do<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.620> from<00:03:29.739> monitoring<00:03:30.310> we<00:03:30.670> have<00:03:30.820> a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
do it from monitoring we have a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.550 
do it from monitoring we have a
fantastic<00:03:31.450> application<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.110> comes<00:03:32.320> within

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
fantastic application that comes within

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.410 
fantastic application that comes within
our<00:03:32.769> boards<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:33.340> called<00:03:33.519> 8i<00:03:33.790> suite<00:03:34.030> 2<00:03:34.239> which

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
our boards it's called 8i suite 2 which

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.970 
our boards it's called 8i suite 2 which
gives<00:03:34.450> us<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.900> whole<00:03:35.080> nother<00:03:35.530> level<00:03:35.769> of

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
gives us a whole nother level of

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.710 
gives us a whole nother level of
monitoring<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:37.120> lot<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.299> cool<00:03:37.510> stuff<00:03:37.540> that

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
monitoring and a lot of cool stuff that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.690 
monitoring and a lot of cool stuff that
we<00:03:37.870> do<00:03:38.140> there<00:03:38.350> but<00:03:38.920> if<00:03:39.220> there's<00:03:39.549> something

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
we do there but if there's something

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.039 
we do there but if there's something
that<00:03:39.850> maybe<00:03:40.000> doesn't<00:03:40.330> want<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.540> run<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.810> in

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
that maybe doesn't want to run that in

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.750 
that maybe doesn't want to run that in
your<00:03:41.709> system<00:03:42.040> tray<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.310> don't<00:03:42.489> want<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.670> have

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
your system tray you don't want to have

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.250 
your system tray you don't want to have
that<00:03:42.910> actively<00:03:43.209> running<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.930> could<00:03:44.079> have

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
that actively running you could have

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.110 
that actively running you could have
this<00:03:44.410> connected<00:03:44.769> externally<00:03:45.370> utilizing<00:03:45.970> no

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
this connected externally utilizing no

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.690 
this connected externally utilizing no
resources<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.890> can<00:03:48.040> essentially<00:03:48.400> be

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
resources and you can essentially be

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.300 
resources and you can essentially be
looking<00:03:49.660> at<00:03:49.780> all<00:03:50.049> your<00:03:50.200> base<00:03:50.410> information<00:03:50.739> so

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
looking at all your base information so

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.100 
looking at all your base information so
our<00:03:51.430> systems<00:03:51.790> come<00:03:51.970> on<00:03:52.150> but<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.690> can<00:03:52.870> go<00:03:52.989> ahead

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
our systems come on but I can go ahead

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.009 
our systems come on but I can go ahead
and<00:03:53.350> see<00:03:53.560> my<00:03:53.980> CPU<00:03:54.400> fan<00:03:54.640> speed<00:03:55.060> here's<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
and see my CPU fan speed here's the

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.170 
and see my CPU fan speed here's the
rotation<00:03:56.620> if<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:56.980> had<00:03:57.130> other<00:03:57.250> chassis<00:03:57.579> fans<00:03:57.970> or

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
rotation if I had other chassis fans or

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.180 
rotation if I had other chassis fans or
optional<00:03:58.600> fans<00:03:58.870> they're<00:03:59.440> all<00:03:59.530> connected<00:04:00.010> and

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
optional fans they're all connected and

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.100 
optional fans they're all connected and
I<00:04:00.489> have<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.700> nice<00:04:00.970> diagram<00:04:01.269> here<00:04:01.810> where<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:02.019> can

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
I have a nice diagram here where I can

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.530 
I have a nice diagram here where I can
have<00:04:02.380> set<00:04:02.739> all<00:04:03.340> these<00:04:03.610> different<00:04:03.970> items<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.450> I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
have set all these different items and I

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.390 
have set all these different items and I
can<00:04:04.690> go<00:04:04.810> ahead<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.049> monitor<00:04:05.290> them<00:04:05.680> see<00:04:06.250> how

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
can go ahead and monitor them see how

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.340 
can go ahead and monitor them see how
they're<00:04:06.579> going<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.750> once<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.019> go<00:04:08.140> ahead<00:04:08.230> and

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
they're going and once I go ahead and

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.080 
they're going and once I go ahead and
click<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.739> play<00:04:08.890> button<00:04:08.920> it's<00:04:09.730> actually

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
click the play button it's actually

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
click the play button it's actually
going<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.269> go<00:04:10.390> ahead<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.750> start<00:04:10.959> recording

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
going to go ahead and start recording

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.949 
going to go ahead and start recording
that<00:04:11.530> information<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.850> can<00:04:13.030> monitor<00:04:13.600> it

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
that information and I can monitor it

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.690 
that information and I can monitor it
and<00:04:14.110> save<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:14.680> store<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.100> if<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.430> want<00:04:15.610> to

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
and save it and store it if I want to

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.550 
and save it and store it if I want to
make<00:04:15.790> any<00:04:15.940> adjustments<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.840> can<00:04:17.229> go<00:04:17.500> to

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
make any adjustments I can go to

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.710 
make any adjustments I can go to
settings<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.970> could<00:04:19.150> change<00:04:19.390> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
settings and I could change the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.120 
settings and I could change the
different<00:04:20.019> types<00:04:20.169> of<00:04:20.290> items<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:20.919> actually

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
different types of items that I actually

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.740 
different types of items that I actually
want<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.489> go

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
want to go

and monitor on my system now those are

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.790 
and monitor on my system now those are
just<00:04:27.510> some<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.960> initial<00:04:28.350> functions<00:04:28.710> that

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
just some of the initial functions that

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.950 
just some of the initial functions that
are<00:04:28.920> available<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.490> RG<00:04:29.850> RG<00:04:30.420> Connect

we<00:04:31.350> also<00:04:31.500> have<00:04:31.800> special<00:04:31.980> functions<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:32.670> GPU

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
we also have special functions like GPU

we also have special functions like GPU
tweak<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.540> which<00:04:33.900> actually<00:04:34.080> allows<00:04:34.440> us<00:04:34.470> to

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
tweak it which actually allows us to

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.770 
tweak it which actually allows us to
access<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.430> graphics<00:04:35.820> card<00:04:36.060> or<00:04:36.360> we<00:04:36.660> can

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
access the graphics card or we can

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.330 
access the graphics card or we can
actually<00:04:36.900> adjust<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.350> fan<00:04:37.590> speed<00:04:37.620> we<00:04:38.190> can

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
actually adjust the fan speed we can

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.400 
actually adjust the fan speed we can
over<00:04:38.610> bolt<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:38.970> we<00:04:39.120> can<00:04:39.240> overclock<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.780> of

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
over bolt it we can overclock it of

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.820 
over bolt it we can overclock it of
course

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
course

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.770

or<00:04:43.140> we<00:04:43.350> can<00:04:43.470> go<00:04:43.590> ahead<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:43.800> actually

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
or we can go ahead and actually

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.130 
or we can go ahead and actually
overclock<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.520> system<00:04:44.970> itself<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.660> we<00:04:46.020> can

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
overclock the system itself and we can

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.690 
overclock the system itself and we can
make<00:04:46.290> low-level<00:04:46.770> adjustments<00:04:47.280> in<00:04:47.370> terms<00:04:47.400> of

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
make low-level adjustments in terms of

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.360 
make low-level adjustments in terms of
voltage<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.300> bus<00:04:48.510> speeds<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.110> whatnot<00:04:49.890> but

voltage and bus speeds and whatnot but

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.950 
voltage and bus speeds and whatnot but
we'll<00:04:50.760> save<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:50.940> for<00:04:51.150> another<00:04:51.210> video<00:04:51.570> thanks
