a<00:00:50.850> good<00:00:51.000> idea<00:00:51.390> either<00:00:51.600> i<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:53.039> teams

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
a good idea either i I think teams

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.939 
a good idea either i I think teams
should<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.930> looked<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.469> more

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
should be looked at a little more

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.330 
should be looked at a little more
carefully<00:00:56.610> by<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.170> FMCSA<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> push

carefully by the FMCSA with the push
these<00:00:59.520> days<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.960> prevent<00:01:01.730> driving<00:01:02.730> while

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
these days to prevent driving while

safety<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.860> big<00:01:07.890> issue<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.460> days<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.090> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
safety is a big issue these days and I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
safety is a big issue these days and I
really<00:01:09.900> questioned<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> safety<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.159> teams<00:01:11.430> in

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

really questioned the safety of teams in
some<00:01:11.970> instances<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:13.170> I'm<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.530> saying<00:01:13.860> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
some instances now I'm not saying in

every instance husband-and-wife teams I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.969 
every instance husband-and-wife teams I

but these just-in-time teams

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.319 
but these just-in-time teams
worry<00:01:41.070> me<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.460> they're<00:01:41.790> always<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
schedule they're always on a deadline

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
schedule they're always on a deadline
and<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.729> believe<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.240> some<00:01:45.450> instances<00:01:45.930> they

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and I believe in some instances they

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.340 
and I believe in some instances they
tend<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.189> push<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> envelope<00:01:47.930> either<00:01:48.930> when

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
tend to to push the envelope either when

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.490 
tend to to push the envelope either when
the<00:01:49.950> weather<00:01:50.939> dictates<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.780> shouldn't<00:01:52.229> or

the weather dictates they shouldn't or

running<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> team<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:36.110> just<00:03:37.110> don't<00:03:37.620> think<00:03:37.830> it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
running a team I just don't think it's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.949 
running a team I just don't think it's
clever<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.760> think<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.330> loophole<00:03:39.570> that

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
clever and I think it's a loophole that

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.710 
clever and I think it's a loophole that
the<00:03:40.140> FMCSA<00:03:41.130> has<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.580> address<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:42.480> they're

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
the FMCSA has to address if they're

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.020 
the FMCSA has to address if they're
seriously<00:03:43.260> concerned<00:03:43.830> with<00:03:44.519> making<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
highways a safer place for everybody I

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.810 
highways a safer place for everybody I
think<00:03:48.450> they<00:03:48.630> would<00:03:48.810> have<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:49.019> hard<00:03:49.380> time

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
think they would have a hard time

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.790 
think they would have a hard time
justifying<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.269> use<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.690> teams<00:03:51.989> if<00:03:52.320> they

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
justifying the use of teams if they

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.770 
justifying the use of teams if they
truly<00:03:53.160> knew<00:03:53.610> what<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.000> was<00:03:54.120> like<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.510> try<00:03:54.720> to
