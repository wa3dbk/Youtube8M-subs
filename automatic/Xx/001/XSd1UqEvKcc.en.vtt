you can experiment as much as you need

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
you can experiment as much as you need
to<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> order<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.190> create<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.489> perfect<00:00:48.059> loop

and<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.930> undo/redo<00:00:49.230> function<00:00:50.039> also<00:00:50.219> means

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and the undo/redo function also means

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.400 
and the undo/redo function also means
that<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.969> erase<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.570> regenerate<00:00:52.170> loops

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that you can erase and regenerate loops

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.939 
that you can erase and regenerate loops
hassle-free<00:00:53.120> when<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.539> use<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> Nano<00:00:55.170> 360

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
no interference so let's take a closer

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.500 
no interference so let's take a closer
look<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> taking<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> closer<00:01:02.730> look<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> 360

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
look so taking a closer look at the 360

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.710 
look so taking a closer look at the 360
you've<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.890> foot<00:01:05.220> switch<00:01:05.339> you've<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.390> two

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you've got a foot switch you've got two

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570 
you've got a foot switch you've got two
dials<00:01:07.080> once<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> level<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> level<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
dials once the level that's the level of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.730 
dials once the level that's the level of
your<00:01:08.700> loop<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.570> playing<00:01:09.810> back<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.290> then

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
your loop that's playing back and then

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.410 
your loop that's playing back and then
you've<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:11.040> 11<00:01:11.340> positions<00:01:11.970> where<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.180> can

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you've got 11 positions where you can

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.260 
you've got 11 positions where you can
store<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> record<00:01:13.710> new<00:01:14.220> loops<00:01:14.490> whenever

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
store and record new loops whenever

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
store and record new loops whenever
there's<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.570> loop<00:01:15.750> recorded<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.799> memory<00:01:17.340> LED

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
there's a loop recorded the memory LED

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.780 
there's a loop recorded the memory LED
will<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.450> lit<00:01:18.560> that's<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> yellow<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:20.130> then

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
will be lit that's the yellow one then

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
will be lit that's the yellow one then
you've<00:01:20.909> got<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> grid<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.600> green<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> red<00:01:22.200> LED

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you've got a grid a green and a red LED

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.550 
you've got a grid a green and a red LED
for<00:01:23.189> recording<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.360> playback<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.140> overdub

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
for recording and playback and overdub

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960 
for recording and playback and overdub
and<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.890> sort<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.189> thing<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:26.670> really

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and that sort of thing so that's really

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.649 
and that sort of thing so that's really
simple<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.420> use

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
simple to use

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
simple to use
so<00:01:28.229> yeah<00:01:28.439> there's<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.040> much<00:01:29.159> more<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> other

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so yeah there's not much more to other

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.560 
so yeah there's not much more to other
night<00:01:29.729> you've<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:29.939> an<00:01:30.030> input<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.479> output

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
night you've got an input and an output

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
night you've got an input and an output

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
Jack and a 9-volt battery in so what the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
Jack and a 9-volt battery in so what the
Nano<00:01:34.740> 360<00:01:35.340> set<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.820> ready<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> play<00:01:36.180> I'm

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
Nano 360 set up and ready to play I'm

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.760 
Nano 360 set up and ready to play I'm
going<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> plug<00:01:36.930> straight<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.619> using

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
going to plug straight into it using

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
going to plug straight into it using
this<00:01:38.009> epiphone<00:01:38.460> masterbilt<00:01:38.490> acoustic<00:01:39.030> which

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
this epiphone masterbilt acoustic which

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.700 
this epiphone masterbilt acoustic which
is<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.810> nice<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.710> let's<00:01:41.189> give<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.490> shot

so I've got a groove going there so I
can<00:01:48.450> add<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.320> just

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
can add to that you can see it's just

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.810 
can add to that you can see it's just
playing<00:01:49.649> back<00:01:49.860> at<00:01:49.979> Imogen<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.549> hit<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
playing back at Imogen but if I hit the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.030 
playing back at Imogen but if I hit the
button<00:01:51.000> again<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:52.170> red<00:01:52.530> light<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:52.860> come

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
so you can see now I've added in that

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.810 
so you can see now I've added in that
kind<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:07.810> rhythmical<00:02:08.320> pulse<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:09.430> I<00:02:09.490> wanted<00:02:09.759> to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
kind of rhythmical pulse so I wanted to

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.540 
kind of rhythmical pulse so I wanted to
play<00:02:10.479> with<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> could<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:15.130> what<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.310> do<00:02:15.370> is

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
play with that I could but what I do is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:43.160 
play with that I could but what I do is
I<00:02:15.610> keep<00:02:15.760> building

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.119 

so<00:02:44.170> now<00:02:44.260> I've<00:02:44.349> got<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> nice<00:02:44.650> little<00:02:44.709> groove

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
so now I've got a nice little groove

00:02:45.129 --> 00:03:26.360
