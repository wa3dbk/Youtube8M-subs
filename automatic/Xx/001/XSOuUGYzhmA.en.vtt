tin it's a diminished scale formed by

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.780 
tin it's a diminished scale formed by
moving<00:01:50.350> up<00:01:50.469> a<00:01:50.560> half<00:01:50.770> step<00:01:50.950> then<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.549> whole

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
moving up a half step then the whole

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
moving up a half step then the whole
step<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:53.079> if<00:01:53.380> we<00:01:53.590> take<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.920> note<00:01:54.070> G<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:55.780> I

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
step so if we take the note G well I

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.359 
step so if we take the note G well I
can't<00:01:56.079> on<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.200> fifth<00:01:56.500> fret<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.799> d-string

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
can't on the fifth fret of the d-string

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.840 
can't on the fifth fret of the d-string
we<00:01:57.610> got<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.820> half<00:01:58.060> step<00:01:58.329> above<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:59.110> have<00:01:59.140> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
we got a half step above that you have a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.600 
we got a half step above that you have a
flat<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:01.149> whole<00:02:01.750> step<00:02:01.990> above<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.289> is<00:02:02.710> B<00:02:03.219> my

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
flat a whole step above that is B my

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.550 
flat a whole step above that is B my
half<00:02:04.570> step<00:02:04.899> is<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.670> whole<00:02:07.479> step<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:08.369> D<00:02:09.369> flat

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
half step is be a whole step is D flat

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.870 
half step is be a whole step is D flat
half<00:02:10.800> step<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.760> whole<00:02:12.750> step<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.110> e<00:02:13.880> 1/2

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
half step is the whole step is e 1/2

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.160 
half step is the whole step is e 1/2
step<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.360> F<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:16.800> we're<00:02:16.950> back<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.099> G<00:02:17.970> again

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
step is F and then we're back to G again

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.600 
step is F and then we're back to G again
so<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.410> recommend<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.890> learn<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.190> scale<00:02:20.430> this

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
so I recommend you learn the scale this

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.040 
so I recommend you learn the scale this

than go to the B flat on the D string

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.729 
than go to the B flat on the D string
again<00:02:50.600> go<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.930> third<00:02:52.170> fret<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.560> g

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
again go to the third fret of the g

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.820 
again go to the third fret of the g
string<00:02:52.769> Stetzer<00:02:53.730> G<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.720> flat<00:02:54.870> B<00:02:55.739> flat<00:02:56.810> B<00:02:57.810> then<00:02:58.680> we

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
string Stetzer G a flat B flat B then we

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:15.550 
string Stetzer G a flat B flat B then we
go<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.040> C<00:02:59.910> sharp<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.630> at<00:03:01.410> d<00:03:01.860> e<00:03:02.450> f<00:03:03.890> g

so<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:16.580> see<00:03:16.760> how<00:03:16.820> it's<00:03:16.970> got<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.150> same

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
so can you see how it's got the same

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.560 
so can you see how it's got the same
nurse<00:03:20.230> as<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:22.430> single<00:03:22.850> string<00:03:23.060> we're<00:03:23.240> just<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.510> a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
nurse as a single string we're just in a

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:31.990 
nurse as a single string we're just in a
more<00:03:23.690> convenient<00:03:24.110> position<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:31.000> worried

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
more convenient position and worried

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.790 
more convenient position and worried
what's<00:03:32.660> going<00:03:32.900> on<00:03:33.020> here<00:03:33.200> is<00:03:33.290> we're<00:03:33.440> starting

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
what's going on here is we're starting

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.000 
what's going on here is we're starting
on<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.010> ena<00:03:34.400> 12<00:03:35.390> fret<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.840> top<00:03:35.990> E<00:03:36.020> string<00:03:36.200> and

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
on the ena 12 fret the top E string and

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:46.990 
on the ena 12 fret the top E string and
we're<00:03:37.220> going<00:03:37.460> D<00:03:38.030> then<00:03:38.840> D<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:41.050> G<00:03:42.050> then<00:03:42.950> F<00:03:46.000> so

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
we're going D then D then G then F so

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.840 
we're going D then D then G then F so
make<00:03:47.150> sure<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.900> pattern<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:51.290> really<00:03:51.860> smooth

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
make sure this pattern is really smooth

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.400 
make sure this pattern is really smooth
and<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.150> fingers<00:03:53.540> practice<00:03:53.870> out<00:03:53.990> a<00:03:54.020> few<00:03:54.170> times

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
and the fingers practice out a few times

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.250 
and the fingers practice out a few times
and<00:03:54.620> get<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.860> speed<00:03:55.100> up<00:03:55.750> if<00:03:56.750> ice<00:03:56.900> all<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.170> do

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
and get the speed up if ice all you do

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.380 
and get the speed up if ice all you do
is<00:03:57.380> move<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:57.680> pattern<00:03:58.040> down<00:03:58.280> in<00:03:58.640> minor

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
is move this pattern down in minor

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.630 
is move this pattern down in minor
thirds<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.140> first<00:04:00.380> one<00:04:00.590> starts<00:04:00.950> on<00:04:01.070> e<00:04:01.220> a

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
thirds so the first one starts on e a

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.430 
thirds so the first one starts on e a
minor<00:04:02.450> third<00:04:02.720> deliver<00:04:03.050> that<00:04:03.760> is<00:04:04.900> C<00:04:05.900> sharp<00:04:06.230> and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
minor third deliver that is C sharp and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.790 
minor third deliver that is C sharp and
minor<00:04:06.650> third<00:04:06.860> below<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:12.110> B<00:04:12.320> flat<00:04:12.530> and

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
minor third below that is the B flat and

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.770 
minor third below that is the B flat and
then<00:04:12.860> finally<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.880> last<00:04:13.910> minor<00:04:14.300> third<00:04:14.540> below

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
then finally the last minor third below

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.320 
then finally the last minor third below
B<00:04:14.960> flat<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.470> G<00:04:17.080> so<00:04:18.080> you<00:04:18.140> get<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.620> time<00:04:18.920> e<00:04:19.330> the

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
B flat is a G so you get this time e the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.040 
B flat is a G so you get this time e the
G<00:04:21.260> F<00:04:21.760> move<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.880> down<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.030> minor<00:04:23.300> third<00:04:23.600> standard

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
G F move it down a minor third standard

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.450 
G F move it down a minor third standard
C<00:04:24.260> sharp<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.830> don't<00:04:24.950> really<00:04:25.040> have<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.280> think

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
C sharp you don't really have to think

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.530 
C sharp you don't really have to think
about<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.790> nurse<00:04:25.970> as<00:04:26.150> long<00:04:26.270> as<00:04:26.360> you've<00:04:26.450> got

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
about the nurse as long as you've got

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.800 
about the nurse as long as you've got
