this is a Danville California which is

this is a Danville California which is
an<00:01:16.740> inland<00:01:17.189> valley<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.909> gets<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.390> into<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
an inland valley that gets up into the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.460 
an inland valley that gets up into the
low<00:01:19.680> 100's<00:01:20.689> Fahrenheit<00:01:21.689> during<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> summer

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
low 100's Fahrenheit during the summer

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.100 
low 100's Fahrenheit during the summer
and<00:01:22.770> during<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> winter<00:01:24.030> last<00:01:24.540> year<00:01:24.720> there

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and during the winter last year there

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.200 
and during the winter last year there
was<00:01:25.229> snow<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.920> ground<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.520> common

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
was snow on the ground it's not common

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.539 
was snow on the ground it's not common
but<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:28.020> year<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.470> gotten<00:01:28.860> down<00:01:29.070> into<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
but this year it's gotten down into the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.630 
but this year it's gotten down into the
mid<00:01:29.729> twenties<00:01:30.740> Fahrenheit<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.130> regular

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
mid twenties Fahrenheit on a regular

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.450 
mid twenties Fahrenheit on a regular
basis<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.810> older<00:01:34.200> planting<00:01:34.799> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
basis and this is an older planting that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
basis and this is an older planting that
is<00:01:35.759> faring<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.930> fine<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.530> those

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
is faring just fine with those

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.640 
is faring just fine with those
temperatures<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> lower<00:01:39.030> 20s<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.259> think

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
temperatures in the lower 20s so I think

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.249 
temperatures in the lower 20s so I think
that's<00:01:40.950> probably<00:01:41.430> where<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.210> starts<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> cap

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that's probably where it starts to cap

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's probably where it starts to cap
out<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.829> terms<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.850> handle<00:01:45.270> but

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
out in terms of what it can handle but

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.010 
out in terms of what it can handle but
here's<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.140> close-up<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:48.060> bees<00:01:48.299> love<00:01:48.780> this

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
here's a close-up and the bees love this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.319 
here's a close-up and the bees love this
plant<00:01:49.380> by<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:50.420> honeybees<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
plant by the way honeybees that is and

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.550 
plant by the way honeybees that is and
especially<00:01:54.329> when<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.810> bloom<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.350> just

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
especially when it's in bloom they just

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.310 
especially when it's in bloom they just
go<00:01:55.710> crazy<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.909> very<00:01:57.659> bright<00:01:57.990> display

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
go crazy for it so very bright display

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.560 
go crazy for it so very bright display
that's<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.430> known<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.149> great

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that's what this is known for great

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.740 
that's what this is known for great
erosion<00:02:01.320> control<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.189> nice<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.670> low<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
erosion control and nice and low so the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.780 
erosion control and nice and low so the

undergrowth by the way I do want people

to<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.269> aware<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:18.989> as<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:20.220> grows

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.059 
to be aware of this that as this grows
and<00:02:21.090> gets<00:02:21.269> older<00:02:21.840> underneath<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.860> get<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
and gets older underneath you get a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.750 
and gets older underneath you get a
woody<00:02:23.400> thatch<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.799> can<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.310> as<00:02:26.459> deep

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
woody thatch that that can get as deep

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.630

deep<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.560> mound<00:02:32.010> II<00:02:33.170> thing<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.379> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
deep and this mound II thing that you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.039 
deep and this mound II thing that you
see<00:02:34.769> going<00:02:35.159> on<00:02:35.310> with<00:02:35.549> this<00:02:35.790> older<00:02:36.209> planting<00:02:36.840> is

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
see going on with this older planting is

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.740 
see going on with this older planting is
you<00:02:37.500> get<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.370> humps<00:02:38.849> are<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.269> older

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
you get the the humps are the older

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.770 
you get the the humps are the older
detter<00:02:40.079> stuff<00:02:40.590> underneath<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:42.269> then<00:02:42.569> this

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
detter stuff underneath and then this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.259 
detter stuff underneath and then this
just<00:02:43.049> grows<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.709> top<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> old<00:02:44.579> stuff<00:02:44.970> and

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
just grows on top of the old stuff and

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.900 
just grows on top of the old stuff and
keeps<00:02:45.480> renewing<00:02:46.079> itself<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.859> but<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.730> is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
keeps renewing itself so but this is

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.780 
keeps renewing itself so but this is
probably<00:02:48.150> 10<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.079> 15<00:02:49.500> year<00:02:49.680> old<00:02:49.829> planting<00:02:50.489> and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
probably 10 to 15 year old planting and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.960 
probably 10 to 15 year old planting and
maybe<00:02:51.510> that's<00:02:52.079> 8<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.829> 10<00:02:53.040> inches<00:02:53.459> deep<00:02:53.489> it's

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
maybe that's 8 to 10 inches deep it's

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.660 
maybe that's 8 to 10 inches deep it's
not<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.450> not<00:02:54.660> too<00:02:54.900> bad<00:02:55.340> but<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> very

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
not it's not too bad but a very

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.240 
not it's not too bad but a very
effective<00:02:57.090> control<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.260> certainly<00:02:59.220> a

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
effective control and certainly a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.339 
effective control and certainly a
display<00:02:59.879> that<00:02:59.909> you<00:03:00.420> don't<00:03:00.599> see<00:03:00.900> from<00:03:01.109> any

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
other type of plant interesting how

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.819 
other type of plant interesting how
these<00:03:03.780> ice<00:03:04.049> plants<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:04.799> be<00:03:04.829> almost<00:03:05.400> um<00:03:06.829> dayglo

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
these ice plants can be almost um dayglo

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.369 
these ice plants can be almost um dayglo
they're<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:08.909> bright<00:03:09.299> they're<00:03:09.659> neon<00:03:10.140> I

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
they're just so bright they're neon I

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.849 
they're just so bright they're neon I
should<00:03:10.620> say<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.750> deer<00:03:13.049> do<00:03:13.290> not<00:03:13.470> eat<00:03:13.650> this

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
should say so the deer do not eat this

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.339 
should say so the deer do not eat this
plant<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.549> very<00:03:14.819> safe<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.480> deer<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.109> is

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
plant it's very safe with deer it is

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.190 
plant it's very safe with deer it is
very<00:03:16.680> low<00:03:16.950> water<00:03:17.310> that's<00:03:18.239> why<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.540> can<00:03:18.810> use<00:03:18.989> it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
very low water that's why you can use it

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.140 
very low water that's why you can use it
near<00:03:19.470> sea<00:03:19.799> sides<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.489> only<00:03:20.639> needs<00:03:21.000> enough

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
near sea sides it only needs enough

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.569 
near sea sides it only needs enough
water<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.930> kind<00:03:22.109> of<00:03:22.260> get<00:03:22.470> by<00:03:22.709> which<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.280> very

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
water to kind of get by which is very

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.020 
water to kind of get by which is very
little

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
little

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.440 
little
and<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:25.919> drought<00:03:26.250> tolerant<00:03:26.880> as<00:03:27.060> we're<00:03:27.269> as

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
and so it's drought tolerant as we're as

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.750 
and so it's drought tolerant as we're as
well<00:03:27.959> as<00:03:28.139> deer<00:03:28.410> resistant<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.250> then<00:03:29.430> very

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
well as deer resistant and then very

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.839 
well as deer resistant and then very
colorful<00:03:30.389> as<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.569> see<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.650> big<00:03:31.950> display<00:03:32.519> is

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
colorful as you see the big display is

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.940 
colorful as you see the big display is
in<00:03:33.150> spring<00:03:33.629> I'd<00:03:33.959> say<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.739> biggest

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
in spring I'd say that the biggest

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.490 
in spring I'd say that the biggest
display<00:03:35.639> lasts<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:36.480> about<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.750> month<00:03:37.109> to<00:03:37.470> a

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
display lasts for about a month to a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.470 
display lasts for about a month to a
month<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.190> half<00:03:38.220> depending<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.239> type

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
month and a half depending on the type

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.819 
month and a half depending on the type
and<00:03:41.449> as<00:03:42.449> you<00:03:42.690> can<00:03:42.840> see<00:03:42.900> here<00:03:43.319> I<00:03:43.349> think<00:03:43.440> it's

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
and as you can see here I think it's

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.830 
and as you can see here I think it's
good<00:03:44.069> it's<00:03:44.310> really<00:03:44.639> great<00:03:44.879> over<00:03:45.209> walls<00:03:45.510> you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
good it's really great over walls you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.229 
good it's really great over walls you
saw<00:03:46.079> some<00:03:46.379> earlier<00:03:46.709> footage<00:03:47.069> of<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.639> hanging

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
saw some earlier footage of it hanging

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.009 
saw some earlier footage of it hanging
over<00:03:48.359> a<00:03:48.540> cliff<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.349> getting<00:03:49.799> no<00:03:50.040> irrigation

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
over a cliff and getting no irrigation

over a cliff and getting no irrigation

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
whatsoever in surviving just fine here

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000 
whatsoever in surviving just fine here
it's<00:03:54.150> draping<00:03:54.690> over<00:03:54.810> this<00:03:55.139> wall<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.739> think

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
it's draping over this wall I think

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.039 
it's draping over this wall I think
that's<00:03:56.459> one<00:03:56.699> of<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.910> nicer<00:03:57.329> ways<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.780> use<00:03:58.019> it

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
that's one of the nicer ways to use it

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.319 
that's one of the nicer ways to use it
in<00:03:58.349> design<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:59.069> where<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.459> can<00:03:59.639> drape<00:03:59.940> over<00:04:00.299> a

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
in design is where it can drape over a

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.170 
in design is where it can drape over a
wall<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.930> even<00:04:01.799> if<00:04:01.889> it's<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.190> pot<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.879> you're

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
wall and even if it's a pot and you're

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.150 
wall and even if it's a pot and you're
just<00:04:03.359> using<00:04:03.569> a<00:04:03.810> little<00:04:03.840> clump<00:04:04.349> of<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:05.099> a
