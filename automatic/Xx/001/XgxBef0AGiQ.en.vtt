come<00:00:29.670> apart<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.929> your<00:00:31.800> chisels<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.820> go

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
come apart so your chisels just go

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.870 
come apart so your chisels just go
through<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.450> which<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.840> bit<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> pity<00:00:34.620> really

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
so it won't be a difficult job I'll just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.880 
so it won't be a difficult job I'll just
do<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.940> refill<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.260> bring

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
actually it's strong enough to take a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.220

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:28.720 
too much but the nice new server motor
which<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.119> switched<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.720> us<00:01:18.960> there's<00:01:19.259> no<00:01:19.439> noise

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.240 

and<00:01:29.730> it's<00:01:29.880> very<00:01:30.090> nice<00:01:33.050> so<00:01:34.050> I'll<00:01:34.320> go<00:01:34.620> round<00:01:34.860> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and it's very nice so I'll go round this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:49.340 
and it's very nice so I'll go round this
seam<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:48.450> new<00:01:48.600> motor<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.080> this<00:01:49.200> machine

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
seam and a new motor on this machine

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.920 
seam and a new motor on this machine
it's<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:50.010> sailing<00:01:50.250> through<00:01:50.640> trouble<00:01:51.330> now

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it's just sailing through trouble now

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.780 
it's just sailing through trouble now
our<00:01:52.080> central<00:01:52.590> put<00:01:52.800> in<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> wider

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
our central put in a wider

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.240 
our central put in a wider
outside<00:01:54.750> torch<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.380> thought<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:56.220> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
outside torch and I thought what a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.710 
outside torch and I thought what a
little<00:01:56.490> bit<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.820> riff<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:59.690> could<00:02:00.690> go

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
little bit more riff on it I could go

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.760 
little bit more riff on it I could go
faster<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.250> frank<00:02:03.140> I'm<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.320> no<00:02:04.470> rush

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.660 

and<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:07.979> very<00:02:08.160> nice

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and it's very nice

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.140 
and it's very nice

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
with that actually I was just looking

with that actually I was just looking

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
the rest of it and it's got one of these

the rest of it and it's got one of these

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
sort of praying and bit flaky so what

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.680 
sort of praying and bit flaky so what
can<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.820> do<00:04:23.940> about<00:04:24.030> that

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
can I do about that

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.160 
can I do about that
I<00:04:25.190> think<00:04:26.190> if<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.400> thin<00:04:26.730> little<00:04:27.390> ever<00:04:27.690> tongue<00:04:27.990> one

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
I think if a thin little ever tongue one

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.780 
I think if a thin little ever tongue one
there<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.590> say<00:04:28.770> thin<00:04:29.100> because<00:04:29.430> it's<00:04:29.580> going

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
there and I say thin because it's going

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.040 
there and I say thin because it's going
through<00:04:29.910> one<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.120> these<00:04:30.330> little<00:04:30.690> buckles

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
through one of these little buckles

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.170 
through one of these little buckles
slightly<00:04:31.470> buckles<00:04:31.850> but<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.880> think<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.090> little

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
slightly buckles but I think a little

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.460 
slightly buckles but I think a little
leather<00:04:33.450> tongue<00:04:33.780> will<00:04:33.960> give<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.230> little<00:04:34.290> bit

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
leather tongue will give it a little bit

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.960 
leather tongue will give it a little bit
of<00:04:34.560> stiffness<00:04:34.800> on<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.220> end<00:04:35.370> we<00:04:35.550> tied<00:04:35.760> you<00:04:35.880> up

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
of stiffness on the end we tied you up

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.990 
of stiffness on the end we tied you up
that<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:37.050> make<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.740> bit<00:04:37.860> more<00:04:38.040> satisfying

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
that and I make it a bit more satisfying

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.090 
that and I make it a bit more satisfying
to<00:04:39.150> get<00:04:39.300> through<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:39.600> buckle<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.560> think

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
to get through that buckle so I think

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.260 
to get through that buckle so I think
I'll<00:04:41.220> do<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.580> as<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:41.820> find<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.210> little

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
I'll do that as I find a little

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
I'll do that as I find a little
refinement

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.660

stop<00:04:59.350> that<00:04:59.380> fraying<00:04:59.890> and<00:05:00.160> just<00:05:00.310> make<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.580> bit

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670
