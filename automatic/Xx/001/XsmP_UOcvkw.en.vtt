00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
and making designs so let's make this

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.820 
and making designs so let's make this
mold<00:00:18.570> both<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.500> them<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.420> see<00:00:21.420> how<00:00:21.449> they<00:00:21.750> look

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.880 

I<00:00:27.890> leave<00:00:28.670> a<00:00:28.970> bunch<00:00:29.420> of<00:00:29.570> play<00:00:30.110> dough<00:00:30.170> on<00:00:30.470> top<00:00:30.500> and

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
I leave a bunch of play dough on top and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.100 
I leave a bunch of play dough on top and
the<00:00:30.980> reason<00:00:31.279> I<00:00:31.369> do<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:31.580> is<00:00:31.910> on<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.750> deeper

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
the reason I do that is on the deeper

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.479 
the reason I do that is on the deeper
mold<00:00:33.380> it<00:00:34.370> makes<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.910> really<00:00:35.150> easy<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:37.250> get<00:00:37.370> it

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
mold it makes it really easy to get it

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.600 
mold it makes it really easy to get it

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
out of the mold like that then we could

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.310 
out of the mold like that then we could
take<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.850> little<00:00:41.170> time<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:42.820> clean<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:43.970> up<00:00:44.320> let's
