can do that and there we go exid I set
up<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.850> loop<00:02:39.000> which<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.660> not<00:02:39.810> something<00:02:39.990> that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
up the loop which is not something that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.230 
up the loop which is not something that
I<00:02:40.230> meant<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.440> do<00:02:40.530> let's<00:02:40.800> go<00:02:40.920> back<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.430> then
