00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
shot there seems to be nice here's the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:45.750 
shot there seems to be nice here's the
features<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> its<00:01:37.380> kickstand

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.500 

right<00:01:48.460> which<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.580> use<00:01:49.760> that<00:01:49.940> real<00:01:50.120> quick<00:01:50.330> it

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
right which I use that real quick it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.000 
right which I use that real quick it
seemed<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.870> control<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.440> speed<00:01:51.650> nice<00:01:51.860> you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
seemed to control the speed nice you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.050 
seemed to control the speed nice you
just<00:01:52.190> gotta<00:01:52.340> have<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.580> worry<00:01:52.700> about<00:01:52.910> your

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
just gotta have to worry about your

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.330 
just gotta have to worry about your
footing<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:53.510> it<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:54.650> then<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:54.950> doesn't<00:01:55.250> really

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
footing on it and then it doesn't really

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.590 
footing on it and then it doesn't really
collapse<00:01:55.790> down<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.780> only<00:01:56.930> thing<00:01:57.110> it'll<00:01:57.290> do<00:01:57.440> is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
collapse down the only thing it'll do is

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.020 
collapse down the only thing it'll do is
you<00:01:59.600> can<00:02:01.750> change<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:02.980> push<00:02:03.980> these<00:02:04.220> little

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
you can change this push these little

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.740 
you can change this push these little
button<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.350> pulls<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.890> like<00:02:07.100> that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
button and that pulls out like that

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.270 
button and that pulls out like that
and<00:02:08.750> each<00:02:08.960> side<00:02:09.259> will<00:02:09.530> collapse<00:02:09.830> down<00:02:10.070> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
and each side will collapse down and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.650 
and each side will collapse down and
hang<00:02:10.429> down<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.670> guess<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.300> get<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.600> a

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
hang down I guess so you can get it in a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.160 
hang down I guess so you can get it in a
tight<00:02:11.900> space<00:02:12.910> somewhere<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.890> know<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:17.170> guess

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
tight space somewhere you know I guess

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.240 
tight space somewhere you know I guess
that's<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> difference<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:18.860> getting<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.130> do

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
that's the difference in getting to do

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.390 
that's the difference in getting to do
not<00:02:19.550> getting<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.880> in<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:22.070> can<00:02:22.220> raise

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
not getting it in and then you can raise

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.510 
not getting it in and then you can raise
you<00:02:22.790> can<00:02:22.940> adjust<00:02:23.240> this<00:02:23.510> with<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:24.200> toggle<00:02:24.709> it

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
you can adjust this with this toggle it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.449 
you can adjust this with this toggle it
will<00:02:28.959> kind<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.020> so<00:02:30.530> yeah<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.280> whole

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
will kind of so yeah this this whole

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.400 
will kind of so yeah this this whole
t-handle<00:02:32.030> bar<00:02:32.180> raises<00:02:32.450> up<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.959> mean<00:02:33.140> if<00:02:33.260> you're

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
t-handle bar raises up I mean if you're

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.910 
t-handle bar raises up I mean if you're
an<00:02:33.500> adult<00:02:34.040> or<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:35.360> know<00:02:35.570> close<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.530> been<00:02:36.800> an
