I put 1/4 of a cup of that cheese over
these<00:04:59.159> refried<00:04:59.970> beans<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.509> I've<00:05:00.960> also<00:05:01.460> taken

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
these refried beans and I've also taken

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.110 
these refried beans and I've also taken
my<00:05:03.330> Greek<00:05:03.750> yogurt<00:05:04.259> and<00:05:04.409> used<00:05:04.650> it<00:05:05.039> as<00:05:05.280> sour

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
cream and I put it over my refried beans

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.680 
cream and I put it over my refried beans
so<00:05:11.759> those<00:05:12.060> are<00:05:12.270> some<00:05:12.509> of<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:12.810> food<00:05:13.560> Pines<00:05:13.860> that

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
so those are some of the food Pines that

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.370 
so those are some of the food Pines that
I've<00:05:15.690> been<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.139> love<00:05:16.349> with<00:05:17.150> post-op<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.479> then

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
I've been in love with post-op and then

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.219 
I've been in love with post-op and then
I<00:05:19.409> also<00:05:19.919> found<00:05:20.220> this<00:05:20.909> at<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.569> vitamin<00:05:21.870> shop

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
I also found this at the vitamin shop

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.839 
I also found this at the vitamin shop
because<00:05:22.710> anybody's<00:05:23.190> working<00:05:23.610> about<00:05:23.789> a

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
because anybody's working about a

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.499 
because anybody's working about a
protein<00:05:24.590> this<00:05:25.669> helped<00:05:26.669> get<00:05:26.820> me<00:05:27.000> over<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.300> hump

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
protein this helped get me over a hump

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.540 
protein this helped get me over a hump
because<00:05:27.719> the<00:05:28.050> two<00:05:28.229> proteins<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.190> have

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
because the two proteins that I have

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.870 
because the two proteins that I have
pre-op<00:05:30.620> began<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.949> sort<00:05:32.159> of<00:05:32.219> repulse<00:05:32.580> me

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
pre-op began to sort of repulse me

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.820 
pre-op began to sort of repulse me
post-op<00:05:33.419> now<00:05:33.840> I'm<00:05:34.050> getting<00:05:34.320> back<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.650> them<00:05:34.770> in

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
post-op now I'm getting back to them in

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.540 
post-op now I'm getting back to them in
there<00:05:34.979> ok<00:05:35.340> but<00:05:35.940> this<00:05:36.180> chocolate<00:05:36.599> way<00:05:37.380> Tech<00:05:37.800> Pro

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
there ok but this chocolate way Tech Pro

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.240 
there ok but this chocolate way Tech Pro
isolate<00:05:39.389> specifically<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.500> pro<00:05:40.740> isolate

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
isolate specifically the pro isolate

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.939 
isolate specifically the pro isolate
because<00:05:41.490> it's<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.880> 100%<00:05:42.690> isolate<00:05:43.199> they<00:05:43.770> have

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
because it's the 100% isolate they have

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.480 
because it's the 100% isolate they have
another<00:05:45.349> container<00:05:46.349> there<00:05:46.620> in<00:05:47.070> the<00:05:47.190> vitamin

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
another container there in the vitamin

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.189 
another container there in the vitamin
shop<00:05:47.639> that<00:05:47.759> looks<00:05:47.909> just<00:05:48.150> like<00:05:48.389> this<00:05:48.659> except

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
shop that looks just like this except

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.040 
shop that looks just like this except
it's<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.440> blend<00:05:49.800> of<00:05:50.070> proteins<00:05:50.580> not<00:05:50.759> thought

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
it's a blend of proteins not thought

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.059 
it's a blend of proteins not thought
100%<00:05:52.400> whey<00:05:53.400> isolate<00:05:53.969> and<00:05:54.599> so<00:05:55.259> this<00:05:55.710> has<00:05:55.889> been

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
100% whey isolate and so this has been

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.939 
100% whey isolate and so this has been
good<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.310> me<00:05:56.759> the<00:05:57.509> chocolate<00:05:58.139> I<00:05:58.380> put<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.770> little

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
good to me the chocolate I put a little

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.490 
good to me the chocolate I put a little
cinnamon<00:05:59.250> in<00:05:59.610> it<00:05:59.759> sometimes<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.990> I<00:06:01.259> just

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
cinnamon in it sometimes and I just

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.309 
cinnamon in it sometimes and I just
knock<00:06:01.889> it<00:06:01.919> back<00:06:02.250> I<00:06:02.280> actually<00:06:02.580> use<00:06:03.060> a<00:06:03.479> protein

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
knock it back I actually use a protein

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.870 
knock it back I actually use a protein

the<00:06:45.930> crystal<00:06:46.260> life<00:06:46.410> that<00:06:46.620> I<00:06:46.710> was<00:06:47.220> fine<00:06:47.490> was

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
the crystal life that I was fine was

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.240 
the crystal life that I was fine was
made<00:06:47.970> with<00:06:48.120> stevia<00:06:48.600> and<00:06:49.140> I<00:06:49.710> got<00:06:49.890> about<00:06:49.980> 10

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250
