00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.160 

so<00:00:06.280> how<00:00:06.730> do<00:00:06.790> you<00:00:06.970> really<00:00:07.480> know<00:00:07.570> when<00:00:07.870> the<00:00:07.990> knife

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
so how do you really know when the knife

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.430 
so how do you really know when the knife
is<00:00:08.350> sharp<00:00:09.059> well<00:00:10.059> I<00:00:10.330> think<00:00:11.049> the<00:00:11.260> thing<00:00:11.380> that

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
is sharp well I think the thing that

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.350 
is sharp well I think the thing that
most<00:00:11.830> people<00:00:12.010> miss<00:00:12.490> when<00:00:12.790> they're<00:00:12.940> sharpening

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
most people miss when they're sharpening

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.450 
most people miss when they're sharpening
and<00:00:13.870> and<00:00:14.200> it<00:00:14.290> really<00:00:14.650> goes<00:00:14.860> to<00:00:14.889> the<00:00:15.130> heart<00:00:15.250> of

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
and and it really goes to the heart of

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.940 
and and it really goes to the heart of
sharpening<00:00:16.270> theory<00:00:16.689> is<00:00:16.840> that<00:00:16.900> they<00:00:17.710> fail<00:00:17.920> to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
sharpening theory is that they fail to

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.950 
sharpening theory is that they fail to
create<00:00:18.430> a<00:00:18.790> burr<00:00:19.060> on<00:00:19.240> each<00:00:19.390> side<00:00:19.599> of<00:00:19.630> the<00:00:19.779> knife

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
create a burr on each side of the knife

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.769 
create a burr on each side of the knife
what<00:00:20.619> what<00:00:20.980> exactly<00:00:21.400> is<00:00:21.460> a<00:00:21.520> bird<00:00:21.759> it's<00:00:22.390> just<00:00:22.660> a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
what what exactly is a bird it's just a

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.960 
what what exactly is a bird it's just a
little<00:00:23.020> wire<00:00:23.590> edge<00:00:23.890> that<00:00:24.189> hangs<00:00:24.430> over<00:00:24.610> from

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
little wire edge that hangs over from

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.089 
little wire edge that hangs over from
one<00:00:25.119> side<00:00:25.390> so<00:00:25.840> let's<00:00:26.050> say<00:00:26.230> I'm<00:00:26.320> sharpening<00:00:26.619> on

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
one side so let's say I'm sharpening on

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.970 
one side so let's say I'm sharpening on
this<00:00:27.759> side<00:00:28.000> when<00:00:28.989> this<00:00:29.110> bevel<00:00:29.380> finally

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
this side when this bevel finally

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.920 
this side when this bevel finally
reaches<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.520> actual<00:00:30.970> edge<00:00:31.090> of<00:00:31.270> the<00:00:31.360> knife<00:00:31.509> I'm

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
reaches the actual edge of the knife I'm

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.780 
reaches the actual edge of the knife I'm
going<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.200> get<00:00:32.380> a<00:00:32.410> little<00:00:32.619> bit<00:00:33.460> of<00:00:33.610> metal

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
going to get a little bit of metal

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.250 
going to get a little bit of metal
hanging<00:00:34.120> over<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.480> side<00:00:34.510> you<00:00:34.780> can<00:00:34.930> feel<00:00:35.140> it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
hanging over the side you can feel it

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.770 
hanging over the side you can feel it
with<00:00:35.380> your<00:00:35.410> finger<00:00:35.980> really<00:00:36.220> easily<00:00:36.520> oh<00:00:36.780> right

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
yep and that always happens on the side

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.869 
yep and that always happens on the side
that's<00:00:41.559> opposite<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.370> one<00:00:42.489> that<00:00:42.609> you've<00:00:42.760> been

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
that's opposite the one that you've been

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.270

sharpening<00:00:43.359> ok<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:43.989> if<00:00:44.260> I've<00:00:44.469> got<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.829> burr<00:00:45.070> now

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
sharpening ok so if I've got a burr now

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.389 
sharpening ok so if I've got a burr now
on<00:00:45.460> this<00:00:45.579> side<00:00:45.850> my<00:00:46.600> job<00:00:46.839> is<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.079> make<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:48.160> few

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
on this side my job is to make a few

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.110 
on this side my job is to make a few
passes<00:00:48.789> on<00:00:48.910> this<00:00:49.120> side<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:51.190> see<00:00:51.850> if<00:00:51.969> I've<00:00:52.089> got

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
passes on this side and see if I've got

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.669 
passes on this side and see if I've got
a<00:00:52.300> burr<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.289> know<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:53.559> you<00:00:53.620> can

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
a burr and you know and you can

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.400 
a burr and you know and you can
definitely<00:00:54.219> feel<00:00:54.370> it<00:00:54.429> it's<00:00:54.789> already<00:00:54.999> there

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
definitely feel it it's already there

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.040 
definitely feel it it's already there
indeed<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:58.030> what<00:00:58.390> that<00:00:58.420> tells<00:00:58.780> me<00:00:58.839> is<00:00:58.960> that

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
indeed and what that tells me is that

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.689 
indeed and what that tells me is that
that<00:00:59.350> both<00:00:59.499> bevels<00:00:59.920> are<00:01:00.100> finally<00:01:00.489> coming

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
that both bevels are finally coming

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.029 
that both bevels are finally coming
together<00:01:00.879> at<00:01:01.149> a<00:01:01.239> very<00:01:01.420> fine<00:01:01.870> point<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.530> and

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
together at a very fine point and and

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.890 
together at a very fine point and and
that's<00:01:03.399> how<00:01:03.609> you're<00:01:03.760> going<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.940> begin<00:01:04.510> to<00:01:04.570> form

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
that's how you're going to begin to form

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.230 
that's how you're going to begin to form
your<00:01:05.019> wicked<00:01:05.320> edge<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.760> once<00:01:06.909> you've<00:01:07.060> got

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
your wicked edge and and once you've got

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.510 
your wicked edge and and once you've got
a<00:01:07.270> burr<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:08.710> you're<00:01:08.860> just<00:01:08.890> going<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.280> kind<00:01:09.490> of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
a burr then you're just going to kind of

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.490 
a burr then you're just going to kind of
straighten<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:09.970> up<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.259> you're<00:01:11.259> ready<00:01:11.350> to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
straighten it up and you're ready to

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.010 
straighten it up and you're ready to
switch<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.009> next<00:01:12.310> set<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.460> stones<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.240> and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
switch to the next set of stones and and

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.660 
switch to the next set of stones and and
begin<00:01:14.409> removing<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.860> scratches<00:01:15.369> from<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
begin removing the scratches from the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.240 
begin removing the scratches from the
coarser<00:01:16.030> set<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.540> had<00:01:16.689> used<00:01:17.250> before

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
coarser set that you had used before

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.340 
coarser set that you had used before
that<00:01:21.149> and<00:01:22.149> once<00:01:22.360> you've<00:01:22.540> created<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.020> ber<00:01:23.170> one

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
that and once you've created the ber one

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.289 
that and once you've created the ber one
time<00:01:23.590> it's<00:01:23.920> not<00:01:24.040> important<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.790> do<00:01:24.969> it<00:01:25.119> on

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
time it's not important to do it on

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.880 
time it's not important to do it on
every<00:01:25.689> set<00:01:25.899> of<00:01:25.930> stones<00:01:26.229> you've<00:01:26.740> established

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
every set of stones you've established

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.240 
every set of stones you've established
the<00:01:27.490> bevel<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.930> edge<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.350> formed<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:30.070> now

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
the bevel and the edge is formed and now

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.830 
the bevel and the edge is formed and now
you<00:01:30.310> have<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.729> just<00:01:30.880> polish<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:31.689> you<00:01:31.750> just

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
you have to just polish it so you just

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.260 
you have to just polish it so you just
continue<00:01:32.290> through<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.100> different<00:01:33.490> stones<00:01:33.820> on

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
continue through the different stones on

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.630 
continue through the different stones on
that<00:01:34.509> same<00:01:34.750> pattern<00:01:35.140> exactly<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.159> I<00:01:36.189> started

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
that same pattern exactly so I started

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.580 
that same pattern exactly so I started
with<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.240> red<00:01:37.420> stones<00:01:37.719> which<00:01:37.990> were<00:01:38.020> 100

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
with the the red stones which were 100

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.520 
with the the red stones which were 100
grit<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:39.149> got<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.450> where<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:40.630> had<00:01:40.869> created<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.350> burr

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
grit I got to where I had created a burr

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.950 
grit I got to where I had created a burr
on<00:01:41.829> one<00:01:42.130> side<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:42.399> then<00:01:42.759> on<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.000> other<00:01:43.030> ok<00:01:43.750> and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
on one side and then on the other ok and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.270 
on one side and then on the other ok and
then<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:44.170> switched<00:01:44.500> stones<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.100> two

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
then I switched stones to the two

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.880 
then I switched stones to the two
hundred<00:01:45.520> grit<00:01:45.670> which<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.119> orange<00:01:46.390> here

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
hundred grit which is the orange here

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.719 
hundred grit which is the orange here
and<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.600> few<00:01:49.810> passes<00:01:50.259> like<00:01:50.380> this<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
and I just do a few passes like this and

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.310 
and I just do a few passes like this and
when<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.030> feel<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.420> resistance<00:01:52.689> kind<00:01:53.229> of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
when I feel the resistance kind of

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.260 
when I feel the resistance kind of
starting<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:53.829> fade<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.880> know<00:01:54.939> that<00:01:55.149> I've

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
starting to fade and I know that I've

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.179 
starting to fade and I know that I've
knocked<00:01:55.689> up<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.049> big<00:01:56.200> ridges<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.859> little

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
knocked up the big ridges and the little

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.870 
knocked up the big ridges and the little
valleys<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:59.469> I<00:01:59.590> know<00:01:59.680> it's<00:01:59.829> time<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.250> switch

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
valleys then I know it's time to switch

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.669 
valleys then I know it's time to switch
these<00:02:01.119> stones<00:02:01.390> out<00:02:01.600> in<00:02:01.810> favor<00:02:02.049> of<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.409> next

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
these stones out in favor of the next

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.859 
these stones out in favor of the next
higher<00:02:02.829> grit<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:04.000> I'm<00:02:04.060> going<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.240> grab<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
higher grit so I'm going to grab the the

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.749 
higher grit so I'm going to grab the the
yellow<00:02:05.049> stones<00:02:05.380> down<00:02:05.590> these<00:02:05.799> are<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> 400

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
yellow stones down these are the 400

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.050 
yellow stones down these are the 400
grit<00:02:06.939> stones<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.500> slide<00:02:08.740> them<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.160> and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
grit stones and I just slide them on and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.420 
grit stones and I just slide them on and
I<00:02:10.149> just<00:02:10.360> keep<00:02:10.929> going<00:02:11.080> on<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.440> same<00:02:11.650> motion<00:02:12.100> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
I just keep going on the same motion and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.660 
I just keep going on the same motion and
the<00:02:13.390> more<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.890> polish<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.370> more

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the more I polish it and the more

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.699 
the more I polish it and the more
cycle<00:02:16.599> through<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> stones<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.260> more<00:02:17.440> wicked

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
cycle through the stones the more wicked

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.070 
cycle through the stones the more wicked
the<00:02:17.800> edge<00:02:17.920> gets<00:02:18.270> well<00:02:19.270> as<00:02:19.390> you're<00:02:19.870> cycling

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
the edge gets well as you're cycling

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.979 
the edge gets well as you're cycling
through<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> stones<00:02:20.940> each<00:02:21.940> finer<00:02:22.390> grit<00:02:22.750> is

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
through the stones each finer grit is

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.140 
through the stones each finer grit is
replacing<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> scratches<00:02:24.220> from<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.970> grip

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
replacing the scratches from the grip

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.580 
replacing the scratches from the grip
before<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.900> look<00:02:26.050> in<00:02:26.200> really<00:02:26.440> close

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
before so if you look in really close

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.410 
before so if you look in really close
now<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.520> see<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:27.819> starting<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.270> get<00:02:28.360> a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
now you can see it's starting to get a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.900 
now you can see it's starting to get a
very<00:02:28.630> nice<00:02:28.810> polished<00:02:29.290> look<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.400> big<00:02:30.610> deep

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
very nice polished look and the big deep

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.850 
very nice polished look and the big deep
grooves<00:02:31.239> from<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.020> course<00:02:32.260> stones<00:02:32.530> are

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
grooves from the course stones are

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.160 
grooves from the course stones are
starting<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.280> disappear<00:02:33.430> sure<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.959> just

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
starting to disappear sure and that just

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.860 
starting to disappear sure and that just
continues<00:02:35.580> more<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.760> more<00:02:36.850> as<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.660> cycle

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
continues more and more as you cycle

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.930 
continues more and more as you cycle
thru<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.350> grits<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.310> switched<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.819> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
thru the grits I just switched to the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.979 
thru the grits I just switched to the
600<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.860> after<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.489> few<00:02:42.519> passes<00:02:43.180> you

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
600 and after just a few passes you

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.650 
600 and after just a few passes you
really<00:02:44.440> see<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.310> difference<00:02:45.340> there<00:02:46.000> now<00:02:46.510> it's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
really see the difference there now it's

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.809 
really see the difference there now it's
got<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> really<00:02:47.019> nice<00:02:47.230> polish<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.100> well<00:02:48.700> not

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
got a really nice polish to it well not

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.509 
got a really nice polish to it well not
only<00:02:49.150> do<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.170> see<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.620> but<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.830> can<00:02:51.010> also<00:02:51.130> hear

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
only do you see it but you can also hear

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.250 
only do you see it but you can also hear
it<00:02:51.670> as<00:02:51.940> you're<00:02:52.269> going<00:02:52.420> through<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.959> sounds<00:02:53.230> a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
it as you're going through it sounds a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.259 
it as you're going through it sounds a
lot<00:02:53.410> more<00:02:53.470> smoother<00:02:54.130> absolutely<00:02:54.970> there's<00:02:55.180> a

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
lot more smoother absolutely there's a

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.380 
lot more smoother absolutely there's a
much<00:02:55.870> less<00:02:56.200> rough<00:02:57.040> sound<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:58.180> feel<00:02:58.360> it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
much less rough sound to it you feel it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:12.280 
much less rough sound to it you feel it
in<00:02:58.540> your<00:02:58.569> hands<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.989> give<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.319> try<00:02:59.530> oh<00:03:04.440> yeah

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.830 

it's<00:03:12.769> fairly<00:03:12.950> easy<00:03:13.069> to<00:03:13.400> use<00:03:13.659> absolutely<00:03:14.659> that

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
it's fairly easy to use absolutely that

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.780 
it's fairly easy to use absolutely that
once<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.439> get<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.709> motion<00:03:15.890> down<00:03:16.250> right<00:03:16.519> and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
once you get the motion down right and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
once you get the motion down right and
it's<00:03:17.120> pretty<00:03:17.329> simple<00:03:17.659> it<00:03:18.109> really<00:03:18.379> just

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
it's pretty simple it really just

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.589 
it's pretty simple it really just
becomes<00:03:18.950> intuitive<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.640> honestly<00:03:20.359> I<00:03:20.450> could

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
becomes intuitive and honestly I could

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.880 
becomes intuitive and honestly I could
sit<00:03:20.780> here<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:20.989> talk<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.409> all<00:03:21.469> day<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.799> not

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
sit here and talk to you all day and not

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.410 
sit here and talk to you all day and not
even<00:03:21.950> look<00:03:22.310> at<00:03:22.459> what<00:03:22.609> I'm<00:03:22.700> doing<00:03:22.730> almost

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
even look at what I'm doing almost

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.330 
even look at what I'm doing almost
meditative<00:03:23.859> absolutely<00:03:24.859> a<00:03:24.980> lot<00:03:25.099> of<00:03:25.129> people

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
meditative absolutely a lot of people

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.349 
meditative absolutely a lot of people
say<00:03:25.579> that<00:03:25.609> about<00:03:25.849> it<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.790> edge<00:03:28.790> is<00:03:29.090> looking

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
say that about it so edge is looking

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.000 
say that about it so edge is looking
really<00:03:29.480> nice<00:03:29.689> if<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.049> feel<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.379> it's<00:03:30.620> already

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
really nice if you feel it it's already

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.449 
really nice if you feel it it's already
very<00:03:31.069> sharp<00:03:31.900> this<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.049> a<00:03:33.079> great<00:03:33.620> edge<00:03:33.769> for<00:03:34.040> for

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
very sharp this is a great edge for for

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.099 
very sharp this is a great edge for for
cooking<00:03:34.760> less<00:03:34.970> or<00:03:35.150> cutting<00:03:35.359> vegetables<00:03:35.569> and

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
cooking less or cutting vegetables and

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.399 
cooking less or cutting vegetables and
chopping<00:03:36.500> hence<00:03:37.159> we<00:03:37.489> could<00:03:37.609> edge<00:03:37.760> exactly<00:03:38.569> so

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
chopping hence we could edge exactly so

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.099 
chopping hence we could edge exactly so
from<00:03:40.220> these<00:03:40.340> stones<00:03:40.609> you<00:03:40.790> can<00:03:40.819> go<00:03:41.120> on<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.569> some

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
from these stones you can go on to some

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.050 
from these stones you can go on to some
of<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.260> accessories<00:03:42.530> we<00:03:43.099> offer<00:03:43.250> these<00:03:43.939> are
