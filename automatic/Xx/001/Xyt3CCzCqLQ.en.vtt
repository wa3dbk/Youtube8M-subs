00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.840
 these vibrators oscillate with the same 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.570
 frequency and in the same phase 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.770
 they are discarded by coherent mole and 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.770
 let's see what happens with their imposition 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.560
 on the wall svetlana circle is not 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.560
 indicated by the crest of the dark depressions. 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.330
 now met takes him both waves 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.120
 distance from vibrators to this point 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.120
 not the same 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.030
 the joy of these distances the joy of moves he 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.600
 over an even sex number in a given 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.600
 case 2 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.100
 therefore, to the point and vibrations comes in 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.100
 identical phases 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.500
 Now the point and a ben and that's gleb 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.790
 resulting force and medium particles 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.170
 up modulo is the sum of the moduli of two 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.170
 component offsets 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.610
 one half time left on 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.610
 heels will meet two Art-1 and 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.430
 resulting sleep second part you 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.799
 tidy up the module again went to 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.210
 the screen of modules constituting the priest 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.390
 it's a challenge . 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.390
 maximum amplitude of oscillations is obtained 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.900
 now take on the surface of the water 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.900
 another one. 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.850
 now here are the comb of one 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.850
 waves and trench another 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.950
 the difference of the moves is the odd part not 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.950
 visited in this case 1 helped the world 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.420
 so the swing to this point comes in 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 antiphase 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.290
 the resulting modulus offset is 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.870
 differences moduli of component displacements 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.819
 same thing observes as point b and later 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.819
 any integer sex of periods 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.180
 oscillations at point b mutually quench each 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.180
 friend 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.350
 darts in which the oscillation amplitude 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.720
 most forms on the surface of the water 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.720
 continuous not and here's one of them 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.800
 points at which the oscillation amplitude 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.800
 minimally form lines of minima 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.120
 lines of highs and lows alternate 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.120
 between themselves 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.510
 such picture of amplitude distribution 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.420
 Fluctuations cleaning 3d postcard unchanged 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.870
 in time and are called 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.870
 interference pattern
