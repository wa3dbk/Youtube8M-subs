00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
changes and all that I probably would

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
changes and all that I probably would
probably<00:01:44.430> would<00:01:44.520> put<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.880> there<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.439> have

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
probably would put it on there and have

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.069 
probably would put it on there and have
the<00:01:46.560> more<00:01:46.829> mana<00:01:47.009> reduction<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.899> we'll<00:01:48.899> see

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the more mana reduction and we'll see

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.700 
the more mana reduction and we'll see
important<00:01:49.860> life<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.549> pretty<00:01:50.790> interesting

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
been changed the teleport ring and my

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.410 
been changed the teleport ring and my
constant<00:02:30.310> sound<00:02:30.400> port<00:02:30.639> you<00:02:30.790> get<00:02:30.909> a<00:02:30.939> protective

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
constant sound port you get a protective

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.030 
constant sound port you get a protective
bubble<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:31.989> prevents<00:02:32.409> interruption

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
bubble that prevents interruption

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.069 
bubble that prevents interruption
absorbs<00:02:33.579> fifty<00:02:34.000> percent<00:02:34.239> damage<00:02:34.389> previously

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
absorbs fifty percent damage previously

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.899 
absorbs fifty percent damage previously
made<00:02:35.319> immunity<00:02:35.920> bubble<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.489> basically<00:02:36.730> would

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
made immunity bubble so basically would

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.449 
made immunity bubble so basically would
take<00:02:37.090> damage<00:02:37.299> mix<00:02:37.569> fifty<00:02:37.870> percent<00:02:38.109> reduction

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
take damage mix fifty percent reduction

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.250 
take damage mix fifty percent reduction
so<00:02:39.459> that's<00:02:40.209> quite<00:02:40.359> nice<00:02:40.629> it's<00:02:40.900> quite<00:02:41.139> nice

so that's quite nice it's quite nice

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.020 
so that's quite nice it's quite nice
Emily<00:02:42.480> okay<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.109> was<00:02:44.349> pretty<00:02:45.220> huge

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
Emily okay and this was pretty huge

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.080 
Emily okay and this was pretty huge
they've<00:02:46.959> changed<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.500> ring<00:02:47.919> he's<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.909> fine

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
health close by a hundred percent okay

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.440 
health close by a hundred percent okay
so<00:02:51.069> i<00:02:51.250> changed<00:02:51.459> i<00:02:51.730> thought<00:02:51.970> they<00:02:52.090> would<00:02:52.239> change

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
this could with a little bit too strong

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.099 
this could with a little bit too strong

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
stretchy 40 dogs which doctor when they

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.240 
stretchy 40 dogs which doctor when they
changed<00:02:56.379> it<00:02:56.409> now<00:02:56.530> when<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:56.799> kill<00:02:56.980> an<00:02:57.069> enemy

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250
