00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
 but reviewed manga on the west site 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.200
 This time I'm going to talk about this mandaqui. 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.820
 alpine fighter suite daniel lopes ailson 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.889
 only two issues edition number 1 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.220
 edition number two ne 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.020
 and he adapts even the little that I know and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.869
 I adapt the story of the dodo games 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.380
 Neon street fighter alpha obviously 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.960
 after all the name is street fighter leonardo 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 of his genius which was as follows is a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.830
 very fun place I had fun 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.590
 much reading the street fighter 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.620
 obviously he does not send great, right? 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.450
 Because we were then we do not have 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.950
 Such a fantastic story as well and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.840
 sincerely who cares about 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.809
 game fight story for the love of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.850
 God right I have a philosophy I 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.120
 I know so many friends who like to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.100
 fucking fighting game and play like this 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.230
 my goal is to play on the level 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.730
 practically and he 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.829
 matter with the color of the game they nor the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.059
 Fuck the game's history and I think so. 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.649
 what fighting game has to have characters 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.600
 charismatic with cool goals they have 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.790
 that beat in a super cool way I 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.950
 I'm very much a fan of the street fighter franchise. 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.890
 in fact it is practically single franchise 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.170
 of fighting game than a game 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.659
 reasonably decent so I just play 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.310
 with samsung the document kicks and that's it 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.170
 that I know how to do 6 I'm sorry not 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.729
 I knew however I have affection for 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.560
 this will waste a lot of time since 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.170
 super nintendo time and I always 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.820
 I really liked the alpha street fighter. 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.790
 including favorite franchise games 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.470
 it's software records 381 of people 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.939
 finally a very visual business of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.509
 characters in alpha and such 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.700
 this magazine here this manga and 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.350
 pop brought this place has basically 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 I want from the door of one of them 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.909
 People are going to have legal fights Legal fights 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.890
 a point that if you understand a little of the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.420
 I play very little, very little. 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.939
 You have a little bit of the game you have. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.090
 memory of what happens is in the street game 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.520
 fighter in gameplay even you realize 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.170
 Whoever did this here knows what it is. 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.549
 doing it just seems like the person really 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.509
 have a certain love for what you're doing 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.360
 and this is very cool the scams are 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.810
 faithful to the game at least as far as 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.459
 what appears to be legal is to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.740
 if you put it on the manga page and realize 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.430
 what kind face 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.160
 yuki and has hits knows the has a string 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.850
 of kicks in the sequence you know I guess 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.260
 that comes a point that gives you a 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.870
 flying creep wrong who I think 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.420
 If there is not me, I have 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.950
 my head I do not know, it 's for me then 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.570
 positive points in such a way that 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.310
 people do the art first is very 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.620
 beautiful it has here in the new edition 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.160
 coke has a colored page at the beginning 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.240
 I like this art, it 's a fine art. 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.020
 90 knows an art with the chuí and 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.970
 Nether arrows is the art of paying is a 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.400
 very beautiful art that even in the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.240
 pages and such are you can see by 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.970
 example the bison with a crazy zone ship 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.340
 huh 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.400
 history history shaved more faith and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.120
 shallow as possible and in a way 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.340
 sheet if I think defect depot to pay 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.100
 I would put the beginning of the volume the end of the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.130
 volume two nee it starts middle 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.580
 randomly itaú and found koh tao 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.820
 river on a boat as a band because he did not 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.100
 want to fight and get shot and 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.990
 awakens the innovating acts and it 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.700
 local people have for it and from 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.830
 he is taken by the police after 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.500
 everything starts a plot of the street tournament 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.810
 Fighter and being arranged such and 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.820
 China is investigating and I go along 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.470
 with oo and everything else that has several 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.990
 characters that appear then this 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.140
 start is very random very random 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.670
 is to avoid a boat took a blow and what 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.970
 it's yours now it's ok I think 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.140
 back now first chapters or a half 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.460
 even half bad 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.220
 only that after the story the characters 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:59.030
 they are charismatic the fights are very good 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.840
 It 's then you'll be taken if you 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.090
 fun is a very light reading and the end 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.580
 of volume 2 that has the fight with the mink 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.959
 which not exactly by the mink knows the 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.000
 visual is very cool even 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:16.340
 Only the manga did not make me care. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.700
 with the mink for me to care about a 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.590
 fight rubson the neighborhood where there is war 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:27.970
 if you like the japanese 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.870
 so is my brother made me care with a 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.610
 neighborhood or else it's a middle 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.830
 a super cool fight with a 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.540
 Man, I only care about the neighborhood. 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.910
 because I know who Mr. Bison is like 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.710
 I used to talk when I was a child, I know who 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.420
 It's this guy so I care about him. 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.370
 because I know people do but not 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.450
 because I tell you, it made me care 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.280
 He and I care about the river that is a 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.780
 very fun character I care 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.610
 with a link in my mouth just from me by with 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.410
 who unfortunately ended up being 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.760
 side there by the action only he has 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.960
 a fight with the river on the beach is very 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.920
 cool really good, it's the end later 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.870
 of the fight with the serious face mink that does not 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.870
 It's going to be a spoiler, it's not just I just wanted 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.760
 show this double page that these 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.790
 two guys on the grass is very pretty if 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.090
 draws very cool is so this is a 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.970
 Fun and lightweight manga with lots of fights 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.690
 fun is super unpretentious to 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.730
 art of the 90's I think super cool is 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.040
 keep a weak pot because bitch who 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.820
 pariu street fighter will not expect a 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.950
 of a great deal dealt with historical partner 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.230
 culture of Japanese history does not 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.360
 guy is a good excuse sought to beat 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.580
 in another negative point is not from editing 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.010
 and door to door that are original that 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.960
 I'm very sad to have a new one. 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.540
 a super fuck of alpha street fighter 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.640
 here back and on the cover the Japanese the 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.760
 I do not know who did put 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.670
 This shit about ethics here is 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.840
 kind of sad but the covers horizontally 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.260
 they are very cool 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.960
 This is the type I saw serving people. 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.710
 buy an album cover in the form of 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.710
 do it 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.080
 Is not this guy a light two man? 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.010
 closed volumes the unpretentious is 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.440
 reading to pass the time is worth a lot 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:20.210
 feather I run behind this street fighter 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.550
 alpha 6 makes clothes sure that I 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.440
 ask yes yes I like it 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.590
 street fighter fucking see that happening 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.050

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.630
 And I do not live street fighter 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:38.680
 so difficult but I'll see some time 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.680
 right down until the next one spoke
