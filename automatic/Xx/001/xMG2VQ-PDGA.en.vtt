00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
there should be more products like this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.510 
there should be more products like this
because<00:01:44.689> sometimes<00:01:45.689> foundations<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:47.070> too

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
because sometimes foundations are too

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.980 
because sometimes foundations are too
pink<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.390> two<00:01:48.750> yellow<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:50.670> oxidize<00:01:50.990> or

pink or two yellow or they oxidize or

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.730 
pink or two yellow or they oxidize or
they<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.520> match<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:53.970> skin

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
you what it looks like you will see a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.070 
you what it looks like you will see a
demo<00:02:17.110> later<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:18.129> it<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.940> looks<00:02:19.269> like<00:02:19.959> that

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
demo later but it just looks like that

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.360

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
when you're applying it it's not thick

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.650 
when you're applying it it's not thick
