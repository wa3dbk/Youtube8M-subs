than four inches you won't get proper

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.850 
than four inches you won't get proper
compaction<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.330> after<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> year<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.290> maybe<00:01:34.470> two

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
compaction and after a year or maybe two

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
compaction and after a year or maybe two
you<00:01:35.430> might<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.000> sinking<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.570> shifting

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
you might have some sinking and shifting

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.139 
you might have some sinking and shifting
when<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.320> gravel<00:01:37.740> itself<00:01:38.190> starts<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
when that gravel itself starts to

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.020 
when that gravel itself starts to
naturally<00:01:39.750> settle<00:01:40.170> also<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.250> tamping<00:01:41.759> it's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
naturally settle also in tamping it's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.210 
naturally settle also in tamping it's
good<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.600> use<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.110> water<00:01:43.440> basin<00:01:44.009> which

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
good to use this water basin which

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.160 
good to use this water basin which
allows<00:01:44.820> water<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> seep<00:01:45.570> through<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.780> bottom

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
allows water to seep through the bottom

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.899 
allows water to seep through the bottom
of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> tamper<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.460> does<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
of the tamper what that does is it

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.359 
of the tamper what that does is it
prevents<00:01:48.210> dusting<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.960> also<00:01:49.290> allows<00:01:50.039> for

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
prevents dusting and also allows for

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.600 
prevents dusting and also allows for
better<00:01:50.729> compaction<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.070> concludes<00:01:53.460> our

better compaction so this concludes our

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.790 
better compaction so this concludes our
