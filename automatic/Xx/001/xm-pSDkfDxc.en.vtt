for this emblem very easy you need a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.280 
for this emblem very easy you need a
square<00:02:03.580> times<00:02:04.580> were<00:02:05.180> not<00:02:05.390> around<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.110> square

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
square times were not around the square

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.800 
square times were not around the square
shows<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.740> times<00:02:07.040> 1<00:02:07.450> you're<00:02:08.450> going<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.629> need<00:02:08.780> a

square x 1 also you're going to need a

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.040 
square x 1 also you're going to need a
circle<00:02:13.069> x<00:02:13.370> 1

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050

that's what you're gonna need this one

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.550 
that's what you're gonna need this one
quite<00:02:26.700> straightforward<00:02:27.450> very<00:02:27.900> easy<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.380> find

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
quite straightforward very easy to find

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.980 
quite straightforward very easy to find
all<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.860> bits<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.160> pieces<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.870> yeah

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
all the bits and pieces so so yeah

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.480 
all the bits and pieces so so yeah
basically<00:02:31.230> obviously<00:02:31.830> i<00:02:31.890> put<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.160> rounded

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
basically obviously i put the rounded

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.150 
basically obviously i put the rounded
square<00:02:32.640> at<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> top<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.770> took<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.920> right<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
square at the top and took that right to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.910 
square at the top and took that right to
the<00:02:35.220> top<00:02:35.400> made<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> fairly<00:02:35.910> fat<00:02:36.300> drop<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the top made a fairly fat drop the the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
the top made a fairly fat drop the the
second<00:02:38.760> square<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.240> at<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.360> bottom<00:02:39.540> black

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
second square and at the bottom black

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.450 
second square and at the bottom black
and<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.380> doesn't<00:02:40.680> match<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.040> let<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.160> run

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
and that doesn't match and let that run

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.860 
and that doesn't match and let that run
off<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> bomb<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.000> page<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:42.660> doesn't

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
off the bomb of the page really doesn't

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.260 
off the bomb of the page really doesn't
matter<00:02:43.170> now<00:02:43.680> I've<00:02:43.830> used<00:02:44.040> as<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.400> 0<00:02:44.730> here<00:02:45.030> for

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
matter now I've used as this 0 here for

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.800 
matter now I've used as this 0 here for
the<00:02:45.420> 20<00:02:46.080> 25<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> don't<00:02:47.190> use<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.490> 0<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.270> one

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
new to my emblem edit series obviously

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.680 
new to my emblem edit series obviously
when<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.310> make<00:02:53.580> these<00:02:53.730> emblems<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.330> make<00:02:54.480> them

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
when I make these emblems and make them

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.410 
when I make these emblems and make them
off<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> fly<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:56.160> just<00:02:56.400> sort<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.640> like<00:02:56.790> five

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
off a fly and I just sort of like five

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.270 
off a fly and I just sort of like five
them<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.840> as<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.200> go<00:02:58.230> along<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.860> sometimes

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
them out as I go along and sometimes

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.550 
them out as I go along and sometimes
they<00:02:59.400> will<00:02:59.550> change<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.420> would<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.110> sort<00:03:01.530> of

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
they will change so I would it sort of

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.350 
they will change so I would it sort of
like<00:03:01.709> say<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:01.980> guys<00:03:02.280> watch<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.000> all<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.150> way

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
like say you guys watch it all the way

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.330 
like say you guys watch it all the way
to<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.690> end<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.140> then<00:03:04.650> you'll<00:03:04.800> see<00:03:04.980> if<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.190> make

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
to the end and then you'll see if I make

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.190 
to the end and then you'll see if I make
any<00:03:05.370> differences<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.240> there<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> wasn't

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
any differences because there I wasn't

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140 
any differences because there I wasn't
happy<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.590> way<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:08.130> 0<00:03:08.400> looked<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:09.030> this

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
happy the way the 0 looked with this

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.640 
happy the way the 0 looked with this
bomb<00:03:09.390> because<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> bombs<00:03:09.959> all<00:03:10.140> sets<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.530> off

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
bomb because the bombs all sets it off

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.670 
bomb because the bombs all sets it off
but<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.700> used<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.510> an<00:03:12.660> oval<00:03:13.020> in<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.170> end<00:03:13.380> on

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
but I used it an oval in the end on

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.290 
but I used it an oval in the end on
there<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.190> then<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.430> made<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.790> bomb<00:03:15.000> stand

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
there and then that made the bomb stand

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.210 
there and then that made the bomb stand
that<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> bit<00:03:15.660> barren<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.230> was<00:03:16.440> very<00:03:16.620> good<00:03:16.950> but

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
that a bit barren and was very good but

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.460 
that a bit barren and was very good but
this<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.610> pretty<00:03:17.850> much<00:03:18.090> an<00:03:18.450> absolute<00:03:18.989> carbon

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
this is pretty much an absolute carbon

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.009 
this is pretty much an absolute carbon
copy<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.860> what<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.760> actual<00:03:20.910> emblem<00:03:21.870> is

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
copy of what the the actual emblem is

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.290 
copy of what the the actual emblem is
the<00:03:22.170> only<00:03:22.320> thing<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.920> differs<00:03:23.400> from<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
the only thing that differs from is the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.350 
the only thing that differs from is the
