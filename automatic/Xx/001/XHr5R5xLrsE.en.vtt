00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
very very fun I had a good time but

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.700 
very very fun I had a good time but
enough<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.480> let's<00:00:15.990> talk<00:00:16.199> about<00:00:16.320> gadgets

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
enough of that let's talk about gadgets

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.439 
enough of that let's talk about gadgets
we're<00:00:17.070> going<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> talk<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:17.699> gadgets<00:00:17.940> today

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
we're going to talk about gadgets today

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.420 
we're going to talk about gadgets today
so<00:00:18.510> see<00:00:18.810> if<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.080> could<00:00:19.230> build<00:00:19.380> any<00:00:19.740> gadget<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
so see if you could build any gadget and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.830 
so see if you could build any gadget and
bring<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.730> market<00:00:20.939> sell<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.420> people<00:00:21.449> what

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
bring it to market sell to people what

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.599 
bring it to market sell to people what
would<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.260> make<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.769> want<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.369> PEZ<00:00:23.580> dispenser

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
would you make I want a PEZ dispenser

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.029 
would you make I want a PEZ dispenser
but<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.330> fires<00:00:24.570> them<00:00:24.779> at<00:00:24.900> lethal<00:00:25.230> velocity<00:00:25.320> so

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
but it fires them at lethal velocity so

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
but it fires them at lethal velocity so
I<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.279> PES<00:00:26.550> gun<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.210> actually<00:00:27.359> shoots<00:00:27.810> PES

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
I can PES gun which actually shoots PES

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
I can PES gun which actually shoots PES
pellets<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.310> could<00:00:29.699> hurt<00:00:30.060> people<00:00:30.090> yeah

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
pellets like and could hurt people yeah

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
pellets like and could hurt people yeah
put<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> hole<00:00:31.199> through<00:00:31.230> drywall<00:00:31.619> whole<00:00:32.009> nine

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
put a hole through drywall whole nine

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.620 
put a hole through drywall whole nine
that's<00:00:32.669> interesting<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> had<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.270> very<00:00:33.390> similar

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that's interesting I had a very similar

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.780 
that's interesting I had a very similar
idea<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.380> cats

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790

millimeter<00:00:53.700> clcs<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.870> still<00:00:55.020> interested

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
millimeter clcs but are still interested

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.740 
millimeter clcs but are still interested
in<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.800> enhanced<00:00:56.370> cooling<00:00:56.790> performance<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.480> a

in the enhanced cooling performance of a
lengthier<00:00:58.200> option<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:59.460> I'll<00:00:59.670> was

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
lengthier option think I'll was

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.979 
lengthier option think I'll was
mentioning<00:01:00.300> something<00:01:00.510> along<00:01:00.720> those<00:01:00.870> lines

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
mentioning something along those lines

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
mentioning something along those lines
to<00:01:01.200> me<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> other<00:01:01.559> day<00:01:01.830> but<00:01:01.890> anyway<00:01:02.730> the
