water<00:00:01.860> as<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.250> know<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.610> really<00:00:02.879> precious

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
water as we know is a really precious

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.930 
water as we know is a really precious
resource<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.020> that's<00:00:04.980> been<00:00:05.430> evident<00:00:05.790> this

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
resource and that's been evident this

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.330 
resource and that's been evident this
year<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.690> very<00:00:06.960> dry<00:00:07.230> spring<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.980> very<00:00:08.160> dry

year in the very dry spring and very dry
autumn<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.790> we've<00:00:08.940> had<00:00:09.120> as<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.260> see

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
autumn that we've had as you can see

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.870 
autumn that we've had as you can see
there's<00:00:10.530> very<00:00:10.559> little<00:00:10.830> water<00:00:11.309> actually<00:00:11.790> in

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
there's very little water actually in

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.339 
there's very little water actually in
this<00:00:12.059> ditch<00:00:12.269> at<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.509> moment<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.049> we've<00:00:13.170> taken

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
this ditch at the moment so we've taken

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.870 
this ditch at the moment so we've taken
an<00:00:13.530> opportunity<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.070> D<00:00:14.219> silt<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
an opportunity to D silt some of the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.029 
an opportunity to D silt some of the
ditch<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.529> following<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.740> some<00:00:16.859> work

management<00:00:22.109> tool<00:00:22.500> we've<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> little<00:00:23.550> bit

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670

management tool we've got a little bit
creative<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.600> JCB<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:26.369> we've

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
creative with the JCB and here we've

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.929 
creative with the JCB and here we've
widened<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.630> deepened<00:00:27.769> the<00:00:28.769> ditch<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.670> we've

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
widened and deepened the ditch and we've

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.870 
widened and deepened the ditch and we've
put<00:00:30.150> some<00:00:30.330> stones<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:31.520> which<00:00:32.520> we've<00:00:32.700> got

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
put some stones in there which we've got

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.440 
put some stones in there which we've got
from<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> farm<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:34.770> idea<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.700> allow<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
from the farm the idea is to allow the

from the farm the idea is to allow the
water<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> come<00:00:37.050> into<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.440> wider<00:00:38.250> deeper

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

section of ditch way where it'll slow

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.970 
section of ditch way where it'll slow
its<00:00:41.129> flow<00:00:41.790> down<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> slows<00:00:43.920> down

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
its flow down and because it slows down

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.119 
its flow down and because it slows down
any<00:00:44.460> particles<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.180> soil<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.690> silt<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.289> are

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
in that in that water should in theory

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.639 
in that in that water should in theory
drop<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.360> turn<00:00:51.690> into<00:00:51.870> silt<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.500> can

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
drop out and turn into silt which we can

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.910 
drop out and turn into silt which we can
then<00:00:53.329> periodically<00:00:54.329> dig<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.960> return

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
then periodically dig out and return

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.970 
then periodically dig out and return
back<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> fields<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.379> that<00:00:58.379> silt<00:00:58.680> has<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
back to the fields and that silt has the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.849 
back to the fields and that silt has the
potential<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.789> carrying<00:01:00.530> fertilizer<00:01:01.530> or

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
potential to be carrying fertilizer or

pesticides that are bound onto those
soil<00:01:03.930> particles<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.710> that's<00:01:05.070> quite<00:01:05.299> quite<00:01:06.299> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
soil particles so that's quite quite a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
soil particles so that's quite quite a
neat<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.659> operation<00:01:07.229> really<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.700> once

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
neat little operation really and once

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.630 
neat little operation really and once
it's<00:01:08.880> been<00:01:09.000> through<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> silt<00:01:09.540> trap<00:01:09.810> area<00:01:10.640> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it's been through the silt trap area it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.750 
it's been through the silt trap area it
returns<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> original<00:01:13.520> flow<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
returns to the original flow of the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.240 
returns to the original flow of the
ditch<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:15.960> seven<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.770> eight<00:01:16.830> meters

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
ditch for about seven or eight meters

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.710 
ditch for about seven or eight meters
just<00:01:17.540> along<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.460> enters<00:01:21.360> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
just along here and then it enters this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
just along here and then it enters this
area<00:01:22.020> which<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.560> time<00:01:22.890> become<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.369> reed

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
area which will in time become a reed

deflector there ready to try and take it
away<00:01:29.400> from<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> old<00:01:29.850> ditch<00:01:30.060> line<00:01:30.299> which<00:01:30.509> ran

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
away from the old ditch line which ran

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.410 
away from the old ditch line which ran
round<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> right<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.939> this<00:01:32.939> area<00:01:33.240> will

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
should in theory take that out before

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.060 
should in theory take that out before
the<00:01:49.649> cleaner<00:01:49.890> cleaner<00:01:50.460> water<00:01:51.920> exits<00:01:52.920> the

the cleaner cleaner water exits the

the cleaner cleaner water exits the
ditch<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.490> heads<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.000> down<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> local

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.810 
stream so that's the plan really as you
say<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.189> bone-dry<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
say as you can see it's bone-dry at the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.170 
say as you can see it's bone-dry at the
moment<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:01.009> we're<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> bit<00:02:03.119> of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
moment and we're you know it's a bit of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.780 
moment and we're you know it's a bit of
a<00:02:03.240> serious<00:02:03.920> scenario<00:02:04.920> certainly<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.549> next

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
a serious scenario certainly for next

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310 
a serious scenario certainly for next
year<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.299> having<00:02:06.540> these<00:02:06.659> ditches<00:02:06.869> running

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
year not having these ditches running

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.930 
year not having these ditches running
now<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.740> means<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.129> land<00:02:08.310> rains<00:02:08.610> aren't

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
now it means the land rains aren't

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.460 
now it means the land rains aren't
running<00:02:09.090> which<00:02:09.330> means<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.750> water<00:02:09.899> table

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
running which means the water table

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.510 
running which means the water table
isn't<00:02:11.400> being<00:02:11.550> topped<00:02:11.879> up<00:02:12.150> yet

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
isn't being topped up yet

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.130 
isn't being topped up yet
which<00:02:13.790> could<00:02:13.970> have<00:02:14.060> some<00:02:14.210> impact<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.660> next

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
which could have some impact on next

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.580 
which could have some impact on next
year's<00:02:15.400> next<00:02:16.400> year's<00:02:16.580> cropping<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.410> it's<00:02:18.560> a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
year's next year's cropping so it's a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.970 
year's next year's cropping so it's a
slight<00:02:19.100> concern<00:02:19.460> at<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.670> moment
