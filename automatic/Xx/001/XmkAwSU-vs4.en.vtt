00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.870
 I want to try to open I think you open by tapping the 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.090
 I opened the product, it's great, I read it until it is good with amazon . 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.770
 However, when I open it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 Where there is not taught you are reading 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.980
 It's amazing, it feels like a really beautiful hair 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.510
 When expressed in paper with this 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.900
 I have a super pony water as an image, a little higher than plain paper 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:28.700
 God of feel great white I'd have been rough

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:46.320
 I'll end up, but this is where I can read it from before 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:51.450
 Also I think this is easy to read because there is no function at all 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.800
 Goods are expected in such a feeling and when you tap on the character 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.800
 I'm sure it's really set 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.560
