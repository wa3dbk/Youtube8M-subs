00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello there 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:13.860
 our diamond shapes show means diamonds 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.170
 it is often aranov to the sea ​​everything is built on 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.380
 carry 5 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 so here I have a diamond or apr 21 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.710
 a loop here is pretty mediocre 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:32.309
 yes and i have from here these bands are coming from 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.190
 three loops instead of two is two loops 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.110
 Here, in principle, no matter just this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.290
 a little bit so flat this turns out 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.510
 more convex when like i like strings 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.149
 but then as I do now I will show you and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.780
 the second line is a little more complicated 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:56.010
 means how loops are distributed so 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.730
 21 loops 7 purl 7 facial 7 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 purl 7 face go to the pigtails here 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.420
 can with 900 pigtails 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.330
 if you do n't, you can actually 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.530
 no braids do mean now show 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:16.770
 what is the difference between these pigtails 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.170
 mean between a regular pigtail like this 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.439
 who here here she is from 7 loops for 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.880
 pcs 1 loop will go to the beginning of our lo 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.220
 of this internal pattern right away 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.320
 so what do we do 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:44.420
 accordingly before we knit first 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:44.420
 just our 7 loops purl 4 ups 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:02:02.689
 so four five six seven 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.490
 Now that is what it means now , unlike 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.609
 the technique is exactly the same, see my 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.670
 previous games lessons about braids but here 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.680
 we have 4 means that the pigtail was us 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.299
 exactly and pretty of three loops 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.660
 remove the first three here remove the first 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.569
 three 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:28.750
 and look means the first three loops 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:32.269
 which we have on this main 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.459
 knitting needles they will go the other way 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.769
 pigtails mean we just knit them 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.780
 1 2 3 but this loop remains with us 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.359
 the beginning of our drawing of the inner 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.120
 it means because we have everything 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.690
 pigtails facial date this loop I'm 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.500
 I knit everything inside out 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.599
 and this is the beginning of the inner pattern further and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:07.010
 accordingly, as usual, I knit 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:13.090
 the remaining three loops 3 are such a pigtail 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.410
 already started the inner eye before the remnants 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:30.049
 dopevyazyvay as we usually have here 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:33.380
 be 7 loops 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 edging 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:37.370
 knitting facial but it's 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:44.680
 who as you like so much 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.680
 purse row purse row 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:55.049
 mean purl knit knit since 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.360
 looking drawing except 1 our internal 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:04.200
 loops that will be in this box office in this 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:15.709
 pattern we already have this pattern then 7 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:19.049
 facial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:24.000
 farther we have 3 purses since 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.630
 us a row here this one here with the fathers 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.639
 these stripes of three are of two yes 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:36.210
 mean 3 purl 1 2 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:39.479
 in general, in principle, in that these and equal 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.669
 new count yes here are three purl 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.350
 now this is the first loop we 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.630
 knit on the wrong side here 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.440
 we have it front is the first loop 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.530
 which picture means we knit it 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.500
 there she we had purl means 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.449
 here we have it here we stand as 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.340
 facial we knit navara too we 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:05.930
 make a pattern fox why about time 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.930
 purl again go three loop strip 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:22.760
 23 and here we should have 7 so far 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:27.030
 seven times two three 4 5 six 7 1 edge 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:31.880
 so, respectively, by the way how 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.880
 looks like scenes so we started doing it 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:49.340
 so next next facial row y 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:54.580
 we have the third row 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:59.310
 it means we start the transfer of loops on 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:12.219
 here we are not knitting 76 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:16.629
 one two three 4 5 six 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:19.599
 Yes, and this loop, we must move 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:22.300
 inside here are all the Arans and these are the bands 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:24.520
 built on carrying loops means like 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.090
 can move the loop first show 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.389
 easiest way yes using depot 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.930
 on the needles then I'll show without extra 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.810
 knitting needles 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:39.729
 mean when we transfer this inside 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.400
 loop we have to remove it back with it 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:48.150
 one took off 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:53.069
 hooked up 3 loops of my strip 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:56.529
 3 and now I have to either with her 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:07:01.800
 additional needles or flip 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:07.300
 like this, but I knit the main knitting needle 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:12.089
 knit purl like this 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.740
 to do with transference so it means to me 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:18.610
 knitted face 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.770
 do the inside out on read then I perry 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.860
 redo extremely and extremely and I 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.419
 I prefer to always do inside out and 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.210
 now i need two loops 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:32.610
 already inside now i need this and this 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:35.520
 loop after three first three of this to me 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.810
 strip this loop to move inside 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:42.270
 then again I show myself simple 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:45.270
 a way with banks knitting needles I take off 3 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.270
 forward 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.800
 I knit 

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.330
 I always purl it 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:58.120
 she looks prettier 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.860
 purl then here I will do 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:04.750
 drawing as i needed knitted 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:09.480
 purland now I knit 3 loops 

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:15.490
 my band here so I 

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:18.420
 moved the door already two more hinges here 

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.420
 in this inner gaze
