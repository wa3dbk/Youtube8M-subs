00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
all right so this is just me recording

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.089 
all right so this is just me recording
about<00:00:03.060> my<00:00:03.899> young<00:00:04.529> yo<00:00:04.770> 5<00:00:05.549> 6<00:00:05.819> 8<00:00:06.000> e^x<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:07.099> have

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
about my young yo 5 6 8 e^x to have

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.459 
about my young yo 5 6 8 e^x to have
recently<00:00:08.429> purchased<00:00:08.670> I'm<00:00:09.450> basically<00:00:10.349> just

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
recently purchased I'm basically just

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.190 
recently purchased I'm basically just
shooting<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.980> subject<00:00:11.429> that's<00:00:11.580> about<00:00:11.969> 4<00:00:12.929> feet

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
shooting a subject that's about 4 feet

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.620 
shooting a subject that's about 4 feet
away<00:00:13.559> from<00:00:13.980> me

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
away from me

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.150 
away from me
gonna<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.809> directly<00:00:16.320> towards<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> subject

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
gonna do it directly towards the subject

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.970 
gonna do it directly towards the subject
first<00:00:17.960> zoomed<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.640> and<00:00:21.380> that's<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.590> exposure

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
first zoomed in and that's the exposure

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.099 
first zoomed in and that's the exposure
as<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.670> histogram<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> pretty

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
as you can see histogram is pretty

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.630 
as you can see histogram is pretty
average<00:00:25.289> pretty<00:00:25.740> good<00:00:27.529> turn<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> head<00:00:28.920> 180

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
average pretty good turn the head 180

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.880 
average pretty good turn the head 180
degrees<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.689> shoot<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> wall<00:00:31.170> behind<00:00:31.349> me<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
degrees to shoot the wall behind me and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.060 
degrees to shoot the wall behind me and
see<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.130> not<00:00:32.279> very<00:00:32.550> far<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:36.570> by<00:00:37.500> comparison

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
see it's not very far and by comparison

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.740 
see it's not very far and by comparison
the<00:00:38.640> histogram<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.390> much<00:00:39.930> darker<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.480> shots

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the histogram is much darker the shots

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.930 
the histogram is much darker the shots
just<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.469> bright<00:00:43.710> should<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.760> like

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
just not as bright should not be like

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.200 
just not as bright should not be like
that<00:00:46.340> but<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.600> power<00:00:49.289> issue

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
that but if you think it's a power issue

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.930 
that but if you think it's a power issue
I'm<00:00:51.210> gonna<00:00:51.360> put<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> manual<00:00:52.350> power<00:00:52.559> at

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
I'm gonna put this on to manual power at

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.479 
I'm gonna put this on to manual power at
1/4<00:00:54.230> 1/4<00:00:55.230> power<00:00:55.469> same<00:00:56.280> shot<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:59.449> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.600> see

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
1/4 1/4 power same shot as you can see

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
1/4 1/4 power same shot as you can see
histogram<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.579> fine<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:03.000> 1/4<00:01:03.570> power<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
histogram is fine at 1/4 power so the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
histogram is fine at 1/4 power so the
flash<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.100> definitely<00:01:05.519> capable<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.150> hitting

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
flash is definitely capable of hitting

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810 
flash is definitely capable of hitting
this<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> TTL<00:01:07.470> calculation<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.549> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
this it's the TTL calculation that is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
this it's the TTL calculation that is
wrong<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:11.189> also<00:01:11.549> test<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.299> can't<00:01:12.960> put

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
wrong to also test this I can't put

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.580 
wrong to also test this I can't put
these<00:01:13.320> batteries<00:01:13.799> into<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:14.340> 5<00:01:14.610> 6<00:01:14.909> 5<00:01:15.150> es<00:01:15.659> also

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
these batteries into my 5 6 5 es also

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.440 
these batteries into my 5 6 5 es also
younger

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.820 

same<00:01:23.110> batteries<00:01:25.050> all<00:01:26.050> right<00:01:26.229> so<00:01:26.409> now<00:01:26.560> I've<00:01:26.680> got

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
same batteries all right so now I've got

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.870 
same batteries all right so now I've got
my<00:01:27.220> young<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.880> know<00:01:28.000> 565<00:01:28.930> e^x<00:01:29.620> all<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.580> one

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.719 

direct<00:01:33.880> flash<00:01:34.090> on<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.900> my<00:01:35.110> subject<00:01:35.530> at<00:01:36.070> 105

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
direct flash on to my subject at 105

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:44.530 
direct flash on to my subject at 105
millimeter

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.080 

and<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:45.350> I'd<00:01:45.440> centered<00:01:45.830> around

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.620 

you<00:01:52.090> can<00:01:52.240> see<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:53.370> TTL<00:01:54.370> exposure<00:01:54.730> is<00:01:54.940> fine<00:01:55.210> on

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
you can see the TTL exposure is fine on

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.440 
you can see the TTL exposure is fine on
the<00:01:55.690> bounce<00:01:56.050> flash<00:01:56.760> one<00:01:57.760> other<00:01:57.970> thing<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.420> have

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
the bounce flash one other thing I have

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.850 
the bounce flash one other thing I have
actually<00:01:58.990> noticed<00:01:59.200> about<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.830> is<00:02:01.020> also<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
actually noticed about this is also the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.920 
actually noticed about this is also the
fact<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.610> do<00:02:03.670> have<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:05.490> sound<00:02:06.490> beep

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
fact that I do have the sound beep

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.850 
fact that I do have the sound beep
turned<00:02:07.930> on<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.750> see<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.500> little

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
turned on can you see the the little

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.430 
turned on can you see the the little
musical<00:02:12.160> note<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.550> right<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.290> that's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
musical note on the right so that's

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.690 
musical note on the right so that's
supposed<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.740> make<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:14.890> beep<00:02:15.130> every<00:02:15.370> time<00:02:15.550> it's

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
supposed to make it beep every time it's

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.060 
supposed to make it beep every time it's
ready<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.090> fire<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.600> flash<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:17.950> I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
ready to fire it on the flash now if I

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.430 
ready to fire it on the flash now if I
this<00:02:18.220> file<00:02:18.460> at<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:19.260> there<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.410> no<00:02:20.560> sound

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
this file at this there is no sound

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.620 
this file at this there is no sound
however<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.550> just<00:02:24.760> apply<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:25.060> little<00:02:25.360> bit<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
however if I just apply a little bit of

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.230 
however if I just apply a little bit of
pressure<00:02:25.780> here

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
pressure here

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.990 
pressure here
it<00:02:28.240> will<00:02:28.980> give<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.070> sound<00:02:30.340> say<00:02:32.880> thanks<00:02:33.880> see<00:02:33.970> I

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
it will give the sound say thanks see I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.780 
it will give the sound say thanks see I
put<00:02:34.360> my<00:02:34.390> hand<00:02:34.660> away<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.990> just<00:02:35.170> stops<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.280> my<00:02:36.459> I

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
put my hand away it just stops so my I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.920 
put my hand away it just stops so my I
think<00:02:37.270> that's<00:02:37.390> laying<00:02:37.510> wrong<00:02:37.720> with<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
think that's laying wrong with the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.930 
think that's laying wrong with the
firing<00:02:38.320> pins<00:02:38.530> which<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.370> what's<00:02:39.550> causing<00:02:39.730> it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
firing pins which is what's causing it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.390 
firing pins which is what's causing it
to<00:02:40.060> play<00:02:40.209> up
