00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.539
 you can easily care if the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.900
 night is no chance 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.260
 we need one or two nice photos 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.660

 other times I should e mail with

 your photo 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.079
 understands here sometimes I can be a 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.499
 take two weeks 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.499
 look at 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 nadine urban I think it's the end 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.850
 contact the lottery numbers 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.690
 right we have in our agency 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:54.550
 a recording fee is 50 euro and 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.470
 is unique we are to 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.450
 must be set differently 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.600
 of course left to the parents themselves 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.280
 if you are willing to pay for it 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.869
 or light what the parents mostly but 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.959
 we do not know that we are the children 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.370
 Year out of legal obligation 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.810
 out at the district governments 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.720
 must register 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.000
 And that costs us all tours in the year 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.980
 sometimes just about the 1000 euro 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.070
 then of course we also have 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.269
 compared to other agencies the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.060
 professional circumstances so we 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.910
 really have a complete 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.760
 equipped photo studio have a lot 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.980
 good cameras and well have 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.510
 of course that's why our fed cold 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.569
 on a to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.379
 if that must be or not I know 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.330
 not know the customer but for us 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.099
 is it the scale and there again 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.849
 In any case , we also want to be faithful 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.620
 stay 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.269
 I think it's a lot worse 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.310
 agencies advertise that everything 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.530
 is free and you will come 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.420
 and is confronted with that one 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.340
 then pay for the photo shoot 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.290
 not only for the first one 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.890
 fotoshooting but stop for each photo 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.590
 shooting 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.630
 that is not really with us 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.790
 once when the children are then 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.660
 have changed and we take photos again 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.670
 to have to do 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.120
 it's the follow shootings on each one 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.120
 case for free 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.480
 do 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:17.530
 the photos of the shooting and your tecdax 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.940
 if you have the documents for the review 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.139
 however sent back askan 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.850
 fast we almost go if the 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.889
 requests from parents to us 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.270
 We have to be sent back 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.770
 also first send to the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.540
 district government dÃ¼sseldorf die 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.700
 in charge of us as an agency and there 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.919
 are the same again two to 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.870
 three weeks that's always away 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.090
 depending on the stamp of Jugendamt 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.440
 it is or not 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.000
 in urgent matters the child 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.600
 example for a job already in question 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.300
 We would come to that with the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.090
 that we can do that in the 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.770
 but only if 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.450
 Of course, all the stamps are there and 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.820
 even the given condition is still right 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.810
 but I want to again say 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.340
 before this request from the parents do not 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.280
 is sent back to us 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:36.180
 will not be a child in ours 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:36.180
