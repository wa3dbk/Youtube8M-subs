00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:58.139 
the one default on this is that it

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:01.160 
the one default on this is that it
doesn't<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:59.429> back<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.600> only<00:01:00.749> happens

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
sometimes but you just have to have it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.560 
sometimes but you just have to have it
in<00:01:03.209> the<00:01:03.269> right<00:01:03.479> thing<00:01:03.749> but<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.769> doesn't<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.570> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
in the right thing but it doesn't on so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
in the right thing but it doesn't on so
bad<00:01:06.900> yeah<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.530> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.979> big<00:01:08.159> problem

circle<00:01:46.170> triangle<00:01:46.650> this<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.730> designed<00:01:48.030> for

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
circle triangle this was designed for

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
circle triangle this was designed for
Tekken<00:01:48.659> 5<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.230> think<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.650> button<00:01:49.890> layout<00:01:50.159> is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
Tekken 5 so I think the button layout is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760 
Tekken 5 so I think the button layout is
for<00:01:50.970> Tekken<00:01:51.180> 5<00:01:51.480> I<00:01:51.659> don't<00:01:51.900> know<00:01:52.050> I've<00:01:52.320> never

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
played it and I'll probably I'm planning

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.470 
played it and I'll probably I'm planning
on<00:01:54.210> bland<00:01:54.659> buying<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.110> probably<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.680> some

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
on bland buying it and probably do some

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
annoys me because all the things just

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.720 
annoys me because all the things just
gradually<00:02:39.140> slide<00:02:39.620> back<00:02:40.010> as<00:02:40.280> you're<00:02:40.459> playing

gradually slide back as you're playing
with<00:02:40.910> them<00:02:41.060> but<00:02:41.569> this<00:02:41.720> really<00:02:42.079> stays<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:43.040> place

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
with them but this really stays in place

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.720 
with them but this really stays in place
when<00:02:44.420> you're<00:02:44.599> fighting<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.260> very<00:02:46.190> very<00:02:46.489> cool

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
when you're fighting so very very cool

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.400

knock on wood

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.360

but like yeah my cat's name never chew
on<00:03:52.599> cords<00:03:53.599> but<00:03:54.700> yeah<00:03:55.700> very<00:03:55.910> thick<00:03:56.299> cord<00:03:56.599> so<00:03:56.780> if

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
on cords but yeah very thick cord so if

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.839 
on cords but yeah very thick cord so if
that<00:03:56.989> does<00:03:57.169> happen<00:03:57.200> if<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.859> it<00:03:58.160> would<00:03:58.489> be<00:03:58.609> hard

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
that does happen if you it would be hard

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.280 
that does happen if you it would be hard
for<00:03:58.970> them<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.239> get<00:03:59.329> all<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.629> way<00:03:59.720> down<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.079> the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
for them to get all the way down to the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.069 
for them to get all the way down to the
metal<00:04:00.799> part<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.700> got<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.060> normal<00:04:02.329> ps2<00:04:02.870> thing

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
metal part you got the normal ps2 thing

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.629 
metal part you got the normal ps2 thing
and<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:03.440> would<00:04:03.590> probably<00:04:03.709> work<00:04:03.919> in<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.400> ps1

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
and this would probably work in a ps1

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.629 
and this would probably work in a ps1
too<00:04:05.120> if<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.950> like<00:04:07.040> if<00:04:07.220> you're<00:04:07.310> playing<00:04:07.340> with<00:04:07.549> a

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
too if you like if you're playing with a

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.839 
too if you like if you're playing with a
fighting<00:04:07.879> game<00:04:08.090> yeah<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:09.440> very<00:04:09.949> very<00:04:10.250> cool<00:04:10.519> the

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
fighting game yeah so very very cool the

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.129 
fighting game yeah so very very cool the
bundling<00:04:11.209> out<00:04:11.329> -<00:04:11.599> one<00:04:11.870> thing<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.109> should

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
bundling out - one thing I should

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.110 
bundling out - one thing I should
mention<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.250> I've<00:04:13.609> played<00:04:13.849> this<00:04:13.940> with<00:04:14.060> a

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
mention is that I've played this with a

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.029 
mention is that I've played this with a
couple<00:04:14.359> of<00:04:14.510> other<00:04:14.720> non<00:04:15.139> fighting<00:04:15.590> games<00:04:15.799> and

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
couple of other non fighting games and

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.890 
couple of other non fighting games and
it<00:04:16.459> works<00:04:16.699> I<00:04:16.970> mean<00:04:17.120> it's<00:04:17.269> hard<00:04:17.539> because<00:04:17.750> you

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
it works I mean it's hard because you

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.580 
it works I mean it's hard because you
don't<00:04:18.049> have<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.199> second

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
don't have a second

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.319 
don't have a second
stick<00:04:18.980> but<00:04:19.160> if<00:04:19.250> you're<00:04:19.370> playing<00:04:19.519> a<00:04:19.730> ps2<00:04:20.150> idiom

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
stick but if you're playing a ps2 idiom

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.729 
stick but if you're playing a ps2 idiom
that<00:04:20.449> doesn't<00:04:20.690> haven't<00:04:20.930> sit<00:04:21.049> doesn't<00:04:21.470> usually

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
that doesn't haven't sit doesn't usually

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.189 
that doesn't haven't sit doesn't usually
utilize<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.940> second<00:04:23.180> analog<00:04:23.690> stick<00:04:23.990> then<00:04:24.169> you

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
utilize the second analog stick then you

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.500 
utilize the second analog stick then you
can<00:04:24.410> use<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:24.830> because<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:26.030> works<00:04:26.300> and

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
can use this because it works and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.240 
can use this because it works and
