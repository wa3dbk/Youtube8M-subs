00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
because there's so much illusion in this

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
add the turn the reason why we learn the

ghosting Cateye I sin first is because

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.400 
ghosting Cateye I sin first is because
you<00:03:07.070> need<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.520> understand<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.420> rhythm<00:03:09.020> and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
you need to understand that rhythm and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.080 
you need to understand that rhythm and
that<00:03:09.440> your<00:03:09.739> left<00:03:09.950> hand<00:03:10.070> barely<00:03:10.520> touches<00:03:11.060> the
