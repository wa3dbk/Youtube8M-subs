00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
goes in like v-shape behind me for extra

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.770 
goes in like v-shape behind me for extra
smoothness<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:31.670> would<00:01:31.880> jump<00:01:32.090> back<00:01:32.329> with<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
smoothness I would jump back with the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.179 
smoothness I would jump back with the
other<00:01:32.899> leg<00:01:33.140> when<00:01:33.319> pulling<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.679> ball<00:01:33.829> forward
