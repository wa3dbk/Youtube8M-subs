00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.379
 in this video documentation I show 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.950
 Make the construction of the table and blue night 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.380
 gentlemen first of all I sort them 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.710
 Components of the kit based on the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.570
 Illustration in the instructions i 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.820
 First check for all puzzles 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.609
 Interconnects well and 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.880
 if necessary, mark it and mark me 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.370
 the respective front and back sides of the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.780
 individual components with one or two 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:44.879
 pieces of crepe tape as long as the components 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.210
 not sewn together and glued together 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.840
 are 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.940
 that's easier to work with 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.489
 that's why I take to this early 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.160
 time already a suggestion before 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.989
 first with coarse grains and the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.920
 circuit having a fine grain size the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.920
 here is 240 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.610
 Next, the plates will edge 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.050
 Beveled so later at 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.050
 Assembling all the shocks are youthful 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.690
 especially in the bow and tail sections 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.770
 Must have caught a significant angle 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.990
 become 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.010
 you can see it here with one 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.880
 probably very good with some sandpaper 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.880
 you can work after 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.570
 the cnc cut kit of the city 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.900
 Night mens has very distinctive puzzle 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.200
 compounds that you color through 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:38.930
 very nice in the later finish of the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:42.200
 integrating boats can do some coloring 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.870
 I with a stain and in preparation 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.490
 on the stain better me the plates 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.230
 first of all so that the wood fibers 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:54.310
 raise and dry after drying 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.310
 can be ground 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.760
 start with a coarse sandpaper 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:28.430
 me and also here I finish the step 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.849
 with a 240 grit are the plates 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.150
 finished sanded I wear now 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:41.090
 a special stimulus brush the far 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:44.090
 on the components is important on that 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.439
 I increase one on a water basis 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.459
 is on an oil and not on an oil basis 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:54.760
 base will not be the epoxide later 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.760
 hold 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.489
 with a lint-free cotton cloth 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.189
 I'll take about two or three more 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.659
 The surplus continues to fall off and on 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.799
 Let the plates dry well 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:18.400
 Now the puzzle connections 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:22.880
 I would like to stick with each other 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.800
 micro celebration to a very tough crowd 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.800
 and brush the connections 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.100
 when gluing puzzle connections 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:59.740
 be sure that both components 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.840
 just on the countertop on the on 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:08.340
 lie thus no offset between the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.340
 arises to assigning components 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.500
 I can remove excess epoxide 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.500
 before it hardens 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:42.559
 I cover the splices with 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:44.330
 bit of plastic foil from lying down a wood 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:49.449
 up and complain everything with one 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:52.189
 weight before I can continue working 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.539
 have to pass 24 hours so that the ad 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.539
 Hail her rotation stalled
