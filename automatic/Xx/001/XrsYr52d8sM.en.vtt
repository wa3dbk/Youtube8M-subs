00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259 
in these ties they start losing heat

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.109 
in these ties they start losing heat
straight<00:00:18.470> away<00:00:18.679> so<00:00:19.189> the<00:00:19.279> first<00:00:19.460> 15<00:00:19.909> minutes

the surgery so all right just a tiny

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.349 
the surgery so all right just a tiny
little<00:00:26.119> cut<00:00:26.569> down<00:00:26.779> through<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.109> skin<00:00:27.349> tone

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
little cut down through the skin tone

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.519 
little cut down through the skin tone
just<00:00:29.359> helps<00:00:29.539> us<00:00:29.630> get<00:00:29.749> the<00:00:29.869> Catherine<00:00:30.319> a<00:00:30.409> lot

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
just helps us get the Catherine a lot

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.740 
just helps us get the Catherine a lot
easier<00:00:32.440> this<00:00:33.440> is<00:00:33.560> sort<00:00:33.710> of<00:00:33.740> an<00:00:33.950> ascetic<00:00:34.750> so

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
easier this is sort of an ascetic so

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.240 
easier this is sort of an ascetic so
just<00:00:35.990> going<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.200> inject<00:00:36.680> that<00:00:36.830> through<00:00:37.100> her

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
just going to inject that through her

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.940 
just going to inject that through her
catheter<00:00:38.740> just<00:00:39.740> slowly<00:00:41.290> giving<00:00:42.290> a<00:00:42.470> chance<00:00:42.740> to

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
catheter just slowly giving a chance to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.510 
catheter just slowly giving a chance to
work<00:00:43.130> as<00:00:43.610> you<00:00:43.760> guys<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.030> sleep

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.640 

so<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.210> goes<00:00:51.330> straight<00:00:51.480> down<00:00:51.630> into<00:00:51.780> trachea

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
so that goes straight down into trachea

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.530 
so that goes straight down into trachea
he'll<00:00:52.830> hear<00:00:53.130> way<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.150> just<00:00:54.330> hook<00:00:54.420> her<00:00:54.510> up

we think we only can assume but we think

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.760 
we think we only can assume but we think
her<00:02:13.510> mother<00:02:13.750> might<00:02:13.959> have<00:02:14.080> chewed<00:02:14.320> her<00:02:14.470> leg<00:02:14.650> off
