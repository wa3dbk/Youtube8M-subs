00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
responses are generated and so on it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.240 
responses are generated and so on it
looks<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:57.289> it<00:00:58.289> feels<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.719> a<00:01:01.250> lot

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
looks like this it feels like this a lot

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.160 
looks like this it feels like this a lot
like<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.809> feels<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.720> wow<00:01:06.720> it

like this it feels like this wow it

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.929 
like this it feels like this wow it
looks<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.490> we're<00:01:08.700> slick

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
looks like that like we're slick

feels<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.140> office

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
feels like the office

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.290 
feels like the office
so<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.990> cyber<00:01:15.230> level<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.680> well<00:01:16.310> I<00:01:16.790> think<00:01:17.210> a

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
so the cyber level on well I think a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.610 
so the cyber level on well I think a
little<00:01:17.420> ride<00:01:17.600> I'm<00:01:17.780> going<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:17.990> get<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:18.290> my<00:01:18.380> car

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
little ride I'm going to get in my car

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.370 
little ride I'm going to get in my car
and<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.940> can<00:01:20.210> grab<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.780> virtual<00:01:21.140> viewership

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
and I can grab the virtual viewership

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.760 
and I can grab the virtual viewership
and<00:01:21.800> I<00:01:22.430> can<00:01:22.640> shift<00:01:23.270> up<00:01:23.810> through<00:01:24.140> second<00:01:24.590> gear

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
and I can shift up through second gear

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.100 
and I can shift up through second gear
and<00:01:25.550> I<00:01:25.640> can<00:01:25.820> feel<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.450> storm<00:01:26.630> will<00:01:26.840> know<00:01:26.960> they

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
and I can feel the storm will know they

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.130 
and I can feel the storm will know they
feel<00:01:27.320> like<00:01:27.350> in<00:01:27.620> turn<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:28.390> you've<00:01:29.390> got<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
feel like in turn it you've got the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.830 
feel like in turn it you've got the
