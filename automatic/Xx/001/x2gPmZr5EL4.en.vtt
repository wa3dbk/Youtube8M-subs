00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
outside to make it frozen so it was

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.939 
outside to make it frozen so it was
stopped<00:00:20.369> rising<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:21.720> since<00:00:22.590> thinking

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949

now I will onto this I will put my
strobe<00:01:37.770> waffle<00:01:38.159> syrup<00:01:38.340> which<00:01:38.579> has<00:01:38.729> not<00:01:38.850> been

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
strobe waffle syrup which has not been

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.840 
strobe waffle syrup which has not been
boiled<00:01:39.270> today<00:01:40.040> syrupy<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.430> still<00:01:41.670> got

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
boiled today syrupy but it's still got

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
boiled today syrupy but it's still got
all<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.150> same<00:01:42.360> contents<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> I'll<00:01:49.710> spread<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
all the same contents and I'll spread it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.510 
all the same contents and I'll spread it
all<00:01:50.670> over<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.159> doing<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
all over this you see what I'm doing it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.870 
all over this you see what I'm doing it
you<00:01:53.759> can

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.770 

so<00:01:57.880> scream<00:01:58.630> let<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.140> spread<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.920> spread<00:02:00.130> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.679 

this<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:04.960> because<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.700> takes<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:06.969> long<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.270> cook

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
this is because it takes so long to cook

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.850 
this is because it takes so long to cook
each<00:02:07.929> single<00:02:09.390> stroke<00:02:10.390> waffle<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.140> my<00:02:11.620> back<00:02:11.830> is

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
each single stroke waffle and my back is

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.580 
each single stroke waffle and my back is
just<00:02:12.220> not<00:02:12.400> into<00:02:12.670> standing<00:02:13.060> here<00:02:13.379> for<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.410> very

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
just not into standing here for a very

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.380 
just not into standing here for a very
long<00:02:14.860> time

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.780 

okay<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.459> then<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:22.120> will<00:02:23.099> roll<00:02:24.099> it<00:02:24.340> loosely<00:02:25.060> I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
okay so then we will roll it loosely I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.330 
okay so then we will roll it loosely I
want<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.879> rolled<00:02:28.090> loosely<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:28.930> as<00:02:29.230> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
want it rolled loosely so that as it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.089 
want it rolled loosely so that as it
rises<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:31.269> big<00:02:34.410> okay<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.680> have<00:02:35.829> two

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
rises it can get big okay so I have two

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:48.120 
rises it can get big okay so I have two
in<00:02:36.430> there<00:02:38.040> let's<00:02:39.040> make<00:02:39.310> another<00:02:39.459> one<00:02:47.130> it's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
in there let's make another one it's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.030 
in there let's make another one it's
quite<00:02:48.310> frosty<00:02:49.079> but<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.200> will<00:02:50.349> certainly<00:02:50.739> fall

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
quite frosty but it will certainly fall

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.509 
quite frosty but it will certainly fall
in<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.489> oven<00:02:52.090> I've<00:02:53.049> got<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.349> oven<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.860> 350

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
in the oven I've got the oven on to 350

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:38.520 
in the oven I've got the oven on to 350

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
here we will take our stuff again

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.020 
here we will take our stuff again
put<00:03:47.169> some<00:03:47.349> man<00:03:47.500> here

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.430 

now<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.150> course<00:03:52.300> this<00:03:52.540> is<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:52.960> it's<00:03:53.200> too<00:03:53.410> much

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
now of course this is if it's too much

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.740 
now of course this is if it's too much
which<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.010> probably<00:03:54.190> will<00:03:54.340> be<00:03:54.490> it<00:03:55.270> will<00:03:55.510> lose

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
which it probably will be it will lose

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.150 
which it probably will be it will lose
