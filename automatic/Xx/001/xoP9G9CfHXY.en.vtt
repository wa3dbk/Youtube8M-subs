but we present you the back in April was
the<00:00:36.160> final<00:00:36.910> design<00:00:37.120> so<00:00:38.079> what<00:00:38.530> you<00:00:38.649> see<00:00:38.860> behind

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
the final design so what you see behind

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.880 
the final design so what you see behind
me<00:00:39.309> if<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:39.790> look<00:00:40.540> at<00:00:40.690> it<00:00:40.720> with<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.470> both<00:00:41.620> side

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
me if you look at it with the both side

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.390 
me if you look at it with the both side
it's<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.910> final<00:00:43.210> design<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.780> vehicle<00:00:44.559> so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
it's the final design of the vehicle so

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.710 
it's the final design of the vehicle so
is<00:00:45.579> there<00:00:45.730> something<00:00:45.940> which<00:00:46.150> tells<00:00:46.420> me<00:00:46.510> how

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
especially the passive safety like urine

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.459 
especially the passive safety like urine
cup<00:03:25.049> test<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.250> every<00:03:27.000> all<00:03:27.750> our<00:03:28.019> ed

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:28.469 
cup test and so on so every all our ed

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:33.490 
cup test and so on so every all our ed
will<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.519> same<00:03:29.790> rating<00:03:30.629> than<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:33.000> ice

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
will have the same rating than the ice

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.320 
will have the same rating than the ice
equivalent

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.070

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
the standard charge so to take from four

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.990 
the standard charge so to take from four
to<00:03:44.900> eight<00:03:44.930> hour<00:03:45.230> for<00:03:45.650> complete<00:03:46.040> charge<00:03:46.280> that's

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
to eight hour for complete charge that's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.140 
to eight hour for complete charge that's
what<00:03:47.210> we<00:03:47.360> will<00:03:47.540> do<00:03:47.720> at<00:03:47.990> home<00:03:48.170> or<00:03:48.560> at<00:03:49.190> work<00:03:49.250> on

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
the curbside and then we develop to i

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.240 
the curbside and then we develop to i
will<00:03:53.570> say<00:03:53.690> emergency<00:03:54.020> way<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.680> will<00:03:54.980> charge

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
then we have what we put a quick drop of

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.940 
then we have what we put a quick drop of
the<00:04:13.280> battery<00:04:13.610> swap<00:04:13.940> station<00:04:14.440> which<00:04:15.440> basically

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
the battery swap station which basically

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.630 
the battery swap station which basically
swap<00:04:16.940> out<00:04:17.120> your<00:04:17.359> energy<00:04:17.870> battery<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:19.370> three

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
minutes and get back full basket so this

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.480 
minutes and get back full basket so this
is<00:04:22.760> what<00:04:22.970> it's<00:04:23.420> just<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:23.960> refueling<00:04:24.560> just

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
is what it's just like refueling just

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.930 
is what it's just like refueling just
like<00:04:25.670> driving<00:04:25.880> through<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.660> car<00:04:26.960> wash<00:04:27.730> but<00:04:28.730> it's

like driving through a car wash but it's

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.820 
like driving through a car wash but it's
a<00:04:29.060> heavy<00:04:29.390> infrastructure<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.260> install<00:04:30.620> so

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
a heavy infrastructure to install so

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.890 
a heavy infrastructure to install so
maybe<00:04:31.460> that<00:04:31.640> firstly<00:04:32.000> there<00:04:32.210> would<00:04:32.330> be<00:04:32.360> lots

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
maybe that firstly there would be lots

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.040 
maybe that firstly there would be lots
of<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.290> lot<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.680> station<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.610> we<00:04:34.760> will<00:04:35.050> start

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
of a lot of station and we will start

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:45.999 
of a lot of station and we will start
with<00:04:36.140> standard<00:04:36.830> charge<00:04:37.100> on<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.400> beach<00:04:37.700> house
