00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880 

I<00:00:06.020> think<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.080> didn't<00:00:07.350> really<00:00:07.560> realize<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
I think I didn't really realize the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.770 
I think I didn't really realize the
effects<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.670> living<00:00:09.120> without<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.330> hand<00:00:09.570> had

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
effects that living without a hand had

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.440 
effects that living without a hand had
on<00:00:09.929> my<00:00:10.080> life<00:00:10.260> until<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.800> got<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> be<00:00:11.219> Bionic<00:00:11.519> I

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
on my life until I got the be Bionic I

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.360 
on my life until I got the be Bionic I
really<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.620> set<00:00:13.830> myself<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.219> lot<00:00:14.309> of

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
really have set myself a lot of

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.430 
really have set myself a lot of
challenges<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:15.150> life<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.839> now<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> realized

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
challenges in life and now I realized

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.590 
challenges in life and now I realized
that<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.920> don't<00:00:17.430> necessarily<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.570> I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that I don't necessarily have to so I

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.230 
that I don't necessarily have to so I
can<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> hand<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.789> make<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.060> life

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
can have a hand and it can make my life

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.900 
can have a hand and it can make my life
easier<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.890> think<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.189> has<00:00:23.310> stopped<00:00:23.609> me<00:00:23.730> from

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
easier I think it has stopped me from

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880 
easier I think it has stopped me from
doing<00:00:24.000> things<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> love<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.470> having<00:00:25.710> one

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
doing things that I love and having one

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.720 
doing things that I love and having one
hand<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.630> am<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:28.109> active<00:00:28.650> person<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
hand I am a really active person and I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
hand I am a really active person and I
love<00:00:29.880> doing<00:00:30.150> things<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.330> running<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.990> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
love doing things like running and I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.870 
love doing things like running and I
haven't<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.099> been<00:00:32.160> able<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:32.579> anything

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
haven't really been able to do anything

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.670 
haven't really been able to do anything
like<00:00:33.000> cycling<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.750> although<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.530> ride

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
like cycling because although I can ride

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.889 
like cycling because although I can ride
a<00:00:34.710> bike<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.030> good<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.270> my<00:00:36.480> posture

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
a bike it's just not good for my posture

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
a bike it's just not good for my posture
to<00:00:37.050> sit<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.320> bike<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.680> hand<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to sit on a bike with one hand the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
to sit on a bike with one hand the
fitting<00:00:38.969> was<00:00:39.059> an<00:00:39.300> exciting<00:00:39.809> process<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
fitting was an exciting process so I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.260 
fitting was an exciting process so I
went<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.879> had<00:00:42.719> my<00:00:42.960> arm<00:00:43.290> measured<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
went in and had my arm measured so the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.090 
went in and had my arm measured so the
cast<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.690> made<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.079> exactly<00:00:46.500> fitted<00:00:46.890> around

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
cast was made that exactly fitted around

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
cast was made that exactly fitted around
my<00:00:47.250> arm<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.660> then<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> went<00:00:49.050> back<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.260> few<00:00:49.350> weeks

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
my arm and then I went back a few weeks

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.459 
my arm and then I went back a few weeks
later<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.309> detach<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.149> hand<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
later and they detach the hand to the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.930 
later and they detach the hand to the
socket<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.010> they've<00:00:53.219> made<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> was

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
socket that they've made me and I was

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.549 
socket that they've made me and I was
able<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.210> try<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.780> first<00:00:54.989> time<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
able to try out the first time and it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.010 
able to try out the first time and it
just<00:00:55.890> blew<00:00:56.879> my<00:00:57.059> mind<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> could<00:00:57.750> do<00:00:57.899> with

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
just blew my mind what I could do with

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500 
just blew my mind what I could do with
it<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.350> honest<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.520> first<00:00:59.550> fitting<00:01:00.059> was

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it to be honest the first fitting was

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.150 
it to be honest the first fitting was
Nikki<00:01:00.870> went<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.800> well

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
Nikki went really really well

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.870 
Nikki went really really well
Nikki<00:01:03.500> benefits<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:04.739> having<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.339> previous

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
Nikki benefits from having some previous

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.510 
Nikki benefits from having some previous
prosthetic<00:01:06.390> experience<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:08.010> all<00:01:08.159> throughout

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
prosthetic experience but all throughout

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760 
prosthetic experience but all throughout
the<00:01:08.700> fitting<00:01:09.060> process<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.840> run<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.320> smoothly

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the fitting process it run very smoothly

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.730 
the fitting process it run very smoothly
we<00:01:11.670> spent<00:01:12.540> some<00:01:12.720> time<00:01:12.780> together<00:01:13.170> talking

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
we spent some time together talking

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.070 
we spent some time together talking
about<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.610> she<00:01:14.880> expected<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.900> she

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
about what she expected and what she

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.800 
about what she expected and what she
wanted<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> prosthetic<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:18.420> did<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
wanted for a prosthetic and we did the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
wanted for a prosthetic and we did the
initial<00:01:18.990> assessment<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.130> looked<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.759> her

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
initial assessment and looked at her

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.929 
initial assessment and looked at her
capability<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> produce<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:23.250> signals<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
capability to produce the signals to

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.929 
capability to produce the signals to
control<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.479> hand<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.680> moved<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
control the hand and then moved on to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.880 
control the hand and then moved on to
the<00:01:27.119> socket<00:01:27.360> socket<00:01:27.900> fitting<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the socket socket fitting and the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
the socket socket fitting and the
training<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.369> use<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> hand<00:01:30.090> after<00:01:30.990> her

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
training of use with the hand after her

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.999 
training of use with the hand after her
fitting<00:01:31.409> Nikki<00:01:32.280> quickly<00:01:33.590> established<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.740> good

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
fitting Nikki quickly established a good

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.789 
fitting Nikki quickly established a good
pattern<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.729> wear<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> control<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
pattern of wear and I go to control of

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.910 
pattern of wear and I go to control of
the<00:01:37.829> hand<00:01:38.159> she<00:01:39.150> quickly<00:01:39.689> learned<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.350> open<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the hand she quickly learned to open and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.069 
the hand she quickly learned to open and
close<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.340> hand<00:01:41.549> reliably<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.479> different

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
close the hand reliably with different

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.710 
close the hand reliably with different
speeds<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.770> operation<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.600> changing<00:01:45.600> between

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the grips it was very natural to Nikki

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.530 
the grips it was very natural to Nikki
she<00:01:48.810> picked<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.229> very<00:01:49.590> quickly<00:01:50.000> learnt<00:01:51.000> how

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
she picked out very quickly learnt how

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.780 
she picked out very quickly learnt how
to<00:01:51.600> access<00:01:51.960> different<00:01:52.470> grips<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.670> the
