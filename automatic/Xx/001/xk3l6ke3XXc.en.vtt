scan<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.030> they<00:01:50.300> saw<00:01:50.480> that<00:01:50.510> my<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:50.930> know<00:01:51.050> my

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
scan and they saw that my you know my

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.750 
scan and they saw that my you know my
sinuses<00:01:51.890> were<00:01:52.040> basically<00:01:52.310> completely

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
sinuses were basically completely

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.330 
sinuses were basically completely
clogged<00:01:53.120> up<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.540> it's<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.800> chronic<00:01:55.070> sinus

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
clogged up and it's the chronic sinus

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.520 
clogged up and it's the chronic sinus
infection<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:55.820> we<00:01:55.850> have<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.120> go<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.330> there

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
infection so we have to go in there

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.200 
infection so we have to go in there
they're<00:01:57.530> gonna<00:01:57.650> like<00:01:57.860> basically<00:01:58.250> clean<00:01:59.060> it

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
they're gonna like basically clean it

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.350 
they're gonna like basically clean it
out<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.600> also<00:02:00.250> rearrange<00:02:01.250> my<00:02:01.610> septum<00:02:02.060> which

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
out and also rearrange my septum which

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.620 
out and also rearrange my septum which
is<00:02:02.540> like<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.880> basically<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.300> thing<00:02:05.480> in<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
is like a basically the the thing in the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.080 
is like a basically the the thing in the
middle<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.140> your<00:02:06.260> nose<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.650> holds<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:07.100> so

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
middle of your nose that holds it up so

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.749 
middle of your nose that holds it up so
yeah<00:02:08.660> that's<00:02:09.349> going<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.979> probably<00:02:10.310> cause<00:02:10.580> some

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
yeah that's going to probably cause some

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.150 
yeah that's going to probably cause some
pain<00:02:10.970> in<00:02:11.030> recovery<00:02:11.690> yeah<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.590> already<00:02:12.920> have<00:02:13.130> a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
pain in recovery yeah I already have a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.480 
pain in recovery yeah I already have a
bunch<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.520> drugs<00:02:13.820> lined<00:02:14.120> up

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
bunch of drugs lined up

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.940 
bunch of drugs lined up
or<00:02:14.550> my<00:02:14.910> post<00:02:15.180> surgery<00:02:15.480> recovery<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.800> what

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
or my post surgery recovery but what

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.800 
or my post surgery recovery but what
that<00:02:17.070> also<00:02:17.220> means<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.670> i'll<00:02:17.880> probably<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.780> very

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
that also means is i'll probably be very

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.740 
that also means is i'll probably be very
unlikely<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.740> make<00:02:19.890> any<00:02:20.070> videos<00:02:20.220> because<00:02:20.760> what

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
unlikely to make any videos because what

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.210 
unlikely to make any videos because what
i<00:02:21.780> am<00:02:22.140> gonna<00:02:22.320> be<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.560> huge<00:02:22.800> amount<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.040> pain
