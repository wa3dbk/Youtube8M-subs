00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
let's go and start with the regular size

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.569 
let's go and start with the regular size
comparisons<00:00:59.309> here

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
comparisons here

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.470 
comparisons here
so<00:01:00.030> oops<00:01:00.920> got<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.100> full<00:01:02.640> size<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> mini

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
so oops got the full size and the mini

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.450 
so oops got the full size and the mini
grip<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.920> tell<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.250> knife

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
grip here and as you can tell this knife

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
grip here and as you can tell this knife
is<00:01:05.700> shorter<00:01:06.210> than<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.689> actual<00:01:06.990> mini<00:01:07.229> grip

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
is shorter than the actual mini grip

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.500 
is shorter than the actual mini grip
itself<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> pretty<00:01:09.240> small

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
itself so it's a very is a pretty small

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.920 
itself so it's a very is a pretty small
knife<00:01:11.000> hit<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:14.479> see<00:01:15.479> here

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
knife hit these out of the way see here

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.340 
knife hit these out of the way see here
I've<00:01:16.380> got<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.560> couple<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.009> credit<00:01:17.400> cards<00:01:17.430> here

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
I've got a couple of credit cards here

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.570 
I've got a couple of credit cards here
so<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.619> might<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.920> probably<00:01:20.220> need<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so I think I might I probably need to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
so I think I might I probably need to
but<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> looks<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.049> exactly<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> same

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
but it looks like it is exactly the same

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.760 
but it looks like it is exactly the same
length<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.880> two<00:01:24.659> credit<00:01:25.020> cards<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.530> put

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
length as two credit cards I put

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.730 
length as two credit cards I put
side-by-side<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:27.119> each<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.320> for

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
side-by-side to each other and for

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.020 
side-by-side to each other and for
everybody<00:01:28.920> familiar<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> US<00:01:29.820> dollar

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
everybody familiar with the US dollar

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.740 
everybody familiar with the US dollar
here<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.460> there's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:32.750> comparison

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
here it is so there's a good comparison

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.179 
here it is so there's a good comparison
for<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.610> reference<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> size<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> mean<00:01:37.189> alright

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
for you reference of size I mean alright

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.429 
for you reference of size I mean alright
and<00:01:38.490> last<00:01:38.759> preference<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.360> size<00:01:39.540> Paul<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.200> hand

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and last preference of size Paul my hand

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.580 
and last preference of size Paul my hand
so<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:43.020> too<00:01:43.200> big

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so you know not too big

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050
