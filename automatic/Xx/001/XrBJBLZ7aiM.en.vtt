00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you know a lot for a doctor to actually

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.510 
you know a lot for a doctor to actually
pick<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.539> up<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.050> in<00:02:01.170> my<00:02:01.470> situation<00:02:02.009> I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
pick it up but in my situation I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.850 
pick it up but in my situation I
actually<00:02:02.700> saw<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.420> two<00:02:03.929> doctors<00:02:04.380> who<00:02:04.500> thought

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
actually saw and two doctors who thought

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.900 
actually saw and two doctors who thought
the<00:02:04.979> first<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.250> thought<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.550> think<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.789> was

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
the first one thought I think it was

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.700 
the first one thought I think it was
blue<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.600> second<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.289> thought<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.500> had

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
blue and the second one thought I had

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.070 
blue and the second one thought I had
food<00:02:07.979> poisoning<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.300> by<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.600> time<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.869> saw

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
food poisoning and so by the time I saw

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.260 
food poisoning and so by the time I saw
a<00:02:10.110> third<00:02:10.440> doctor<00:02:10.890> had<00:02:11.039> already<00:02:11.220> been<00:02:12.000> quite

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
a third doctor had already been quite

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.809 
a third doctor had already been quite
ill<00:02:12.480> for<00:02:12.870> 24<00:02:13.260> hours<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:13.800> both<00:02:13.980> farmer<00:02:14.370> actually

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
ill for 24 hours so both farmer actually

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.809
