00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.150
 and good morning to all of us today 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.770
 have talked a bit about video games 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.779
 which you all know 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.400
 this character who is a concept 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.160
 Japanese who comes from the company 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.739
 nintendo he revolutionized the first 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.050
 video games so this is anita link with 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.489
 a plumber overalls that runs 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.649
 like a Congolese and that is for 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.989
 have parts and he has to save the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.210
 french sum at dawn really with the 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.660
 face to say they broke down the 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.700
 mouth precisely to create this game reveals 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.260
 another thing too is the ratio in 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.140
 the call of duty 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.450
 what's the use of it ? 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.680
 know how to play and how would you do 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.690
 someone playing on your account 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.880
 finally I want to say if I will have with your 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.880
 ratio while it is super zero to shit 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:12.680
 what are you doing here but no 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.420
 but it died not you play you will 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.549
 fuck my ratio you'll get fired 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.540
 of the team but you are crazy what you 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.120
 ratio is what allows you to grow 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.630
 if it makes you grow up banon you grow 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.010
 not endowed with a shit 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.750
 luckily they did not do that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.869
 in all video games apart in the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.570
 sims has made himself want to pee and 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.040
 poo your game characters not otherwise 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.850
 would really give something 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.320
 weird 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:52.909
 luc formula 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:52.909
 report will still be strong 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.610
 good there are also pokemon games 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.740
 that was good but it was before you 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.710
 make an adventure flows through 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.200
 pokemon it's cool but there was a 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.280
 concern that I discovered anyway and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.510
 which was rather boring 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.489
 it was the edges yeah actually the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.769
 principle is that these borders you 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.450
 could lower them but not the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.760
 back up so you had to do 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.760
 all the way it was boring 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.450
 then came bolloc'h 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.790
 yeah I changed between two because 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.530
 that I had sore throat any good ben 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.569
 it will end so you can 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.430

 disappear
