okay<00:00:00.900> once<00:00:01.110> you<00:00:01.230> have<00:00:01.260> your<00:00:01.439> fabric<00:00:01.800> all

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay once you have your fabric all

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.360 
okay once you have your fabric all
ironed<00:00:03.720> out<00:00:03.870> flat<00:00:04.259> you're<00:00:04.650> going<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.100> go<00:00:05.250> ahead

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
ironed out flat you're going to go ahead

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.179 
ironed out flat you're going to go ahead
and<00:00:05.730> grab<00:00:06.509> your<00:00:06.540> adhesive<00:00:07.259> paper<00:00:07.500> you'll<00:00:08.040> be

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
and grab your adhesive paper you'll be

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.950 
and grab your adhesive paper you'll be
able<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.550> feel<00:00:08.760> which<00:00:08.970> side<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.420> glue<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.809> on

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
able to feel which side the glue is on

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.839 
able to feel which side the glue is on
make<00:00:10.290> sure<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.889> that's<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.340> side<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.580> put

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
make sure that that's the side you put

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.350 
make sure that that's the side you put
the<00:00:11.969> fabric<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.950> never<00:00:13.950> cut<00:00:14.460> out<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.880> shape

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
the fabric on I never cut out the shape

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.060 
the fabric on I never cut out the shape
that<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.630> want<00:00:15.719> until<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> adhesive<00:00:16.800> on

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that I want until I have the adhesive on

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.439 
that I want until I have the adhesive on
because<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.580> much<00:00:17.789> harder<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.090> put<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
because it's much harder to put the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.140 
because it's much harder to put the
adhesive<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:19.050> if<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.380> don't<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.150> flat

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
adhesive on if you don't have a flat

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.880 
adhesive on if you don't have a flat
area<00:00:21.510> covered<00:00:21.960> because<00:00:22.410> you'll<00:00:22.560> end<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:22.769> with

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
area covered because you'll end up with

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.679 
area covered because you'll end up with
adhesive<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.490> over<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:23.820> iron<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:26.449> I'm<00:00:27.449> tee

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
adhesive all over your iron so I'm tee

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.269 
adhesive all over your iron so I'm tee
sit<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:27.960> there<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> best<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.070> all

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
sit on there the best you can so all

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
sit on there the best you can so all
pieces<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.880> better<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.269> overlap<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> little

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
pieces it's better to overlap a little

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.540 
pieces it's better to overlap a little
on<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> fabric<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.099> all<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> glue

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
on the fabric and have all the glue

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.459 
on the fabric and have all the glue
covered<00:00:32.940> than<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.420> try<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> skimp<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
covered than to try to skimp on it I

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.860 
covered than to try to skimp on it I
don't<00:00:37.469> usually<00:00:37.770> cut<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.160> before<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.360> iron<00:00:39.719> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
don't usually cut it before I iron it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
don't usually cut it before I iron it
but<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.110> make<00:00:40.410> sure<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.879> iron<00:00:42.090> does<00:00:42.329> not

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
but I do make sure that my iron does not

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.110 
but I do make sure that my iron does not
go<00:00:42.750> over<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> edges<00:00:43.520> because<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.789> okay<00:00:45.030> at

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
go over the edges because it's okay at

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.190 
go over the edges because it's okay at
the<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.450> edge<00:00:45.660> isn't<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.140> there<00:00:48.140> these<00:00:49.140> are

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the very edge isn't on there these are

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
the very edge isn't on there these are
all<00:00:49.350> scraps<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.039> material<00:00:50.489> anyway<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.149> we

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
all scraps of material anyway so if we

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.510 
all scraps of material anyway so if we
lose<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.840> bit<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> big<00:00:52.590> deal

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.099 

now<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> thicker<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.090> material<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
now the thicker your material is the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.599 
now the thicker your material is the
harder<00:00:58.410> you'll<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> push<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
harder you'll have to push down and the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
harder you'll have to push down and the
longer<00:00:59.969> you'll<00:01:00.149> need<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.480> iron<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
longer you'll need to iron it if you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.869 
longer you'll need to iron it if you
have<00:01:01.440> these<00:01:01.739> aren't<00:01:01.949> too<00:01:02.129> bad<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.730> won't

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
have these aren't too bad so it won't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.850 
have these aren't too bad so it won't
take<00:01:03.090> real<00:01:03.329> long<00:01:09.320> once<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.710> be

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
take real long once you do that be

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.679 
take real long once you do that be
careful<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> touch<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.119> does<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.479> hot

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
careful not to touch it it does get hot

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
careful not to touch it it does get hot
but<00:01:13.680> should<00:01:14.040> stick<00:01:14.689> like<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:17.430> you're

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
but should stick like that and you're

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270 
but should stick like that and you're
going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.850> ahead<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:19.280> take

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
going to go ahead and on the back take

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.770 
going to go ahead and on the back take
your<00:01:20.310> template<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.720> trace<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:26.750> upside<00:01:27.750> down

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
your template and trace it upside down

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
your template and trace it upside down
you<00:01:27.960> want<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> flip<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.100> side<00:01:29.400> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you want to flip it so the side you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.560 
you want to flip it so the side you
colored<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.530> go<00:01:31.530> ahead<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.829> trace<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
colored is down go ahead and trace it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.700 
colored is down go ahead and trace it
might<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> edge<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.560> don't

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
might as well go to the edge so we don't

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.280 
might as well go to the edge so we don't
waste<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.450> because<00:01:36.450> whatever<00:01:36.659> I'll<00:01:36.960> have

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
waste it because whatever I'll have

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
waste it because whatever I'll have
leftover<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.220> stick<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> bag<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
leftover I will stick in a bag and I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
leftover I will stick in a bag and I
have<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> nice<00:01:39.689> big<00:01:39.960> bag<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> applique<00:01:41.130> scraps

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
have a nice big bag of applique scraps

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
have a nice big bag of applique scraps
that<00:01:41.880> already<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.329> adhesive<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> back

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that already have adhesive on the back

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:53.280 
that already have adhesive on the back
that<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.729> grab<00:01:44.729> into<00:01:44.909> whenever<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.420> need<00:01:45.689> to

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.530 

I'm<00:01:54.290> actually<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.800> piece<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.880> I'm<00:01:56.000> using<00:01:56.210> for

the trunk does not have the paper on the
