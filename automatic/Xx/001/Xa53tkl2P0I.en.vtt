finally getting out that Stargate now

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.869 
finally getting out that Stargate now
he's<00:00:49.680> coming<00:00:49.980> down<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> try<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
he's coming down here going to try to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
he's coming down here going to try to
scout<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.750> type<00:00:51.960> B<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.559> able<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
scout but type B is going to be able to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.950 
scout but type B is going to be able to
see<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.340> his<00:00:53.579> circlings<00:00:54.570> even<00:00:54.870> though

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
see this with his circlings even though

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
see this with his circlings even though
serling's<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.590> basically<00:00:56.070> blind<00:00:56.550> they<00:00:57.239> have

serling's are basically blind they have
hardly<00:00:58.020> no<00:00:58.289> vision<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.340> type<00:00:59.550> B<00:00:59.699> will

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
hardly no vision at all so type B will

oh it looks like Baku is yantra sneak
back<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.420> type<00:01:06.780> he<00:01:06.900> sees<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> he's<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
back here type he sees it he's going to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.980 
back here type he sees it he's going to
try<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:09.060> probe<00:01:09.479> I'm<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.869> sure

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
try to take out this probe I'm not sure

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.090 
try to take out this probe I'm not sure
if<00:01:10.080> he's<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.470> able<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> go<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
if he's going to be able to go up and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.060 
if he's going to be able to go up and
block<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:12.030> joke<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:13.200> even<00:01:13.740> sure<00:01:13.920> if

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
block that joke and I'm not even sure if

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.140 
block that joke and I'm not even sure if
he's<00:01:14.189> paying<00:01:14.400> attention<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.820> don't<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.090> he

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
he's paying attention I don't think he

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
he's paying attention I don't think he
was<00:01:15.299> paying<00:01:15.509> attention<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.159> circling

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
was paying attention to the circling

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.390 
was paying attention to the circling
down<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:18.439> so<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.680> looks<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.860> backhoe<00:01:20.130> is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
down there so it looks like backhoe is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.710 
down there so it looks like backhoe is
going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> complete<00:01:21.119> scout<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.630> on

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
going to get the complete scout here on

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.969 
going to get the complete scout here on
the<00:01:21.810> next<00:01:21.990> building<00:01:22.140> coming<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.619> spire

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the next building coming up this spire

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.310 
the next building coming up this spire
coming<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:24.470> for<00:01:25.470> type<00:01:26.189> B<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:27.210> maybe<00:01:27.900> backhoe

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
coming up for type B so maybe backhoe

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.170 
coming up for type B so maybe backhoe
actually<00:01:28.740> assumes<00:01:29.159> muta<00:01:29.579> lyst<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.939> point

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
actually assumes muta lyst at this point

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450 
actually assumes muta lyst at this point
since<00:01:30.329> he<00:01:30.509> did<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.170> third<00:01:31.530> base<00:01:31.770> I'm

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
since he did not see that third base I'm

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.920 
since he did not see that third base I'm
guessing<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> backhoe<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> send

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
guessing that backhoe is going to send

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.450 
guessing that backhoe is going to send
out<00:01:34.079> another<00:01:34.259> couple<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> probes<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.220> try<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
out another couple of probes just try to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.969 
out another couple of probes just try to
look<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.900> third<00:01:37.170> base<00:01:37.380> he<00:01:37.560> wants<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> be

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
look for that third base he wants to be

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
look for that third base he wants to be
sure<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:39.329> third<00:01:39.540> base<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.900> coming<00:01:40.200> up

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
sure if that third base is coming up

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.670 
sure if that third base is coming up
that<00:01:40.590> he<00:01:40.710> scalped<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.689> but<00:01:42.689> dual<00:01:42.960> Stargate

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

that he scalped it but dual Stargate
coming<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.340> backhoe<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
coming up for backhoe and this is

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.569 
coming up for backhoe and this is
scouted<00:01:46.439> by<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> Overlord<00:01:47.430> that

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
scouted by the Overlord that

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.249

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
have a very short life it's going to die

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.639 
have a very short life it's going to die
soon<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.659> did<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> Scout<00:01:52.409> on

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
soon but it did get the Scout on

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490 
soon but it did get the Scout on
everything<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.700> Scouts<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.500> corsair

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
everything here it Scouts the corsair

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
everything here it Scouts the corsair
upgrade<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.490> plus-one<00:01:56.909> attack<00:01:57.030> upgrade<00:01:57.780> for

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
upgrade the plus-one attack upgrade for

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.660 
upgrade the plus-one attack upgrade for
the<00:01:58.049> corsair<00:01:58.500> spending<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.040> cybernetics

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the corsair spending at the cybernetics

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.780 
the corsair spending at the cybernetics
core<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.659> yeah<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.280> corsair

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
core so yeah this is going to be corsair

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.780 
core so yeah this is going to be corsair
river<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:04.229> than<00:02:04.350> likely<00:02:04.590> corsair<00:02:05.430> rebirth

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
river more than likely corsair rebirth

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
don't count the hidden base and I think

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.789 
don't count the hidden base and I think
back<00:02:23.269> o<00:02:23.420> actually<00:02:23.750> assumes<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.590> there's

another base around here right now and

before the Corsair Scouts another base
but<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:33.110> probably<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.680> going<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:33.860> be<00:02:33.980> able<00:02:34.010> to

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
but is probably not going to be able to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.470 
but is probably not going to be able to
do<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.489> course<00:02:34.700> area<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.000> going<00:02:35.090> straight

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
do it the course area is going straight

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.180 
do it the course area is going straight
for<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.720> top<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.140> eventually<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:36.860> coarse

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
for the top and eventually that coarse

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.100 
for the top and eventually that coarse
hair<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.730> see<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.480> base<00:02:38.660> up<00:02:38.930> there

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
hair is going to see the base up there

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.539 
hair is going to see the base up there
maybe<00:02:39.560> be<00:02:39.829> able<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.099> take<00:02:40.250> out<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.459> number

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
maybe be able to take out a number

taken<00:02:43.159> down<00:02:43.310> by<00:02:43.549> scourge<00:02:45.099> but<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.280> good<00:02:46.430> thing

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
taken down by scourge but the good thing

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.490 
taken down by scourge but the good thing
for<00:02:46.760> type<00:02:46.940> B<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.299> he<00:02:47.510> scouted<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.110> double

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
for type B is he scouted the double

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.619 
for type B is he scouted the double
stargate<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:49.670> he's<00:02:49.790> going<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.060> know<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.239> get<00:02:50.569> a

troops at the front they can't fend off

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.089 
troops at the front they can't fend off
against<00:03:26.389> drops<00:03:26.660> very<00:03:26.900> easily<00:03:27.139> so<00:03:27.380> there's<00:03:27.889> a

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
against drops very easily so there's a

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.589 
against drops very easily so there's a
good<00:03:28.310> chance<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:28.790> type<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.120> might<00:03:29.180> try

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
good chance the type you might try

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.379 
good chance the type you might try
another<00:03:29.840> drop<00:03:30.349> here<00:03:30.620> soon<00:03:30.889> but<00:03:31.760> looks<00:03:32.239> like

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
another drop here soon but looks like

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.089 
another drop here soon but looks like
the<00:03:32.900> evolution<00:03:33.349> chamber<00:03:33.470> coming<00:03:33.799> up<00:03:33.859> for<00:03:33.980> type

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
the evolution chamber coming up for type

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.409 
the evolution chamber coming up for type
B<00:03:34.220> he's<00:03:34.400> going<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.609> get<00:03:34.669> us<00:03:34.730> upgrades<00:03:35.120> up<00:03:35.299> for

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
B he's going to get us upgrades up for

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.080 
B he's going to get us upgrades up for
his<00:03:35.510> hydras<00:03:36.040> well<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.069> lot<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.489> course<00:03:37.849> air<00:03:38.000> is

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
his hydras well a lot of course air is

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.970 
his hydras well a lot of course air is
coming<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.450> for<00:03:38.780> backhoe<00:03:39.019> back<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.680> actually

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
coming in for backhoe back is actually

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.229 
coming in for backhoe back is actually
breaking<00:03:40.190> through<00:03:40.489> these<00:03:40.609> hold<00:03:40.819> positions

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
breaking through these hold positions

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.000 
breaking through these hold positions
circlings<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.290> type<00:03:42.500> he<00:03:42.620> wasn't<00:03:42.889> really

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
circlings so type he wasn't really

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.289 
circlings so type he wasn't really
paying<00:03:43.220> attention<00:03:43.370> there<00:03:43.819> but<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.090> lot<00:03:44.150> of

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
paying attention there but a lot of

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.699 
paying attention there but a lot of
those<00:03:44.450> circlings<00:03:44.840> going<00:03:45.019> down<00:03:45.139> I<00:03:45.200> think<00:03:45.349> tight

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
those circlings going down I think tight

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.099 
those circlings going down I think tight
back<00:03:46.669> o<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.940> actually<00:03:47.239> going<00:03:47.389> up<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.870> top

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
back o is actually going up to that top

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.860 
back o is actually going up to that top
base<00:03:48.349> with<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.560> small<00:03:48.919> force<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.599> really<00:03:50.599> that

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
base with a small force and really that

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.349 
base with a small force and really that
that<00:03:51.230> base<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.680> really<00:03:52.130> really<00:03:52.370> far<00:03:52.609> away<00:03:52.760> so

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
that base is really really far away so

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.120 
that base is really really far away so
it's<00:03:53.480> going<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.720> take<00:03:53.810> type<00:03:54.410> me<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.590> long<00:03:54.859> time

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
it's going to take type me a long time

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.640 
it's going to take type me a long time
to<00:03:55.269> run<00:03:56.269> up<00:03:56.359> in<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.599> zerglings<00:03:56.989> enough<00:03:57.379> speed

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
to run up in the zerglings enough speed

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.050 
to run up in the zerglings enough speed
upgrade<00:03:57.980> just<00:03:58.190> circling<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.639> take<00:03:58.790> out<00:03:58.910> that

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
upgrade just circling to take out that

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.599 
upgrade just circling to take out that
troop<00:03:59.359> but<00:04:00.260> looks<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:00.680> backhoe<00:04:01.129> actually

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
troop but looks like backhoe actually

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.039 
troop but looks like backhoe actually
backed<00:04:01.849> off<00:04:02.060> from<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.359> attack<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.810> thought<00:04:02.959> he

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
backed off from that attack I thought he

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.690 
backed off from that attack I thought he
was<00:04:03.200> inching<00:04:03.470> up<00:04:03.590> towards<00:04:03.950> that<00:04:04.099> base<00:04:04.310> but<00:04:04.609> he

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
was inching up towards that base but he

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.869 
was inching up towards that base but he
decided<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.629> fall<00:04:05.840> back<00:04:06.340> defend<00:04:07.340> his<00:04:07.549> front

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
decided to fall back defend his front

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.129 
decided to fall back defend his front
and<00:04:08.090> eventually<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.510> think<00:04:08.720> he's<00:04:08.840> going<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.019> put

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
and eventually I think he's going to put

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.319 
and eventually I think he's going to put
down<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.319> lot<00:04:09.560> more<00:04:09.709> cannons<00:04:10.129> at<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.400> front<00:04:10.730> he

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
down a lot more cannons at this front he

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.229 
down a lot more cannons at this front he
got<00:04:11.510> his<00:04:11.660> robotics<00:04:12.349> facility<00:04:12.470> up<00:04:13.040> I'm<00:04:13.790> sure

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
got his robotics facility up I'm sure

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.909 
got his robotics facility up I'm sure
that<00:04:14.389> robotic<00:04:14.780> support<00:04:15.169> Bay<00:04:15.319> is<00:04:15.500> somewhere

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
that robotic support Bay is somewhere

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.009 
that robotic support Bay is somewhere
it's<00:04:16.190> probably<00:04:16.459> inside<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.940> main<00:04:17.150> right<00:04:17.840> now

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
it's probably inside the main right now

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.610 
it's probably inside the main right now
I<00:04:18.669> was<00:04:19.669> simple<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.209> dune<00:04:20.449> coming<00:04:20.810> up<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.500> this

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
I was simple of a dune coming up so this

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.490 
I was simple of a dune coming up so this
could<00:04:21.769> be<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:22.150> Dark<00:04:23.150> Templar<00:04:23.419> drop<00:04:23.990> strategy

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
could be a Dark Templar drop strategy

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.740 
could be a Dark Templar drop strategy
just<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.219> drop<00:04:25.820> dark<00:04:26.090> templars

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
just to drop dark templars

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.260 
just to drop dark templars
the<00:04:26.810> main<00:04:26.930> oh<00:04:26.960> oh<00:04:27.080> looks<00:04:27.860> like<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.160> type<00:04:29.030> B<00:04:29.180> is

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
the main oh oh looks like the type B is

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.430 
the main oh oh looks like the type B is
trying<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.540> break<00:04:29.630> through<00:04:29.690> here<00:04:29.960> only<00:04:30.110> two

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
trying to break through here only two

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
cannons here for backhoe tobacco's guy

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.120 
cannons here for backhoe tobacco's guy
get<00:04:32.600> some<00:04:32.720> excellent<00:04:33.170> excellent<00:04:33.590> micro<00:04:33.950> here

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130

get some excellent excellent micro here
oh<00:04:34.280> man<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:35.180> backhoe<00:04:35.600> might<00:04:35.840> have

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
oh man a backhoe might have

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.680 
oh man a backhoe might have
underestimated<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.850> amount<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.150> hydras<00:04:38.540> that

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
underestimated the amount of hydras that

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.420 
underestimated the amount of hydras that
will<00:04:38.780> be<00:04:38.930> breaking<00:04:39.110> his<00:04:39.350> front<00:04:39.650> he<00:04:39.980> didn't<00:04:40.280> put

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
will be breaking his front he didn't put

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.250 
will be breaking his front he didn't put
down<00:04:40.610> nearly<00:04:41.120> enough<00:04:41.420> cans<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.870> defend<00:04:42.140> this

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
down nearly enough cans to defend this

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.960 
down nearly enough cans to defend this
but<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.530> Reaver<00:04:42.770> coming<00:04:43.010> in<00:04:43.100> river<00:04:43.670> coming<00:04:43.820> in

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
but the Reaver coming in river coming in

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.580 
but the Reaver coming in river coming in
I'll<00:04:44.120> take<00:04:44.510> me<00:04:44.600> contrast<00:04:44.930> like<00:04:45.230> this<00:04:45.380> river

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
I'll take me contrast like this river

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.440 
I'll take me contrast like this river
before<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.950> first<00:04:46.160> garib<00:04:46.490> comes<00:04:46.790> off<00:04:46.970> the

first garib coming in just the right

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.250 
first garib coming in just the right
time<00:04:49.700> but<00:04:49.940> still<00:04:50.210> that<00:04:50.390> rivers<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:50.870> huge

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
time but still that rivers in huge

trouble taking out measures to take out
two<00:04:53.870> hydras<00:04:54.410> before<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.160> died<00:04:55.370> but<00:04:55.820> yeah<00:04:56.060> this

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
two hydras before it died but yeah this

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.880 
two hydras before it died but yeah this
is<00:04:56.330> not<00:04:56.540> looking<00:04:56.690> good<00:04:56.870> for<00:04:57.020> back<00:04:57.320> oh<00:04:57.500> I<00:04:57.530> think

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
is not looking good for back oh I think

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.920 
is not looking good for back oh I think
type<00:04:58.490> B<00:04:58.640> is<00:04:58.700> doing<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.000> continue<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.630> push

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
type B is doing to continue to push

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.190 
type B is doing to continue to push
hydras<00:05:00.620> in<00:05:00.830> here<00:05:01.130> tight<00:05:01.460> oh<00:05:01.640> man<00:05:02.600> back<00:05:02.960> i<00:05:02.990> was

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
hydras in here tight oh man back i was

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.370 
hydras in here tight oh man back i was
looking<00:05:03.440> at<00:05:03.620> his<00:05:03.919> third<00:05:04.520> loss<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.419> this<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:06.020> so

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
looking at his third loss and this is so

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.110 
looking at his third loss and this is so
I<00:05:06.620> thought<00:05:06.919> backhoe<00:05:07.310> would<00:05:07.490> put<00:05:07.669> up<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.880> much

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
I thought backhoe would put up a much

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.720 
I thought backhoe would put up a much
better<00:05:08.360> fight<00:05:08.690> than<00:05:08.720> this<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.320> mean<00:05:10.100> I<00:05:10.340> know<00:05:10.550> a

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
better fight than this I mean I know a

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.730 
better fight than this I mean I know a
lot<00:05:10.850> of<00:05:10.910> people<00:05:11.000> make<00:05:11.270> fun<00:05:11.480> of<00:05:11.540> back<00:05:11.780> over<00:05:12.050> and

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
lot of people make fun of back over and

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.020 
lot of people make fun of back over and
say<00:05:13.010> that<00:05:13.190> he's<00:05:13.280> not<00:05:13.400> a<00:05:13.460> very<00:05:13.700> good<00:05:13.730> player<00:05:14.000> but

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
say that he's not a very good player but

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.400 
say that he's not a very good player but
actually<00:05:14.510> back<00:05:14.630> was<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:14.870> pretty<00:05:15.050> good<00:05:15.230> player

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
actually back was a pretty good player

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.320 
actually back was a pretty good player
but<00:05:15.440> he's<00:05:15.710> definitely<00:05:15.890> not<00:05:16.130> shown<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.760> in<00:05:16.850> the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
but he's definitely not shown it in the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.150 
but he's definitely not shown it in the
so<00:05:17.510> cell<00:05:17.810> he<00:05:17.990> is<00:05:18.140> going<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.470> lose<00:05:18.650> his<00:05:18.830> natural

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
so cell he is going to lose his natural

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.920 
so cell he is going to lose his natural
expansion<00:05:19.400> here<00:05:19.760> he<00:05:20.000> did<00:05:20.150> not<00:05:20.330> get<00:05:20.570> a<00:05:20.600> third

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
expansion here he did not get a third

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.710 
expansion here he did not get a third
base<00:05:21.290> so<00:05:22.070> this<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.880> second<00:05:23.210> only<00:05:23.330> mining

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
base so this is the second only mining

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.150 
base so this is the second only mining
base<00:05:23.840> he's<00:05:24.080> using<00:05:24.380> all<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.560> his<00:05:24.680> probes<00:05:25.010> at

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
base he's using all of his probes at

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.920 
base he's using all of his probes at
this<00:05:25.280> point<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.610> fight<00:05:25.850> off<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.419> hydras<00:05:26.750> it

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
this point to fight off the hydras it

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.970 
this point to fight off the hydras it
looks<00:05:27.110> like<00:05:27.200> ty<00:05:27.320> he's<00:05:27.500> trying<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.770> go<00:05:27.830> ahead

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
looks like ty he's trying to go ahead

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.570 
looks like ty he's trying to go ahead
snipe<00:05:28.370> another<00:05:28.910> reverb<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.320> that<00:05:31.040> river<00:05:31.340> goes

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
snipe another reverb and that river goes

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.350 
snipe another reverb and that river goes
down<00:05:32.570> before<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:33.260> Scarab<00:05:34.220> even<00:05:34.490> comes<00:05:34.729> off<00:05:35.000> so

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
down before the Scarab even comes off so

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.480 
down before the Scarab even comes off so
