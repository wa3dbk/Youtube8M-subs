welcome back to street fighter 2010 the
final<00:00:06.090> fight<00:00:06.330> into<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.110> update<00:00:07.470> we're<00:00:07.830> gonna

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
final fight into this update we're gonna

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.040 
final fight into this update we're gonna
tackle<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.640> fourth<00:00:09.090> planet<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.720> game

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
tackle that fourth planet of the game

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.799 
tackle that fourth planet of the game
we're<00:00:10.980> now<00:00:11.160> into<00:00:11.370> water<00:00:11.910> world<00:00:12.269> although

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
we're now into water world although

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.360 
we're now into water world although
you're<00:00:13.290> not<00:00:13.320> gonna<00:00:13.650> guess<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:14.219> away

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
you're not gonna guess it right away

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.939 
you're not gonna guess it right away
because<00:00:14.670> water<00:00:15.509> happens<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.289> both<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
because water happens to be both on the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250 
because water happens to be both on the
top<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.699> bottom<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> screen<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.990> are

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
top and the bottom of the screen so are

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.950 
top and the bottom of the screen so are
we<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.949> water<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> heart<00:00:21.090> two<00:00:21.420> layers<00:00:21.660> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
we and water and the heart two layers of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.740 
we and water and the heart two layers of
water<00:00:22.199> or<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.980> entire<00:00:23.760> gravity<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.600> this

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
water or the entire gravity of this

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.870 
water or the entire gravity of this
planet<00:00:25.199> makes<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> water<00:00:26.310> what

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
planet makes it so that the water what

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.490 
planet makes it so that the water what
happens<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> ceiling<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
happens to be on the ceiling and the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.519 
happens to be on the ceiling and the
floor<00:00:29.100> at<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> same<00:00:29.670> time<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:31.260> really

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
floor at the same time I'm not really

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.849 
floor at the same time I'm not really
sure<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.160> works<00:00:33.079> even<00:00:34.079> these<00:00:34.260> frogs<00:00:34.649> are

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
sure how that works even these frogs are

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.349 
sure how that works even these frogs are
confused<00:00:35.370> they<00:00:35.519> don't<00:00:35.670> know<00:00:35.819> where<00:00:35.999> to<00:00:36.030> go

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
confused they don't know where to go

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.529 
confused they don't know where to go
there<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.019> so<00:00:37.260> lost<00:00:37.879> as<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.239> fourth

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
there just so lost as for the fourth

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.360 
there just so lost as for the fourth
planet<00:00:39.719> itself<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.589> probably<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> most

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
planet itself it's probably the most

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.239 
planet itself it's probably the most
serene<00:00:41.850> world<00:00:42.179> of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.539> entire<00:00:42.899> game<00:00:43.319> in<00:00:43.589> fact

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
serene world of the entire game in fact

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.789 
serene world of the entire game in fact
after<00:00:44.489> planet<00:00:45.299> tree<00:00:45.569> this<00:00:45.749> is<00:00:45.809> quite<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.319> drop

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:46.799 
after planet tree this is quite a drop

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:49.189 
after planet tree this is quite a drop
in<00:00:47.010> difficulty<00:00:47.639> I<00:00:47.879> mean<00:00:48.449> just<00:00:48.690> look<00:00:48.839> at<00:00:48.959> this

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
in difficulty I mean just look at this

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.779 
in difficulty I mean just look at this
you're<00:00:49.499> currently<00:00:49.859> fighting<00:00:50.159> in<00:00:50.459> these<00:00:50.639> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you're currently fighting in these on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.699 
you're currently fighting in these on
the<00:00:50.909> purple<00:00:51.299> dimension<00:00:51.869> but<00:00:52.049> they're<00:00:52.589> not

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:52.709 
the purple dimension but they're not

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:56.709 
the purple dimension but they're not
even<00:00:53.069> movie<00:00:53.760> why<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.929> not<00:00:55.229> moving<00:00:55.889> I

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
even movie why are they not moving I

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.059 
even movie why are they not moving I
really<00:00:57.719> don't<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.559> fact<00:00:58.799> this<00:00:59.039> is

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
really don't know and in fact this is

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.789 
really don't know and in fact this is
also<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.819> short<00:01:00.269> planet<00:01:00.719> two<00:01:00.929> I<00:01:00.959> mean<00:01:01.319> with

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
also really short planet two I mean with

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.009 
also really short planet two I mean with
the<00:01:01.920> exception<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.639> the<00:01:02.879> little<00:01:03.600> interlude

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the exception of the little interlude

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.620 
the exception of the little interlude
stage<00:01:04.500> into<00:01:04.859> the<00:01:04.979> purple<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.850> Butte<00:01:06.240> land

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
stage into the purple in the Butte land

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.230 
stage into the purple in the Butte land
stages<00:01:07.289> there<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.829> only<00:01:08.039> three<00:01:08.609> levels<00:01:09.000> into

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
stages there are only three levels into

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.690 
stages there are only three levels into
this<00:01:09.450> whole<00:01:09.689> chapter<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.590> at<00:01:11.070> least<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this whole chapter but at least I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.940 
this whole chapter but at least I
compensated<00:01:12.359> by<00:01:12.630> making<00:01:13.109> the<00:01:13.229> Civil<00:01:13.560> pretty

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
compensated by making the Civil pretty

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.719 
compensated by making the Civil pretty
long<00:01:15.229> we<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.469> live<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.039> yellow<00:01:17.460> submarine

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
long we all live on a yellow submarine

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
long we all live on a yellow submarine
that<00:01:18.329> happens<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.079> turrets<00:01:19.530> shooting

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that happens to have turrets shooting

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
that happens to have turrets shooting
fish<00:01:20.429> at<00:01:20.609> you<00:01:20.789> Han<00:01:21.090> yeah<00:01:21.719> by<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> way<00:01:22.079> you're

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
fish at you Han yeah by the way you're

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
fish at you Han yeah by the way you're
still<00:01:22.530> taking<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> full<00:01:23.189> heart<00:01:23.429> of<00:01:23.609> damage

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
still taking a full heart of damage

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.120 
still taking a full heart of damage
whenever<00:01:24.329> you<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.630> hurt<00:01:24.869> by<00:01:25.079> this<00:01:25.140> never

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
whenever you get hurt by this never

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.999 
whenever you get hurt by this never
underestimate<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.000> power<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.570> fish<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.350> mean

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
underestimate the power of fish I mean

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.080 
underestimate the power of fish I mean
maybe<00:01:29.189> jen<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.969> allergic<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.570> them<00:01:30.899> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
maybe jen is just allergic to them and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
maybe jen is just allergic to them and
by<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.359> are<00:01:33.689> forced<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> finding<00:01:34.679> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
by the way you are forced to finding the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.859 
by the way you are forced to finding the
fishes<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.600> blue

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
fishes because you see the little blue

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.599 
fishes because you see the little blue
ceiling<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> stalactites

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
ceiling with all of the stalactites

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.700 
ceiling with all of the stalactites
hanging<00:01:39.149> on<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> well<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.679> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
hanging on it well it is not a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.099 
hanging on it well it is not a
decoration<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.609> an<00:01:41.880> actual<00:01:42.030> obstacle<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
decoration it's an actual obstacle and

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.349 
decoration it's an actual obstacle and
if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.799> stand<00:01:44.039> on<00:01:44.189> top<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> sub<00:01:44.939> you're

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
if you stand on top of the sub you're

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.160 
if you stand on top of the sub you're
gonna<00:01:45.539> get<00:01:45.719> crush<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:47.569> obviously<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.990> game

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
gonna get crush and obviously the game

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.319 
gonna get crush and obviously the game
is<00:01:49.350> fully<00:01:49.619> aware<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.429> this

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
is fully aware of that because this

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.599 
is fully aware of that because this
submarine<00:01:51.929> will<00:01:52.319> take<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.770> very<00:01:53.100> time<00:01:53.460> in

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
submarine will take it's very time in

by<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.160> ceiling<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.590> novel<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:32.920> pretty

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
by the ceiling so this novel is pretty

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.340 
by the ceiling so this novel is pretty
much<00:02:33.459> about<00:02:33.790> twice<00:02:34.330> as<00:02:34.570> long<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.930> usual

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
much about twice as long as a usual

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.890 
much about twice as long as a usual
level<00:02:35.560> but<00:02:36.280> about<00:02:36.489> half<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.239> challenge<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
level but about half of the challenge I

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.229 
level but about half of the challenge I
mean<00:02:38.440> with<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.890> exception<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.520> going<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.090> that

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
mean with the exception of going to that

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.850 
mean with the exception of going to that
portion<00:02:40.540> where<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.989> ship<00:02:41.230> rocks<00:02:41.530> back<00:02:41.830> and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
portion where the ship rocks back and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
top in order to make it to the other

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.360 
top in order to make it to the other
side<00:02:45.630> tours<00:02:46.630> honestly<00:02:47.590> not<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.800> whole<00:02:48.040> lot<00:02:48.220> of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
side tours honestly not a whole lot of

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.910 
side tours honestly not a whole lot of
hard<00:02:48.610> things<00:02:48.820> about<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.270> little<00:02:49.920> because

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
hard things about this little because

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.650 
hard things about this little because
first<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.250> all<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.610> turrets<00:02:51.820> are<00:02:52.090> really<00:02:52.510> easy

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
first of all the turrets are really easy

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.930 
first of all the turrets are really easy
to<00:02:52.959> kill<00:02:53.230> there's<00:02:53.980> also<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.370> lot<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.700> them

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
to kill there's also a lot of them

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.510 
to kill there's also a lot of them
because<00:02:55.270> they<00:02:55.420> constantly<00:02:55.959> respawn<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.980> they

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
because they constantly respawn and they

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.220 
because they constantly respawn and they
will<00:02:57.670> leave<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.880> lot<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.270> energy<00:02:58.570> pellets

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
will leave a lot of energy pellets

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.470 
will leave a lot of energy pellets
behind<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.890> you're<00:03:00.430> not<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:00.850> any<00:03:01.120> kind<00:03:01.330> of

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
danger to die in this level apart from

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.660 
danger to die in this level apart from
being<00:03:04.120> crushed<00:03:04.540> by<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.780> ceiling<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.670> we

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
being crushed by the ceiling and we

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.340 
being crushed by the ceiling and we
finally<00:03:07.030> have<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.299> deal<00:03:07.480> with<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.780> fish<00:03:08.110> guy

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
finally have to deal with this fish guy

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.680 
finally have to deal with this fish guy
who<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.650> called<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.190> skimmer<00:03:09.580> because<00:03:10.090> just

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
who is called the skimmer because just

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.050 
who is called the skimmer because just

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
has been the hardest thing that we've

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.500 
has been the hardest thing that we've
had<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.709> do<00:03:35.830> into<00:03:36.100> this<00:03:36.190> entire<00:03:36.580> chapter<00:03:37.180> and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
had to do into this entire chapter and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.979 
had to do into this entire chapter and
even<00:03:38.350> then<00:03:38.590> it's<00:03:38.950> not<00:03:39.250> very<00:03:39.640> hard<00:03:39.970> because<00:03:40.209> at

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
even then it's not very hard because at

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.110 
even then it's not very hard because at
Lisa's<00:03:41.530> attack<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:42.010> very<00:03:42.250> easy<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.640> predict

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
Lisa's attack is very easy to predict

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.630 
Lisa's attack is very easy to predict
because<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.750> entire<00:03:44.260> play<00:03:44.590> arena<00:03:44.829> has<00:03:45.190> flat

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
because the entire play arena has flat

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.759 
because the entire play arena has flat
so<00:03:46.060> therefore<00:03:46.510> it's<00:03:46.780> kind<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.260> easy<00:03:47.500> to

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
so therefore it's kind of easy to

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.500 
so therefore it's kind of easy to
predict<00:03:48.130> where<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.400> fireballs<00:03:48.970> will<00:03:49.209> spawn

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
predict where the fireballs will spawn

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.690 
predict where the fireballs will spawn
more<00:03:50.110> so<00:03:50.320> considering<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:51.070> they<00:03:51.340> spawned

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
more so considering that they spawned

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.300 
more so considering that they spawned
pretty<00:03:52.090> slowly

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
pretty slowly

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.550 
pretty slowly
so<00:03:54.310> hats<00:03:54.640> off<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.180> puke<00:03:55.540> city<00:03:55.930> for<00:03:56.140> finally
