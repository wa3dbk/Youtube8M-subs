00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:10.790
 I will prepare bows from here tonight 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.180
 laugh with oars and paprika potatoes 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.419
 very simple quantities of potatoes 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 necessary for your family 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:26.189
 the cut into pieces is like this 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:33.809
 ok more or less then a bit of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:36.980
 salt then put a pinch of one 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.980
 sprinkled with pepper 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.320
 ok 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:51.630
 they must be pretty tasty then a nice one 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.500
 bit of spicy paprika but then there was a 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.850
 wait for chilli pepper 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.890
 teaspoon otherwise I forget and I will 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.220
 touches in the eyes chilli pepper if there 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.210
 you have it in dust and I better have it alone 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 so in big pieces we make it go 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.390
 well the same then to color the whole 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.830
 we put turmeric like a spice 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:22.740
 of which I have known in Greece is 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:27.180
 excellent and will not taste better 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.000
 what else to color to give color 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.630
 now a pinch I shouted to him I have 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.700
 kept with this device for a while 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.710
 we do with fully studied 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 chopped 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.350
 or just very little and then uses 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.040
 just can give 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.229
 a little perfume 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.740
 so as I said before, the first is as if 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.979
 were our saffron because of a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.470
 east to shave their color 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.200
 it seems almost brutal that I ended up but not 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.240
 it has a great smell but it is important that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.489
 now you will see the color of the words 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.590
 when he has massaged everything between 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:16.190
 a beautiful intense yellow then we put a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.190
 nice little oil 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.380
 ok 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.660
 for once you can also overdo it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:32.780
 the last guys in secret is a whole lot 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.780
 of breadcrumbs used to make attack 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.540
 remains attached to potatoes and does so 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.440
 become even more crunchy drained 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.280
 well making sure everything is mixed 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.860
 how much the potato arrived from the outside 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.860
 it was here 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.530
 then if you notice that you prefer 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.230
 put another little bit of paprika for 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.330
 more flavor damage you can do 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.530
 also during cooking 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.480
 ok now just a moment we put a 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.700
 very little else when struggling with the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.350
 dirty hands then added another 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.360
 little paprika because you see the 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:20.080
 color this must be must be 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.740
 beautiful beautiful soaked of this all 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.850
 these spices we're going to bake with 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.600
 grill function for half an hour 200 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.510
 degrees 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.700
 I recommend checking frequently 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.280
 potatoes so that you don't 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.920
 burn and above all put them in the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.840
 lower part of the oven so they have 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.510
 the intense heat that makes them become 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.580
 crunchy on the outside but makes them stay soft 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:52.300
 you these should be ready yes 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.420
 let's see a perfect moment guys yes 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.989
 they are perfect eye today at the time of 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.690
 cooking because time can vary 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.090
 twenty minutes half an hour 35 depending on 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.640
 what you have done great said 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.510
 how many are just like quantity like 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.879
 weight 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.870
 and it also depends a lot on your type of 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.019
 tour 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.320
 keep an eye out anyway and put them with 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.299
 the grill because in the lower part because 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.199
 so they will be well taken care of both under and 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.660
 above will be so then when you are 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.360
 towards the end of the given cooking 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.550
 another sprinkling of breadcrumbs 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.650
 they will remain even more crisp but 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.840
 these are the potatoes ready to be 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.620
 eat to be brought to the table and 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.940
