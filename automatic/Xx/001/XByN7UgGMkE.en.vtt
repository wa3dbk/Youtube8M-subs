lot<00:04:00.620> of<00:04:00.650> people<00:04:00.739> are<00:04:01.069> surprised<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.639> we

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
lot of people are surprised that we

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.699 
lot of people are surprised that we
prefer<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.150> or<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.329> prefer<00:04:02.720> at<00:04:02.870> least<00:04:03.049> but<00:04:03.590> it

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
prefer that or I prefer at least but it

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.610 
prefer that or I prefer at least but it
is<00:04:03.799> what<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.280> what<00:04:04.639> is<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.780> LED<00:04:06.019> options<00:04:06.349> so

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
is what it is what is the LED options so

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.440 
is what it is what is the LED options so
first<00:04:06.859> of<00:04:06.950> all<00:04:07.010> this<00:04:07.129> is<00:04:07.250> off<00:04:07.430> what<00:04:07.940> probably<00:04:08.359> a

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
first of all this is off what probably a

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.869 
first of all this is off what probably a
lot<00:04:08.599> of<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.780> will<00:04:08.930> have<00:04:09.109> at<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.769> beginning<00:04:10.069> if

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
lot of you will have at the beginning if

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.849 
lot of you will have at the beginning if
we<00:04:11.030> turn<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.449> on<00:04:11.569> you<00:04:12.079> get<00:04:12.199> this<00:04:12.290> Knight<00:04:12.560> Rider

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
we turn it on you get this Knight Rider

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.250 
we turn it on you get this Knight Rider
effect<00:04:13.340> which<00:04:13.549> is<00:04:13.669> very<00:04:13.879> cool<00:04:14.150> if<00:04:14.569> we<00:04:14.930> go<00:04:15.079> one

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
effect which is very cool if we go one

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.240 
effect which is very cool if we go one
further<00:04:15.669> then<00:04:16.669> we<00:04:17.449> go<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.079> main<00:04:18.889> bank

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
further then we go to the main bank

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.979 
further then we go to the main bank
which<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:19.789> an<00:04:20.180> interesting<00:04:20.419> arrangement

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
which is an interesting arrangement

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.540 
which is an interesting arrangement
because<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.500> means<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.709> only<00:04:21.919> get<00:04:22.190> really<00:04:22.460> the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
because it means you only get really the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.709 
because it means you only get really the
key<00:04:22.729> to<00:04:22.789> where<00:04:23.000> you're<00:04:23.150> going<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.330> be<00:04:23.390> gaming

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:23.719 
key to where you're going to be gaming

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.870 
key to where you're going to be gaming
again<00:04:23.990> if<00:04:24.289> you<00:04:24.380> turn<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.680> caps<00:04:24.860> look<00:04:25.039> on<00:04:25.159> then

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
again if you turn the caps look on then

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.300 
again if you turn the caps look on then
I'll<00:04:26.030> show<00:04:26.360> up<00:04:26.479> otherwise<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.469> caps<00:04:27.740> lock

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
I'll show up otherwise the caps lock

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.909 
I'll show up otherwise the caps lock
will<00:04:28.370> be<00:04:28.490> not<00:04:29.450> lit<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.960> if<00:04:30.350> we<00:04:30.440> go<00:04:30.560> for<00:04:30.770> full

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
will be not lit and if we go for full

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.190 
will be not lit and if we go for full
bank<00:04:31.160> very<00:04:31.460> nice<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:32.000> then<00:04:32.840> there's

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
bank very nice and then there's

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.500 
bank very nice and then there's
breathing<00:04:33.710> mode<00:04:33.889> then<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.790> final<00:04:35.060> mode<00:04:35.330> is

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
breathing mode then the final mode is

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.350 
breathing mode then the final mode is
this<00:04:36.470> may<00:04:36.650> very<00:04:36.919> interesting<00:04:37.280> mode<00:04:37.400> every

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
this may very interesting mode every

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.270 
this may very interesting mode every
time<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:38.690> touch<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.020> key<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:40.010> will<00:04:40.160> actually

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
time you touch the key it will actually

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.760 
time you touch the key it will actually
light<00:04:40.610> up<00:04:46.210> very<00:04:47.210> interesting<00:04:47.630> sort<00:04:47.900> of<00:04:48.020> trick

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
light up very interesting sort of trick
