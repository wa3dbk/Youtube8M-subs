00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
would have two times one without the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.610 
would have two times one without the
stand<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:26.030> then<00:05:26.210> they<00:05:26.360> could<00:05:26.599> just<00:05:26.960> cut<00:05:27.409> off

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
stand so then they could just cut off

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.360 
stand so then they could just cut off
this<00:05:27.830> back<00:05:28.159> bit<00:05:28.520> here<00:05:28.819> oh<00:05:29.139> and<00:05:30.139> then<00:05:30.409> make<00:05:31.130> the

keys bigger or something or maybe they
could<00:05:34.130> just<00:05:34.310> maybe<00:05:34.490> key<00:05:34.849> spread<00:05:35.270> out<00:05:35.419> more<00:05:35.599> cuz

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900
