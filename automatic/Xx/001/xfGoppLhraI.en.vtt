all right I'm going to do a shoot here

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.090 
all right I'm going to do a shoot here
using<00:00:08.069> my<00:00:08.100> 7d<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.330> 100<00:00:10.080> millimeter<00:00:10.290> macro

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
using my 7d and a 100 millimeter macro

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.000 
using my 7d and a 100 millimeter macro
lens<00:00:11.670> if<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.629> don't<00:00:12.869> have<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.199> macro<00:00:13.770> lens

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
lens if you don't have a macro lens

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.090 
lens if you don't have a macro lens
don't<00:00:14.850> forget<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.570> can<00:00:15.840> do<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.590> lot<00:00:16.770> less

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
don't forget you can do it a lot less

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.890 
don't forget you can do it a lot less
expensively<00:00:17.850> using<00:00:19.340> something<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.640> 500<00:00:21.630> d

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
expensively using something like a 500 d

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.710 
expensively using something like a 500 d
close-up<00:00:22.800> lens<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.640> screws<00:00:24.030> on<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> end

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
close-up lens that screws on to the end

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.480 
close-up lens that screws on to the end
of<00:00:25.020> your<00:00:25.170> zoom<00:00:26.160> lens<00:00:26.520> or<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.110> can<00:00:28.289> use

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
of your zoom lens or you can use

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.760 
of your zoom lens or you can use
extension<00:00:29.490> tubes<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.090> both<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> those<00:00:31.289> items

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
extension tubes and both of those items

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.479 
extension tubes and both of those items
are<00:00:32.329> significantly<00:00:33.500> less<00:00:34.500> expensive<00:00:34.680> than

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
are significantly less expensive than

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.260 
are significantly less expensive than
this<00:00:35.670> 100<00:00:36.360> millimeter<00:00:36.930> macro<00:00:37.200> lens<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.460> this

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
this 100 millimeter macro lens but this

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.380 
this 100 millimeter macro lens but this
will<00:00:39.600> work<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.739> great<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:42.060> if<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> don't

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
will work just great so if you don't

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.540 
will work just great so if you don't
have<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> macro<00:00:42.780> lens<00:00:43.230> check<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.920> extension

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
have a macro lens check on extension

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.690 
have a macro lens check on extension
tubes<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.420> maybe<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.230> 500<00:00:46.829> d<00:00:46.980> close-up<00:00:47.520> lens

water as you can get in the dish
probably<00:01:34.649> I<00:01:35.459> would<00:01:35.999> say<00:01:36.139> at<00:01:37.139> least<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.889> couple

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
probably I would say at least a couple

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.730 
probably I would say at least a couple
of<00:01:38.279> inches<00:01:38.399> if<00:01:38.819> not<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.420> more<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.619> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
of inches if not a little more and I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.419 
of inches if not a little more and I
have<00:01:40.920> two<00:01:41.249> rather<00:01:41.969> large<00:01:42.740> or<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> guess<00:01:44.039> small

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
have two rather large or I guess small

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.339 
have two rather large or I guess small
lights<00:01:45.349> lighting<00:01:46.349> up<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> area<00:01:47.130> I've<00:01:47.700> got<00:01:48.179> my

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
lights lighting up the area I've got my

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.800 
lights lighting up the area I've got my
100<00:01:49.349> millimeter<00:01:49.770> macro<00:01:50.159> lens<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.999> shooting

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
100 millimeter macro lens on shooting

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.109 
100 millimeter macro lens on shooting
with<00:01:52.049> my<00:01:52.079> 7d<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:54.169> got<00:01:55.169> a<00:01:55.200> ball<00:01:55.499> head<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.130> of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
with my 7d and got a ball head and of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.300 
with my 7d and got a ball head and of
course<00:01:57.419> the<00:01:57.599> tripod<00:01:58.109> is<00:01:58.319> able<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:59.130> this

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
course the tripod is able to do this

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.449 
course the tripod is able to do this
which<00:01:59.669> is<00:01:59.700> very<00:01:59.849> nice<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.409> put<00:02:01.950> some<00:02:01.979> cooking

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
which is very nice so I put some cooking

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.419 
which is very nice so I put some cooking
oil<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:02.939> some<00:02:03.149> olive<00:02:03.450> oil<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.929> water<00:02:04.169> and<00:02:04.499> I

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
oil or some olive oil in the water and I

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.739 
oil or some olive oil in the water and I
stirred<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:05.999> a<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.270> bit

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
stirred it up a little bit

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.770 
stirred it up a little bit
waited<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.889> to<00:02:07.919> mellow<00:02:08.610> out<00:02:08.729> slow<00:02:09.599> down

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
waited for it to mellow out slow down

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.980 
waited for it to mellow out slow down
and<00:02:10.020> stop<00:02:10.289> now<00:02:10.679> I'm<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> shoot<00:02:11.280> some

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
and stop now I'm going to shoot some

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:22.059 
and stop now I'm going to shoot some
pictures

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.559 

so<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.219> looking<00:02:23.459> like<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:24.060> stir<00:02:24.420> it

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
so it's looking like I have to stir it

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.500 
so it's looking like I have to stir it
up<00:02:24.659> a<00:02:24.810> little<00:02:24.930> bit<00:02:25.579> from<00:02:26.579> time<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.030> time<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
up a little bit from time to time and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.839 
up a little bit from time to time and
