you how it's really pretty simple so
we'll<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.080> drag<00:01:19.320> passwords<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.369> our<00:01:20.460> trash

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
we'll just drag passwords into our trash

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.240 
we'll just drag passwords into our trash
and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.350> we'll<00:01:22.439> go<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> trash<00:01:22.979> can

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250

secure empty trash now it does take a

secure empty trash now it does take a

lot longer because it instead of just

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
deleting the pointer it has to go in and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.649

over<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> data<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.030> it'll<00:01:48.180> take<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.509> lot

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
over at the data so it'll take a lot

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
over at the data so it'll take a lot
more<00:01:48.689> system<00:01:49.290> resources<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.920> actually<00:01:50.040> delete

this<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.619> comes<00:01:52.799> into<00:01:52.950> play

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
this and that really comes into play

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.520 
this and that really comes into play
when<00:01:53.340> you're<00:01:53.460> deleting<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.329> lot<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.200> let's<00:01:55.380> say

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
when you're deleting a lot but let's say

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920 
when you're deleting a lot but let's say
you<00:01:55.560> forgot<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:57.149> some<00:01:57.390> files<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you forgot to do that for some files and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.149 
you forgot to do that for some files and
you<00:01:58.049> want<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> make<00:01:58.560> sure<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
you want to make sure that that

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.100 
you want to make sure that that
information<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.790> secure<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.689> maybe<00:02:00.899> you're

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
information is secure or maybe you're

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.690 
information is secure or maybe you're
just<00:02:01.140> super<00:02:01.500> paranoid<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.430> want<00:02:02.579> to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
just super paranoid and you want to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.420 
just super paranoid and you want to
overwrite<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> information<00:02:04.170> again<00:02:04.439> just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
overwrite that information again just

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.459 
overwrite that information again just
open<00:02:05.579> up<00:02:05.759> disk<00:02:06.000> utility<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> your<00:02:07.170> hard

race

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.940 
race
and<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.910> want<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.180> erase<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.720> free<00:02:13.960> space<00:02:14.260> now

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and you want to erase the free space now

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.550 
and you want to erase the free space now
what<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.250> will<00:02:15.460> do<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.820> we'll<00:02:16.330> go<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.050> all<00:02:17.320> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
what this will do is we'll go to all the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.550 
what this will do is we'll go to all the
free<00:02:18.100> space<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:19.420> each<00:02:19.630> 0

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
free space that you have and for each 0

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.230 
free space that you have and for each 0
and<00:02:20.800> one<00:02:21.040> that's<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:21.580> hard<00:02:21.760> drive<00:02:21.880> it'll

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
and one that's on your hard drive it'll

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.300 
and one that's on your hard drive it'll
rewrite<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.900> with<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.050> zero<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.100> have

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
rewrite it with a zero so you have

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.530 
rewrite it with a zero so you have
different<00:02:24.430> options<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.030> 0<00:02:25.330> at<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
different options you can 0 at the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.690 
different options you can 0 at the
deleted<00:02:26.020> files<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.620> that's<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.430> quick

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
deleted files and that's the quick

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.330 
deleted files and that's the quick
security<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.330> as<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.960> quick<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.680> writes

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
security and as a and is quick it writes

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.190 
security and as a and is quick it writes
zeros<00:02:30.730> over<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.120> unused<00:02:31.450> space<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.870> your<00:02:31.900> disk

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
zeros over the unused space in your disk

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.770 
zeros over the unused space in your disk
once<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.460> seven<00:02:33.820> pass<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.300> race<00:02:34.600> of

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
once you have a seven pass a race of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.750 
once you have a seven pass a race of
data<00:02:34.960> provides<00:02:35.770> better<00:02:35.950> security<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
data provides better security but it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.430 
data provides better security but it
takes<00:02:36.940> seven<00:02:37.240> times<00:02:37.510> longer<00:02:37.750> than<00:02:37.870> zero<00:02:38.260> out

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
takes seven times longer than zero out

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.830 
takes seven times longer than zero out
it<00:02:39.160> could<00:02:39.460> because<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.880> rewrites<00:02:40.360> all<00:02:40.630> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
it could because it rewrites all the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.370 
it could because it rewrites all the
unused<00:02:41.170> space<00:02:41.440> seven<00:02:42.100> times<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.960> 32<00:02:43.960> passes

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
unused space seven times and 32 passes

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.230 
unused space seven times and 32 passes
essentially<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.950> same<00:02:45.100> thing<00:02:45.430> we'll<00:02:46.090> go<00:02:46.210> over

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
essentially the same thing we'll go over

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.320 
essentially the same thing we'll go over
all<00:02:46.630> your<00:02:46.810> unused<00:02:47.170> space<00:02:47.440> on<00:02:47.620> your<00:02:47.680> volume<00:02:48.330> 35

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
all your unused space on your volume 35

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.680 
all your unused space on your volume 35
times<00:02:49.960> rewriting<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:51.040> random<00:02:51.400> zeros<00:02:51.820> now

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
times rewriting it with random zeros now

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.710 
times rewriting it with random zeros now
basically<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:55.000> most<00:02:55.210> secure<00:02:55.420> you're

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
basically this is the most secure you're

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.390 
basically this is the most secure you're
going<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.900> get<00:02:56.020> 35<00:02:56.590> pass<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.310> going

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
going to get 35 pass but this is going

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.460 
going to get 35 pass but this is going
to<00:02:57.520> take<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.670> really<00:02:58.060> long<00:02:58.090> time<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.230> if<00:02:59.350> you

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
to take a really long time so if you

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.930 
to take a really long time so if you
were<00:02:59.560> going<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.740> be<00:02:59.830> gone<00:02:59.860> for<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.370> weekend<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
were going to be gone for a weekend and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.000 
were going to be gone for a weekend and
you<00:03:01.000> had<00:03:01.180> some<00:03:01.390> really<00:03:01.750> sensitive<00:03:02.320> stuff<00:03:02.800> on

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
you had some really sensitive stuff on

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.790 
you had some really sensitive stuff on
your<00:03:03.130> computer<00:03:03.700> maybe<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.570> do<00:03:04.750> 32<00:03:05.230> pests<00:03:05.680> and

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
your computer maybe you do 32 pests and

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.430 
your computer maybe you do 32 pests and
just<00:03:06.100> let<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.310> grind<00:03:06.700> for<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.180> few<00:03:07.420> days<00:03:07.570> but

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
just let it grind for a few days but

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.230 
just let it grind for a few days but
really<00:03:08.770> for<00:03:08.980> me<00:03:09.160> if<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.730> something<00:03:09.910> really

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
really for me if it's something really

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.880 
really for me if it's something really
important<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.170> go<00:03:11.290> into<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.620> trash<00:03:11.860> and

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
important I just go into the trash and

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.310 
important I just go into the trash and
secure<00:03:12.430> empty<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.910> trash<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.420> every<00:03:14.020> now<00:03:14.140> and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
secure empty the trash and every now and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.350 
secure empty the trash and every now and
then<00:03:14.440> if<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.710> have<00:03:14.890> some<00:03:15.070> time<00:03:15.310> maybe<00:03:15.880> overnight

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
then if I have some time maybe overnight

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.120 
then if I have some time maybe overnight
or<00:03:16.660> whatever<00:03:16.930> I'll<00:03:17.200> let<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.530> zero<00:03:17.860> out<00:03:18.100> the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
or whatever I'll let it zero out the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.460 
or whatever I'll let it zero out the
deleted<00:03:18.670> files<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.570> just<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.230> be<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.380> little

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
deleted files just just to be a little

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.370 
deleted files just just to be a little
bit<00:03:20.800> extra<00:03:20.950> secure<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.780> that's<00:03:22.930> up<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.230> you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
bit extra secure but that's up to you

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.500 
bit extra secure but that's up to you
and<00:03:23.730> depending<00:03:24.730> on<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.880> level<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.180> security

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
and depending on the level of security

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.120 
and depending on the level of security
you<00:03:25.780> need<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.050> have<00:03:26.170> with<00:03:26.320> your<00:03:26.440> data<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:26.980> me<00:03:27.100> I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
you need to have with your data for me I

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.460 
you need to have with your data for me I
mean<00:03:27.370> it's<00:03:27.520> nothing<00:03:27.850> really<00:03:27.880> important<00:03:28.630> that

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
mean it's nothing really important that

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.130 
mean it's nothing really important that
would<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.860> know<00:03:29.950> maybe<00:03:30.190> be<00:03:30.480> my<00:03:31.480> taxes<00:03:32.050> or

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
would you know maybe be my taxes or

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.240 
would you know maybe be my taxes or
something<00:03:32.470> like<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.040> would

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
something like that that you would

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.250 
something like that that you would
definitely<00:03:33.760> want<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.940> keep<00:03:34.180> secure<00:03:34.600> but<00:03:35.110> if

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
definitely want to keep secure but if

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.960 
definitely want to keep secure but if
you<00:03:35.350> do<00:03:35.500> have<00:03:35.800> some<00:03:35.980> really<00:03:36.130> secure<00:03:36.550> stuff<00:03:36.790> on

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
layer of security 0 at the deleted files
