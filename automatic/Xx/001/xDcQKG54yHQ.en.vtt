this evening we are gonna create a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.630 
this evening we are gonna create a
potion<00:00:23.180> for<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.810> mind<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:24.919> I<00:00:24.950> asked<00:00:25.279> my<00:00:25.400> mother

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
potion for the mind so I asked my mother

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.970 
potion for the mind so I asked my mother
mother<00:00:26.560> what<00:00:27.560> shall<00:00:27.829> I<00:00:27.860> eat<00:00:27.950> before<00:00:28.460> final<00:00:29.980> she

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
mother what shall I eat before final she

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.369 
mother what shall I eat before final she
says<00:00:31.250> instead<00:00:32.090> of<00:00:32.150> feet<00:00:32.390> in<00:00:32.510> your<00:00:32.629> face<00:00:32.870> why

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
says instead of feet in your face why

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.479 
says instead of feet in your face why
don't<00:00:33.440> you<00:00:33.559> feed<00:00:33.830> your<00:00:33.980> brain<00:00:34.190> in<00:00:34.400> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
don't you feed your brain in the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.850 
don't you feed your brain in the
classroom<00:00:35.180> I<00:00:35.390> said<00:00:35.660> thank<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:35.930> mother<00:00:36.170> as<00:00:36.589> I

tomato for like broccoli poor digestion
and<00:00:45.050> my<00:00:45.320> least<00:00:45.559> favorite<00:00:46.039> garlic<00:00:46.879> for<00:00:47.510> memory

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
and my least favorite garlic for memory

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.700 
and my least favorite garlic for memory
while<00:00:49.610> this<00:00:49.820> potion<00:00:50.059> settles<00:00:50.690> let's<00:00:51.440> go<00:00:51.649> to

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
while this potion settles let's go to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.950 
while this potion settles let's go to
Professor<00:00:52.070> Goldenberg<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.329> see<00:00:53.629> if<00:00:53.719> we<00:00:53.840> can

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
Professor Goldenberg and see if we can

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.310 
Professor Goldenberg and see if we can
combine<00:00:54.170> fruits<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:54.980> vegetables<00:00:55.719> for<00:00:56.719> if<00:00:57.140> you

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
combine fruits and vegetables for if you

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.840 
combine fruits and vegetables for if you
will

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
will

with Professor Goldenberg he's gonna
explain<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.399> us<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:07.580> we<00:01:07.610> can<00:01:07.700> genetically

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
explain to us if we can genetically

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.340 
explain to us if we can genetically
engineer<00:01:08.660> plants

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
engineer plants

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.680

well<00:01:09.649> Tony<00:01:09.830> we<00:01:10.160> can<00:01:10.490> do<00:01:10.729> crosses<00:01:11.300> between

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
well Tony we can do crosses between

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.200 
well Tony we can do crosses between
different<00:01:12.140> organisms<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:13.039> are<00:01:13.220> sort<00:01:14.119> of

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
different organisms that are sort of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.060 
different organisms that are sort of
related<00:01:14.600> one<00:01:15.170> way<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.470> doing<00:01:15.590> that<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:16.039> to

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
related one way of doing that is to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.969 
related one way of doing that is to
isolate<00:01:16.429> a<00:01:16.850> gene<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:17.390> then<00:01:17.900> put<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.259> into<00:01:18.500> a

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
isolate a gene and then put it into a

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.609 
isolate a gene and then put it into a
vector<00:01:19.790> these<00:01:20.270> vectors<00:01:20.689> are<00:01:20.840> pieces<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.439> DNA

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
vector these vectors are pieces of DNA

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.710 
vector these vectors are pieces of DNA
that<00:01:21.830> can<00:01:22.130> replicate<00:01:22.340> themselves<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.330> once<00:01:23.570> I

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
that can replicate themselves and once I

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.990 
that can replicate themselves and once I
get<00:01:23.869> into<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.500> Agrobacterium<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.670> then<00:01:25.880> it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
get into the Agrobacterium that then it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.840 
get into the Agrobacterium that then it
infects<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.630> plant<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.680> genes<00:01:27.979> are<00:01:28.280> actually

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
infects the plant the genes are actually

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.780 
infects the plant the genes are actually
inserted<00:01:29.570> into<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.110> genome<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.770> then<00:01:31.430> we<00:01:31.579> can

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
inserted into the genome and then we can

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.960 
inserted into the genome and then we can
reproduce<00:01:32.210> those<00:01:32.869> change<00:01:33.350> cells<00:01:34.009> into<00:01:34.759> full

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
reproduce those change cells into full

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.670 
reproduce those change cells into full
plants<00:01:35.479> that<00:01:35.600> will<00:01:35.720> produce<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.259> products

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
plants that will produce the products

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.530 
plants that will produce the products
that<00:01:36.799> we'd<00:01:36.920> like<00:01:37.130> for<00:01:37.460> example<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.970> McIntosh

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
that we'd like for example the McIntosh

Apple<00:01:39.079> is<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.650> result<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.369> single<00:01:40.640> mutation

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
Apple is a result of a single mutation

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.380 
Apple is a result of a single mutation
in<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.869> single<00:01:42.500> plant<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.460> mr.<00:01:43.790> Macintosh's

orchard so could you do a tomato and a

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.999 
orchard so could you do a tomato and a
watermelon<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:47.930> might<00:01:48.290> be<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.530> little<00:01:48.740> bit

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009
