it with process you know less dramatic

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.960 
it with process you know less dramatic
you<00:00:39.449> will<00:00:40.449> bring<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:40.870> back<00:00:41.309> deep<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.610> hear

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
you will bring this back deep to hear

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.620 
you will bring this back deep to hear
you'll<00:00:43.870> end<00:00:44.110> up<00:00:44.260> with<00:00:44.320> 11<00:00:45.190> Cain<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:46.030> one<00:00:46.210> sperm

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
you'll end up with 11 Cain and one sperm

you'll end up with 11 Cain and one sperm
so<00:00:47.079> in<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.320> event<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.770> cane<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
so in the event that the cane the the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.060 
so in the event that the cane the the
major<00:00:49.450> came<00:00:49.810> that<00:00:50.320> this<00:00:50.500> doesn't<00:00:50.710> grow<00:00:51.010> you

unpressed wine it's unused and then as
time<00:01:34.960> goes<00:01:35.200> by<00:01:35.229> you<00:01:35.470> start<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.100> really<00:01:36.700> press

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
time goes by you start to really press

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.170 
time goes by you start to really press
the<00:01:37.240> wine<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.780> as<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:39.189> get<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.549> end<00:01:39.729> just

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
the wine and as you get to the end just

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.570 
the wine and as you get to the end just
kind<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.420> really<00:01:40.659> hammer<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.310> well<00:01:42.310> what

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
kind of really hammer it well what

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.190 
kind of really hammer it well what
happens<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:43.000> done<00:01:43.210> wine<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.689> take<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.020> out<00:01:44.170> of

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
happens is done wine is take it out of

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.469 
happens is done wine is take it out of
the<00:01:44.380> tank<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.369> skins<00:01:45.729> drop<00:01:45.970> down<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.390> the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the tank and the skins drop down to the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.420 
the tank and the skins drop down to the
bottom<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.320> it's<00:01:47.470> separated<00:01:47.950> off<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.310> the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
bottom and so it's separated off of the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.280 
bottom and so it's separated off of the
skin<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.970> skin<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.360> what<00:01:49.509> gives<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.840> red<00:01:50.049> wine

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
skin the skin is what gives the red wine

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.590 
skin the skin is what gives the red wine
color<00:01:50.740> basically<00:01:51.670> grape<00:01:51.880> juice<00:01:52.119> is<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.299> same

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
color basically grape juice is the same

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.630 
color basically grape juice is the same
color<00:01:52.869> white<00:01:53.380> grapes<00:01:53.650> or<00:01:53.860> reg<00:01:54.009> rates

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
color white grapes or reg rates

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.550 
color white grapes or reg rates
same<00:01:54.820> color<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.690> that's<00:01:55.870> why<00:01:56.080> they're<00:01:56.260> left<00:01:56.440> on

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
same color so that's why they're left on

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.469
