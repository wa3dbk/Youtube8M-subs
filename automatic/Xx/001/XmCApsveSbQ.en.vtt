would<00:00:42.280> increase<00:00:42.579> that<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.789> eight<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.059> what

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
would increase that to eight and what

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.779 
would increase that to eight and what
that<00:00:43.539> entices<00:00:44.079> what<00:00:44.590> that<00:00:44.710> includes<00:00:45.039> so<00:00:45.670> we

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
that entices what that includes so we

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.150 
that entices what that includes so we
used<00:00:45.969> to<00:00:46.090> have<00:00:46.239> three<00:00:46.899> basic<00:00:47.230> difficulties<00:00:48.010> on

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.439 
used to have three basic difficulties on
each<00:00:48.280> song<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:48.940> would<00:00:49.090> be<00:00:49.180> three

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
each song and that would be three

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.720 
each song and that would be three
routines<00:00:49.870> we've<00:00:50.800> increased<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.370> eight

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
routines we've increased that to eight

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.369 
routines we've increased that to eight
eight<00:00:52.270> different<00:00:52.570> routines<00:00:52.989> for<00:00:53.170> every

eight different routines for every
single<00:00:53.710> song<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.309> we<00:00:54.340> have<00:00:54.730> four<00:00:55.480> basic

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
single song so we have four basic

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.349 
single song so we have four basic

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
rollout of that so the game comes with

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.140 
rollout of that so the game comes with
ten<00:02:26.060> songs<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:27.380> its<00:02:27.620> core<00:02:27.890> ships<00:02:28.820> with<00:02:28.970> ten
