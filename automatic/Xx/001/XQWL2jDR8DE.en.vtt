a<00:02:02.960> fluke<00:02:03.260> both<00:02:03.740> times<00:02:04.160> I<00:02:04.340> was<00:02:04.369> off<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.729> ice<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
a fluke both times I was off the ice the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.900 
a fluke both times I was off the ice the
second<00:02:05.360> time<00:02:05.479> even<00:02:05.750> more<00:02:05.900> so<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.259> was<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:06.910> I'm

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
second time even more so it was like I'm

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.279 
second time even more so it was like I'm
not<00:02:08.209> ready<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.539> move<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:08.959> with<00:02:09.140> my<00:02:09.170> life

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
not ready to move on with my life

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.110 
not ready to move on with my life
because<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.860> believe<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:10.610> where<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:10.940> meant

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
because I believe this is where I meant

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.670 
because I believe this is where I meant
to<00:02:11.270> be<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.050> what<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.230> was<00:02:12.380> supposed<00:02:12.500> to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
to be and this is what I was supposed to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.740 
to be and this is what I was supposed to
be<00:02:12.740> doing<00:02:13.040> right<00:02:13.190> now<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:14.420> come<00:02:14.600> in

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you land such gorgeous powerful quads in

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.430 
you land such gorgeous powerful quads in
the<00:02:20.239> past<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.810> seem<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:20.989> struggle<00:02:21.230> with

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
the past but you seem to struggle with

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.350 
the past but you seem to struggle with
them<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:21.830> past<00:02:22.040> season<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.120> what<00:02:23.239> do<00:02:23.300> you

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
them this past season so what do you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.790 
them this past season so what do you
think<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.600> cause<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.810> your<00:02:24.080> inconsistency

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
think the cause of your inconsistency

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.000 
think the cause of your inconsistency
was<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.250> past<00:02:25.400> season<00:02:25.640> with<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.060> club<00:02:27.010> house

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
was this past season with the club house

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.560 
was this past season with the club house
fat<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:31.250> team<00:02:31.459> competition<00:02:31.970> at<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> Olympics

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
fat the team competition at the Olympics

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.600 
fat the team competition at the Olympics
i<00:02:32.750> think<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.050> going<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.290> be<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:34.010> great

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
i think is going to be a great

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.930 
i think is going to be a great
opportunity<00:02:35.180> for<00:02:35.860> canada<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.250> win<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.730> gold

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
opportunity for canada to win a gold

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.490 
opportunity for canada to win a gold
medal<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.450> think<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:38.840> definitely<00:02:38.989> possible

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
medal I think it's definitely possible

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.930 
medal I think it's definitely possible
and<00:02:40.330> in<00:02:41.330> terms<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:42.530> world<00:02:43.459> team<00:02:43.700> trophy

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
and in terms of this world team trophy

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.509 
and in terms of this world team trophy
coming<00:02:44.510> up<00:02:44.660> it's<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.769> dry<00:02:46.280> run<00:02:48.519> it's

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
coming up it's it's like a dry run it's

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.910 
coming up it's it's like a dry run it's
that<00:02:49.760> hook<00:02:50.060> at<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.390> end<00:02:50.570> she<00:02:50.959> gets<00:02:51.320> she's<00:02:51.890> a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
that hook at the end she gets she's a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.610 
that hook at the end she gets she's a
really<00:02:52.760> slow<00:02:53.209> rotator<00:02:53.750> in<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.140> air<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.380> terms

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
really slow rotator in the air in terms

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.259 
really slow rotator in the air in terms
of<00:02:54.739> getting<00:02:54.920> into<00:02:55.220> her<00:02:55.430> snap<00:02:55.730> into<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
of getting into her snap into the

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.270 
of getting into her snap into the
position<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:56.989> particularly<00:02:57.830> when<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.100> that

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
position so particularly when it's that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.100 
position so particularly when it's that
second<00:02:58.790> jump<00:02:59.000> she<00:02:59.180> has<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.600> get<00:02:59.720> into<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
second jump she has to get into the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.690 
second jump she has to get into the
rotation<00:03:00.260> quick<00:03:00.799> or<00:03:00.980> her<00:03:01.100> arms<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.549> her<00:03:01.610> legs

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
rotation quick or her arms and her legs

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.000 
rotation quick or her arms and her legs
have<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.299> work<00:03:02.480> together<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:03.260> do<00:03:03.470> think<00:03:03.829> he<00:03:03.890> can

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
have to work together I do think he can

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.530 
have to work together I do think he can
get<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.160> bit<00:03:04.280> out<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.489> control<00:03:04.910> like<00:03:05.180> we<00:03:05.360> saw

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
get a bit out of control like we saw

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.650 
get a bit out of control like we saw
after<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.140> quad<00:03:06.380> he's<00:03:07.190> going<00:03:07.670> into<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.269> Lutz

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
after the quad he's going into that Lutz

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.080 
after the quad he's going into that Lutz
and<00:03:08.930> he<00:03:09.230> doesn't<00:03:09.560> have<00:03:09.590> myself<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.820> cruise

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
and he doesn't have myself the cruise

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.500 
and he doesn't have myself the cruise
ship<00:03:11.829> well<00:03:12.829> yeah<00:03:13.070> because<00:03:13.250> you're<00:03:13.730> soaked<00:03:14.120> and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
ship well yeah because you're soaked and

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.300 
ship well yeah because you're soaked and
he<00:03:15.049> looks<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.380> little<00:03:15.530> out<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.739> control<00:03:15.890> out<00:03:16.160> of

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
he looks a little out of control out of

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.009 
he looks a little out of control out of
the<00:03:16.430> landing<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.030> which<00:03:17.209> is<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.420> problem<00:03:17.750> with

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
the landing and which is a problem with

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.509 
the landing and which is a problem with
the<00:03:18.049> construction<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.920> program<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.400> begin

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
the construction of the program to begin

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.920 
the construction of the program to begin
with

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.000 

I<00:03:22.370> think<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.489> he's<00:03:23.670> not<00:03:23.939> doing<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.450> quad

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
I think if he's not doing the quad

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.410 
I think if he's not doing the quad
consistently<00:03:26.010> before<00:03:26.159> skin<00:03:26.579> America<00:03:27.090> he

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
consistently before skin America he

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.199 
consistently before skin America he
won't<00:03:27.689> be<00:03:27.900> there<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:29.609> think<00:03:29.939> though<00:03:30.180> if

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
won't be there I and I think though if

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.089 
won't be there I and I think though if
he<00:03:30.599> doesn't<00:03:31.019> go<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.109> skate<00:03:31.379> america<00:03:31.469> we<00:03:31.890> won't

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
he doesn't go to skate america we won't

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.440 
he doesn't go to skate america we won't
see<00:03:32.280> him<00:03:32.400> at<00:03:32.489> nationals<00:03:32.849> I<00:03:32.939> really<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.329> it

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
see him at nationals I really think it

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.179 
see him at nationals I really think it
all<00:03:33.569> hinges<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.930> whether<00:03:34.260> or<00:03:34.439> not<00:03:34.560> he<00:03:34.799> shows<00:03:35.010> up

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189 
all hinges on whether or not he shows up

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.459 
all hinges on whether or not he shows up
risk<00:03:35.549> in<00:03:35.700> America<00:03:36.209> with<00:03:36.390> Evans<00:03:36.719> going<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.140> come

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:37.469 
risk in America with Evans going to come

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.589 
risk in America with Evans going to come
back<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.829> go<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.159> Olympics<00:03:38.700> he<00:03:39.420> can

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
back and go to the Olympics he can

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.839 
back and go to the Olympics he can
handle<00:03:39.810> having<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.859> tough<00:03:41.069> competitor<00:03:41.219> at<00:03:41.760> a

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
handle having a tough competitor at a
