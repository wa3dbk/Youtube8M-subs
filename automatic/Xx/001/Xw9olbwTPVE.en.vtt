00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
look that's already getting a bit more

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.770 
look that's already getting a bit more
difficult<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.290> from<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.000> as<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
difficult and I go from here and as you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
difficult and I go from here and as you
can<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.200> things<00:01:13.560> already<00:01:14.130> start<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> get

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
can see things already start to get

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
can see things already start to get
somewhat<00:01:15.960> annoying<00:01:16.460> oops

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
somewhat annoying oops

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.920 
somewhat annoying oops
and<00:01:19.610> there<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.729> go<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> classic

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and there we go this is like the classic

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
and there we go this is like the classic
juicer<00:01:22.560> where<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.159> does<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.759> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
juicer where it just does not want to

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.140 
juicer where it just does not want to
drop<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.159> issue<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.000> can

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
drop into it so the issue which I can

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.910 
drop into it so the issue which I can
see<00:01:27.390> which<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.960> happening<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> fact<00:01:28.829> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
see which is happening is the fact that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520 
see which is happening is the fact that
the<00:01:29.070> touchpad<00:01:29.340> itself<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.450> sensitive<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the touchpad itself is sensitive all the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.370 
the touchpad itself is sensitive all the
way<00:01:31.619> down<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> bottom<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.049> go

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
way down to the bottom so as if I go

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.130 
way down to the bottom so as if I go
along<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.040> still<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.430> left<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.820> right

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
along here I can still go left and right

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.990 
along here I can still go left and right
now<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> must<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.220> having<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.579> sort<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
now it must be having some sort of

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.660 
now it must be having some sort of
conflicts<00:01:42.000> between<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.659> two<00:01:42.869> points<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:44.280> them

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
conflicts between the two points of them

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.289 
conflicts between the two points of them
a<00:01:44.790> touch<00:01:45.290> feature<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.060> try<00:01:48.270> and

click<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.689> drag<00:01:48.869> quite<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.590> jump<00:01:50.070> in

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
click and drag quite a little jump in

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
click and drag quite a little jump in
one<00:01:50.820> location<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> next<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.170> click<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

drag and it's just having a finding out
where<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> thinks<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.180> touch<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.750> this
