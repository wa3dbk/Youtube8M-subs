with the Sport Package

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.220 
with the Sport Package
so<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:35.340> rims<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.880> different<00:00:36.809> than<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
so the rims are different than the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
so the rims are different than the
standard<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.980> came<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.399> car<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.300> I

negative<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.329> these<00:00:42.450> rims<00:00:42.660> are<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.200> are

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
negative to these rims are that they are

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.680 
negative to these rims are that they are
really<00:00:43.649> hard<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> clean<00:00:44.210> because<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.600> to

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
this would is called but it's just this

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.290 
this would is called but it's just this
brown<00:06:01.530> wood<00:06:01.889> trim<00:06:02.220> on<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:02.700> base<00:06:02.849> it<00:06:03.150> looks

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.570 
brown wood trim on the base it looks
really<00:06:03.510> nice<00:06:03.630> but<00:06:04.460> yeah

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.170 

so<00:06:08.210> that's<00:06:08.710> pretty<00:06:09.710> much<00:06:09.860> it<00:06:10.580> I'm<00:06:11.000> going<00:06:11.150> to

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
so that's pretty much it I'm going to

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:23.850 
so that's pretty much it I'm going to
show<00:06:11.390> you<00:06:11.450> guys<00:06:11.660> the<00:06:11.900> engine<00:06:12.260> a<00:06:13.480> 3.0<00:06:14.480> liter<00:06:14.660> v6

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.700 

so<00:06:24.860> this<00:06:25.010> is<00:06:25.130> the<00:06:25.220> engine

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.020 

I<00:06:27.770> believe<00:06:28.250> it<00:06:28.370> puts<00:06:28.520> out<00:06:28.750> 210<00:06:30.430> horsepower<00:06:31.430> I'm

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
I believe it puts out 210 horsepower I'm

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.730 
I believe it puts out 210 horsepower I'm
not<00:06:32.540> really<00:06:32.660> sure<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:33.140> exact<00:06:33.410> numbers

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
not really sure the exact numbers

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.920 
not really sure the exact numbers
actually<00:06:33.920> right<00:06:34.250> now<00:06:34.370> but<00:06:34.640> maybe<00:06:35.540> we<00:06:35.690> can<00:06:35.810> put

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
actually right now but maybe we can put

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.330 
actually right now but maybe we can put
them<00:06:35.990> in<00:06:36.110> the<00:06:36.170> description<00:06:36.440> for<00:06:36.770> you<00:06:36.890> guys<00:06:37.070> I

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.140 
them in the description for you guys I
did<00:06:37.820> make<00:06:38.000> a<00:06:38.030> video<00:06:38.270> showing<00:06:38.990> how<00:06:39.740> to<00:06:40.150> replace

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
did make a video showing how to replace

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.780 
did make a video showing how to replace
your<00:06:41.720> engine<00:06:42.080> air<00:06:42.260> filter<00:06:42.620> so<00:06:43.400> that<00:06:43.520> should<00:06:43.670> be

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
your engine air filter so that should be

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.850 
your engine air filter so that should be
