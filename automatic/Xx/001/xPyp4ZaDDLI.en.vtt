00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.039
 is the perpetrator of the murder 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.430
 I preferred to stay more or less like this 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.859
 how many shots as the victim took the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.660
 third party information where heard 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.060
 shots is talea capsule 380 and when 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 really when the victim was 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.650
 boy you were the first to come here 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.770
 to observe where they reach these 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.930
 more or less negative shots do not have 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.520
 information still because it's searchable 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.009
 so only when he gets here will he have 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.689
 no concrete information so far 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.630
 where they are the only family that attended 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.210
 here even the place was a sister of the victim 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.430
 possible the sister is guide Maria had 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.619
 here a place and passed the information not 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.810
 informed if the victim had problems with 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.229
 drugs or if he was being sworn in 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.530
 death not according to she did not confirm anything 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.850
 about this is not only the recording nor the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.860
 when he was younger and he answered 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.740
 extension and that he worked here 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.390
 in this hardware store and was 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.939
 waiting to work because until 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.070
 then it was closed exact place the faith 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.909

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.229
 police go out to work and find out 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.209
 Who was the author? 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.140
 but it's as we can observe is a lot 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.940
 people and as the corporal said 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.560
 no one arrives with more information 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.560
 concrete is not a cable so that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.200
 help the police unravel this crime 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.200

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.000
