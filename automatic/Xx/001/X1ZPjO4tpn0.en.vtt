change<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.310> clarinet<00:00:06.000> ten<00:00:06.150> o'clock<00:00:06.359> with<00:00:06.990> our

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
change a clarinet ten o'clock with our

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
change a clarinet ten o'clock with our
new<00:00:07.379> tool<00:00:07.770> which<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.250> perfect<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.090> removing

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
new tool which is perfect for removing

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.160 
new tool which is perfect for removing
this<00:00:11.190> barrel<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:11.880> very<00:00:12.210> wobbly<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.929> ten

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
this barrel is very wobbly the ten

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.230 
this barrel is very wobbly the ten
o'clock<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.559> quite<00:00:13.740> loose<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.030> needs

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
o'clock is quite loose so it needs

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.599 
o'clock is quite loose so it needs
changing<00:00:15.330> because<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.109> will<00:00:16.230> leak<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.650> also

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
changing because it will leak and also

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.310 
changing because it will leak and also
as<00:00:17.940> you're<00:00:18.210> playing<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.869> could<00:00:19.050> come<00:00:19.199> apart

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
as you're playing it could come apart

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.800 
as you're playing it could come apart
and<00:00:19.710> then<00:00:19.830> we'll<00:00:19.949> see<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.310> ideal

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
and then we'll see that's not ideal

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.240 
and then we'll see that's not ideal
first<00:00:21.810> thing<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.710> take<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> tool

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
first thing you do is you take the tool

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.300 
first thing you do is you take the tool
you<00:00:24.240> use<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.199> peeler<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> potato

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
you use it like a peeler like a potato

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.750 
you use it like a peeler like a potato
peeler<00:00:26.730> basically<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:28.080> dig<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.890> blade<00:00:29.130> into

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
peeler basically you dig the blade into

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.150 
peeler basically you dig the blade into
the<00:00:30.029> cork<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.050> pull<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.320> around<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the cork and you just pull it around and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:42.600 
the cork and you just pull it around and
it<00:00:32.940> should<00:00:33.149> scrape<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.690> clock<00:00:34.020> away

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.460 

this<00:00:43.180> is<00:00:43.330> probably<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.750> safest<00:00:44.290> way<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.560> do<00:00:44.890> it

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
this is probably the safest way to do it

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.280 
this is probably the safest way to do it
there's<00:00:47.470> almost<00:00:48.280> no<00:00:48.790> chance<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:49.360> catching<00:00:49.810> the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
there's almost no chance of catching the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:01:08.460 
there's almost no chance of catching the
clarinet<00:00:50.740> or<00:00:50.860> your<00:00:51.100> fingers<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.510> it's<00:00:53.070> perfect

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.469 

so<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.560> old<00:01:09.740> quark<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.250> all<00:01:10.400> up<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:11.090> may<00:01:11.240> still

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
so the old quark is all up you may still

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.260 
so the old quark is all up you may still
have<00:01:11.540> some<00:01:11.869> glue<00:01:12.549> if<00:01:13.549> you've<00:01:13.790> got<00:01:14.030> some

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
have some glue if you've got some

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.149 
have some glue if you've got some
lighter<00:01:14.540> fluid<00:01:14.930> that's<00:01:15.320> perfect

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:28.600 

just<00:01:19.159> remove<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.670> old<00:01:19.820> glue<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:28.490> need

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
just remove the old glue so now you need

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.749 
just remove the old glue so now you need
to<00:01:28.759> measure<00:01:28.970> your<00:01:29.090> piece<00:01:29.509> of<00:01:29.630> new<00:01:29.810> cork<00:01:30.759> you

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
to measure your piece of new cork you

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.910 
to measure your piece of new cork you
take<00:01:31.970> your<00:01:32.090> sheet<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:34.869> pencil<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.110> ruler<00:01:36.140> and

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
take your sheet a pencil and a ruler and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.130 
take your sheet a pencil and a ruler and
you<00:01:37.759> measure<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.180> size<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.840> you're<00:01:38.930> going

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
you measure the size that you're going

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:49.370 
you measure the size that you're going
to<00:01:39.229> need<00:01:39.580> usually<00:01:40.580> it's<00:01:40.700> about<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:40.970> centimeter

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.980 

if<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.130> make<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> little<00:01:50.729> line<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.390> both

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
if you make the little line on both

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.620 
if you make the little line on both
sides<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> cork<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.330> know<00:01:54.450> you're

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
sides of the cork and you know you're

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.999 
sides of the cork and you know you're
going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.080> right<00:01:55.259> size<00:01:55.530> and<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:01.860> use

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
going to get the right size and you use

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.700 
going to get the right size and you use
a<00:02:02.040> razor<00:02:02.340> blade<00:02:04.159> being<00:02:05.159> very<00:02:05.430> careful<00:02:06.710> just

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
a razor blade being very careful just

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.440 
a razor blade being very careful just
run<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> along<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> lines<00:02:08.880> you've<00:02:09.209> made

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.120 

so<00:02:15.959> now<00:02:16.050> you've<00:02:16.170> got<00:02:16.230> your<00:02:16.410> piece<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.740> new<00:02:16.860> cork

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
so now you've got your piece of new cork

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.910 
so now you've got your piece of new cork
to<00:02:17.970> wrap<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.330> round<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.140> will<00:02:19.230> need<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.470> bevel

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
to wrap it round you will need to bevel

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.000 
to wrap it round you will need to bevel
one<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> edges<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.319> put<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> neat

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
one of the edges so you just put a neat

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.380 
one of the edges so you just put a neat
little<00:02:23.780> chop<00:02:24.780> down<00:02:25.319> one<00:02:25.650> end<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.270> you've

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
little chop down one end so that you've

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.780 
little chop down one end so that you've
got<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.569> nice<00:02:27.750> wedge<00:02:28.050> shape<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:32.010> now<00:02:32.190> you're

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
got a nice wedge shape so now you're

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.870 
got a nice wedge shape so now you're
ready<00:02:32.819> for<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.120> glue<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:38.069> want<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.430> all<00:02:38.640> on

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
ready for the glue you want it all on

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.550 
ready for the glue you want it all on
the<00:02:39.030> underside<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.140> cork

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the underside of the cork

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.400 
the underside of the cork
quite<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> generous<00:02:41.730> amount<00:02:42.030> seems<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.200> spread

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
quite a generous amount seems to spread

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.590 
quite a generous amount seems to spread
it<00:02:43.620> around<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:46.440> spread<00:02:46.920> with<00:02:46.980> your<00:02:47.220> fingers

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
it around and spread with your fingers

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.110 
it around and spread with your fingers
for<00:02:48.600> an<00:02:49.019> even<00:02:49.739> layer<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.280> too<00:02:50.459> thin<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:53.610> then

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
for an even layer not too thin and then

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.449 
for an even layer not too thin and then
also<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.780> little<00:02:55.080> bit<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.920> bevel<00:02:56.100> that

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
also a little bit just on the bevel that

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.620 
also a little bit just on the bevel that
you<00:02:56.580> may

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.570 

and<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.230> put<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.650> one<00:03:03.740> side<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:04.100> dry<00:03:04.310> it

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
and you put that to one side to dry it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.550 
and you put that to one side to dry it
could<00:03:04.730> take<00:03:04.940> up<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.480> minute<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.990> dry<00:03:06.230> and

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
could take up to a minute to dry and

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.340 
could take up to a minute to dry and
then<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.010> should<00:03:07.250> be<00:03:07.340> good<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.580> go<00:03:07.990> do<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.140> same

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
then it should be good to go do the same

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.820 
then it should be good to go do the same
thing<00:03:09.680> put<00:03:10.070> some<00:03:10.220> glue<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> tenon<00:03:11.830> smooth

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
thing put some glue on the tenon smooth

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.440 
thing put some glue on the tenon smooth
it<00:03:12.950> around<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:19.310> them<00:03:19.490> both<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.120> be<00:03:20.210> touched

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
it around for them both to be touched

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.910 
it around for them both to be touched
dry<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:20.960> should<00:03:20.990> be<00:03:21.200> able<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.410> Pat<00:03:21.650> them<00:03:21.800> with

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
dry you should be able to Pat them with

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.750 
dry you should be able to Pat them with
your<00:03:22.040> fingers<00:03:23.410> okay<00:03:26.020> so<00:03:27.020> to<00:03:27.080> glue<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.280> cork<00:03:28.490> on

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
your fingers okay so to glue the cork on

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.810 
your fingers okay so to glue the cork on
it's<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.840> good<00:03:29.990> idea<00:03:30.110> to<00:03:30.560> get<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:31.310> line<00:03:31.520> with

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
it's a good idea to get it in line with

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.490 
it's a good idea to get it in line with
the<00:03:31.940> speaker<00:03:32.300> key<00:03:32.480> if<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.960> it<00:03:33.110> just<00:03:33.140> looks

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
the speaker key if you can it just looks

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.620 
the speaker key if you can it just looks
quite<00:03:33.800> neat<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:35.210> press<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.800> glue

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
quite neat you press it in to the glue

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.810 
quite neat you press it in to the glue
and<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.930> should<00:03:39.230> secure<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.590> end<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.160> then

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
and that should secure the end and then

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.610 
and that should secure the end and then
it's<00:03:40.940> just<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.210> case<00:03:41.390> of<00:03:41.420> pulling<00:03:42.020> it<00:03:42.200> around

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.369 

and<00:03:49.160> up<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.670> over<00:03:49.790> your<00:03:50.150> level<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.629> that<00:03:51.260> will

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
and up and over your level and that will

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.589 
and up and over your level and that will
create<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.680> nice<00:03:51.920> neat<00:03:52.280> edge<00:03:52.599> that's

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
create the nice neat edge that's

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.820 
create the nice neat edge that's
supposed<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.989> make<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.319> look<00:03:54.500> almost

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
supposed to make it look almost

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.300 
supposed to make it look almost
invisible<00:03:55.099> like<00:03:55.519> there's<00:03:55.700> no<00:03:55.819> edge<00:03:55.970> at<00:03:56.120> all<00:04:00.310> so

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
invisible like there's no edge at all so

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.160 
invisible like there's no edge at all so
if<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.610> get<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:02.030> glue<00:04:02.239> for<00:04:02.510> long<00:04:02.660> enough<00:04:02.900> that

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
if you get the glue for long enough that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.380 
if you get the glue for long enough that
should<00:04:03.379> be<00:04:03.560> perfectly<00:04:04.250> secure<00:04:04.670> now<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.239> ready

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
should be perfectly secure now and ready

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.119 
should be perfectly secure now and ready
to<00:04:05.480> adjust<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:06.470> chop<00:04:06.739> off<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.099> excess

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.000 

now<00:04:13.129> at<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:13.489> stage<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:14.510> barrel<00:04:14.870> won't<00:04:15.860> go<00:04:15.980> on

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
now at this stage the barrel won't go on

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.159 
now at this stage the barrel won't go on
because<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.519> cord<00:04:16.729> is<00:04:16.850> too<00:04:17.030> thick<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:18.019> what

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
because the cord is too thick so what

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.900 
because the cord is too thick so what
you<00:04:18.260> need<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.440> use<00:04:18.739> is<00:04:18.979> this<00:04:19.459> emery<00:04:19.940> paper<00:04:21.910> on

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
you need to use is this emery paper on

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.150 
you need to use is this emery paper on
its<00:04:23.090> fabric<00:04:23.450> strip<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.870> can<00:04:23.930> rip<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.560> just

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
its fabric strip you can rip it to just

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.810 
its fabric strip you can rip it to just
the<00:04:25.220> right<00:04:25.310> width<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:26.360> get<00:04:26.540> round<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:28.310> again

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
the right width to get round and again

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.780 
the right width to get round and again
almost<00:04:29.810> an<00:04:30.110> appealing<00:04:30.560> action<00:04:31.040> just<00:04:31.310> pull<00:04:31.700> it

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
almost an appealing action just pull it

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:52.700 
almost an appealing action just pull it
round

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.430 

okay<00:04:53.610> again<00:04:54.150> keep<00:04:54.449> going<00:04:54.750> as<00:04:54.870> you're<00:04:55.020> testing

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
okay again keep going as you're testing

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.920 
okay again keep going as you're testing
obviously<00:04:56.370> everyone<00:04:56.880> will<00:04:57.360> want<00:04:57.539> their<00:04:57.750> phone

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
obviously everyone will want their phone

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.960 
obviously everyone will want their phone
clocks<00:04:58.259> to<00:04:58.500> be<00:04:58.620> different<00:04:59.039> feel<00:04:59.400> different<00:04:59.430> if

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
clocks to be different feel different if

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.640 
clocks to be different feel different if
you're<00:05:00.090> doing<00:05:00.389> this<00:05:00.660> for<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.960> child<00:05:01.259> it's

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
you're doing this for a child it's

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.140 
you're doing this for a child it's
probably<00:05:02.009> a<00:05:02.039> good<00:05:02.190> idea<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.639> make<00:05:02.789> it<00:05:02.940> quite

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
probably a good idea to make it quite

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.879 
probably a good idea to make it quite
loose<00:05:03.389> but<00:05:03.780> not<00:05:03.960> enough<00:05:04.470> so<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.889> wobbles

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.650 

ideally<00:05:10.889> when<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.370> clock<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.580> dry<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.479> want

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
ideally when the clock is dry you want

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.409 
ideally when the clock is dry you want
the<00:05:13.020> barrel<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:13.710> go<00:05:13.830> on<00:05:13.979> about<00:05:14.669> two-thirds<00:05:15.240> of

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
the barrel to go on about two-thirds of

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.150 
the barrel to go on about two-thirds of
the<00:05:15.479> way<00:05:15.630> so<00:05:16.410> that<00:05:16.440> is<00:05:17.160> perfect<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:19.130> then<00:05:20.130> you

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
the way so that is perfect and then you

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.879 
the way so that is perfect and then you
apply<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.580> cork<00:05:20.940> grease<00:05:24.440> run<00:05:25.440> it<00:05:25.560> round<00:05:25.740> like

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
apply the cork grease run it round like

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.469 
apply the cork grease run it round like
you<00:05:26.220> would<00:05:26.340> usually<00:05:28.160> and<00:05:29.160> then<00:05:29.400> in<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.389> new

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479
