like as you're seeing here this kind of
they're<00:00:12.750> getting<00:00:12.990> 3d<00:00:13.530> models<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
they're getting 3d models and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
they're getting 3d models and
rotoscoping<00:00:15.570> around<00:00:15.900> them<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.320> give<00:00:16.470> this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
rotoscoping around them to give this

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.029

really<00:00:16.920> cool<00:00:17.480> kind<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> cockpit<00:00:18.840> effect<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.010> I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
really cool kind of cockpit effect so I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.790 
really cool kind of cockpit effect so I
thought<00:00:20.460> I'd<00:00:20.550> give<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.850> try<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.740> kind<00:00:22.740> of

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
thought I'd give it a try and kind of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.670 
thought I'd give it a try and kind of
show<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.010> my<00:00:23.250> cheating<00:00:23.789> techniques<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> what

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
show you my cheating techniques so what

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.300 
show you my cheating techniques so what
I<00:00:25.710> did<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.869> build<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.619> really<00:00:28.920> terrible

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
I did was build a really really terrible

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.350 
I did was build a really really terrible
3d<00:00:29.910> model<00:00:30.240> using<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.750> terrible<00:00:31.199> 3d<00:00:31.439> skills<00:00:31.920> I

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
3d model using my terrible 3d skills I

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.120 
3d model using my terrible 3d skills I
can't<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.450> faces<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.350> stole<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.829> head

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
can't do faces so I just stole this head

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.760 
can't do faces so I just stole this head
from<00:00:35.640> somewhere<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.469> slapped<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.680> on

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
from somewhere and just slapped it on

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.369 
from somewhere and just slapped it on
there<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.329> move<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> camera<00:00:39.840> around<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
there and move the camera around in the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.160 
there and move the camera around in the
cockpit<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> bit<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
cockpit a bit like so so with this as a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.889 
cockpit a bit like so so with this as a
guide<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.890> could<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:45.149> my<00:00:45.300> lines<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
guide I could then do my lines over the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.380 
guide I could then do my lines over the
top<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.289> obviously<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.550> most<00:00:47.760> important

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
top of that obviously the most important

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.439 
top of that obviously the most important
thing<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.320> head<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.879> first<00:00:50.879> again

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
thing is to get the head on first again

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.080 
thing is to get the head on first again
you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.809> draw<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.140> face<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.649> because<00:00:53.160> this

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you know draw the face on because this

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
you know draw the face on because this
3d<00:00:54.629> head<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.829> 3d<00:00:56.250> head<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:56.760> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
3d head is a 3d head of a kind of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.410 
3d head is a 3d head of a kind of
realistic<00:00:57.390> looking<00:00:57.600> dude<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.399> I<00:00:59.399> needed<00:00:59.879> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
realistic looking dude and I needed to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.149 
realistic looking dude and I needed to
do<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> anime<00:01:01.289> style<00:01:01.530> head<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:03.920> yeah<00:01:04.920> as

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.969 
do a kind of anime style head so yeah as
you<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> did

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you see here that's kind of what I did

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.539 
you see here that's kind of what I did
it<00:01:08.189> looks<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.610> weird<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> does<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> job

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
it looks really weird but it does a job

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.600 
it looks really weird but it does a job
so<00:01:11.549> yeah<00:01:12.030> next<00:01:12.390> stage<00:01:12.900> was<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.549> I've

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so yeah next stage was to know that I've

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
so yeah next stage was to know that I've
got<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> head<00:01:15.060> done<00:01:15.299> basically<00:01:16.259> inked<00:01:16.590> over

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
got the head done basically inked over

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.490 
got the head done basically inked over
everything<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:18.299> over<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.049> those<00:01:19.200> 3d

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
everything so over all of those 3d

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.130 
everything so over all of those 3d
background<00:01:20.070> bits<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.299> 3d<00:01:21.600> elements

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
background bits all the 3d elements

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.070 
background bits all the 3d elements
which<00:01:23.040> allows<00:01:23.700> me<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> crazy

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
which allows me to do this kind of crazy

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.490 
which allows me to do this kind of crazy
camera<00:01:25.740> angle<00:01:26.159> madness<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.350> would<00:01:28.350> be

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
camera angle madness that would be

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.410 
camera angle madness that would be
really<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:29.100> hard<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.610> impossible<00:01:29.880> for

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
really really hard or impossible for

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.200 
really really hard or impossible for
someone<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> my<00:01:31.140> limited<00:01:31.680> skills<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.030> by

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
someone of my limited skills to do by

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.200 
someone of my limited skills to do by
hand<00:01:33.710> next<00:01:34.710> stage<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> shading<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.970> there

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
hand next stage get the shading in there

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.090 
hand next stage get the shading in there
you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.170> my<00:01:37.200> shading<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.810> um<00:01:39.979> here<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
you know I like my shading so um here it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.429 
you know I like my shading so um here it
is<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.400> shading<00:01:41.759> still<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.869> has<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> purple

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
is with shading still just has a purple

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.190 
is with shading still just has a purple
background<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:44.340> chroma<00:01:45.030> keying<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:46.079> know

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
background for chroma keying you know

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.219 
background for chroma keying you know
the<00:01:46.439> blue<00:01:46.649> screen<00:01:46.979> green<00:01:47.340> screen<00:01:47.670> effect

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
the blue screen green screen effect

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
the blue screen green screen effect
because<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> cockpit<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.130> purple

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
because it's in the cockpit that purple

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.429 
because it's in the cockpit that purple
bit<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> background<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> be

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
bit in the background is going to be

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.010 
bit in the background is going to be
replaced<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.159> screens<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.360> what's<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.840> on

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
replaced with screens of what's going on

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.550 
replaced with screens of what's going on
outside

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
outside

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.510 
outside
so<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.909> did<00:01:57.060> was<00:01:57.360> render<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> separately

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
so what I did was render that separately

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.170 
so what I did was render that separately
as<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:01.250> then<00:02:02.250> composite<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
as you can see here then composite it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.109 
as you can see here then composite it
into<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> final<00:02:04.110> thing<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.619> um<00:02:05.070> stick<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> bit

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
into the final thing at um stick a bit

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.749 
into the final thing at um stick a bit
of<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.299> TV<00:02:06.719> filter<00:02:07.140> effect<00:02:07.469> over<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> top<00:02:08.099> looks

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
of a TV filter effect over the top looks

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.330 
of a TV filter effect over the top looks
pretty<00:02:08.970> decent<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.780> whole

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
pretty decent on the whole

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.619 
pretty decent on the whole
a<00:02:11.370> masterpiece<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.540> it'll<00:02:12.780> do<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.300> what<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> did

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
a masterpiece but it'll do so what I did

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.320 
a masterpiece but it'll do so what I did
then<00:02:16.050> was<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.950> thought<00:02:17.430> hang<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:17.910> let's<00:02:18.090> trying

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
then was I thought hang on let's trying

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.290 
then was I thought hang on let's trying
to<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.480> something<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.810> bit<00:02:18.840> more<00:02:19.230> ambitious<00:02:20.300> it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
to do something a bit more ambitious it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.640 
to do something a bit more ambitious it
failed<00:02:21.780> but<00:02:22.470> let's<00:02:23.099> have<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> look<00:02:23.610> at<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.849> okay

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
failed but let's have a look at it okay

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.390 
failed but let's have a look at it okay
again<00:02:25.790> really<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.090> bad<00:02:27.420> 3d<00:02:28.049> model<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
again really really bad 3d model of the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.500 
again really really bad 3d model of the
interior<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> fighter<00:02:31.260> cockpit<00:02:32.510> same

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
interior of like a fighter cockpit same

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.070 
interior of like a fighter cockpit same
dodgy<00:02:33.930> 3d<00:02:34.290> head<00:02:34.500> as<00:02:34.650> before<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.099> modeled<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:36.080> kind

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
dodgy 3d head as before I modeled a kind

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.130 
dodgy 3d head as before I modeled a kind
of<00:02:37.370> dodgy<00:02:38.370> helmet<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:39.090> stick<00:02:39.299> over<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.660> top

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
of dodgy helmet to stick over the top

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.710 
of dodgy helmet to stick over the top
move<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.530> camera<00:02:40.980> around<00:02:41.390> show<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.569> whole

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
move the camera around show the whole

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.600 
move the camera around show the whole
launch<00:02:43.019> sequence<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.040> kind<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.340> stuff

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
launch sequence all that kind of stuff

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.870 
launch sequence all that kind of stuff
and<00:02:45.260> yeah<00:02:46.260> then<00:02:46.530> basically<00:02:47.160> exactly<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.790> same

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
and yeah then basically exactly the same

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.360 
and yeah then basically exactly the same
thing<00:02:48.209> as<00:02:48.329> before

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
thing as before

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.220 
thing as before
do<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.549> face<00:02:50.760> first<00:02:51.090> which<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.900> what<00:02:52.079> I<00:02:52.110> did

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
do the face first which is what I did

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.500 
do the face first which is what I did
and<00:02:52.739> then<00:02:53.069> I<00:02:53.099> inked<00:02:53.610> over<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.940> rest<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.299> it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
and then I inked over the rest of it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.400 
and then I inked over the rest of it
rose<00:02:54.810> goping<00:02:55.290> over<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.620> 3d<00:02:55.980> model<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
rose goping over the 3d model and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.759 
rose goping over the 3d model and
shading<00:02:58.410> it<00:03:02.810> final<00:03:03.810> phase<00:03:04.079> was<00:03:04.379> obviously

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
shading it final phase was obviously

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.500 
shading it final phase was obviously
adding<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.310> all<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.519> cool<00:03:05.849> stuff<00:03:06.120> like<00:03:06.360> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
adding in all the cool stuff like the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.750 
adding in all the cool stuff like the
glows<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.590> instrument<00:03:08.040> panels<00:03:08.400> inside

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
glows of the instrument panels inside

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.000 
glows of the instrument panels inside
and<00:03:09.030> all<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.209> kind<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.510> stuff<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.319> yeah

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
and all that kind of stuff but yeah

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.300 
and all that kind of stuff but yeah
that's<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.430> basically<00:03:11.640> um<00:03:12.890> really<00:03:13.890> really

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
that's it basically um really really

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.390 
that's it basically um really really
tricky<00:03:14.549> stuff<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.239> rotating<00:03:16.069> 360<00:03:17.069> degrees

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
tricky stuff like rotating 360 degrees

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.979 
tricky stuff like rotating 360 degrees
inside<00:03:17.790> your<00:03:17.910> cockpit<00:03:18.090> while<00:03:18.540> someone's

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
inside your cockpit while someone's

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.140 
inside your cockpit while someone's
heads<00:03:19.230> moving<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.040> they're<00:03:20.579> moving<00:03:20.819> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
heads moving and they're moving the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.240 
heads moving and they're moving the
joysticks<00:03:22.139> around<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.859> doing<00:03:22.980> all<00:03:23.130> this

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
joysticks around and doing all this

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.120 
joysticks around and doing all this
crazy<00:03:23.430> stuff<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:24.720> know<00:03:24.840> we've<00:03:25.260> got<00:03:25.440> 3d<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.010> we

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
crazy stuff you know we've got 3d so we

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.910 
crazy stuff you know we've got 3d so we
may<00:03:26.310> long<00:03:26.549> use<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:27.030> obviously<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:28.109> ultimate

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
may long use it obviously the ultimate

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.129 
may long use it obviously the ultimate
aim<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.239> able<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.420> do<00:03:30.599> this<00:03:30.810> kind<00:03:31.079> of

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
aim is to be able to do this kind of

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.830 
aim is to be able to do this kind of
stuff<00:03:31.410> without<00:03:32.400> any<00:03:32.639> kind<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.060> reference<00:03:33.299> at

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
stuff without any kind of reference at

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.490 
stuff without any kind of reference at
all

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
all

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.970 
all
so<00:03:35.480> that's<00:03:36.480> probably<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.989> next<00:03:37.170> challenge<00:03:37.560> I

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
so that's probably the next challenge I

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.759 
so that's probably the next challenge I
reckon<00:03:38.280> but<00:03:38.459> yeah<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.180> hope<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.169> helped<00:03:40.530> if

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
reckon but yeah I hope it helped if

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.830 
reckon but yeah I hope it helped if
you're<00:03:41.310> animating<00:03:41.910> or<00:03:42.090> if<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.389> just<00:03:42.569> wanna

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
you're animating or if you just wanna

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.280 
you're animating or if you just wanna
see<00:03:43.620> how<00:03:43.829> people<00:03:44.280> with<00:03:44.970> no<00:03:45.419> money<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.900> no

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
see how people with no money and no

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.150 
see how people with no money and no
budget<00:03:47.130> do<00:03:47.519> these<00:03:47.760> things<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.359> don't<00:03:48.569> know

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
budget do these things I don't know

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.730 
budget do these things I don't know
cheerio<00:03:50.160> for<00:03:50.549> now
