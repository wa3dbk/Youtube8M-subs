larvae at all so come in a little pack

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.460 
larvae at all so come in a little pack
here<00:02:28.590> frozen<00:02:29.190> there's<00:02:29.520> tons<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.000> them<00:02:30.180> this

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
here frozen there's tons of them this

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.260 
here frozen there's tons of them this
over<00:02:31.470> here<00:02:31.680> was<00:02:31.890> about<00:02:32.040> five<00:02:32.370> bucks<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:33.090> was

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
over here was about five bucks this was

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.580 
over here was about five bucks this was
a<00:02:33.300> little<00:02:33.510> more<00:02:33.630> expensive<00:02:33.900> since<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.470> is

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
a little more expensive since it is

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.020 
a little more expensive since it is
quite<00:02:34.890> rare<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.430> haven't<00:02:35.760> found<00:02:35.880> it

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
quite rare and I haven't found it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.260 
quite rare and I haven't found it
anywhere<00:02:36.090> else<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:36.990> about<00:02:37.230> six<00:02:37.650> seven<00:02:38.270> but

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
anywhere else was about six seven but

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.520 
anywhere else was about six seven but
hopefully<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.780> worth<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.140> seems<00:02:40.440> really

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
hopefully it's worth it seems really

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.530 
hopefully it's worth it seems really

for<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:56.190> new<00:02:56.400> F<00:02:56.610> tank<00:02:57.150> when<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.450> fill<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:57.870> with

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
for my new F tank when I fill it up with

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.240 
for my new F tank when I fill it up with
little<00:02:58.350> more<00:02:58.470> water<00:02:58.620> I'll<00:02:58.830> be<00:02:58.920> able<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.160> use

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
little more water I'll be able to use

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.150 
little more water I'll be able to use
this<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.700> because<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.420> really<00:03:00.980> disliked<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
this in it because I really disliked the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.370 
this in it because I really disliked the
fact<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:03.320> protein<00:03:04.320> scum<00:03:04.709> develops<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
fact that protein scum develops on the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.720 
fact that protein scum develops on the
top<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.739> water<00:03:07.950> here<00:03:08.160> since<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:08.580> have

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
top of the water here since I don't have

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.360 
top of the water here since I don't have
a<00:03:08.760> filtration<00:03:09.209> device<00:03:09.600> which<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.800> really

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
a filtration device which I really

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.790 
a filtration device which I really
really<00:03:12.300> hate<00:03:12.540> cuz<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.989> looks<00:03:13.019> gross<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.709> the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
really hate cuz it looks gross in the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.259 
really hate cuz it looks gross in the
newts<00:03:14.040> when<00:03:14.280> they<00:03:14.400> get<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.150> water

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
newts when they get out of the water

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.210 
newts when they get out of the water
they<00:03:15.540> get<00:03:15.720> covered<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.320> as<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:16.650> as<00:03:16.860> nasty

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
they get covered in it as just as nasty

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.979 
they get covered in it as just as nasty
that's<00:03:18.150> why<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.360> should<00:03:18.570> always<00:03:18.660> have<00:03:18.930> a

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
that's why you should always have a

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.350 
that's why you should always have a
filter<00:03:19.260> no<00:03:19.650> matter<00:03:19.860> what<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.370> yeah<00:03:21.180> that's

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
filter no matter what and yeah that's

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.670 
filter no matter what and yeah that's
pretty<00:03:21.450> much<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.170> really<00:03:22.440> quick

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
pretty much it just a really quick
