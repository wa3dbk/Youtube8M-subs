00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.120
 i 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.140
 this is an ambitious project executed 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.059
 by the district municipality of chile 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.810
 the project is called construction of the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.390
 road chile to have a boy already 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.920
 it's going to be important for the development 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.260
 from the district of chile since it's going 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.770
 to interconnect with ancash and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.600
 specifically also with the coast and 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.120
 good the average of the trip possibly 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.220
 be shortened in seven and a half hours eight 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.810
 hours from chile to chimbote 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.500
 trujillo 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.910
 is a work that is running this 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.990
 exclusively with canon funds 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.990
 canon miner and sobrecanon 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.130
 on the part financed by the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.900
 district municipality of chile 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.000
 the projection I think it's going to be a year 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.000
 more we are already a year 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.740
 and here I hope we have no problems 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.810
 in eight months to nine months and 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.229
 we are concluding down in the valley of 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.450
 guys that's where the other one is going to get 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.050
 side of the road that comes from 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 conchucos until maya san jose santa y 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.600
 then it will go down to the cashew the project what 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.060
 we have more or less already half that 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.220
 It's about 12 kilometers or so 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.710
 we are satisfied we are happy 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.190
 clear with certain drawbacks like 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.460
 you will see here 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.160
 We have small rules but good 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.450
 thank god thank the people 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.220
 also what is working and what 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.890
 we are going through all that we are 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.310
 here working is exclusively people 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.310
 From Chile 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.260
 the possibilities we are trying to 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.260
 run it 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.870
 with the support and also the good 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.579
 disposition of the tannery community 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.920
 so that your budget is invested in 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.840
 this road I want to emphasize this 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.980
 this is a very important project 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.750
 because it's going to include a whole road network 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.020
 for the improvement of districts and lyon 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.720
 we will be completing in a third or 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.800
 fourth stage already looking for the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.770
 bridge financing 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.940
 then this we are going to do the road in 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.090
 a boat brand and in order that 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.400
 make it more attractive this chile for 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.540
 that the ships visit us and can 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.540
 transit through these places 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.780
 project exclusively in the 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.570
 municipality of chilia we have 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.110
 disagreed with the region on the road 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.510
 interoceanic because the road is 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.820
 in maya so mesh is low to the bridge 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.280
 of many and the bridge of many 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.590
 simply this is a section of 35 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.930
 kilometers that practically not 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.490
 it benefits any community the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.340
 unstable approach that I had to 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.800
 come in front of those places of san 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.180
 JosÃ© de santa have endured me going down 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:49.120
 guys and climb this for a stretch east of 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.090
 chinches pata is busy oxapampa al 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.040
 sector 3 and then turn up until 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.100
 wylie but it has not been done like that 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.030
 we are trying to cure 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.370
 s that lack of good study of 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.590
 engineers but good we are trying 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.180
 to work and hopefully god 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.180
 citizenship and the people in this campaign 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.409
