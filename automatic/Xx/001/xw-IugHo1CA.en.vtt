 using a cutting disc 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.650
 you can use is a pliers of 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.380
 since not everyone has access to 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.049
 a certain cutting disc is from 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 which cuts actually placed is not clear 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.680
