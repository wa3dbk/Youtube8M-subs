so<00:00:30.999> this<00:00:31.029> is<00:00:31.449> my<00:00:31.599> interpretation<00:00:32.380> of<00:00:32.529> some<00:00:32.890> of

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
so this is my interpretation of some of

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.740 
so this is my interpretation of some of
the<00:00:33.040> things<00:00:33.250> that<00:00:33.310> Rick<00:00:33.760> uses<00:00:34.000> a<00:00:34.180> lot<00:00:34.390> in<00:00:34.570> his

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
the things that Rick uses a lot in his

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.599 
the things that Rick uses a lot in his
playing<00:00:34.989> so<00:00:35.200> there's<00:00:35.410> arpeggios<00:00:36.100> economy

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
playing so there's arpeggios economy

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.740 
playing so there's arpeggios economy
picking<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.239> bit<00:00:37.390> legato<00:00:37.780> and<00:00:39.750> alternate

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
picking a bit legato and alternate

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.680 
picking a bit legato and alternate
picking<00:00:40.930> so<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.879> all<00:00:42.969> based<00:00:43.149> around<00:00:43.390> a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
picking so it's all based around a

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.290 
picking so it's all based around a
Dorian<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.320> might<00:00:44.530> also<00:00:44.980> mention<00:00:45.219> my<00:00:45.730> guitar<00:00:46.179> is

note so I'm gonna play from the a minor
arpeggio<00:06:34.130> to<00:06:34.910> the<00:06:35.030> end<00:06:35.180> of<00:06:35.330> it<00:06:35.420> and<00:06:35.540> then<00:06:35.630> I'll

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
arpeggio to the end of it and then I'll

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.860 
arpeggio to the end of it and then I'll
place<00:06:35.990> in<00:06:36.380> its<00:06:36.530> entirety<00:06:37.330> slower<00:06:38.330> speed<00:06:38.660> and

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
place in its entirety slower speed and

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:50.470 
place in its entirety slower speed and
then<00:06:39.020> once<00:06:39.290> more<00:06:39.500> up<00:06:39.710> to<00:06:39.860> speed<00:06:49.270> and<00:06:50.270> therefore

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
then once more up to speed and therefore

00:06:50.480 --> 00:07:19.310 
then once more up to speed and therefore
the<00:06:50.720> beginning

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.500 

so<00:07:20.320> they<00:07:20.440> have<00:07:20.650> it<00:07:20.740> at<00:07:20.860> slow<00:07:21.130> speed<00:07:21.400> and<00:07:21.670> once

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.510 
so they have it at slow speed and once

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:32.730 
so they have it at slow speed and once
more<00:07:22.660> up<00:07:22.810> to<00:07:22.930> speed<00:07:23.140> so<00:07:31.110> they<00:07:32.110> have<00:07:32.350> it's<00:07:32.590> quite

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740 
more up to speed so they have it's quite

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.130 
more up to speed so they have it's quite
a<00:07:32.770> monstrous<00:07:33.280> lick<00:07:33.460> to<00:07:33.580> play<00:07:33.760> and<00:07:34.150> it<00:07:34.420> is

a monstrous lick to play and it is

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.490 
a monstrous lick to play and it is
