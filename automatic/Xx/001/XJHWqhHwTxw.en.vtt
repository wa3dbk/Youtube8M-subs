00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and bills to you know wide so i had to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.340 
and bills to you know wide so i had to
cut<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.830> piece<00:00:47.040> of<00:00:47.100> wood<00:00:47.660> put<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.870> top<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.290> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
shelf as you can see and then I thought

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.899 
shelf as you can see and then I thought
why<00:00:52.409> not<00:00:52.440> make<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.769> diorama<00:00:53.040> so<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.519> just<00:00:53.729> painted

it and then you know I thought what

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.780 
it and then you know I thought what
could<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.299> do<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.720> it<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.019> I<00:00:58.080> painted<00:00:58.290> it<00:00:58.589> and<00:00:58.799> I

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
could I do with it so I painted it and I

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.479 
could I do with it so I painted it and I
just<00:00:59.970> remembered<00:01:00.479> with<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.309> Clone<00:01:02.309> Wars
