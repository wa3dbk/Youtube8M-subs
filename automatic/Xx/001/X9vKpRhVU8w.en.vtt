00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
wanted to get it on paper to make it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.360 
wanted to get it on paper to make it
more<00:01:35.850> formal<00:01:36.480> so<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.860> officially

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
number see the movement the first

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.100 
number see the movement the first
contract<00:01:44.730> was<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.150> one<00:01:45.330> year<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.870> put<00:01:46.080> on

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
contract was for one year it was put on

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.690 
contract was for one year it was put on
a<00:01:46.260> trial<00:01:46.500> basis<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.980> see<00:01:47.160> how<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.370> concept

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
a trial basis to see how the concept

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
a trial basis to see how the concept
works<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.050> first<00:01:49.260> contract<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.950> one

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
works so the first contract was for one

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.370 
works so the first contract was for one
year<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.340> after<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.970> contract<00:01:51.390> expired<00:01:51.840> then

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
year so after that contract expired then

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.810 
year so after that contract expired then
they<00:01:52.530> renew<00:01:52.800> didn't<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.310> contract<00:01:53.670> is
