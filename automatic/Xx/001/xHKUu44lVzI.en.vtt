00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.500

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.260
 I do not get along with cars, I prefer 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.659
 bikes but finally let's see how it is that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.970

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.729

 Let's go there again, at least finish. 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.370
 races mark the option to climb 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.370
 Let me come up here in good company. 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.670
 Now let's see if I can when it arrives. 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:22.209
 there at that time had to put in that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:26.410
 nobody hits her that I fall to the 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.050
 Fucking bitch fucking that boring run 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.400
 I'll stay here until tomorrow again 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.400
 More than I'm bad for damn 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:48.489
 tomorrow we will see what there is to discuss 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:53.890
 no damn, only one can climb up 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:58.350
 good hope you did not now you will focus on 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.350
 put as a checkpoint there at the end 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.240
 is someone should have to already have 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.050
 We got there and we'll see if I can do 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.050
 in this life 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.939
 the Spartan first I'm here 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.650
 guys with two members of my command 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:33.459
 here the Marquinhos and the Spartans minister 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.459
 Queen can not complete the shit 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:43.359
 fall also the guy is not a boring guy 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.359
 but again 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:57.450
 Why do not you go there, why the fuck? 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:04.520
 Oh my God, you have to finish this. 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:09.450
 running with marquinha is special for 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:12.300
 Damn, I'll have to see if I can 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.230
 less complete the race haven 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.880
 average 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.170
 I do not think I fall I arrived I 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.910
 I could get where I got 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.450
 last in this race this will 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.450
 finish her 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.440
 there is more difficult because the staff stay 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:37.600
 people knocking over 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:43.250
 fall alone that the guy also a 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:58.650
 checkpoint only there at the end she saw herself 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:05:01.590
 This is somebody knocking here on ny 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.620
 to tie it fine - that they are very 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.780
 boring wait a little 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.300
 This guy keeps beating the mark. 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.300
 that search of new 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.620
 now I think it's going to be lonely 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.350
 in the vision of joÃ£o 2009 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.820
 so they lose 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.000
 to get it now 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.080
 I'm going to get there fourth because I do not win the 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:03.120
 last is better better than expected 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.340
 Ours did not blow the car there. 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.500
 fourth place galera port is that I went well 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.000
 how difficult because the staff 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.439
 It knocks you down than properly 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.740
 because the difficult phase but for really nice 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:20.349
 this clue that suggested douglas 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.210

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.490

 your first and yes it concludes the race is 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.919
 can you send the most difficult is that you 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.800
 with is knowing what I'm going to try 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.490
 do and I think the race did not end 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.680
