00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.860 
confined space it's going to remind me
very<00:03:10.560> much<00:03:10.860> abrupt<00:03:11.580> we're<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.750> have

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
very much abrupt we're going to have

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.230 
very much abrupt we're going to have
narrow<00:03:13.110> corridors<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.610> also<00:03:14.790> says<00:03:14.970> that

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
narrow corridors and it also says that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.790 
narrow corridors and it also says that
there's<00:03:15.570> going<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.750> be<00:03:15.780> some<00:03:16.020> new<00:03:16.170> weapons<00:03:16.560> and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
there's going to be some new weapons and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.290 
there's going to be some new weapons and
hopefully<00:03:17.220> there<00:03:17.370> will<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.610> some<00:03:17.790> new<00:03:17.940> traps

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
hopefully there will be some new traps

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.720 
hopefully there will be some new traps
or<00:03:18.900> maybe<00:03:19.080> some<00:03:19.320> turret<00:03:19.680> guns<00:03:19.920> because<00:03:20.610> it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
or maybe some turret guns because it

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.220 
or maybe some turret guns because it
actually<00:03:20.850> doesn't<00:03:21.120> say<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:21.630> equippable

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
actually doesn't say like equippable

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.440 
actually doesn't say like equippable
weapons<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.340> what<00:03:23.550> I'm<00:03:23.700> thinking<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:24.239> the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
weapons so what I'm thinking is the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.150 
weapons so what I'm thinking is the
weapons<00:03:24.810> will<00:03:24.930> actually<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.410> kind<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.739> mounted

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
weapons will actually be kind of mounted

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.100 
weapons will actually be kind of mounted
like<00:03:26.340> either<00:03:26.489> mounted<00:03:26.970> machine<00:03:27.150> guns<00:03:27.570> mounted

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
like either mounted machine guns mounted

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.340 
like either mounted machine guns mounted
catapults<00:03:28.980> or<00:03:29.100> something<00:03:29.690> also<00:03:30.690> there<00:03:31.200> might

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
catapults or something also there might

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.680 
catapults or something also there might
be<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.560> sense<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.980> customization<00:03:32.790> obviously<00:03:33.570> we

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
be a sense of customization obviously we

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.320 
be a sense of customization obviously we
have<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> sliquifier<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.800> die<00:03:35.400> rise<00:03:35.670> maybe

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
have the sliquifier in die rise maybe

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.990 
have the sliquifier in die rise maybe
you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.660> pick<00:03:36.870> up<00:03:37.019> items<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.340> alcatraz

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you can pick up items in this alcatraz

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.640 
you can pick up items in this alcatraz
prison<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.660> put<00:03:39.989> them<00:03:40.140> together<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.530> make

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
prison and put them together to make

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.570 
prison and put them together to make
stuff<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:42.120> will<00:03:42.330> obviously<00:03:43.370> come<00:03:44.370> with

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
stuff and this will obviously come with

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.520 
stuff and this will obviously come with
some<00:03:44.820> really<00:03:45.180> really<00:03:45.360> good<00:03:45.570> ideas<00:03:45.989> i<00:03:46.170> can<00:03:46.350> see

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
some really really good ideas i can see

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.440 
some really really good ideas i can see
that<00:03:46.560> tracker<00:03:46.920> put<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> lot<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.519> time<00:03:48.300> and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
that tracker put a lot of time and

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.509 
that tracker put a lot of time and
effort<00:03:48.570> into<00:03:48.989> this<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.560> i<00:03:49.769> think<00:03:50.010> it's<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.310> very

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
effort into this and i think it's a very

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.550 
effort into this and i think it's a very
very<00:03:50.580> good<00:03:50.880> idea<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.750> definitely<00:03:52.050> wasn't<00:03:52.200> what

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
very good idea it definitely wasn't what

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.710 
very good idea it definitely wasn't what
we<00:03:52.680> were<00:03:52.769> thinking<00:03:52.800> but<00:03:53.610> uh<00:03:53.670> hopefully<00:03:54.239> mob<00:03:54.630> of

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
we were thinking but uh hopefully mob of
