00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
two outfits and then I've just used LP

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.670 
two outfits and then I've just used LP
points<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:11.290> try<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.350> get<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.680> rest

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
points and try to get the rest

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.050 
points and try to get the rest
so<00:02:14.519> say<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.900> press<00:02:16.189> the<00:02:17.189> bottom<00:02:17.459> line<00:02:17.640> number

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so say you press the bottom line number

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.990 
so say you press the bottom line number
six<00:02:18.299> oh<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.950> sure<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:20.220> want<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> use<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.640> LP

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
six oh you sure you want to use the LP

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000 
six oh you sure you want to use the LP
points<00:02:21.420> oh<00:02:21.569> yes<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.680> only<00:02:22.769> pick

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
points oh yes so it can only pick

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.789 
points oh yes so it can only pick
between<00:02:23.129> those<00:02:23.400> three<00:02:24.079> so<00:02:25.079> it's<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> higher

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
between those three so it's a higher

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.740 
between those three so it's a higher
chance<00:02:26.099> but<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:26.549> obviously<00:02:26.700> sometimes<00:02:27.209> it

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
chance but then obviously sometimes it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.050 
chance but then obviously sometimes it
will<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.129> pick<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.280> same<00:02:29.489> thing<00:02:29.730> over<00:02:29.909> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
will just pick the same thing over and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.190 
will just pick the same thing over and
over<00:02:30.180> again<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.659> you'll<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:30.959> end<00:02:31.170> up

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
over again and you'll just end up

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.550 
over again and you'll just end up

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
wouldn't say doing this way because I've

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.729 
wouldn't say doing this way because I've
wasted<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:21.180> lot<00:03:21.419> of<00:03:21.480> Opie's<00:03:21.900> doing<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.379> but<00:03:22.799> I

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
wasted a lot of Opie's doing this but I

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.050 
wasted a lot of Opie's doing this but I
could<00:03:25.739> astley<00:03:26.010> couldn't<00:03:26.280> wait<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.459> plus<00:03:26.849> I

could astley couldn't wait and plus I

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.229 
could astley couldn't wait and plus I
think<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.540> actual<00:03:27.629> quest<00:03:27.959> has<00:03:28.109> got<00:03:28.319> a

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
think the actual quest has got a

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.580 
think the actual quest has got a
five-day<00:03:30.239> limit<00:03:30.569> well<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:30.870> had<00:03:31.019> originally<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
five-day limit well we had originally a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:40.610 
five-day limit well we had originally a
six<00:03:31.889> day<00:03:32.069> limit<00:03:32.400> on<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:39.049> ok<00:03:40.049> so<00:03:40.109> then<00:03:40.379> we<00:03:40.500> get

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
six day limit on it so ok so then we get

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.369 
six day limit on it so ok so then we get
a<00:03:40.680> set<00:03:41.069> so<00:03:41.909> that's<00:03:42.060> one<00:03:42.239> item<00:03:42.419> alone<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.229> then
