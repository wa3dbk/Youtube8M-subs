00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.610
 my name is david I learned the margin 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.110
 there will be Schiphol at the airport 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.010
 and my job is to convert it safely 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.010
 of aircraft 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.700
 just landed on the right 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.330
 charlie 16 line 11 the bravo wave ' 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.320
 but now on the way to the gate 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.460
 Charlie 16 around and 737 inside of the klm 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.140
 and there taxi that 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.420
 my head just left the polder lane at the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.530
 head of a sepia are a number 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.019
 boarding places where no booking system 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.449
 hand and they must enter manually 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.440
 be met and one becomes 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.440
 martial de she had sent 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.210
 we are the first to always check the op 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.830
 school place itself 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.450
 does not guarantee the waste ing's material 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.200
 the way it stands in the right on fabric 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.850
 boxes 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.700
 the bridge is in the correct parking position 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.860
 bread lie the green land of the bridge 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.410
 no pieces of junk 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.000
 et cetera on the platform or one 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.470
 plane cannot arrive safely without 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.470
 that something is going to happen 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:59.719
 thus we think say the pilot 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.920
 direction on this is straight or in fact 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.600
 nose wheel straight 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.890
 this is week to the left week to the right 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.780
 so that plane almost stops and 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.760
 stop line is 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.120
 we are going to wave a bit slower because me 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.150
 want to indicate that he is almost dead 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.569
 is getting slower and slower and then we go to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.569
 the stop sign 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.350
 if you stopped mine 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.010
 brake down and then wait until the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.010
 goats are laid 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.840
 what do you make work as a marshall is like that 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.840
 interesting 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.720
 diversity the dynamics 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.810
 it the contact with with with with 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.580
 kite handling and with just it 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.830
 whole process on such a platform that is that 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.820
 is nice that is very much i have a good one 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.400
 day had 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.410
 when it has been quite busy and 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.030
 everything does get told 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.580
 plane did not have how to expect it 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.240
 a martial all satisfied 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.410
 faces 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.500
 and then I go with a good feeling 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.500
 House
