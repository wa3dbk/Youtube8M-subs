00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
honestly if I did it would look

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.060 
honestly if I did it would look
extremely<00:01:54.420> fake<00:01:54.720> um<00:01:55.579> what<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.950> what<00:01:58.950> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
extremely fake um what is that what that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.060 
extremely fake um what is that what that
is<00:01:59.240> it<00:02:00.240> would<00:02:00.420> look<00:02:00.540> extremely<00:02:01.110> fake<00:02:01.380> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
is it would look extremely fake I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.889 
is it would look extremely fake I
thought<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.820> may<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.000> doing<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.390> ping-pong<00:02:03.659> ball

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
thought it may be doing a ping-pong ball

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.740 
thought it may be doing a ping-pong ball
it's<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:05.040> gonna<00:02:05.159> look<00:02:05.250> really<00:02:05.610> fake<00:02:06.030> because

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
it's just gonna look really fake because

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.479 
it's just gonna look really fake because
it's<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.409> able<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.680> move<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.220> I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
it's not going to be able to move and I

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.559 
it's not going to be able to move and I
was<00:02:08.640> CGI'd<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> movie<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.379> think<00:02:10.950> just

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
was CGI'd in the movie so I think just

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.679 
was CGI'd in the movie so I think just
baked<00:02:13.230> shunt<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.249> guess<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.670> could<00:02:14.819> say<00:02:15.030> he's

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
baked shunt I guess you could say he's

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.959 
baked shunt I guess you could say he's
good<00:02:15.900> enough<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.530> design<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.249> have<00:02:17.609> a<00:02:17.639> bald

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
good enough in this design I have a bald

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.929
