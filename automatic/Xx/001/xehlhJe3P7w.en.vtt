00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
eyeball but it is called a Fermata it

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.950 
eyeball but it is called a Fermata it
means<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.310> pause<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.000> music<00:00:24.390> you're<00:00:24.660> going<00:00:24.840> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960

hold<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.529> whatever<00:00:26.369> note<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.970> Fermata

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
hold on whatever note the Fermata

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.519 
hold on whatever note the Fermata
is<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.769> need<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.130> hold<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.429> note<00:00:29.789> for

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
is on and you need to hold that note for

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.049 
is on and you need to hold that note for
quite<00:00:31.529> longer<00:00:31.980> usually<00:00:32.579> than<00:00:32.759> what<00:00:32.910> people

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
quite longer usually than what people

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.690 
quite longer usually than what people
think<00:00:33.480> because<00:00:34.469> if<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.920> don't<00:00:35.160> hold<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.550> long

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
think because if you don't hold it long

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.160 
think because if you don't hold it long
enough<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.780> sound<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
enough it's going to sound like a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.290 
enough it's going to sound like a
mistake<00:00:37.590> let's<00:00:38.190> take<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> look<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
mistake let's take a look at when the

mistake let's take a look at when the
saints<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:39.629> marching<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.190> line<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.640> measure

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
saints go marching in line for measure

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.100 
saints go marching in line for measure
one

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
one

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.430 
one
there's<00:00:43.829> your<00:00:44.100> firmata<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.480> two<00:00:46.200> beats

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
there's your firmata you have two beats

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.580 
there's your firmata you have two beats
worth<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.920> rest<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:47.670> two<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.899> get<00:00:49.079> two<00:00:49.260> three

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
worth of rest one two you get two three

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.110 
worth of rest one two you get two three
and<00:00:50.329> they're<00:00:51.329> telling<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.750> pause<00:00:52.879> when<00:00:53.879> my

next note when I did move forward but
once<00:01:30.450> again<00:01:30.650> do<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.829> count<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> pramanas<00:01:32.729> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
once again do not count the pramanas you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.450 
once again do not count the pramanas you
pause<00:01:33.270> lose<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.409> rhythm<00:01:34.560> all<00:01:34.799> together<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
pause lose your rhythm all together and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.749 
pause lose your rhythm all together and
then<00:01:36.030> restart<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.409> hold<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> too<00:01:38.220> short<00:01:38.520> if

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
then restart if you hold it too short if

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.760 
then restart if you hold it too short if
you<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:39.030> hold<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.329> long<00:01:39.509> enough<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.530> going

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you don't hold it long enough it's going

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.109 
you don't hold it long enough it's going
to<00:01:40.860> sound<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.369> played<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.759> three

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
to sound like you played it for three

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.139 
to sound like you played it for three
beats<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.720> four<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.729> instead<00:01:44.729> of

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
beats or for four or for two instead of

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.510 
beats or for four or for two instead of
pausing<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.920> gonna<00:01:47.070> throw<00:01:47.310> your

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
pausing and then it's gonna throw your

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.920 
pausing and then it's gonna throw your
rhythm<00:01:47.759> off<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.060> hold<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.899> while

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
rhythm off so just hold it for a while

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.970 
rhythm off so just hold it for a while
and<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.159> good<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> Fermata

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.040 

you
