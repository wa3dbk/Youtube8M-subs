that easy you know there's a bad deal
but<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.750> would<00:03:19.840> make<00:03:19.960> sense<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.410> course<00:03:20.440> if

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
but it would make sense of course if

of ability for example these cards we

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.450 
of ability for example these cards we
need<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.490> fill<00:04:03.790> expeditionary<00:04:04.450> calls<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:06.310> you

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
need to fill expeditionary calls if you

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.580 
need to fill expeditionary calls if you
have<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.820> parts<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.360> are<00:04:07.480> on<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.810> run<00:04:08.200> such<00:04:08.410> an

this<00:04:11.260> cross<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.980> not<00:04:12.010> here<00:04:12.340> then<00:04:13.300> you<00:04:13.420> could

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
this cross is not here then you could

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.140 
this cross is not here then you could
discard<00:04:14.230> your<00:04:14.470> cards<00:04:14.830> you<00:04:15.610> can<00:04:15.880> we<00:04:15.940> have<00:04:16.030> that

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
discard your cards you can we have that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.509 
discard your cards you can we have that
one<00:04:16.209> it's<00:04:16.810> worth<00:04:17.260> more<00:04:17.650> be<00:04:17.799> three<00:04:18.010> points<00:04:18.370> and

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
one it's worth more be three points and

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.550 
one it's worth more be three points and
get<00:04:18.970> some<00:04:19.150> money<00:04:19.329> as<00:04:19.450> well<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:22.540> can<00:04:22.780> collect

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
get some money as well you can collect

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:31.370 
get some money as well you can collect
swords<00:04:25.620> swords<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:27.270> nuclear<00:04:28.270> repel<00:04:28.630> ships

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.520 

exactly

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
exactly

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.550 
exactly
so<00:04:32.770> for<00:04:32.950> example<00:04:33.400> if<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.510> had<00:04:34.690> this<00:04:35.200> ship<00:04:35.440> I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
so for example if I had this ship I

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.680 
so for example if I had this ship I
opted<00:04:35.770> in<00:04:35.980> this<00:04:36.130> card<00:04:36.400> it's<00:04:36.580> draw<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.480> I<00:04:37.570> have

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
opted in this card it's draw and I have

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.770 
opted in this card it's draw and I have
one<00:04:37.930> sword<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.890> I<00:04:38.980> can<00:04:39.190> say<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.550> can<00:04:40.030> repel<00:04:40.630> this

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
one sword and I can say I can repel this

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.870 
one sword and I can say I can repel this
because<00:04:41.050> one<00:04:41.260> sword<00:04:41.590> is<00:04:41.710> needed<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.550> get<00:04:42.760> out

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
because one sword is needed to get out

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.510 
because one sword is needed to get out
this<00:04:43.060> part<00:04:43.330> actually<00:04:43.840> there's<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.350> little

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
this part actually there's a little

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.370 
this part actually there's a little
information<00:04:45.520> here<00:04:46.030> are<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.330> carcasses<00:04:46.810> what

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
information here are the carcasses what

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.820 
information here are the carcasses what
color<00:04:48.100> do<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:48.850> yellows<00:04:49.210> many<00:04:50.140> swords<00:04:50.410> are

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
color do the yellows many swords are

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.220 
color do the yellows many swords are
there<00:04:51.190> you<00:04:51.640> draw<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.540> one<00:04:52.750> you<00:04:52.870> know<00:04:52.990> there's

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
there you draw the one you know there's

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.260 
there you draw the one you know there's
only<00:04:53.470> choosing<00:04:53.980> for<00:04:54.160> sponsorship<00:04:54.820> you<00:04:54.940> should

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
only choosing for sponsorship you should

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.720 
only choosing for sponsorship you should
if<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:55.960> are<00:04:56.140> if<00:04:56.230> one<00:04:56.440> sword<00:04:56.680> actually<00:04:57.370> repel

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
if you are if one sword actually repel

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.720 
if you are if one sword actually repel
this<00:04:57.880> card<00:04:58.210> but<00:04:58.870> wait<00:04:59.080> for<00:04:59.260> another

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.760 

so<00:05:02.090> if<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.270> can<00:05:02.390> repel<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.620> can

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
so if it can repel that and I can

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.290 
so if it can repel that and I can
continue<00:05:04.070> because<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.520> didn't<00:05:04.820> go<00:05:04.880> bust<00:05:05.060> of<00:05:05.180> my

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
continue because I didn't go bust of my

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:13.150 
continue because I didn't go bust of my
