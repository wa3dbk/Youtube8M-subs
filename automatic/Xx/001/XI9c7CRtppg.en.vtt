00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.400 
back with another watch me draw video
finally<00:00:08.220> finishing<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.510> drawing<00:00:09.900> oh<00:00:10.290> my

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
finally finishing this drawing oh my

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.930 
finally finishing this drawing oh my
goodness<00:00:11.300> as<00:00:12.300> much<00:00:12.750> as<00:00:12.780> I'm<00:00:12.990> really<00:00:13.259> trying<00:00:13.559> to

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
goodness as much as I'm really trying to

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.490 
goodness as much as I'm really trying to
put<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> lot<00:00:15.150> more<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.570> energy<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.170> effort

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
put a lot more like energy and effort

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.680 
put a lot more like energy and effort
into<00:00:16.680> doing<00:00:16.920> more<00:00:17.250> complex<00:00:17.850> drawings<00:00:18.510> with

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
into doing more complex drawings with

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.090 
into doing more complex drawings with
lots<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.990> colors<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.380> backgrounds<00:00:19.710> or

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
lots of colors and backgrounds or

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.370 
lots of colors and backgrounds or
whatnot<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:21.090> very<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:21.810> time<00:00:22.350> consuming

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
whatnot it is very very time consuming

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.120 
whatnot it is very very time consuming
for<00:00:22.859> me<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:24.529> think<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.769> might<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:25.920> mentioned

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
for me I think I might have mentioned

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.169 
for me I think I might have mentioned
this<00:00:26.310> before<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.769> actually<00:00:28.880> it's<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
this before but I actually it's kind of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.240 
this before but I actually it's kind of
hard<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> i<00:00:30.660> believe<00:00:31.230> i<00:00:31.410> guess<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.920> i<00:00:31.980> actually

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
hard to i believe i guess but i actually

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
hard to i believe i guess but i actually
can't<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.540> focus<00:00:33.780> too<00:00:34.350> long<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:35.210> on<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
can't really focus too long on on a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.540 
can't really focus too long on on a
drawing<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:37.230> one<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.070> particular

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
drawing at one time like one particular

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.450 
drawing at one time like one particular
drawing<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.780> i<00:00:39.809> tend<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.070> bunch

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
drawing so i tend to have like a bunch

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
drawing so i tend to have like a bunch
of<00:00:41.640> different<00:00:41.760> things<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.780> i'm<00:00:42.840> working<00:00:43.140> on

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
of different things that i'm working on

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.410 
of different things that i'm working on
at<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.789> I'll<00:00:44.969> pretty<00:00:45.210> much<00:00:45.300> just

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
at a time and so I'll pretty much just

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.110 
at a time and so I'll pretty much just
go<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.469> know<00:00:46.710> mess<00:00:47.460> around<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.850> one

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
go like you know mess around with one

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
go like you know mess around with one
for<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.690> an<00:00:48.840> hour<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.170> two<00:00:49.200> or<00:00:49.500> whatever<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
for like an hour or two or whatever and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.420 
for like an hour or two or whatever and
then<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> other<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:52.280> don't<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
then go to the other one I don't know I

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.660 
then go to the other one I don't know I
just<00:00:53.520> can't<00:00:53.850> seem<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:55.110> hold<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:55.980> focus<00:00:56.460> on

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
just can't seem to a to hold my focus on

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
just can't seem to a to hold my focus on
one<00:00:56.879> particular<00:00:57.030> thing<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> long<00:00:57.989> time

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
one particular thing for a long time

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.470 
one particular thing for a long time
which<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.649> guess<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.949> good<00:00:58.980> thing<00:00:59.280> because

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
which I guess is a good thing because

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.020 
which I guess is a good thing because
you<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:01.250> get<00:01:02.250> more<00:01:02.460> stuff<00:01:02.730> done<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
you know I can get more stuff done I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.939 
you know I can get more stuff done I
guess<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> makes<00:01:04.080> things<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.589> slow<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
guess but it makes things so slow to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.270 
guess but it makes things so slow to
finish<00:01:05.369> or<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.810> anyway<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.350> sorry<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:08.159> it's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
finish or but anyway I'm sorry that it's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.770 
finish or but anyway I'm sorry that it's
taken<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.610> while<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.790> me<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> finish<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.540> for

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
taken a while for me to finish this for
