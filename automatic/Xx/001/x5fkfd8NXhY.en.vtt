00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
because you know originally I was gonna

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.610 
because you know originally I was gonna
get<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.370> really<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:36.049> wasn't<00:02:37.049> like<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> really

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
get like really I wasn't like the really

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.830 
get like really I wasn't like the really
cheap<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:38.190> off<00:02:38.549> amazon<00:02:38.819> i<00:02:39.120> was<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.510> seven

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
cheap one off amazon i was like a seven

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.750 
cheap one off amazon i was like a seven
dollar<00:02:39.959> one<00:02:40.290> but<00:02:40.890> then<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> realized<00:02:41.519> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
dollar one but then I realized the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.640 
dollar one but then I realized the
quality<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.209> probably<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.660> be<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.930> bad<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
quality is probably to be so bad that it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.979 
quality is probably to be so bad that it
would<00:02:44.519> probably<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:45.000> better<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.420> know<00:02:45.780> just

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
would probably be better to know just

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.559 
would probably be better to know just
not<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.319> webcam<00:02:46.579> so<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.970> know<00:02:48.090> I'll<00:02:48.360> wait

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
not have a webcam so you know I'll wait

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.800 
not have a webcam so you know I'll wait
until<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:51.560> wooden<00:02:52.560> October<00:02:52.980> comes<00:02:53.190> around<00:02:53.810> so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
