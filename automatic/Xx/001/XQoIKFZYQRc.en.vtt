00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:15.170
 this greeting gas tank restoration 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:15.170
 Ashka vector and has one quotation from cloves 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.130
 such 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:37.950
 has us kind of we will begin to restore 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:44.010
 for this acquired such devices here 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.300
 visible solvent was sense decor on 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.300
 bronze base 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.079
 tassels and here is such a hedgehog hedgehog 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.349
 see the effect of detectives 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:54.440
 so here we look at the result literally 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:02:00.570
 30 seconds so we go through everything completely 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:05.070
 completely on the skin enzo so our here 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.040
 already hung it up to paint over like this 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:15.440
 this mind does not want to completely skin itself 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:21.180
 all the rust actually forces like this 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:30.060
 It looks like this now 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:37.480
 I go through the primer first layer here and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:40.680
 here degrease like this in general 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.680
 Did not work out 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:04.530
 left drove a liar. 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:07.680
 I went through the first layer of soil 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.680
 the best did not work 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 the result 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.750
 but this kind 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.110
 so it remains to count a layer of soil who 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:56.800
 runs from the decor to the bronze 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:01.240
 basis and everything went so here and passed 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:05.740
 second layer of soil 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.740
 metal is such a view 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:44.860
 Now we are going through the decor like this 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.860
 and everything and principle finish off 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.440
 anticorrosive treated 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.870
 that's what we see 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.400
 let it dry up 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.180
 Thank you all good luck
