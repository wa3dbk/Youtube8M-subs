00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.760 
are these ledges off to the side here
that's<00:01:55.509> where<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:55.780> would<00:01:55.869> jump<00:01:56.110> off<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.530> die

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
that's where you would jump off to die

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.440 
that's where you would jump off to die
so<00:01:57.579> of<00:01:57.700> course<00:01:57.759> you're<00:01:57.970> going<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.180> get<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.299> whole

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
normally I just go to the that one room

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.230 
normally I just go to the that one room
on<00:02:54.350> patrol<00:02:54.740> on<00:02:55.010> earth<00:02:55.250> where<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.610> break<00:02:55.970> left

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
on patrol on earth where you break left

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.580 
on patrol on earth where you break left
and<00:02:56.480> go<00:02:56.600> down<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:57.080> always<00:02:57.200> those<00:02:57.380> three

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
and go down and it's always those three

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.320 
and go down and it's always those three
nights<00:02:57.770> that's<00:02:58.280> actually<00:02:58.430> much<00:02:58.700> faster<00:02:58.760> but

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
nights that's actually much faster but

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.000 
nights that's actually much faster but
you<00:02:59.690> got<00:02:59.870> it<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.380> can<00:03:00.500> do<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.710> mall<00:03:00.830> here

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
you got it and you can do it mall here

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.200 
you got it and you can do it mall here
so<00:03:01.160> here<00:03:01.340> I'm<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:01.550> jumping<00:03:01.790> off<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.030> side

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
so here I'm just jumping off the side

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.970 
so here I'm just jumping off the side
die<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.080> then<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.200> respawn<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.740> at<00:03:03.860> that

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
die and then a respawn in at that

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.580 
die and then a respawn in at that
checkpoint<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.820> that's<00:03:05.330> where<00:03:05.480> at<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:06.350> this<00:03:06.560> is

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
checkpoint so that's where at so this is

thousand<00:03:37.610> glimmer<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:37.880> still<00:03:38.120> think

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
thousand glimmer and still think

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.240 
thousand glimmer and still think
exclusion<00:03:38.780> zones<00:03:38.989> way<00:03:39.290> better<00:03:39.739> for<00:03:40.010> glimmer

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
exclusion zones way better for glimmer

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.910 
exclusion zones way better for glimmer
because<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.300> exclusion<00:03:41.900> zone<00:03:42.200> those<00:03:42.380> cabal

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
because in exclusion zone those cabal

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.670 
because in exclusion zone those cabal
major<00:03:43.430> ultras<00:03:43.940> give<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.209> like<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.630> think<00:03:44.989> 47

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
major ultras give you like I think 47

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.380 
major ultras give you like I think 47
glimmer<00:03:46.100> per<00:03:46.430> kill<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:46.730> think<00:03:47.030> isn't<00:03:47.269> like<00:03:47.360> that

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
glimmer per kill I think isn't like that

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.240 
glimmer per kill I think isn't like that
so<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.290> not<00:03:48.410> bad<00:03:48.620> i'm<00:03:48.800> definitely<00:03:49.160> coming
