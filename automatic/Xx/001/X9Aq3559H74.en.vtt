00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
would be coming to GTA online because it

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.379 
would be coming to GTA online because it
would<00:03:44.739> not<00:03:44.920> make<00:03:45.100> sense<00:03:45.370> for<00:03:45.880> rockstars

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
would not make sense for rockstars

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.270 
would not make sense for rockstars
bottom<00:03:46.870> line<00:03:47.109> they<00:03:47.410> wouldn't<00:03:47.709> really<00:03:47.889> want<00:03:48.130> to

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
bottom line they wouldn't really want to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.699 
bottom line they wouldn't really want to
give<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.670> free<00:03:48.940> money<00:03:49.180> with<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.109> incentive

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
give you free money with the incentive

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.470

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
or with the opportunity to buy cash

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.330 
or with the opportunity to buy cash
cards<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.380> just<00:03:53.560> wouldn't<00:03:53.739> make<00:03:53.859> sense<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.250> me

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
cards it just wouldn't make sense to me

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.710 
cards it just wouldn't make sense to me
why<00:03:54.519> they<00:03:54.670> would<00:03:54.790> put<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.239> game<00:03:55.420> for
