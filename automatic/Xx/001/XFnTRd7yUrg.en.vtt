so immediately I want to start backing
up<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:11.000> use<00:02:12.000> my<00:02:12.320> my<00:02:13.320> turret<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:14.100> my<00:02:14.250> advantage

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
up I use my my turret to my advantage

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.300 
up I use my my turret to my advantage
see<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.140> do<00:02:16.380> oh<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.190> keep

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
see what I can do oh so I just keep

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.040 
see what I can do oh so I just keep
backing<00:02:23.520> up<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.060> hopefully<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
backing up and hopefully that the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.850 
backing up and hopefully that the
tortoise<00:02:25.320> doesn't<00:02:25.560> come<00:02:25.680> down

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.710 

and<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:32.159> you<00:02:32.250> can<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.790> tortoise<00:02:33.150> was<00:02:33.299> not

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
and as you can see the tortoise was not

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.819 
and as you can see the tortoise was not
gonna<00:02:33.989> let<00:02:34.409> me<00:02:34.620> slide<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.959> take<00:02:36.959> my<00:02:37.140> shot<00:02:37.379> that

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
gonna let me slide so take my shot that

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.819 
gonna let me slide so take my shot that
it<00:02:37.950> hit<00:02:38.069> my<00:02:38.189> turret<00:02:38.549> keep<00:02:38.760> packing<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.829> and

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
it hit my turret keep packing on it and

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.170 
it hit my turret keep packing on it and
that's<00:02:41.040> kind<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.579> have<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.819> do<00:02:41.939> like

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that's kind of all you have to do like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.000 
that's kind of all you have to do like
hope<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.959> they<00:02:43.079> can't<00:02:43.319> they<00:02:43.680> don't<00:02:43.829> pin<00:02:43.980> your

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
hope that they can't they don't pin your

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.350 
hope that they can't they don't pin your
turret<00:02:44.340> because<00:02:44.489> your<00:02:44.610> turret<00:02:44.819> can<00:02:45.000> still<00:02:45.239> be

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
turret because your turret can still be

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.110 
turret because your turret can still be
penned<00:02:45.659> in<00:02:45.840> some<00:02:46.019> spots<00:02:46.319> but<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:47.940> gotta

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
penned in some spots but you just gotta

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.240 
penned in some spots but you just gotta
hope<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.840> good<00:02:48.959> position<00:02:49.590> where

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
hope you're in a good position where

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.580 
hope you're in a good position where
that<00:02:50.430> doesn't<00:02:50.610> happen<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.870> once<00:02:55.170> again<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.530> I

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
would have been really bad but basically

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.710 
would have been really bad but basically
Centurion<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:37.739> tank<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.099> very<00:03:38.370> mobile<00:03:38.720> also

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720
