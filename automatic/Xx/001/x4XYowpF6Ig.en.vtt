00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
to actually drain life when they use

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.300 
to actually drain life when they use
life<00:04:40.770> drain<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.340> would<00:04:41.520> be<00:04:41.639> cool<00:04:41.940> i<00:04:41.970> mean

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
life drain that would be cool i mean

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.150 
life drain that would be cool i mean
there<00:04:44.310> that's<00:04:44.610> essential<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.750> most<00:04:45.960> game<00:04:46.320> it's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
there that's essential to most game it's

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.280 
there that's essential to most game it's
just<00:04:47.400> like<00:04:47.460> lava<00:04:47.880> balls<00:04:48.210> at<00:04:48.510> least<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:49.080> see

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
just like lava balls at least you see

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.190 
just like lava balls at least you see
some<00:04:49.590> sort<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.889> fire<00:04:50.220> type<00:04:50.820> attack<00:04:51.240> right<00:04:51.630> so

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
some sort of fire type attack right so

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.810 
some sort of fire type attack right so
Life<00:04:52.440> Drain<00:04:52.800> should<00:04:53.100> have<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.550> type<00:04:53.790> of

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
Life Drain should have that type of

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.470 
Life Drain should have that type of
attribute<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:54.980> think<00:04:55.980> that<00:04:56.190> I'll<00:04:56.730> make<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.240> more

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480
