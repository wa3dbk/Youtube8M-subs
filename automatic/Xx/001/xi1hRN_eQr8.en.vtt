00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello how about this time we are going to 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.230
 fix a 32-inch screen 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.919
 model 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.919
 God 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.250
 and this device was not brought because 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.250
 has audio 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.360
 we play what the speakers are there is a 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.280
 horn was 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.260
 it is no longer useful 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.420
 this 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.750
 we proceed to check what is the output 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.270
 of audio and exactly we do not have anything 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.920
 of in the output circuit given that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.130
 it's been this this just delivery 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.700
 nothing of 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.420
 audio if voltages come in if you 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:51.400
 audio signals come in but 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.650
 it does not amplify what proceeded to be done 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.200
 is 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.680
 identify the audio entries that 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.680
 it's been 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 of the third 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.800
 antepenultimate the third one here for 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.690
 here and the third one from here to here 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.940
 then there we have audio we made this 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.990
 we take out the audio and we pass it on 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.450
 what is an amplifier 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.210
 we took this amplifier from one of 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:28.110
 the old recorders that many times 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 they give us those Chinese recorders 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.460
 then here we identify the entrance 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.750
 of voltage 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.920
 input signals 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.980
 audio and speaker outputs 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.400
 all we did was take out the 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.250
 signal of this circuit 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.220
 pass it here and we feed it with a 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.290
 9 volt regulator here is us 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.380
 delivering 12 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.570
 and we put a 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.610
 regularly a regulator of 9 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.570
 volts 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.570
 this 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.660
 only then can we recover what 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.450
 is this screen since this circuit does not 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.710
 they sell it we do not get it see us 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.140
 they sell the whole card then this 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.990
 Well, only in this way can we 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.070
 recover it since the customer is urgent 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.970
 because he wants to take it, I do it later 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.960
 then this one let's check the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.960
 connect you please 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.960
 let's hear 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.400
 that already has audio and they are exactly 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.680
 through these 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.680
 this audio circuit 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.000
 let's light it 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.460
 and learned the led light 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.460
 we talked 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.849
 Yes now 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.849
 sounding the horns 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.890
 and this are fueled by this 90's 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.890
 of 12 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.910
 and the signals that are being put 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.030
 from the circuit 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.400
 well this is one of the ways to 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.480
 try to fix the audio in what 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.880
 are these cards I hope you serve them 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.880
 and they have been useful until then
