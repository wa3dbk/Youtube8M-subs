good<00:04:48.509> now<00:04:49.509> I<00:04:49.689> mean<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.050> weakest<00:04:50.349> point<00:04:50.590> is

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
good now I mean the weakest point is

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.619 
good now I mean the weakest point is
probably<00:04:51.039> a<00:04:51.129> their<00:04:51.909> Center<00:04:52.210> in<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.419> point

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:52.629 
probably a their Center in that point

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.869 
probably a their Center in that point
guard<00:04:52.779> position<00:04:52.870> because<00:04:53.469> far<00:04:54.279> more<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.639> not

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
guard position because far more is not

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.309 
guard position because far more is not
better<00:04:54.939> than<00:04:55.270> Marcus<00:04:55.539> smart<00:04:55.809> but<00:04:55.990> look<00:04:56.080> that

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
better than Marcus smart but look that

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.260
