exactly<00:04:56.320> why<00:04:56.500> signal<00:04:56.950> strength<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.340> here

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
exactly why signal strength is here

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.130 
exactly why signal strength is here
so<00:04:59.990> it's<00:05:00.110> going<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.350> receive<00:05:00.920> a<00:05:00.980> signal<00:05:05.140> box

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140
