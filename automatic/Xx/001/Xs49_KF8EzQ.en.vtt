00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
gonna quickly showcase one of these

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.059 
gonna quickly showcase one of these
silly<00:00:05.130> little<00:00:05.370> local<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.000> did<00:00:06.799> just<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.890> while

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
silly little local is I did just a while

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.150 
silly little local is I did just a while
back<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.639> as<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.480> tell<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.840> su<00:00:10.410> dB<00:00:10.920> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
back so as you can tell it's su dB and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.669 
back so as you can tell it's su dB and
it's<00:00:11.490> less<00:00:11.849> circular<00:00:12.090> logo<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.230> stands<00:00:13.530> on

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
it's less circular logo and it stands on

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.650 
it's less circular logo and it stands on
its<00:00:13.740> own<00:00:14.040> meaning<00:00:14.700> there's<00:00:15.240> not<00:00:15.450> really

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
its own meaning there's not really

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.540 
its own meaning there's not really
anything<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.289> back<00:00:16.500> or<00:00:16.800> well<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.369> not

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
anything in the back or well it's not

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.269 
anything in the back or well it's not
really<00:00:17.820> even<00:00:17.940> necessary<00:00:18.840> okay<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.529> how<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.130> came

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
really even necessary okay so how I came

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.609 
really even necessary okay so how I came
about<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.300> constructing<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.289> first

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
about in constructing this I first

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.529 
about in constructing this I first
started<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> concept<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.060> knew<00:00:24.510> I

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
started out with the concept I knew I

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.880 
started out with the concept I knew I
was<00:00:24.810> gonna<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:26.150> letters<00:00:27.150> u<00:00:27.570> D<00:00:28.170> B<00:00:28.470> stands

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
was gonna do the letters u D B stands

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.999 
was gonna do the letters u D B stands
for<00:00:29.010> urban<00:00:29.910> design<00:00:30.179> blueprint<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
for urban design blueprint right and I

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.770 
for urban design blueprint right and I
knew<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.460> gonna<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:32.910> urban<00:00:33.450> feel

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
knew it was gonna have that urban feel

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780 
knew it was gonna have that urban feel
to<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> same<00:00:34.829> time<00:00:35.190> has<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.610> have

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to it but at the same time has to have

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.600 
to it but at the same time has to have
it<00:00:35.969> nice<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.510> clean<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:38.070> too<00:00:38.340> far

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
it nice and clean and just not too far

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
it nice and clean and just not too far
out<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> started<00:00:40.079> off<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
out there so I started off with the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.700 
out there so I started off with the
circle<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.270> tried<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
circle and then I tried it out with the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.830 
circle and then I tried it out with the
letters<00:00:44.190> were<00:00:44.670> gonna<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.379> alright<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
letters were gonna go alright and then I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.869 
letters were gonna go alright and then I
basically<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.250> kind<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> sketched<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.760> out

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
basically just kind of sketched it out

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.689 
basically just kind of sketched it out
and<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.230> tell<00:00:52.440> there's<00:00:52.699> perspective

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and you can tell there's perspective

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.060 
and you can tell there's perspective
applied<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> letters<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.860> they're

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
applied to the letters because they're

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.400 
applied to the letters because they're
not<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.210> row<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.930> whoops

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
not you know in a row and like whoops

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.459 
not you know in a row and like whoops
nice<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.399> straight<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.730> just<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.510> rigid<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
nice and straight and just like rigid it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.969 
nice and straight and just like rigid it
has<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.399> flow<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
has that flow going and it's going you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
has that flow going and it's going you
know<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.309> has<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.110> vanishing

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
know it has that the the vanishing

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.679 
know it has that the the vanishing
points<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.979> should<00:01:08.189> say<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
points I should say is here here and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.580 
points I should say is here here and
here<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.439> not<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.299> weight<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
here so it's not in a weight that is I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.670 
here so it's not in a weight that is I
guess<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.220> say<00:01:14.400> realistic<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
guess you can say realistic but at the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.109 
guess you can say realistic but at the
same<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.520> got<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> urban

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
same time you know it's got that urban

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
same time you know it's got that urban
feel<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.710> nice<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> clean

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
feel to it and it's all nice and clean

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.109 
feel to it and it's all nice and clean
okay<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.630> then<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.229> constructed<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.670> don't

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
okay so then I constructed these I don't

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.060 
okay so then I constructed these I don't
know<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.780> call<00:01:24.930> them<00:01:25.080> arrows<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
know if you can call them arrows but I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.060 
know if you can call them arrows but I
charted<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.450> circle<00:01:27.810> real<00:01:28.470> quickly<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
charted it the circle real quickly and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.499 
charted it the circle real quickly and
then<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.579> tell<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.909> also<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
then you can tell it's also got the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.270 
then you can tell it's also got the
perspective<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.979> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
perspective going because this is it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.210 
perspective going because this is it
goes<00:01:32.460> from<00:01:32.490> small<00:01:33.200> big<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.799> back<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
goes from small big and then back to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.940 
goes from small big and then back to
small<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.060> more<00:01:36.960> eye-catching<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
small so it's more eye-catching and it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.210 
small so it's more eye-catching and it
has<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.369> diamond<00:01:38.930> dynamic<00:01:39.930> feel<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.680> so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
has that diamond dynamic feel to it so

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.819 
has that diamond dynamic feel to it so
after<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> charted<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.240> circle<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.869> put<00:01:43.619> in

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
after I charted out the circle I put in

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.300 
after I charted out the circle I put in
the<00:01:44.070> arrows<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.299> nice<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the arrows so it's nice and you know it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.420 
the arrows so it's nice and you know it
has<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.229> well<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.439> guess<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.009> see<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.280> has

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
has that well I guess you can see it has

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
has that well I guess you can see it has
that<00:01:50.610> design<00:01:51.030> type<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.360> feel<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.049> then

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that design type of feel to it and then

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.880
