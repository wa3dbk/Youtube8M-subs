00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.190
 congratulations to youtube is very nice 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 and not only also very good at that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.720
 michael righini i am i follow him from a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.769
 some time in his comedy videos makes me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 die laughing and sometimes that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.470
 I also write this in the comments 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.930
 time I wanted to congratulate for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
 The web series that creates that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.129
 realized and that is going into these 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.920
 days is publishing these days 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.539
 which is escape from death but very beautiful 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.539
 even though I only saw the first one 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.070
 episode in fact I wait for nothing but 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.600
 the others do not know how many episodes 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 sleep but I think it's a nice series 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.510
 in fact I'm sure of it 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.320
 congratulations to maicon, congratulations to all 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.080
 the other actors acting in this 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 web series 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.900
 beautiful also the place they have 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.860
 chosen to shoot it because I think it is 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 a creed that is a castle and any 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.560
 castle is known is the setting 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.420
 best for the topic you decided on 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.680
 of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:32.899
 to treat and to that halo of mystery of 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.350
 magic and I think we are is a beautiful thing 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:39.560
 sorry for the crap the cassate I am 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.240
 saying, however, I don't even have a little nervousness 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.000
 because the first video I make in 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.710
 this in front of the camera 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.710
 and not back 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:02:00.850
 what to say michael is very good plan of 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:04.460
 innate comedy talent and therefore 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.780
 I think it's just his quality 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.610
 natural I would not want to offend him in saying 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.890
 that even if he was silent in a video 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.209
 various injuries in the same and would like to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.209
 whoever saw it for a while also the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.660
 fact that this time he wanted to do 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.720
 a little more serious thing like 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.050
 escape part keeping anyway 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.360
 a hint of his comedy makes us understand 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.840
 in short, he can also be an actor 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.560
 versatile strange that it is not seen 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.370
 also somewhere else maybe 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.110
 television in some cameo of one 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.510
 TV series 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.000
 but I think I hope to see him soon 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.280
 however still compliments escape 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 from death, congratulations to everyone 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.450
 and to all the actors and a big kiss a 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.450
 soon
