00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:09.510
 Yes, we will learn to do some 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.190
 some exercises to strengthen the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.530
 today, paulo 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.260
 so I'll show you what I 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.090
 I do like are the examples that I do 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.189
 for the fantasy in the foot and is also has 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.250
 more made of iron than first 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 Let's start as an exercise in this 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.390
 position and understood that this is here 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:41.940
 Be Joseph is effective half-tip and will 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:50.969
 force your feet out and with all the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:01:03.239
 fingers on the floor can not take 34 yes 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:08.250
 other 234 234 5 2 3 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:15.290
 so and such exercise is great girls 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:19.470
 to be able to have strength in the feet here 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:24.190
 so another very cool one is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.490
 see that you too can force 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:36.030
 on stone outside and head and legs 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:40.080
 muscles and go up and down and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.080
 go up and stay 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:51.880
 and you also have this one that you can 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:58.470
 do that's a two three four five 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.470
 without costing the heel on the floor 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:12.060
 This is a great mother, so these are the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.750
 exercises for us to do is to be able to 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.310
 stay with the three cuts and even 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.820
 balance 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:29.970
 okay and holding a job and you can 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:34.680
 to do so and right now another 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.000
 exercise for standing up and equip 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:48.920
 I will I do for you do 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.920
 the initial reset is in account ee 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.920
 double the time ahead in strength but 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.210
 slowly 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:07.360
 each one has its own nighy nÃ© 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:13.800
 then you come back 'in that 12 32 34 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.800
 silva goes up and does not happen 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.420
 so the account here people is this you have 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.689
 that being holding can not put force 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.459
 just to make this move is the strength 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:32.129
 it will only be on the half-tip and so ok 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.049
 in my time the only different tip 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.049
 It's really just a movement. 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:49.439
 the exercise is not that is how many 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:56.750

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:56.750
 the other foot of ours 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.719
 You can see how I feel, too. 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.040
 but this and I already have time that I am training 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.970

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.150
