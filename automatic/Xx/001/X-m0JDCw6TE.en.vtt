00:00:02.076 --> 00:00:03.109
 This is a picture of 

00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:04.014
 the human brain. 

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:04.967
 It seems 

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:06.070
 the human brain 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.509
 in profile - imagine a person, 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.133
 turn to one side. 

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.385
 This will be the front of the head, 

00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:14.208
 but the eyes, the nose and the mouth 

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:15.868
 will be located here. 

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.654
 This will be the back of the head, 

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:20.488
 this is the top, 

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:24.050
 and this - the lower part of it. 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.734
 This great area here, 

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:31.312
 which is the first thing that beats the eyes, 

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:34.039
 if you just look at the brain outside, 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.565
 is the cerebral cortex. 

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:39.659
 You will probably notice, 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:40.275
 that she 

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:42.318
 looks wrinkled. 

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:43.200
 It's really wrinkled. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.733
 Instead of having a smooth surface, 

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.078
 the cerebral cortex is covered with protrusions and creases, 

00:00:47.078 --> 00:00:48.634
 which is extremely useful because 

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.479
 this increases 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.195
 its surface, 

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.111
 provides space for more neurons 

00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:56.906
 and increases cellular mass. 

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.407
 Usually, the cerebral cortex is divided 

00:00:58.407 --> 00:00:59.915
 on four partitions. 

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.251
 The first one is called the front title 

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.186
 and I will paint it in blue. 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.298
 The second is the lumbar portion, in yellow, 

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:12.520
 which is here, in the upper back. 

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:15.370
 Following is the title, 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.169
 which will color in pink. 

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:18.876
 Finally, the temporal lobe, 

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.828
 which will be in purple. 

00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:25.075
 The goal partition consists of two main zones. 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.642
 the engine area (engine area) or motor crust, 

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:34.895
 and the prefrontal cortex 

00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:40.938
 The engine area is responsible for 

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.679
 body movements. 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.466
 If we open someone's skull 

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.698
 and stimulate with electrodes 

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:47.125
 different areas of the engine area, 

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.038
 we can make a man's hand tremble or his leg to move. 

00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:52.477
 All this by stimulating the brain. 

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:55.291
 In addition to the motor crust in the forehead, the prefrontal cortex is also present. 

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.077
 She is responsible for 

00:01:57.077 --> 00:01:59.921
 the executive functions of the brain - 

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:02.057
 thinking, problem solving and organizing 

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:04.599
 occur in the prefrontal cortex. 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.957
 It is also involved in control and management 

00:02:06.957 --> 00:02:08.675
 of other parts of the brain. 

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:10.811
 Another part of the front title that is worth mentioning, 

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:13.191
 is the area of ​​Brock. 

00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:15.257
 This part of the brain is connected 

00:02:15.257 --> 00:02:16.998
 with speech. 

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:19.692
 We move on to the yellow-orange part, 

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:21.983
 which, as I said, is called the titanium. 

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:28.130
 That part of the cerebral cortex too 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.778
 performs various functions. 

00:02:29.778 --> 00:02:31.392
 An important part of the bisector is 

00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:34.209
 somatosensory fields (common sense area) 

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:40.554
 This is the part of the brain, 

00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:42.191
 which is responsible for the sensations. 

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.594
 I do not mean the feelings, 

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:46.556
 but for the senses. This part of the body receives information 

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:48.435
 from your whole body to 

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:51.432
 touch, pressure, temperature, pain. 

00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:53.498
 The crust will help us reach out 

00:02:53.498 --> 00:02:55.112
 for a cup of coffee until 

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:57.318
 the somatosensory crust will allow us 

00:02:57.318 --> 00:02:59.292
 to feel the pressure of the cup of coffee 

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:01.010
 or its heat. 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.229
 Maybe you think that 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.376
 these two senses are inextricably linked, 

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:05.271
 and that's true. 

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:06.095
 Although we say that 

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:07.895
 are located in different parts of the brain, 

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:10.054
 they are in fact one next to another. 

00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:12.434
 From this part of the brain to this crack, 

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:14.895
 within the forehead is the crust. 

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:17.600
 Right beside her, in the brisket, 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.735
 at the back of the head is the somatosensory crust. 

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.139
 Together they both form 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.631
 the sensory crust. 

00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:30.395
 The vampire share is also responsible for 

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.861
 spatial orientation. 

00:03:38.198 --> 00:03:39.286
 That is, it helps us 

00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:43.622
 to orient yourself in three-dimensional space. 

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:45.201
 This part of the brain not only helps us 

00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:47.082
 to find out where we are, 

00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:48.359
 but also to understand 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.797
 the space around you. 

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.074
 For example, if I decide to reach out 

00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:54.140
 for a cup of coffee in front of me, 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.135
 I can use my prefrontal bark to plan the movement, 

00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:59.759
 and the crust of the crust to fulfill it. 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.721
 Besides, I will need the blade that will guide me 

00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:04.032
 where exactly the cup is located. 

00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:05.611
 Without this information I can not 

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.398
 to reach out and take it. 

00:04:07.398 --> 00:04:08.978
 Orientation on the map, seamless navigation 

00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:10.719
 in the house or town where you live, 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.079
 are also part of 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.480
 spatial orientation. 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.301
 The titralium, which is located in the back of the brain, 

00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:21.247
 responsible for vision. 

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:25.861
 We can see with the eyes that are part of the face, 

00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:27.162
 but after gathering information 

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:28.160
 from the outside world, 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.134
 it is sent for processing 

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:33.024
 back to the brain. 

00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:35.083
 Add "vision". 

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:38.141
 Another term you may be hearing 

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:39.674
 in relation to the title share, 

00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:42.099
 is the term -------------- 

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:44.973
 This means, 

00:04:44.973 --> 00:04:46.385
 that if you look at the titralium under a microscope, 

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.933
 his cells will look like you 

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:51.757
 striped, striped. 

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.217
 The last part of the cerebral cortex is the temporal lobe, 

00:04:54.217 --> 00:04:55.283
 which is in purple. 

00:04:56.474 --> 00:04:58.471
 This part of the brain is responsible for 

00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.369
 hearing processing. 

00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.101
 As with the vamal, responsible for vision, 

00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.493
 information flows through one of the senses - in this case the ears, 

00:05:06.493 --> 00:05:10.206
 but is processed by the brain in the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. 

00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:11.922
 Another important area in the temporal lobe 

00:05:11.922 --> 00:05:14.884
 is the Vernicke speech center. 

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:21.216
 When we talked about the front title, 

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:22.575
 it was about the area of ​​Brock, 

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:25.013
 who is responsible for the speech. 

00:05:25.013 --> 00:05:28.077
 The Vernique speaking area is responsible for accepting language information 

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:30.317
 and understanding the language. 

00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:31.269
 Before we finish, 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:32.768
 I want to note, 

00:05:32.768 --> 00:05:34.415
 that the different parts of the brain 

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:37.874
 have much more features than those I've listed. 

00:05:37.874 --> 00:05:38.990
 These are, however, the most important features, 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.593
 with which you have to connect the different titles 

00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:43.025
 of the cerebral cortex.
