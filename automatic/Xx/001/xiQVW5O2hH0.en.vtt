00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
will get destroyed and stuff and you can

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.520 
will get destroyed and stuff and you can
also<00:01:22.980> set<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.460> chance<00:01:24.050> that<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.170> lockpick

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
also set the chance that the lockpick

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.750 
also set the chance that the lockpick
has<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.010> don't<00:01:26.160> know<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> hundred

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
has so I don't know if there's a hundred

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.150 
has so I don't know if there's a hundred
sin<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:27.510> can<00:01:27.600> also<00:01:27.720> set<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.260> like<00:01:28.440> one

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
sin you can also set that to like one

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.040 
sin you can also set that to like one
percent<00:01:29.550> so<00:01:29.730> one<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.120> a<00:01:30.180> hundred<00:01:30.300> up<00:01:30.720> tries

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
percent so one in a hundred up tries

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.220 
percent so one in a hundred up tries
they'll<00:01:31.860> get<00:01:32.010> through<00:01:32.480> so<00:01:33.480> let's<00:01:33.870> try<00:01:34.080> opening

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
they'll get through so let's try opening

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.940 
they'll get through so let's try opening
one<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.830> chests<00:01:35.310> oh<00:01:36.080> here<00:01:37.080> we<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.350> some
