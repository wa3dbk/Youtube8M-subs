used to do okay that's a big difference
previously<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.510> design<00:03:03.930> had<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.380> taller

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
previously this design had to be taller

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.840 
previously this design had to be taller
and<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.100> had<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> fence<00:03:05.730> post

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
and you had to have a fence post

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.680 
and you had to have a fence post
underneath<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.840> dispenser<00:03:07.410> but<00:03:08.160> now<00:03:08.690> you

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
underneath this dispenser but now you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.330 
underneath this dispenser but now you
can<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.960> do<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.260> chickens<00:03:10.920> get<00:03:11.070> hit<00:03:11.220> by
