00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
contaminate our vial and a very also a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.240 
contaminate our vial and a very also a
very<00:02:33.989> important<00:02:34.470> part<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.770> taking<00:02:35.160> this

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
very important part of taking this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.910 
very important part of taking this
sample<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:35.910> every<00:02:36.900> time<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.680> go<00:02:37.860> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
sample is that every time that you go to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.339 
sample is that every time that you go to
take<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.370> sample<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.120> move<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.930> actual

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
take the sample and you move the actual

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.490 
take the sample and you move the actual
teat<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.519> gland<00:02:41.880> there's<00:02:42.540> many<00:02:43.140> different

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
teat or the gland there's many different

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.420 
teat or the gland there's many different
types<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.400> particles<00:02:45.000> from<00:02:45.180> hair<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.930> dust<00:02:46.620> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
types of particles from hair to dust to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.250 
types of particles from hair to dust to
all<00:02:47.670> kinds<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.060> different<00:02:48.510> sort<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.840> debris

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
all kinds of different sort of debris

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.650 
all kinds of different sort of debris
that<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.680> actually<00:02:49.890> fall<00:02:50.370> into<00:02:50.760> your<00:02:51.330> sample

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
that can actually fall into your sample

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.870 
that can actually fall into your sample
vial<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.830> want<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.100> be<00:02:53.190> careful<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.640> avoid

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
vial so you want to be careful to avoid

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.570 
vial so you want to be careful to avoid
those<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:55.140> way<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.500> we<00:02:55.620> avoid<00:02:55.950> those<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.430> we

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
those the way that we avoid those is we

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.720 
those the way that we avoid those is we
actually<00:02:56.760> allow<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.390> lid<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.440> be<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.860> protector

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
actually allow the lid to be a protector

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.780 
actually allow the lid to be a protector
so<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.540> stuff<00:03:01.080> will<00:03:01.319> bounce<00:03:01.530> off<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.400> at

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
so that stuff will bounce off of it at

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.820 
so that stuff will bounce off of it at
the<00:03:02.970> same<00:03:03.209> time<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:03.630> need<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.959> direct<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
the same time we need to direct the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.460 
the same time we need to direct the
stream<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.280> milk<00:03:05.459> into<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.360> tube<00:03:06.600> at<00:03:06.870> an<00:03:07.049> angle

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
stream of milk into the tube at an angle

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.250 
stream of milk into the tube at an angle
so<00:03:08.069> now<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.580> open<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.090> lid<00:03:09.299> leave

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
so now I'm going to open the lid leave

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.640 
so now I'm going to open the lid leave
it<00:03:10.440> half<00:03:11.010> open<00:03:11.580> like<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.030> at<00:03:12.299> an<00:03:12.959> angle<00:03:13.440> to

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it half open like this at an angle to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.710 
it half open like this at an angle to
the<00:03:13.680> cow's<00:03:14.010> teeth<00:03:14.489> I'm<00:03:14.970> going<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.299> actually

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
the cow's teeth I'm going to actually

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.620 
the cow's teeth I'm going to actually
strip<00:03:16.109> milk<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.340> four<00:03:17.670> milk<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.209> first

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
strip milk the four milk is first

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.470 
strip milk the four milk is first
stripped<00:03:19.380> away<00:03:19.590> onto<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.400> ground<00:03:20.790> not<00:03:21.120> into

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
stripped away onto the ground not into

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.750 
stripped away onto the ground not into
the<00:03:21.630> tube<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.140> then<00:03:22.230> once<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.310> finish

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the tube and then once we finish

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.610 
the tube and then once we finish
stripping<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.420> into<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> ground<00:03:25.019> then<00:03:25.470> we

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
stripping it into the ground then we

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.220 
stripping it into the ground then we
actually<00:03:26.040> collect<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.150> two<00:03:27.390> into<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.989> tube

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
actually collect the two into the tube

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.400 
actually collect the two into the tube
using<00:03:29.010> again<00:03:29.519> our<00:03:29.700> lid<00:03:29.970> as<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.630> buffer<00:03:31.380> to

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
using again our lid as a buffer to

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.390 
using again our lid as a buffer to
prevent<00:03:32.130> any<00:03:32.430> sort<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:33.030> material<00:03:33.660> from

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
prevent any sort of material from

prevent any sort of material from
collecting<00:03:35.400> into<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.239> whale<00:03:37.640> then<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:38.850> fill

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
collecting into the whale then we fill

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.100 
collecting into the whale then we fill
the<00:03:39.510> tube<00:03:39.750> up<00:03:40.019> with<00:03:40.350> milk

a small sample at least one quarter of
the<00:03:46.770> way<00:03:46.950> up<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.310> tube<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.790> then<00:03:48.330> we<00:03:48.510> close

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
the way up the tube and then we close

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.350 
the way up the tube and then we close
the<00:03:48.930> lid<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.860> we<00:03:50.190> have<00:03:50.340> our<00:03:50.520> sample<00:03:50.820> vial<00:03:51.210> to

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
the lid and we have our sample vial to

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.260 
the lid and we have our sample vial to
turn<00:03:51.960> in<00:03:52.170> for<00:03:52.380> microbiology<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.850> should

turn in for microbiology that should

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.190 
turn in for microbiology that should
whatever<00:03:55.550> organism<00:03:56.550> grows<00:03:57.300> should<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:58.020> the
