00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.610 
surgery so if you were having two or
more<00:02:35.540> operations<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.310> suggest<00:02:38.239> that

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
more operations that and suggest that

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.330 
more operations that and suggest that
probably<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:41.570> were<00:02:41.900> in<00:02:42.170> some<00:02:42.500> way<00:02:42.709> sick<00:02:43.130> now

probably you were in some way sick now
it's<00:02:43.489> possible<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.060> those<00:02:44.360> two<00:02:44.600> operations

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
it's possible that those two operations

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.259 
it's possible that those two operations
were<00:02:46.720> ear<00:02:47.720> tubes<00:02:49.750> once<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.050> then<00:02:52.269> thompson's

well<00:03:26.069> at<00:03:26.250> night<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.739> doesn't<00:03:29.040> perform

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190

up<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.780> expectations<00:03:30.780> during<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.260> day<00:03:31.410> so

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
up to expectations during the day so

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.770 
up to expectations during the day so
it's<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.459> hard<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.760> know<00:03:32.910> what<00:03:33.209> because<00:03:33.720> of

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
it's it's hard to know what because of

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.670 
it's it's hard to know what because of
the<00:03:34.110> learning<00:03:34.440> disability<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:37.230> we<00:03:37.380> can't

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
the learning disability is so we can't

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.220 
the learning disability is so we can't
say<00:03:38.069> that<00:03:38.280> it's<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.610> anesthetic<00:03:39.360> per<00:03:39.720> se<00:03:39.989> that

say that it's the anesthetic per se that
caused<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.890> we<00:03:41.730> are<00:03:41.849> trying<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.360> follow<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.930> or

follow-up study right now where we are

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
kids who had an anaesthetic with a kid -

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.460 
kids who had an anaesthetic with a kid -
who<00:03:55.590> has<00:03:56.000> similar<00:03:57.000> medical<00:03:57.420> problems<00:03:58.140> that

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
did not get an anaesthetic and see if we

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.780 
did not get an anaesthetic and see if we
can<00:04:02.310> tease<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.330> out<00:04:03.900> parents<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.160> their

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
can tease that out parents and their

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.220 
can tease that out parents and their
physicians<00:04:06.390> need<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:07.230> balance<00:04:08.989> some<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.110> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
kinds of normal decisions that we all go

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.979 
kinds of normal decisions that we all go
through<00:04:13.590> when<00:04:14.040> we<00:04:14.069> decide<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.819> have<00:04:14.989> surgery

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
through when we decide to have surgery

through when we decide to have surgery
for<00:04:16.530> one<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.370> our<00:04:17.489> children<00:04:18.979> what<00:04:19.979> we<00:04:20.130> want<00:04:20.340> to

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
for one of our children what we want to

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.469 
for one of our children what we want to
be<00:04:20.549> careful<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:22.320> not<00:04:22.410> do<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.539> I<00:04:26.120> think<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.360> way

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
be careful and not do is I think a way

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.120 
be careful and not do is I think a way
to<00:04:27.539> look<00:04:27.720> at<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.260> we<00:04:28.410> want<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.710> be<00:04:28.770> careful

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
to look at this is we want to be careful

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.300 
to look at this is we want to be careful
about<00:04:29.220> unintended<00:04:30.000> consequence<00:04:30.840> for<00:04:31.710> example

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
about unintended consequence for example

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.920 
about unintended consequence for example
if<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.880> child<00:04:33.210> one<00:04:33.419> of<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.570> more<00:04:33.720> frequent

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
if a child one of the more frequent

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.520 
if a child one of the more frequent
procedures<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:34.890> children<00:04:35.250> undergo<00:04:35.700> is

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
procedures that children undergo is

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.370 
procedures that children undergo is
tubes<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:37.770> their<00:04:37.950> ears<00:04:38.390> if<00:04:39.390> we<00:04:39.690> were<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.990> delay

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
tubes in their ears if we were to delay

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.310 
tubes in their ears if we were to delay
placing<00:04:41.220> tubes<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:41.910> children's<00:04:42.390> ears<00:04:42.810> they

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
placing tubes in children's ears they

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.460 
placing tubes in children's ears they
may<00:04:43.560> have<00:04:44.270> hearing<00:04:45.270> problems<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:46.080> because

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
may have hearing problems and because

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.200 
may have hearing problems and because
they<00:04:46.680> have<00:04:46.860> hearing<00:04:47.220> problems<00:04:47.610> they<00:04:47.820> may<00:04:48.000> have

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
they have hearing problems they may have

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.810 
they have hearing problems they may have
language<00:04:48.690> delay<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.490> because<00:04:50.490> they<00:04:50.669> have

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
language delay and because they have

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.400 
language delay and because they have
language<00:04:51.240> delay<00:04:51.570> they<00:04:51.840> may<00:04:51.990> have<00:04:52.200> learning

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
language delay they may have learning

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.890 
language delay they may have learning
disability<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:54.030> we<00:04:54.180> want<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.450> be<00:04:54.539> careful

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
disability so we want to be careful

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.680 
disability so we want to be careful
about<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:56.039> unintended<00:04:56.669> consequences<00:04:57.630> of

about the unintended consequences of

about the unintended consequences of
delaying<00:04:58.260> surgeries<00:04:58.979> that<00:04:59.160> we<00:05:00.090> would<00:05:00.300> have

delaying surgeries that we would have

delaying surgeries that we would have
done<00:05:00.660> otherwise<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:02.430> would<00:05:02.880> emphasize<00:05:03.060> again

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
done otherwise I would emphasize again

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.570 
done otherwise I would emphasize again
that<00:05:04.050> it's

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
that it's

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.749 
that it's
it's<00:05:05.090> too<00:05:05.449> early<00:05:05.479> for<00:05:05.960> us<00:05:06.289> to<00:05:06.620> make<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:07.639> make

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
it's too early for us to make to make

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.960 
it's too early for us to make to make
any<00:05:08.090> recommendations<00:05:08.960> about<00:05:09.400> changing<00:05:10.400> the
