become<00:02:05.790> clear<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.410> meet<00:02:07.590> starts<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
become clear and then the meet starts to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.729 
become clear and then the meet starts to
become<00:02:08.310> sort<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.849> country<00:02:09.119> then<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
