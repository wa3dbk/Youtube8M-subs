00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.260
 hi friends from youtube good today we are going to 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.230
 do in this new tutorial of courses 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.960
 labor or snacks that is pretty little 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.210
 usual but it is exquisite and with which 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.250
 they are going to show off with their friends and 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.699
 guests in this case we are talking 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.300
 pumpkin seeds or pumpkin 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.430
 baked in the oven with salts left 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.280
 exactly in really good is not 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.309
 exactly but in the style similar to 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.400
 Peanuts and entity very crispy and are very 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.070
 tasty in fact there is a signature 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.989
 commercial which is enough for me 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.830
 to do this I can not be so 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.890
 difficult I saw that they sold cashews 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.530
 peanuts and seeds of lapacho and good 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.110
 let's see if this toasted and with salt 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.799
 it works so it works perfect in this 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.979
 I'm making a vegetable soup 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.299
 and as a surplus of course they are not going to 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.450
 be exclusively because it does not have 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.890
 meaning but we have the seeds of 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.700
 zapallo that we are going to be withdrawing 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.990
 separating the look that throws 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.210
 all this kind of squash remains and 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.070
 you have to clean it but not too much 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.380
 because later in the oven 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.890
 this begins to disintegrate and they are left 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.890
 only the crisp geneticists like that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.550
 how good are we going to get all the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.270
 possible seeds we are going to put them in 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.700
 a few more moments in a container 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 metal preferably Teflon ado for 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 keep it from sticking 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.320
 We are going to spread them well and on that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.810
 let's put salt 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.030
 just a little salt up good 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.550
 It gives you enough and then in any case 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.130
 much access they take the seeds and they 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.810
 they remove them and that we are going to put in the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.920
 fire to soft fire and we will go 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.289
 shaking so it does not get stuck 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.360
 at the bottom preferably with a 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.570
 spatula in this case like this cloned 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.390
 It has to be a plastic spatula 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.070
 if it's not plastic type to go 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.520
 stirring and not sticking 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.770
 well let's get down to work 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.630
 very well we have reality then all 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.880
 the seeds of a single pumpkin 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.760
 notice the important castilla that in a 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.620
 Bol is a pretty interesting quantity 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.930
 not to chop with any service besides 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.000
 if you do it with a squash with 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.610
 two pumpkins and rejoinder is an amount 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.250
 even more interesting if we are going to 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.750
 salt generously by 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.880
 Of course we recommend salt with low sodium 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.850
 for the subject of depressions some 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.760
 people 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.220
 but well let's put it so that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.470
 get impregnated as we do not clean this 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.880
 in fact there is still a little bit of 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.050
 pumpkin goop 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:11.110
 the salt sticks pretty well then 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.110
 let's shake those a little 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.020
 we have already turned on the oven 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.590
 in low temperature if a little while ago 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:26.270
 is the hot oven and we add a 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.030
 little salt and here we have after 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.750
 to move, we are going to put it 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.390
 then baked to go 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.820
 beginning to brown and dry are going to go 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.450
 noticing that they are browned basically we are going to 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.450
 leave it 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:49.670
 and at 5 minutes the oven removed 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.330
 and notice that they are already 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.330
 dry 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.100
 those who have practically stuck 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.800
 we move them a bit simply so that 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.780
 they go down changing the face that gives against the 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.640
 metal 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.690
 let's wait for it to be roasted in a 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.180
 a little more 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.180
 add a little more salt 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.049
 and we put it back in the oven for 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.019
 a few more minutes until they start 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.449
 get a little more golden and they will stay 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.290
 absolutely crunchy and they are a 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.900
 delight highly recommended as for 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.389
 surprise relatives and friends back 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.389
 baked for a few more minutes 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.490
 and the moment of truth arrives then 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.409
 let's go 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.179
 the spicy seeds 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.370
 as happy as they are absolutely 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:53.449
 dry 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:58.280
 we saved it were a little bit and look 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:01.520
 listen to the crisps that are good 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.270
 a delight really to take advantage 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.270
