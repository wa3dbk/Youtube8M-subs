00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 It is 【God】 thing 【ぇ ど る】. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 I would like to comment on the captions (subtitles) this time as well. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Nice to meet you. 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.350
 This stage is "Action Mode 2" of "Marana". 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 Although it is "magic prohibited", I will show you what kind of magic it is. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 This is a dead end ... 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Immediately, this is the biggest challenge! 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 To break through here with "no damage", you have to avoid the attack in perfect steps. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 However, it is difficult to explain it in text, so please use this video as a reference if you like. 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.750
 I managed to break through w 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 This enemy is dangerous if it gets too close. 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.050
 I will measure the timing firmly. 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 Let's jump and jump! 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.750
 From here, there are "right" and "left" routes, but "right" is a little easier, so let's go "left" this time! 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.550
 Let's kill this enemy before flying around! 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 You also need to follow the steps here. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Let's attack "Grim Reaper" while facing the other side! 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 This ball can be touched when electricity is not running. 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.700
 It is "immediate death" when touching this "Harri" w 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 Somehow the enemy is falling, so let's move to the central foothold! 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100
 Here we join the “right” route. 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.900
 I also measure the timing firmly here. 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.450
 Since this is a dead end, let's run to the left at the best timing! 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 I managed to break through w 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.930
 If you don't jump like this, you will hit the Grim Reaper directly. 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
 It is finally a "boss game"! 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.100
 Snake King Kalia: With six arms on Boscobra's head in ACT2 in Marana. It is a part of Satan and was born from the root of Satan 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.100
 The only chance of attacking this boss is "when the boss falls" or "ascends on the foot of the fallen platform". 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.600
 ※ When using magic, "Magic of stardust" ・ "Magic of aura" is effective 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.600
 By the way, when guiding the boss to come down, if it is "directly below", it will attack the light, so let's wait in the vicinity of the "left flame". 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.100
 In addition, let's cut the number of times to "5 times". 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400
 I won't get in on the invitation by a slight gap of the standing position ... 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400
 Let's decide the last blow cool! 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.390
 I won't take the invitation again ... 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200
 ...... 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 By the way, this is ... 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Abune! ? 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 Go! 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.900
 The last last minute w 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.800
 This clears "Action mode 2" of "Marana". 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.300
 Therefore, you have cleared "Marana". 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.100
 It has never been broken even once ... 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.100
 ... Really? 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.100
 ※ We show the whole of "town" 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.600
 Fixedly narrow w 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.200
 Goodbye! People of "Marana"! 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.300
 Move to the next district "Northwall". 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.800
 Thank you for your viewing. Let's look forward to Part 16!
