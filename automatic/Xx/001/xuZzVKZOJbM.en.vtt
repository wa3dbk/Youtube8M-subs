00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.360 

okay<00:00:04.750> so<00:00:04.810> the<00:00:05.680> whites<00:00:05.890> finished<00:00:06.250> fermenting

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
okay so the whites finished fermenting

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.690 
okay so the whites finished fermenting
we've<00:00:07.180> seen<00:00:07.509> their<00:00:07.720> life<00:00:07.960> of<00:00:08.400> bubbles<00:00:09.400> coming

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
we've seen their life of bubbles coming

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.700 
we've seen their life of bubbles coming
through<00:00:09.910> through<00:00:10.510> the<00:00:10.690> airlock

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710 
through through the airlock

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.470 
through through the airlock
that's<00:00:12.190> actually<00:00:12.550> stopped<00:00:12.850> there<00:00:13.030> completely

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
that's actually stopped there completely

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.859 
that's actually stopped there completely
we<00:00:14.290> can<00:00:14.470> see<00:00:14.769> the<00:00:15.100> wine<00:00:15.309> is<00:00:15.550> just<00:00:15.970> starting<00:00:16.630> to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
we can see the wine is just starting to

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.779 
we can see the wine is just starting to
loosen<00:00:17.650> a<00:00:17.740> little<00:00:17.980> bit<00:00:18.099> of<00:00:18.189> its<00:00:18.369> cloudy

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
loosen a little bit of its cloudy

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.120 
loosen a little bit of its cloudy
appearance<00:00:19.019> and<00:00:20.019> we've<00:00:20.169> also<00:00:20.380> done<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.919> final

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
appearance and we've also done the final

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.509 
appearance and we've also done the final
SG<00:00:21.669> check<00:00:21.999> now<00:00:22.929> the<00:00:22.989> SG<00:00:23.499> is<00:00:23.529> showing<00:00:24.039> us<00:00:24.220> that

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
SG check now the SG is showing us that

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.460 
SG check now the SG is showing us that
we're<00:00:24.669> actually<00:00:24.880> at<00:00:25.210> ninety<00:00:25.570> nine<00:00:25.720> three<00:00:26.140> and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
we're actually at ninety nine three and

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.499 
we're actually at ninety nine three and
have<00:00:27.039> been<00:00:27.249> for<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.550> last<00:00:27.669> two<00:00:27.939> or<00:00:27.970> three<00:00:28.089> days

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
have been for the last two or three days

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.169 
have been for the last two or three days
so<00:00:29.439> we<00:00:29.619> know<00:00:29.829> the<00:00:29.980> fermentation<00:00:30.759> is<00:00:30.819> well<00:00:31.029> and

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
so we know the fermentation is well and

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.919 
so we know the fermentation is well and
truly<00:00:31.210> finished

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
truly finished

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.440 
truly finished
so<00:00:32.770> what<00:00:32.950> we're<00:00:33.130> now<00:00:33.310> going<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.579> do<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:34.239> we're

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
so what we're now going to do is we're

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.810 
so what we're now going to do is we're
going<00:00:34.540> to<00:00:34.600> let<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.899> stabilizer<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
going to let the stabilizer the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.000 
going to let the stabilizer the
stabilizer<00:00:37.359> is<00:00:37.629> just<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:37.930> mixture<00:00:38.109> of<00:00:38.379> sodium

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
stabilizer is just a mixture of sodium

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.000 
stabilizer is just a mixture of sodium
metabisulfite<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:40.210> potassium<00:00:40.690> sorbate

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
metabisulfite and potassium sorbate

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.040 
metabisulfite and potassium sorbate
Soviet<00:00:42.010> metabisulfite<00:00:42.340> will<00:00:43.210> prevent<00:00:43.660> any

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
Soviet metabisulfite will prevent any

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.410 
Soviet metabisulfite will prevent any
infections<00:00:44.920> coming<00:00:45.309> into<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.640> wine<00:00:45.820> and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
infections coming into the wine and

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.520 
infections coming into the wine and
potassium<00:00:47.050> sorbate

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
potassium sorbate

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.799 
potassium sorbate
is<00:00:47.949> going<00:00:48.219> to<00:00:48.280> stop<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.640> fermentation<00:00:48.820> ever

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
is going to stop the fermentation ever

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.349 
is going to stop the fermentation ever
taking<00:00:50.379> place<00:00:50.589> again<00:00:51.010> but<00:00:51.699> for<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.329> work

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
taking place again but for that to work

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.590 
taking place again but for that to work
effectively<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.920> fermentation<00:00:54.789> doesn't

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
effectively the fermentation doesn't

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.139 
effectively the fermentation doesn't
have<00:00:55.749> to<00:00:55.870> be<00:00:56.019> one<00:00:56.199> truly<00:00:56.679> finished<00:00:57.039> so<00:00:57.910> without

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
have to be one truly finished so without

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:09.180 
have to be one truly finished so without
this<00:01:02.249> and<00:01:03.249> then<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.970> can<00:01:07.150> see<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:08.190> think

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
this and then just you can see I think

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.080 
this and then just you can see I think
you've<00:01:09.310> seen<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:09.640> before

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
you've seen this before

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.410 
you've seen this before
again<00:01:10.630> we<00:01:10.780> just<00:01:10.900> cleaned<00:01:11.170> up<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.440> get<00:01:12.300> in<00:01:13.300> the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
again we just cleaned up you get in the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:24.480 
again we just cleaned up you get in the
end<00:01:13.480> of<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.720> drone<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.740> there<00:01:23.920> see<00:01:24.400> how

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
end of the drone not in there see how

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:33.940 
end of the drone not in there see how
useful<00:01:24.730> this<00:01:25.000> little<00:01:25.270> top<00:01:25.480> means<00:01:25.720> as<00:01:25.990> well

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:46.359 

and<00:01:34.759> then<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.390> realistic

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.340 

and<00:01:47.369> we'll<00:01:47.520> repeat<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.080> probably<00:01:49.080> three<00:01:49.320> or

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and we'll repeat that probably three or

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.850 
and we'll repeat that probably three or
four<00:01:49.409> times<00:01:49.740> throughout<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> day<00:01:51.680> in<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
four times throughout the day in the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.289 
four times throughout the day in the
course<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.280> next<00:01:53.430> 24<00:01:53.939> hours<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.509> then

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
course of the next 24 hours and then

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
course of the next 24 hours and then
we'll<00:01:57.299> add<00:01:57.420> our<00:01:57.540> findings<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.560> done<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
we'll add our findings I have done that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.770 
we'll add our findings I have done that
I<00:01:59.100> did<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> obviously<00:01:59.909> before<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.299> started

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
I did that obviously before we started

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.070 
I did that obviously before we started
so<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.700> work<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> findings

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
so I'm now going to work at the findings

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.590 
so I'm now going to work at the findings
to<00:02:04.380> States<00:02:04.979> findings<00:02:05.430> are<00:02:06.000> thing<00:02:06.240> will<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.539> in

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
to States findings are thing will go in

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
to States findings are thing will go in
at<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> start<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.860> again<00:02:08.100> we'll<00:02:08.220> swap<00:02:08.429> that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
at the start so again we'll swap that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.660 
at the start so again we'll swap that
into<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.080> into<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.350> container<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:11.340> add

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
into there into the container just add

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.699 
into there into the container just add
that<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.800> again<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.280> little<00:02:14.790> bit<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.709> guessing

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
that and again a little bit of guessing

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:33.830 
that and again a little bit of guessing
up<00:02:27.440> nicely<00:02:28.440> fold<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.100> findings<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.660> then

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
up nicely fold in the findings and then

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.729 
up nicely fold in the findings and then
tomorrow<00:02:34.519> we<00:02:35.519> had<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.569> extra<00:02:36.810> large

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
tomorrow we had the extra large

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.030 
tomorrow we had the extra large
sashenka<00:02:38.250> findings<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.200> again<00:02:40.530> just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
sashenka findings so that again just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.100 
sashenka findings so that again just
wants<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.459> gently<00:02:41.760> folded<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:42.810> not<00:02:43.080> a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
wants to be gently folded in it's not a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.050 
wants to be gently folded in it's not a
heavy<00:02:43.350> risk<00:02:43.709> like<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.459> have<00:02:44.640> done<00:02:44.819> with<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
heavy risk like we have done with the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.330 
heavy risk like we have done with the
first<00:02:45.180> one<00:02:45.510> fermentation<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:47.160> well

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
first one fermentation that as well

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.949 
first one fermentation that as well
through<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.700> finish<00:02:47.910> with<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.330> gas<00:02:48.660> state

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
through the finish with the gas state

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.319 
through the finish with the gas state
with<00:02:49.470> ever<00:02:49.620> no<00:02:49.799> findings<00:02:50.340> what<00:02:51.090> we're<00:02:51.209> going

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
with ever no findings what we're going
