00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.710
 timo letschert made saturday night 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 against heracles almelo his debut in the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.820
 fc groningen's first team duel 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920
 against the all- powerful was also for him 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.030
 a very first official competition 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.030
 professional football 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.609
 I quietly after them I went red 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 was not too nervous and I think I 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.539
 just rest the game was played 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.680
 i have my level go i think the zero 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.150
 held I am very happy with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.150
 natural three points so you can do better 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 it deserves to play and that he 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.130
 picked up well 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.230
 don't start playing them familiar game 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.030
 I must have shot some balls away 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.989
 which is the start of ours 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.510
 but let it getting better in the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.879
 match did an excellent job 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.440
 what is his trust game ah is whole 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 very good at the ball, he is calm 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 the ball he can slide 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.260
 he 'll be the pretty fast but he yes that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.300
 star will begin a few times that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.070
 what a quiet one 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.130
 number of times ball loss even do not think 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.479
 used to it but it picked it up 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.740
 german own the second monitor 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.020
 for a better spawn you must of course 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.360
 just enter the match and as soon as you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.770
 Just tell your balls well processable 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.910
 but you sport good balls 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.080
 but you are also a personal one there 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.520
 are you just make it a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 normal match is like all others 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.330
 and then and then maybe I can 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.330
 actually been there longer 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.840
 central defender you started on 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.500
 another position midfielder more 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.939
 offensive 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.549
 when the name decided on the promise 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.960
 to turn your central defense 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.970
 because I think that was two or three 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.679
 weeks before the winter break 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.810
 then twente played out with the promise 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.280
 then I stood there for the first time and 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.330
 then it went well 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.489
 and actually since then I have been there 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.140
 actually only stood and therefore 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.190
 actually got better with this 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.040
 as a result tasty 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.790
 did an excellent job and 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.620
 of course you have to be such a boy 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.080
 once in a while help with steffano 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.319
 on the other hand we have guys 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.760
 Occasionally take a little bit of that 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.260
 comes purely from the coaching from 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.269
 choose position 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.500
 I didn't have to tell him how 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.819
 you grab the ball on how you 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.430
 he heads is the way I pitch 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.380
 done in it clicks well today so 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.480
 we normally shot away or undertook 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 we let the coal between the fingers 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.830
 he must say is it me merchant 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.750
 well this game but helped 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.860
 I constantly run coaching and I have whole 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.970
 much to it and and you see it 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.040
 We still have results and 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.390
 so won so that they are most important short 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.580
 before the end of the game hit 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.799
 injured in a sprint duel 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.230
 let's fall and have severe pain 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.549
 driving looks serious i have i 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.410
 just author Tuesday seriously 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.730
 but it's really just cramp but 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.739
 my foot I was not really say 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.440
 but so yes I am not the other way around stupid 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.880
 just actually and therefore seemed to 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.940
 serious then really was only once 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.940
 come
