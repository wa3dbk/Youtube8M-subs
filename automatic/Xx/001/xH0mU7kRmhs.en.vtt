00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello to everyone and welcome back here on vinsero 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.340
 with ray man legends today we will deal with 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.550
 of the second world 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 obviously we begin with the entrance is a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.150
 slightly smaller world is there is a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.330
 level less than in the world number 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.820
 a teens in trouble the world is called 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.250
 croaking story and this is the first one 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 level 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.399
 prey and plant it and plant it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.890
 beans brings us into a world where 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.020
 in fact there are giant beans 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.860
 of the huge bean plants in the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.160
 which fluttering flutter is one of the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 passwords of these of these 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.920
 internships as you can see there are a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.960
 everywhere the big currents everywhere 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 air that allow us thanks to the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.670
 glide I would say man that is holding down 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 the jump button while in flight of 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.200
 fly by helicopter and then by 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.200
 go up using these currents 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:17.520
 climb that push us towards it 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:22.320
 upwards we now do a little 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.619
 behind the front and a dive and we destroy 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.619
 this mushroom maybe just for the funny 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.130
 noise that makes meanwhile we find the first 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.130
 secret room 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.400
 I recommend using these plants and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.439
 blue and above all, try to 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.439
 fly to collect as much as possible 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:49.799
 possible we eventually found the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.759
 the reggina the reggina of the level la 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:59.460
 see here with his big eyes that he gives us 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.509
 a basin and gives us a heart yes 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.119
 keep it going 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.970
 continue down another easy one 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.300
 bathroom and releasing the second team of the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.060
 of the level and now with a little bit of 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.270
 helicopter we try to reach the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.070
 purple rum so that it can 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.940
 color all the others by making them 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:28.390
 then worth double and even giving us 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:32.170
 so double the rum at the end of di 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.530
 this combo of characters the second 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.380
 team was recoverable from here now 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.760
 we try to go up 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.490
 we destroy two or three things e 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.850
 let's continue the enemies that are present 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.870
 here are quite clumsy frogs and 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.390
 funny as is tradition on the other hand is 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.610
 below there are these enemies these 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.170
 ugly and pincers they try to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.840
 grab the frogs on stilts here 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.400
 we try to collect that on doubloon there 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.610
 let's stop here for a moment so that 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.650
 the hand goes away and then we go back up 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:16.170
 with our third team propeller move 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.120
 recovered here there are some frogs 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.209
 paratroopers who launch themselves towards 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.910
 towards us 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.370
 remember that this parachute fan that 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.709
 also acts as a platform here before 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.340
 continue try to rise to the top 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:37.299
 you will see the camera move upwards 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.580
 you too with you and then you can find 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.840
 the second and last secret room of the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.299
 level this is a little bit more 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.580
 particular because you have to hit 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.730
 this ball when you are at the apex of 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.850
 jump to make it bounce and make that 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.440
 destroy the gabri cage in which it was 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.510
 enclosed the king of the teams you go up yes 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.420
 will enter into these holes 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.420
 inside the plant 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.049
 here you see these thorny plants these 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.670
 shrubs move in some cases come out 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.060
 out of a bit out of nowhere so you need to 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.709
 make enough to be careful enough 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.049
 to avoid colliding 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.949
 let's get back some of it in the meantime here 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.710
 take another little heart if you can 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.120
 so remember to always leave 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.710
 collect the looks from the purple one in 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.669
 so that it also gradually transforms 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.550
 the other other teen here I recommend 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.660
 see here on the right there will be a 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.970
 hole 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.669
 now we have stopped for a moment for 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.819
 gather that this series of him is 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.979
 among other things, neither too well nor here 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:52.919
 find a team this maybe on the team anymore 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:56.280
 hard to see of level one 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:00.690
 kick to this frog the shield is not 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:06.800
 served not so much here as usual combo 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:09.990
 a smelly mushroom is known about him 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.330
 see also these frogs go up towards 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.210
 up using the open parachute 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.039
 a rather simple position team 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.539
 both to be recovered as well as from 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.300
 to see 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.699
 the shield in this case has meant that 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.650
 we in salissimo on it and see here 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.680
 there are also stilts and stilts 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:35.070
 can be destroyed and can be 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.840
 then shoot down the enemies another team 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.810
 slightly more complex to recover 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:45.960
 without being hit a nice combo of 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:48.960
 he and now he travels serene towards the 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.370
 the end of the itanes stage are all there 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.469
 we just have to go in and 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:58.889
 collect all the looks we have 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:02.159
 collected in the usual 150 level 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:05.789
 bronze cup 300 usual cup 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:11.070
 silver 450 the usual ticket 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:14.090
 lucky charm scratch card and at 600 la 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.090
 usual gold medal 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:27.139
 then we return to the world 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:30.810
 main rayman exits the framework e 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:35.339
 all the various teams are added to the al 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:38.880
 our to our collection by going to 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:40.169
 also unlock several other pictures for 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.510
 the next paintings we give you an appointment 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.510
 to in a few seconds with another video
