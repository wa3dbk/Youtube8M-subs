00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
hey this is WT Jeffrey at a Glen rainy

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.810 
hey this is WT Jeffrey at a Glen rainy
farm<00:00:10.550> and<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:12.330> you're<00:00:12.480> looking<00:00:12.750> at<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.820> a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
farm and what you're looking at is a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.429 
farm and what you're looking at is a
natural<00:00:15.690> way<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:17.420> eliminate<00:00:18.439> Yellowjackets

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
natural way to eliminate Yellowjackets

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.460 
natural way to eliminate Yellowjackets
without<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> use<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.100> pesticides<00:00:21.470> we've

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
without the use of pesticides we've

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.550 
without the use of pesticides we've
tried<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.689> for<00:00:24.689> several<00:00:25.019> years<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.470> really

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
tried this for several years it's really

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.250 
tried this for several years it's really
very<00:00:26.010> effective<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.730> found<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.260> pretty

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
very effective we found a pretty

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
very effective we found a pretty
good-sized<00:00:28.680> Yellow<00:00:29.039> Jacket<00:00:29.460> nest<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
good-sized Yellow Jacket nest in the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:38.030 
good-sized Yellow Jacket nest in the
back<00:00:30.750> field<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:33.590> well<00:00:34.590> most<00:00:35.960> most<00:00:36.960> insects<00:00:37.829> we

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
back field and well most most insects we

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.310 
back field and well most most insects we
you<00:00:38.760> know<00:00:38.850> leave<00:00:39.030> alone<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.629> let<00:00:39.870> them<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you know leave alone and let them do the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.220 
you know leave alone and let them do the
thing<00:00:40.790> it's<00:00:41.790> an<00:00:41.969> important<00:00:42.360> partnership<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
thing it's an important partnership and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
thing it's an important partnership and
of<00:00:43.410> course<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.820> pesticides<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:47.329> going

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
of course the use of pesticides is going

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
of course the use of pesticides is going
to<00:00:48.420> kill<00:00:48.600> lots<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.989> good<00:00:49.289> insects<00:00:49.770> like

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to kill lots of good insects like

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.650 
to kill lots of good insects like
honeybees<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.940> other<00:00:53.149> insects<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.270> help

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
honeybees and other insects that help

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.619 
honeybees and other insects that help
pollinate<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.649> crops<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:57.180> lots<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.480> good

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
pollinate your crops and do lots of good

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.010 
pollinate your crops and do lots of good
things<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.879> we<00:00:59.879> came<00:01:00.180> across<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> few

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
things and we came across this a few

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.100 
things and we came across this a few
years<00:01:01.199> ago<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.629> very<00:01:03.960> very

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
years ago and it's really very very

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.270 
years ago and it's really very very
effective<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.799> takes<00:01:05.070> two<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.000> three<00:01:06.119> days

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
effective and it takes two or three days

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
effective and it takes two or three days
but<00:01:08.360> what<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:11.659> clear<00:01:12.659> glass

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
but what we have is a clear glass

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.149 
but what we have is a clear glass
actually<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.310> big<00:01:14.490> vase<00:01:14.840> and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
actually I think it's a big vase and

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
actually I think it's a big vase and
it's<00:01:17.159> got<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> very<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.970> know<00:01:18.000> wide<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.530> know

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it's got a very you know wide you know

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's got a very you know wide you know
bottom<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> top<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:26.180> what<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
bottom but like the top and what you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.429 
bottom but like the top and what you
want<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.900> once<00:01:28.229> you've<00:01:28.350> identified

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
want to do is once you've identified

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.920 
want to do is once you've identified
your<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.790> Yellow<00:01:30.030> Jacket<00:01:30.420> nest<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.810> will

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
your your Yellow Jacket nest it will

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.399 
your your Yellow Jacket nest it will
usually<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> ground<00:01:31.799> it'll<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> hole

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
usually be in the ground it'll be a hole

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.760 
usually be in the ground it'll be a hole
it'll<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:34.530> down<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> good<00:01:35.130> ways<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
it'll go down in there a good ways and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.649 
it'll go down in there a good ways and
so<00:01:37.770> what<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.030> procedure

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
so what we do is that this procedure

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.700 
so what we do is that this procedure
here<00:01:40.049> actually<00:01:40.350> tricks<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> Yellowjackets

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
here actually tricks the Yellowjackets

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
here actually tricks the Yellowjackets
the<00:01:43.710> clear<00:01:43.979> glass<00:01:44.220> allows<00:01:44.670> sunlight<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.360> get

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the clear glass allows sunlight to get

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.020 
the clear glass allows sunlight to get
in<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:47.880> don't

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
in and they really they really don't

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.310 
in and they really they really don't
know<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.360> they're<00:01:48.750> trapped<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:51.320> they

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
know that they're trapped and they

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.230 
know that they're trapped and they
basically<00:01:52.920> over<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> period<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.880> couple<00:01:53.939> of

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
basically over a period of a couple of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.670 
basically over a period of a couple of
three<00:01:54.509> days<00:01:54.659> or<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.259> starve<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> death

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
three days or so will starve to death

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.840 
three days or so will starve to death
they<00:01:56.009> won't<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.310> able<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> feed<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> Queen

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
they won't be able to feed the Queen

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.889 
they won't be able to feed the Queen
certain<00:01:59.850> times<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.299> day<00:02:00.360> you'll<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.869> just

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
certain times of the day you'll see just

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.660 
certain times of the day you'll see just
hundreds<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.770> them<00:02:01.920> flying<00:02:02.189> around<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.549> there

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
hundreds of them flying around in there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.940 
hundreds of them flying around in there
and<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.060> there's<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.450> few<00:02:03.950> but

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and right now there's just a few but

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.230 
and right now there's just a few but
they'll<00:02:05.130> fly<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.579> nest<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.969> fly<00:02:06.180> around

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
they'll fly to the nest and fly around

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.469 
they'll fly to the nest and fly around
inside<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> glass<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> little<00:02:07.710> while<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
inside the glass for a little while and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.680 
inside the glass for a little while and
then<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.720> will<00:02:10.910> go<00:02:11.910> back<00:02:11.940> down<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> nest

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
then they will go back down in the nest

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.339 
then they will go back down in the nest
and

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
and

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.289 
and
try<00:02:13.799> again<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.340> they'll<00:02:15.090> wear<00:02:15.269> themselves

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
try again and they'll wear themselves

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.069 
try again and they'll wear themselves
out<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.109> there<00:02:16.859> they're<00:02:17.249> just<00:02:17.519> not<00:02:18.079> they're

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
out and there they're just not they're

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.610 
out and there they're just not they're
just<00:02:19.349> not<00:02:19.439> smart<00:02:19.650> enough<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:22.319> know<00:02:22.409> dig

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
just not smart enough to you know dig

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.959 
just not smart enough to you know dig
their<00:02:22.769> way<00:02:22.799> out<00:02:22.920> or<00:02:23.189> anything<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.579> that<00:02:23.639> now

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
their way out or anything like that now

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.989 
their way out or anything like that now
there's<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> few<00:02:24.620> stragglers<00:02:25.819> flying<00:02:26.819> around

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:26.999 
there's a few stragglers flying around

on the outside those are the ones that
were<00:02:29.639> still<00:02:29.939> out<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.239> nest<00:02:30.420> last<00:02:30.689> night

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
were still out of the nest last night

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.280 
were still out of the nest last night
you<00:02:32.280> always<00:02:32.549> if<00:02:32.790> you're<00:02:32.909> if<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.480> you'll

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you always if you're if you you'll

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
seeing them fly in and out of the ground

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.209 
seeing them fly in and out of the ground

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
but once you've identified the hole

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.220 
but once you've identified the hole

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
with this one so it's just sitting on

the<00:03:16.650> ground<00:03:16.859> pressed<00:03:17.759> down<00:03:17.970> as<00:03:18.090> tight<00:03:18.269> as<00:03:18.389> I

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
the ground pressed down as tight as I

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:22.429 
the ground pressed down as tight as I

could get it against the ground and you

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.960 
could get it against the ground and you
may<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.859> take<00:03:22.979> a<00:03:23.040> little<00:03:23.280> bit<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.549> dirt<00:03:23.759> or

may have to take a little bit of dirt or
something<00:03:24.389> like<00:03:24.509> that<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:25.019> make<00:03:25.169> it<00:03:25.319> level<00:03:25.560> and

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
something like that to make it level and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.490 
something like that to make it level and
and<00:03:27.030> make<00:03:27.299> sure<00:03:27.479> that<00:03:27.689> the<00:03:27.810> bottom<00:03:28.139> is<00:03:28.259> nice

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
and make sure that the bottom is nice

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.869 
and make sure that the bottom is nice
and<00:03:28.709> snug<00:03:28.889> so<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:30.120> they<00:03:30.209> can't<00:03:30.419> crawl<00:03:30.689> out

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
and snug so that they can't crawl out

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.569 
and snug so that they can't crawl out
but<00:03:32.879> that's<00:03:33.090> about<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.379> the<00:03:34.379> Yellow<00:03:35.129> Jackets

but that's about it the Yellow Jackets
will<00:03:35.759> just<00:03:36.290> basically<00:03:37.290> starve<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.769> death

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:38.009 
will just basically starve to death

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.879 
will just basically starve to death
and<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.579> three<00:03:38.759> or<00:03:38.819> four<00:03:39.000> days<00:03:39.150> you'll<00:03:39.509> find<00:03:39.540> a
