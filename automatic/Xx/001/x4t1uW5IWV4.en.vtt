00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.980
 Vienna were up to date 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.100
 weak before fast 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.250
 JÃ¼lich 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.900
 I'll show you 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.699
 on a single medal 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.139
 we mainly clarify the movement strong colors 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.609
 Ulrich Veith left 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.420
 the pioneer came in very well 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
 at the beginning already points together in the passage 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 often show what he can wear the club 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.570
 the Sabah dance the show what he can the 8 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080
 that represent 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
 because a little more has to be asked here 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.240
 Lucerne 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 from the playoffs to the passage 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.090
 that affects 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.550
 Of course this can always be read 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.550
 the spirited Folk Schmidig APA 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.690
 Outsiders are so thrilling at doing a bit of it 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 Of course I'm pressing 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.529
 that will be now 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.599
 Not quite without excitement has been the color photos Bodo still in the basic game 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.929
 just to see Melville 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.929
 we have to go a bit very far 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.179
 a brilliant achievement who once sat on a horse that is one 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.919
 very little distract little 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.919
 Stamer to the southwest knows what to do 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.389
 around him then further back 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.269
 To see Hayley again 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.169
 unfortunately not quite so 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.639
 small points 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.639
 less more 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.009
 beautiful cows live 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.009
 Unfortunately, woodpeckers suffered from Fuchsstadt 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.979
 not one hundred percent focused on his rider but 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.009
 here and there too a bit too strong on that 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.009
 lorenz-strom around happens though it knows today 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.869
 November to 10 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.869
 not authorized to remain the squad 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.529
 slim the same 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.110
 again and again 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.509
 she has to work hard 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.169
 That certainly was not one hundred percent supervised first 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:10.900
 destroyed 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.059
 Giorgio at the end of June 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:15.339
 but initiate into the passage 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:19.919
 after the failure the only right thing done so on hereby i agree to that 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.240
 his knee 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 the pulled so no sense 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.610
 a great freestyle but unfortunately just a bit under the picture Strisch 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.279
 He was one hundred percent in the cause 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.139
 Patron doubt pulls
