hi everyone

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.580 

I<00:00:03.480> started<00:00:04.380> my<00:00:05.510> environmental<00:00:06.590> challenge

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.590 
I started my environmental challenge

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.690 
I started my environmental challenge
it's<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.310> seven<00:00:08.670> days<00:00:08.880> challenge<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.900> um<00:00:10.080> I

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
it's a seven days challenge and um I

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.060 
it's a seven days challenge and um I
mean<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.940> Isaac

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
mean we Isaac

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.030 
mean we Isaac
so<00:00:14.059> I<00:00:14.510> just<00:00:14.900> want<00:00:15.080> to<00:00:15.200> see<00:00:15.410> if<00:00:15.530> it<00:00:15.650> will<00:00:15.800> walk

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
so I just want to see if it will walk

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.850 
so I just want to see if it will walk
with<00:00:16.280> the<00:00:16.550> beep<00:00:16.730> on<00:00:17.060> because<00:00:17.930> this<00:00:18.590> is<00:00:18.770> the

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
with the beep on because this is the

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.050 
with the beep on because this is the
only<00:00:18.890> time<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:19.340> have<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:21.520> do<00:00:22.520> the<00:00:22.700> inversion

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
only time I have to do the inversion

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.810 
only time I have to do the inversion
method<00:00:23.810> because<00:00:24.710> I've<00:00:24.860> done<00:00:25.040> now<00:00:25.189> it's<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.670> bit

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
method because I've done now it's a bit

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.589 
method because I've done now it's a bit
Christmas<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.050> new<00:00:27.890> year<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.640> I<00:00:29.210> saw

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
Christmas and the new year and I saw

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.380 
Christmas and the new year and I saw
four<00:00:29.869> people<00:00:30.259> so<00:00:30.649> it<00:00:31.340> is<00:00:31.579> very<00:00:31.759> busy<00:00:32.060> during

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
four people so it is very busy during

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.110 
four people so it is very busy during
this<00:00:32.599> time

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
this time

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
this time
Erica<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.910> people<00:00:35.910> saw<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> lot<00:00:36.629> at<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> end<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
Erica so people saw a lot at the end of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.090 
Erica so people saw a lot at the end of
the<00:00:37.890> year<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.660> anyway<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.980> be

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the year so anyway I'm going to be

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.189 
the year so anyway I'm going to be
uploading<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.910> picture<00:00:42.480> or<00:00:43.290> video<00:00:43.949> of<00:00:44.570> me<00:00:45.570> doing

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
uploading a picture or video of me doing

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.799 
uploading a picture or video of me doing
the<00:00:46.649> advice<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.690> new<00:00:49.100> inversion<00:00:50.100> method

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
the advice or the new inversion method

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.680 
the advice or the new inversion method
that<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.839> have<00:00:52.019> like<00:00:52.699> yesterday<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.729> started<00:00:54.329> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that I have like yesterday I started it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.340 
that I have like yesterday I started it
so<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.260> uploaded<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.100> video<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.460> me<00:00:56.729> doing<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.350> but

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so I uploaded a video of me doing it but

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.139 
so I uploaded a video of me doing it but
I<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.710> sitting<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.159> at<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> edge<00:00:59.729> of<00:00:59.909> my<00:00:59.969> bed

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
I was sitting out at the edge of my bed

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.600 
I was sitting out at the edge of my bed
just<00:01:00.540> there<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.839> today<00:01:03.839> I<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.799> standing<00:01:05.460> up

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
just there so today I was standing up

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.560 
just there so today I was standing up
and<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.330> while<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.080> bend<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.009> my<00:01:08.160> head<00:01:08.570> down

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and like while we bend in my head down

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.749 
and like while we bend in my head down
so<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.649> I<00:01:10.800> will<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> next

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
so I think I will do that for the next

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.940 
so I think I will do that for the next
six<00:01:11.940> days<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.630> might<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.440> doing<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.770> for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
six days or I might be doing it for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
six days or I might be doing it for
seven<00:01:14.340> four<00:01:14.729> eight<00:01:14.880> days<00:01:15.300> instead<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.840> seven

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
seven four eight days instead of seven

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.859 
seven four eight days instead of seven
days<00:01:16.610> because<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.060> first<00:01:18.300> day<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.539> was<00:01:18.720> sitting

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
days because the first day I was sitting

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.290 
days because the first day I was sitting
down<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.560> today<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:21.000> standing

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
down so today I'm going to be standing

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.330 
down so today I'm going to be standing
up<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.659> will<00:01:21.780> show<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> how<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.979> did<00:01:23.159> that

and I'll put some link of if you need to
know<00:01:29.310> more<00:01:29.610> about<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.090> inversion<00:01:30.509> method<00:01:30.690> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
know more about the inversion method of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.360 
know more about the inversion method of
all<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.950> YouTube<00:01:32.340> video

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
all the YouTube video

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.390 
all the YouTube video
videos<00:01:33.730> that<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:34.390> like<00:01:34.750> more<00:01:35.260> from<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:36.310> I'm

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
videos that I like more from so I'm

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.200 
videos that I like more from so I'm
going<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.670> put<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.000> link<00:01:37.210> down<00:01:37.510> below<00:01:38.320> so<00:01:38.770> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
going to put the link down below so you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.970 
going to put the link down below so you
should<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.360> check<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.720> out<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.230> don't

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
should just check it out and don't

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.430 
should just check it out and don't
forget<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.400> subscribe<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:43.270> see<00:01:43.510> my<00:01:43.810> results

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
forget to subscribe to see my results

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.220 
forget to subscribe to see my results
and<00:01:44.770> after<00:01:45.250> I'm<00:01:45.670> through<00:01:45.700> it's<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.690> inversion

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
and after I'm through it's the inversion

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and after I'm through it's the inversion
method<00:01:47.410> I'm<00:01:47.920> going<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.430> like<00:01:48.640> we<00:01:49.390> move<00:01:50.250> this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
method I'm going to like we move this

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.950 
method I'm going to like we move this
week<00:01:51.520> they<00:01:52.510> checked<00:01:53.470> my<00:01:53.680> head<00:01:53.890> my<00:01:54.630> legs<00:01:55.630> check

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
week they checked my head my legs check

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.880 
week they checked my head my legs check
because<00:01:56.760> previously<00:01:57.760> when<00:01:58.060> I<00:01:58.090> checked<00:01:58.510> my

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
because previously when I checked my

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.130 
because previously when I checked my
headlights<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.310> was<00:02:00.490> at<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.360> top<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:01.630> my<00:02:01.930> name

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
headlights it was at the top of my name

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.870 
headlights it was at the top of my name
here<00:02:02.730> so<00:02:04.200> yeah<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:07.000> I'll<00:02:07.810> check<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.530> see<00:02:08.820> I'm<00:02:09.820> a

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
here so yeah so I'll check and see I'm a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.000 
here so yeah so I'll check and see I'm a
little<00:02:10.330> using<00:02:10.660> any<00:02:10.780> measure<00:02:11.020> means<00:02:11.290> if<00:02:11.830> it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
little using any measure means if it's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.890 
little using any measure means if it's
walk<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.490> would<00:02:12.670> see<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:12.970> difference<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.720> don't

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
walk I would see a difference we don't

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.710 
walk I would see a difference we don't
need<00:02:14.260> any<00:02:14.860> measurement<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.970> guys<00:02:16.180> thinking<00:02:16.660> of

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
need any measurement so guys thinking of

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.280 
need any measurement so guys thinking of
a<00:02:16.870> thousand<00:02:17.580> thanks<00:02:18.580> for<00:02:18.730> watching<00:02:19.290> Merry

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
a thousand thanks for watching Merry
