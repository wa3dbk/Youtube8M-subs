00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.070 
up for it in my opinion so overall this
chapter<00:05:33.919> is<00:05:34.160> dripping<00:05:34.910> in<00:05:35.030> style<00:05:35.450> I<00:05:35.750> would<00:05:35.900> say

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
chapter is dripping in style I would say

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.310 
chapter is dripping in style I would say
but<00:05:36.380> not<00:05:36.710> necessarily<00:05:37.370> in<00:05:37.520> substance<00:05:38.229> but<00:05:39.229> the

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
but not necessarily in substance but the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.110 
but not necessarily in substance but the
chapter<00:05:39.590> doesn't<00:05:39.860> suffer<00:05:40.130> because<00:05:40.280> of<00:05:40.430> it<00:05:43.120> the

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
chapter doesn't suffer because of it the

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.370 
chapter doesn't suffer because of it the
music<00:05:44.479> in<00:05:44.599> this<00:05:44.630> chapter<00:05:44.960> is<00:05:45.139> pretty

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
music in this chapter is pretty

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.920 
music in this chapter is pretty
inconsistent<00:05:45.800> and<00:05:46.430> patchy<00:05:46.910> and<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:47.419> say<00:05:47.690> this

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
inconsistent and patchy and I say this

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.779 
inconsistent and patchy and I say this
because<00:05:48.169> there<00:05:48.680> are<00:05:48.800> large<00:05:49.039> portions<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.669> the

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
because there are large portions of the

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.490 
because there are large portions of the
game<00:05:49.940> that<00:05:49.970> don't<00:05:50.300> feature<00:05:50.539> any<00:05:50.870> music<00:05:51.229> at<00:05:51.320> all

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
game that don't feature any music at all

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.379 
game that don't feature any music at all
but<00:05:51.950> it<00:05:52.010> doesn't<00:05:52.340> necessarily<00:05:52.400> enhance<00:05:53.150> the

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
but it doesn't necessarily enhance the

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.450 
but it doesn't necessarily enhance the
experience<00:05:53.710> there<00:05:54.710> since<00:05:54.919> this<00:05:55.039> chapters

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
experience there since this chapters

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.589 
experience there since this chapters
lacking<00:05:56.000> in<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.570> serious<00:05:57.440> scares<00:05:57.830> department

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
lacking in the serious scares department

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.000 
lacking in the serious scares department
the<00:05:59.599> tension<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.200> atmosphere<00:06:00.680> simply

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
the tension and atmosphere simply

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.550 
the tension and atmosphere simply
doesn't<00:06:01.310> make<00:06:01.700> up<00:06:01.910> for<00:06:01.940> the<00:06:02.780> lack<00:06:02.900> of<00:06:02.960> ambient

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
doesn't make up for the lack of ambient

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.469 
doesn't make up for the lack of ambient
