thing is when you're unblocking a cat
you<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.100> able<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.430> extrude<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> penis

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you have to be able to extrude the penis

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.139 
you have to be able to extrude the penis
and<00:02:03.840> hold<00:02:04.200> onto<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> prepuce<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.729> typically

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and hold onto the prepuce so typically

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.080 
and hold onto the prepuce so typically
I'll<00:02:06.479> use<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.869> non-dominant<00:02:07.560> hand<00:02:08.099> use<00:02:08.910> my

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
I'll use my non-dominant hand use my

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.510 
I'll use my non-dominant hand use my
thumb<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.569> index<00:02:09.989> finger<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:11.190> able<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
thumb and index finger and be able to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.490 
thumb and index finger and be able to
exert<00:02:12.420> pressure<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
exert pressure so I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.370 
exert pressure so I
extrude<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.190> penis<00:02:14.550> from<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.030> prepuce<00:02:15.480> then

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
extrude the penis from the prepuce then

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.190 
extrude the penis from the prepuce then
I'll<00:02:16.650> introduce<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.430> Tomcat<00:02:18.150> catheter<00:02:18.720> into

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
I'll introduce the Tomcat catheter into

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.960 
I'll introduce the Tomcat catheter into
the<00:02:19.710> urethra<00:02:20.510> approximately<00:02:21.510> half<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.740> maybe

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the urethra approximately half to maybe

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.520 
the urethra approximately half to maybe
three-quarters<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.060> an<00:02:24.180> inch<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
three-quarters of an inch so that the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.320 
three-quarters of an inch so that the
holes<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.220> urinary<00:02:26.520> catheter<00:02:27.030> are<00:02:27.180> no

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
holes of the urinary catheter are no

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.160 
holes of the urinary catheter are no
longer<00:02:27.630> visible

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
longer visible

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.160 
longer visible
once<00:02:29.040> I've<00:02:29.280> secured<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.390> catheter<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:31.110> place

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
once I've secured my catheter in place

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.530 
once I've secured my catheter in place
in<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> tip<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.370> penis<00:02:32.580> I'll<00:02:33.150> actually

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
in the tip of the penis I'll actually

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.440 
in the tip of the penis I'll actually
pinch<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.320> prepuce<00:02:34.800> skin<00:02:35.250> gently<00:02:35.580> between<00:02:36.240> my

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
pinch the prepuce skin gently between my

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.449 
pinch the prepuce skin gently between my
thumb<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.720> forefinger<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.709> pull<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
thumb and forefinger and pull the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.330 
thumb and forefinger and pull the
prepuce<00:02:38.940> caudally<00:02:39.690> eventually<00:02:40.470> while<00:02:41.100> I'm

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
prepuce caudally eventually while I'm

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.360 
prepuce caudally eventually while I'm
advancing<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> catheter<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.630> flushing

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
advancing the catheter in flushing

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.820 
advancing the catheter in flushing
remember<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.820> have<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.240> apply<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.930> decent

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
remember you have to apply a decent

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.740 
remember you have to apply a decent
amount<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.220> traction<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.239> prepuce

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
amount of traction to the prepuce

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.380 
amount of traction to the prepuce
because<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.070> pressure<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.030> helps

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
because this is the pressure that helps

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.479 
because this is the pressure that helps
straighten<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.080> flexor<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.830> cat's<00:02:53.040> penis

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
straighten the flexor in the cat's penis

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.670 
straighten the flexor in the cat's penis
and<00:02:53.730> permits<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.570> catheter<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.050> pass<00:02:55.380> over

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
and permits the catheter to pass over

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.490 
and permits the catheter to pass over
the<00:02:56.070> ischial<00:02:56.489> arch<00:02:56.810> once<00:02:57.810> we<00:02:58.020> flushed<00:02:58.320> with

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the ischial arch once we flushed with

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.620 
the ischial arch once we flushed with
the<00:02:58.620> Tomcat<00:02:59.100> I'll<00:02:59.430> actually<00:02:59.820> aggressively

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the Tomcat I'll actually aggressively

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.800 
the Tomcat I'll actually aggressively
flush<00:03:00.989> as<00:03:01.290> I'm<00:03:02.280> pulling<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> Tomcat<00:03:03.120> out<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
flush as I'm pulling the Tomcat out to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.630 
flush as I'm pulling the Tomcat out to
make<00:03:03.930> sure<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.320> flushed<00:03:04.650> all<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.250> grit

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
make sure that I flushed all that grit

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.360 
make sure that I flushed all that grit
or<00:03:05.880> crystal<00:03:06.450> or<00:03:06.720> mucoid<00:03:07.110> debris<00:03:07.590> back<00:03:08.130> into

or crystal or mucoid debris back into
the<00:03:08.459> bladder<00:03:08.640> I'll<00:03:08.910> then<00:03:09.720> advance<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.350> three

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
the bladder I'll then advance a three

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.920 
the bladder I'll then advance a three
and<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.130> half<00:03:11.310> French<00:03:11.700> or<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> five<00:03:12.390> French<00:03:12.690> red

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930

rubber catheter with a syringe attached

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.220 
rubber catheter with a syringe attached
so<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.920> flush<00:03:17.160> as<00:03:17.370> I'm<00:03:17.640> going<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.989> one

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
so I can flush as I'm going in the one

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.410 
so I can flush as I'm going in the one
mistake<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.709> see<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.280> people<00:03:20.670> flushing

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
mistake I see is people flushing

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.539

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
starting to wake up once you get the red

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.680 
starting to wake up once you get the red
rubber<00:03:25.500> catheter<00:03:25.799> in<00:03:26.190> place<00:03:26.250> make<00:03:27.090> sure<00:03:27.120> to
