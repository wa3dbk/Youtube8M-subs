something maybe a little different maybe

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.020 
something maybe a little different maybe
a<00:01:10.940> lot<00:01:11.150> different<00:01:11.510> on<00:01:11.600> your<00:01:11.780> steel<00:01:12.050> guitar

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
a lot different on your steel guitar

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.160 
a lot different on your steel guitar
I'm<00:01:14.030> going<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.240> say<00:01:14.360> right<00:01:14.540> away<00:01:14.780> this<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.140> not

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
I'm going to say right away this is not

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.170 
I'm going to say right away this is not
a<00:01:15.380> comprehensive<00:01:15.920> course<00:01:16.460> in<00:01:16.760> playing<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
a comprehensive course in playing the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.410 
a comprehensive course in playing the
steel<00:01:17.450> guitar<00:01:18.790> there's<00:01:19.790> plenty<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.180> those

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
steel guitar there's plenty of those

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.370 
steel guitar there's plenty of those
types<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:21.500> courses<00:01:21.710> on<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.160> market<00:01:22.490> already

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
types of courses on the market already

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.139 
types of courses on the market already
I'm<00:01:24.380> also<00:01:24.619> going<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.100> assume<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.850> have<00:01:25.910> a

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
I'm also going to assume that you have a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.999 
I'm also going to assume that you have a
steel<00:01:26.600> guitar<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.200> then<00:01:27.410> hopefully<00:01:27.680> you've

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
steel guitar and then hopefully you've

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.770 
steel guitar and then hopefully you've
been<00:01:28.190> playing<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.729> for<00:01:28.759> a<00:01:29.000> while<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.479> have<00:01:29.750> a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
been playing it for a while so we have a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.270 
been playing it for a while so we have a
little<00:01:30.020> bit<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.350> understanding<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:31.130> what's

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
little bit of understanding of what's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.940 
little bit of understanding of what's
going<00:01:31.340> on<00:01:31.990> I'm<00:01:32.990> playing<00:01:33.380> in<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.869> standard<00:01:36.350> c6

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
going on I'm playing in the standard c6

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.450 
going on I'm playing in the standard c6
-<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:38.660> can<00:01:38.840> do<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.080> same<00:01:39.320> in<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.590> e9<00:01:39.950> tuning

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
- you can do the same in the e9 tuning

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.490 
- you can do the same in the e9 tuning
it<00:01:41.180> makes<00:01:41.390> no<00:01:41.570> difference<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:42.200> for<00:01:42.259> the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
it makes no difference but for the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.870 
it makes no difference but for the
purpose<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.070> video<00:01:43.399> we're<00:01:43.610> going<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.759> be

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
purpose of this video we're going to be

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.170 
purpose of this video we're going to be
playing<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.270> c6<00:01:45.190> I'm<00:01:46.190> also<00:01:46.399> not<00:01:46.670> going<00:01:46.910> to<00:01:47.000> get

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
playing in c6 I'm also not going to get

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.560 
playing in c6 I'm also not going to get
into<00:01:47.509> a<00:01:47.539> lot<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.020> theory<00:01:48.430> here<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.360> we're<00:01:50.539> just

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
into a lot of theory here so we're just

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.910 
into a lot of theory here so we're just
going<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:50.930> get<00:01:51.110> right<00:01:51.289> into<00:01:51.350> it

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
going to get right into it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.120 
going to get right into it
hmm<00:01:52.750> there<00:01:53.750> are<00:01:53.780> ten<00:01:54.110> strings<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:55.010> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
hmm there are ten strings in the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.399 
hmm there are ten strings in the
standard<00:01:55.549> c6<00:01:56.000> tuning<00:01:56.360> we're<00:01:57.080> going<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.290> be

stream
the<00:02:25.880> first<00:02:26.120> finger<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.510> going<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.720> be<00:02:26.780> playing

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the first finger is going to be playing

is going to be playing the fourth string

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.770 
is going to be playing the fourth string
just<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.610> we're<00:02:35.360> gonna<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.630> playing

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
just like that we're gonna be playing

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.979 
just like that we're gonna be playing
the<00:02:36.080> string<00:02:36.459> simultaneously<00:02:40.599> provide<00:02:41.599> just<00:02:41.870> a

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
the string simultaneously provide just a

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.620 
the string simultaneously provide just a
little<00:02:42.290> rocking<00:02:42.769> motion<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.910> hand<00:02:44.239> on<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
little rocking motion on the hand on the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.930 
little rocking motion on the hand on the
right<00:02:44.780> hand<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.290> dampen<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.739> strings<00:02:46.099> and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
right hand to dampen the strings and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.490 
right hand to dampen the strings and
therefore<00:02:47.420> establish<00:02:47.959> some<00:02:48.140> kind<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.410> rhythm

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.809 

so<00:02:54.500> you'll<00:02:54.650> probably<00:02:54.800> have<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.130> practice<00:02:55.610> that

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
so you'll probably have to practice that

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.090 
so you'll probably have to practice that
for<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.269> little<00:02:56.750> while<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.200> really<00:02:57.470> make<00:02:58.069> sure

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
for a little while to really make sure

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.710 
for a little while to really make sure
you're<00:02:58.489> hitting<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.850> right<00:02:59.000> streets<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.600> get

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
you're hitting the right streets and get

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.900 
you're hitting the right streets and get
