it<00:04:36.770> off<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.040> little<00:04:37.250> bit<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:40.720> brush<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.750> on

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
it off a little bit and brush it on

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.659 
it off a little bit and brush it on
vertically<00:04:43.640> like<00:04:44.919> instead<00:04:45.919> of<00:04:45.979> doing<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.460> this

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
vertically like instead of doing it this

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.279 
vertically like instead of doing it this
night<00:04:47.260> do<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.380> up<00:04:48.500> and<00:04:48.710> down

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.299 

I<00:04:51.580> think<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.639> gives<00:04:52.879> it<00:04:53.119> a<00:04:53.330> better<00:04:54.309> toast

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:55.309 
I think that gives it a better toast

00:04:55.309 --> 00:05:01.239 
I think that gives it a better toast
effect<00:04:55.789> I<00:04:56.860> don't<00:04:57.860> know<00:04:57.949> why<00:04:58.189> but<00:04:59.979> I've<00:05:00.979> tried

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.249 
effect I don't know why but I've tried

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.489 
effect I don't know why but I've tried
it<00:05:01.430> both<00:05:01.580> ways<00:05:01.849> and<00:05:01.909> I<00:05:02.629> like<00:05:03.169> it<00:05:03.319> better

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:03.499 
it both ways and I like it better

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:06.129 
it both ways and I like it better
vertically<00:05:04.360> okay<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:05.419> now<00:05:05.809> you<00:05:05.869> have<00:05:05.990> your

down and you're just going to cut off
the<00:06:04.219> ends<00:06:04.849> so<00:06:04.969> that<00:06:05.120> it<00:06:05.389> makes<00:06:05.509> a<00:06:05.659> little

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
the ends so that it makes a little

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:14.730 
the ends so that it makes a little
square

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.190 

see

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
and you're just going to set it right on

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:27.360 
and you're just going to set it right on
top<00:06:22.290> and<00:06:23.290> then<00:06:25.620> do<00:06:26.620> the<00:06:26.710> same<00:06:26.920> thing<00:06:27.160> for<00:06:27.310> the

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
top and then do the same thing for the

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:34.060 
top and then do the same thing for the
other<00:06:27.460> one

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.920

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
like make jam or something you can just

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.610 
like make jam or something you can just
take<00:06:40.250> your<00:06:40.430> TLS<00:06:41.390> and<00:06:41.630> mix<00:06:41.810> it<00:06:41.990> with<00:06:42.140> like

have little jam you can do it with
peanut<00:06:51.110> butter<00:06:52.300> TLS<00:06:53.300> works<00:06:53.570> good<00:06:53.840> for<00:06:53.870> that

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
peanut butter TLS works good for that

00:06:54.170 --> 00:07:00.340 
peanut butter TLS works good for that
