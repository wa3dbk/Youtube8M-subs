00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.850
 what everyone and welcome to my first 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.900
 son of four and also drone 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:23.980
 it feels good 3 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.330
 because to start playing one of the most 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.330
 simple of the game 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.530
 in the past it says that on broadcast 1 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.230
 meeting 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.820
 access to the boss recording the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.039
 Spaniards we go to the mission one remains of 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.039
 dawn difficulty costs it to be 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.820
 that is good to recharge and if you follow me 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.019
 I already had the campaign 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.460
 it is to some extent interesting 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.460
 but think straight 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.409
 and if I am playing, avoid legendary 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.829
 and it takes like 23 past missions and then 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.570
 if you have 7 challenge but it is not so 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.010
 superior as 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.010
 the previous ones good 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.700
 we removed this video 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.960
 quiet goes away until a while 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:57.659
 unconscious 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.659
 where are we because you wake me up 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:09.310
 and we wait for the hatch up 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.570
 we open this thing 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.640
 like the old days ready to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.970
 back to work here here when we go 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.970
 shorten 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.960
 activated in several covers 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.060

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.280

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.460
