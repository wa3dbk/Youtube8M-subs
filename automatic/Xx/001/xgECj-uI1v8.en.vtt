00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
lab two and this lab we're going to take

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.990 
lab two and this lab we're going to take
a<00:00:03.810> look<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.319> create<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:05.130> bolt<00:00:05.609> as<00:00:05.879> you

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
a look how to create this bolt as you

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.250 
a look how to create this bolt as you
see<00:00:06.210> here<00:00:06.529> let's<00:00:07.529> begin<00:00:08.599> start<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.690> new<00:00:09.870> part

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
see here let's begin start a new part

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.250 
see here let's begin start a new part
file<00:00:13.759> create<00:00:14.759> sketch<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.690> select<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.470> plane

file create sketch and select the plane

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.269 
file create sketch and select the plane
begin<00:00:19.260> by<00:00:19.470> drawing<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.010> center<00:00:20.340> line

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
begin by drawing a center line

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:33.319 
begin by drawing a center line
approximately<00:00:23.279> three<00:00:23.670> inches<00:00:23.939> high<00:00:32.030> the<00:00:33.030> next

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
approximately three inches high the next

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.790 
approximately three inches high the next
thing<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.660> want<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.559> line

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
thing we want to do is take the line

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920 
thing we want to do is take the line
tool<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.399> make<00:00:35.820> sure<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.059> turn<00:00:36.300> off<00:00:36.480> center

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
tool and make sure you turn off center

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.260 
tool and make sure you turn off center
line<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.800> can't<00:00:38.070> draw<00:00:38.399> profile<00:00:41.270> draw

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
line because you can't draw profile draw

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
line because you can't draw profile draw
a<00:00:42.300> line<00:00:42.540> straight<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.050> make<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.890> two<00:00:44.309> inches

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
a line straight up make it two inches

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
a line straight up make it two inches
just<00:00:44.969> type<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.390> two<00:00:45.629> before<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.050> complete<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
just type in two before you complete it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.630 
just type in two before you complete it
and<00:00:46.940> then<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.680> case<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.280> don't<00:00:50.489> really

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and then in this case we don't really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.040 
and then in this case we don't really
we're<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> end<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.300> deleting<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.840> one

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
we're going to end up deleting this one

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
we're going to end up deleting this one
anyway<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> draw<00:00:53.789> out

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
anyway but I'm just going to draw out

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.799 
anyway but I'm just going to draw out
and<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:56.420> just<00:00:57.420> drawn<00:00:57.629> out

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and this is going to be just drawn out

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.070 
and this is going to be just drawn out
as<00:00:58.559> such<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> little<00:01:00.989> under

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
as such and we make it a little under

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
as such and we make it a little under
area<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> head<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> bolt<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
area here for the head of the bolt and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.380 
area here for the head of the bolt and
close<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.180> hit<00:01:07.080> escape<00:01:07.820> delete<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> line<00:01:09.180> on

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
close it hit escape delete the line on

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.469 
close it hit escape delete the line on
the<00:01:09.479> top<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.340> now<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> could<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.360> move

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the top and now you could see can move

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.690 
the top and now you could see can move
these<00:01:12.600> around<00:01:12.799> go<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> dimension<00:01:14.490> tool

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
these around go to the dimension tool

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.690 
these around go to the dimension tool
and<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.479> mention<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.960> line<00:01:16.229> right<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.700> one

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and to mention this line right here one

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
and to mention this line right here one
point<00:01:18.030> seven<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:19.530> you're<00:01:19.650> wondering

you can see the print right here okay
the<00:01:26.280> next<00:01:26.549> dimension<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.659> line

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the next dimension is this little line

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.700 
the next dimension is this little line
here<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.500> 0.1<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:30.079> then<00:01:31.079> this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
here it's going to be 0.1 and then this

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
line here and the center line now be

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.350 
line here and the center line now be
careful<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.430> select<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> solid<00:01:36.210> line

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
careful don't select the solid line

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
careful don't select the solid line
needs<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> center<00:01:36.990> line<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
needs to be the center line this way it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.370 
needs to be the center line this way it
gives<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> diameter<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.020> want<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.259> to

line again and that's going to be one

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.060 
line again and that's going to be one
inch<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:46.979> head<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> bolt<00:01:48.860> I'm<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
inch for the head of bolt I'm going to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.950 
inch for the head of bolt I'm going to
hit<00:01:50.159> escape<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> arrange

hit escape and I'm going to arrange

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.670 
hit escape and I'm going to arrange
these<00:01:52.259> dimensions<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.990> quite<00:01:55.350> as

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
these dimensions so it's not quite as

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.399 
these dimensions so it's not quite as
clef<00:01:56.070> cluttered<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:59.689> okay<00:02:00.689> now<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
clef cluttered here okay now we have to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.700 
clef cluttered here okay now we have to
put<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> arc<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> arc<00:02:03.329> tool

put the arc on so go to the arc tool

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.620 
put the arc on so go to the arc tool
just<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.860> seven<00:02:05.130> three<00:02:05.280> point<00:02:05.520> arc<00:02:05.640> click<00:02:06.479> on

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
just to seven three point arc click on

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.919 
just to seven three point arc click on
this<00:02:06.810> corner<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.610> this

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
this corner and that and this

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.920 
this corner and that and this
