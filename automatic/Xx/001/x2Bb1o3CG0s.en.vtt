00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 how come to a new shader preview 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.309
 This time it's about mister sikhs shader 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.530
 So actually shader these were 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.420
 me from mister with poland as you already know 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.400
 there are even small ones 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.400
 changes but more to that after the intro 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.849
 yes, for example, water as transparent 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.160
 as with shaders and most of all it 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.550
 does not look so gross exaggerated 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.420
 it's all very simple 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.550
 held 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.540
 the water is just that 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.449
 is not my case 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.040
 there are nicer things but 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.559
 otherwise the shader pack is on everyone 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.239
 case ingenious because it 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.070
 just looks so realistic again 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.629
 These colors are not exaggerated 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.000
 Go here for a long time and just feel 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.409
 very nice you always the server 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.769
 Here's why I'm the best 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.269
 looks to represent the whole 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.019
 from the colors the white always runs 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.460
 so beautiful bright 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.460
 from the top you have a good outlook 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.570
 very cool list on the definitely 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.159
 which is a bit different , too 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.540
 Looking far away, the water looks natural 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.110
 right now much much more beautiful than 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:21.090
 normal but I think in any case that 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:23.500
 very similar to such and this is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.329
 just a mix of jazz and one 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.100
 Eigenkreation I have the feeling as 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.360
 Actually, all shaders are pixar 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.819
 but I think here is just such a 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.350
 little bit of the colors 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.479
 been changed and that's just complete 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.810
 cool by the color change but 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.850
 We for example, the data pack with this 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.380
 Get we have lived it differed 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.689
 just looks a bit more here 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.210
 colorful from that everything still 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.590
 5 4 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.369
 been made more contrastive and if 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.079
 it again the xv 10 rc 7 bring that in 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.939
 It just really knows how 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.289
 be adjusted only told by him 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.299
 newest shader a lot of water he does 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.670
 more shader pecs also has such is zb 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.139
 i have seen link to the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.060
 Container can be found in the description 

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:05.859
 and I would say if it is you 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.500
 Please give a thumbs up 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.300
 if not then we will not see each other 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 in the next shader preview if you still 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.450
 If I ask you, you can 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.270
 like to ask under the video or at 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.640
 scribd else you can also like 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.220
 shader packs yourself or has 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.000
 you know here under posts and me 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.000
 she would introduce
