00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 um 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.510
 hello guys and girls from youtube me 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.670
 I have to make a video tutorial very 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.200
 quickie of the simple elche finder mod 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.750
 or what has been the same thing 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.400
 seeker is very easy and good 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.259
 Well, as its name suggests, it's about 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.779
 a mod that will help us find 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.939
 the chests in our worlds are worth 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.189
 put an example here set we have 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.199
 a normal chest a in there chest and a 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.210
 cheat trap and good put also in 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.059
 the box with a trolley for you to see 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.970
 that does not work, it's a chest that 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.589
 no then he does not like minecraft that 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.870
 work well the truth is that it is 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.790
 pretty good because according to how we 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.399
 let's get closer to the areas 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.920
 then we will see the chests that the 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.980
 world is giving us not so look 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.320
 for example around here there is one if what 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.629
 you get to see well it's worth there you see it looks 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.460
 the square there just do not know if by 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.500
 here you will see some other voucher but we will 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.899
 will be marking what is very, very 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.699
 that very well that we are going to do to 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.560
 go see the chests well then we 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.780
 let's put we are going to put like this and 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.940
 let's go forward then let's go 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.580
 put us under the ground so you can see 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.930
 all the dungeons that we are going to 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.060
 can find 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.550
 we go to the rabbin this and if you look 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.560
 You see we are generating all the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.880
 chests that there are around us 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.350
 if we look back then there was no 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.360
 none and well then we look for 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.370
 go ahead we have these here's worth 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.979
 that are surely all spinners 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.140
 there it is we have a zombie spoiler and 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.050
 Well, we have an armor. 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.630
 or protection between power 3 and 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.510
 efficiency 3 my god but we can continue 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.229
 looking for we will not be able to continue finding 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.800
 all the chés that we have around 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.780
 inclusive 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.930
 ok we will be able to 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.210
 find the chés of the lens okay let's go 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.920
 to be able to get to the in looking for the chés 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.740
 in this way, well, here we have 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.900
 another one is to put skeleton 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.520
 Well, it's pretty good because good 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.580
 well, it also serves to find 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.640
 quickly the famous spoilers are worth 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.739
 Look here is to take nice there 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.270
 theoretical with armor that we are worth to 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.430
 nothing gave look that they could change the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.350
 loops of the chests I could not 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.110
 have more things you have that very few 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.750
 things look here here we have 1 triple 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.090
 notice we have one here another here are 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.400
 also in rank I believe here you could 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.050
 do something cool fix a double chest 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.550
 to me this weird thing 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.100
 another double chest my mother this is 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.260
 rare that double chests appear is 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:42.000
 very weird though not though you do not think so 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.159
 it's pretty weird let's go in vision 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 night let's take a potion me 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:51.420
 will leave let's put game boat 2 and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.450
 let's take here a one potion there 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.880
 is and so I see them continuously 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.560
 fixed here we have another 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.470
 I also think that they are in range here 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.620
 I could do some pretty work 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.150
 cool is worth with all these sponges that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.880
 we have located here the truth is 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.730
 that is very cool the mod the truth 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.010
 I liked very much very simple 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.480
 because really the mods that to me 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.270
 tend to draw more attention are the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.860
 that are very simple and the truth that 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.590
 against simpler they are more they call me the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:27.210
 attention what makes it good so be 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.440
 quite pretty handsome the mod and good 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.690
 because it also serves as you have been able 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.430
 see the beginning of the video is worth it 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.140
 It also serves to see the send by 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.420
 here what we have a tuna johann is worth 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.220
 so look, we can quickly see or 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.470
 locate where chests are in state 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.770
 union there are no chests in union state is 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.300
 a union a little bit strange the truth 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.580
 is that now I see worse not take 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.470
 bad night vision he looked pretty 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.120
 better but good the truth is that it comes 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.580
 good enough to locate the chests 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.720
 which is what the module is about and good 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.330
 then basically locate 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.140
 spoilers because in this way you can 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.450
 locate look at this spanair that girl 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.000
 my mother serious uncle this is super 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.609
 close to figaro is super super close to 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.500
 skeletons my mother I'm going to put the sit 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.030
 you always ask me and well there 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.190
 have the coordinates it so that 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.890
 you see the truth is that here you could 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.050
 make a pretty epic farm but 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.520
 well the truth is that it was simply 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.660
 this what I wanted to teach you the truth 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.970
 is that it's a pretty pretty mode 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.890
 cool in my opinion I hope that I have 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.470
 liked guys life favorites comment 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.450
 and see you in the next video goodbye 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.980
 welcome to the installation of simple 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.770
 the chef finder mod for the present 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.940
 minecraft 1.8 and earlier of the motive not 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.920
 tell you that the link will be in the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.720
 description of the video click and you 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.190
 will take to the good mother page 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.500
 Here you have 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.300
 the link of the download we open it in a 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.580
 new window and we're going to focus on 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.950
 the screen shot where good then we 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.600
 comments the same thing that we have seen in the 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.600
 video but basically it's going to mark us 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.220
 by colors always the chests are worth and 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.350
 Well, you have a couple of videos here 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.940
 they teach you pretty much the same thing 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.900
 we have seen and what has changed since 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.270
 the first release well 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.669
 we give you jump advertising you ignore the 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.370
 advertising that comes out here in the middle and 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.630
 you can download it for 17 10 or for 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.009
 the 1.8 as logically is for the 1.8 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.900
 Well, we're going to give you here 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.059
 and we will give you the advertising that comes out 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.710
 here in the middle and we will give it back to 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:32.419
 jump advertising this will make it 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.550
 download the mod there is and you have to 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.539
 to leave a file such as this chef 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.520
 finder for version 1.8 or about 710 if 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.809
 is the case of the ones and very good 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.210
 important that you go through the video here 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:46.369
 up if you have not installed forums for 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.139
 the 1.8 very important for the guys is 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:49.849
 very very important that you have a 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.849
 version of force installed in your 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:56.419
 minecraft I exactly have the 13 53 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.729
 it's worth 1.8 if you 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.800
 you want to install with 1.7 point 10 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.199
 then you have to have force installed in 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.139
 the profile of force created for 17 10 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.339
 right good once you have force 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.050
 installed in your minecraft you go to 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:11.539
 create the mods folder as simple as 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.069
 if you do not have it already created, it is worth 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.770
 possible that if you have some way 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.870
 included 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.789
 in your mods folder so I can 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.069
 give some incompatibility but not 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.289
 it would not be the common thing would be quite 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:25.060
 weird good copies finally the chef 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.330
 finder to the folder of mods I have put 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.129
 also the note not and temps and finally 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.960
 run and masters our minecraft worth 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:33.639
 all this process logically you have it 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.949
 to have with minecraft closed what 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.569
 you can have open and automatically 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.190
 in principle if everything goes well if everything 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.690
 you have installed well you will have taken the 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.820
 profile of force if it is not so that only 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.860
 your profile comes out, you can edit it 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.660
 but what I would recommend is to give 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.880
 new profile ok we give to the new 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.560
 profile we write then motorcycle profile or 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.660
 what you want and here where 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.940
 put kings 18 you go down completely and 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.110
 if you have installed force well it is worth 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.390
 you do not have it installed properly so what 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.940
 said you go through the video and you will give 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.920
 to save is worth then here there will be 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.650
 Added the profile of the selected mods 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.840
 and you give to play bad is very easy very 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.760
 very basic simple has no major 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.070
 difficulty and good is almost more 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.170
 complicated the installation of the mod that the 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.780
 same way the truth is that it is very 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.580
 simple everything and good then finally 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.360
 we're going to make sure we have the 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.200
 mod installed perfectly there is like this 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.060
 that nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.920
 liked but that you served law 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.030
