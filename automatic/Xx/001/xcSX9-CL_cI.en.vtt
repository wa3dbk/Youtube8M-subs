00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.680
 yo guests all good day all here 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.790
 and today I will bring you another one 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.950
 new commentary in the background 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.779
 gameplay is a very ugly game play 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.570
 this is really my parents la roller 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.300
 slowest kem strike so far and that is 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.130
 purely and simply because I am here with anomaly 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.649
 the chair top picked up which by the way really 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.239
 I thought this game was a beast weapon 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:32.450
 but warm and i like anomaly here 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.800
 sat on this roof and this was on the weekend 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.399
 that with a measure of mole as with him 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.489
 want 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.809
 then over there lm portion and I am sitting here 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.030
 on this roof and it goes well with 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.309
 that emily and then for a while just really come 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.320
 no more against it and then I go in 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.519
 once roam the folders and I 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.289
 no one really touches you 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.699
 will see i just got some here 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.339
 once spoke with poor leigh and so on 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.929
 goes well then I think goes 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.739
 fine on the day you know and i play 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.659
 by the way with sport 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.219
 so i thought what if i just got here 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.839
 momentarily stuck and some kills 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.269
 picks up before the start streak and then 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.859
 just go save because i'm making the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.690
 throat to throat so i thought you 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.700
 that in itself is nice just me 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.799
 really come across no one making it 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.860
 As a result, I am really in the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.390
 last second of the game play my yes 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.180
 get my acquaintance frank and that I get him one 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.740
 that he does not go off within time 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.360
 and I do count our campsite because I m 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.479
 commits in the game even though it is not 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.369
 and e-mail by the way in this game 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.119
 play that also had kem strike so d 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.860
 it is actually a lump kem strike and 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.479
 was giving the cart wai as of fife 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.390
 if k there both were kem strike 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.829
 very nice and i know that mark in this 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.659
 game play mark of our chest is that he 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.159
 namely also in I know he too 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.079
 close to a mauve if so it was 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.869
 just a triple cam bro 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.579
 been a strike no if mark him too 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.170
 met but good guys that's it in 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.729
 ivory for gameplay it is really one 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.100
 ugly gameplay because I just know 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.450
 not where to go and I rode 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.939
 just don't streak at a given time 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 I lost because I really knew that 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.450
 e-mail was on needed street so I was 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.560
 really the program struggles with normal want 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.820
 that we had some sort of deals 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.140
 closed for dude 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.539
 this weekend we will keep a piece of kem 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.520
 strike and well that is what I wanted now 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.110
 really get it for a while and have it for the rest 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.789
 there is also no one more money but I want 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.280
 this comment you f swot to you 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.800
 namely ask what do you want to see on 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.300
 my channel because your opinion as apps 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.070
 is important I know that 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.440
 and I am again with a new series 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.940
 started skyblock survival with dill and 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.910
 so far the reactions have been real 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.080
 cool on for which my thanks for you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.520
 just like that series to 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.850
 see if I know of the wash in time 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.650
 with Patrick and yes even now I do to 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.000
 with matt dillon dam and dylan 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.460
 of course also a very funny gosh them 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.020
 and delivers a lot of content where the 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.420
 if there would like to call it like that 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.960
 just fun moments and if we like it 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.120
 to do together 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.680
 seems like a nice series to me but what 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.600
 want to see even more on my channel because 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.920
 I mean I'm always the call of duty 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.510
 channel but I have it too 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.290
 I always want to change a bit 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.210
 I mean I've always been that way 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.570
 would also like to add some other things 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.950
 like now minecraft skyblock survival then 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.720
 possibly other things from minecraft 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.610
 as such to but on you can 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.710
 leave behind 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.120
 And yes, I can only go for that 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.530
 do you want now more sharp shooter 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.360
 blackops two for example 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.340
 do you want a certain top call or kemo 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.110
 duty 4 or something or something that I am going to do 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.660
 want you in a completely different game that I do 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.110
 well or for example after gta is 5 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.790
 then something I do have or you 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.290
 for example red dead redemption one of 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.090
 you want to get the older games back 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.560
 or and early 30 hours to such a but that 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.780
 it always just got lucky with the kill 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.040
 the and dine mar komme has but 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.870
 leave me in the comments what 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.700
 you want to see mine on my 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.010
 channel and I went there last year 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.870
 battle for your opinion as subscribers 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.820
 I know that important and I want that too 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.080
 do you find fat so if 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.810
 you really have things you like 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.100
 something like hey arjan that's 6 that 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.230
 you have to do that on your channel, we think 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.370
 nice to watch then you need the that 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.650
 just leave it and then i go my 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.150
 do best to play that 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.640
 good suggestions are too 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.190
 italic who only asks on twitter when asked 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.390
 the arnhem region do the italics or for tom 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.890
 had top or so 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.390
 You can do that under such things 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.410
 just leave it behind because that is normal 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.739
 I can do it all online 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.720
 and well if you would like that 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.739
 then I can do my best 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.750
 and then we can take a moment 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.910
 see what we can bake of it 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.200
 at least that is actually something 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.239
 I just ask I have a pass 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.519
 also asked on twitter if I have a number 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.769
 short responses from, among other things, a curve 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.450
 fever and there include minecraft 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.280
 skyblock survival on the way 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.690
 so but then I have a de 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.180
 not really those things that come across 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.040
 that i think of yes that's bold find it 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.540
 your fat that I think sometimes put 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.250
 italic also good solutions 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.350
 that is also something i do 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.669
 can upload regularly as you 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.780
 would find that fat 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.910
 but it must all be neat here 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.200
 leave and then I will all go there 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.639
 to do my best and then I will 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.669
 numbers look at what i can do for you 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.870
 but good guys it was for me 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.490
 is the Christmas holiday thread coming 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.889
 at least I have next week I have 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.470
 a buffer week is fairly free 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.210
 I have one more week there and then I have 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.840
 I Christmas holiday so Christmas holiday is possible 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.160
 I do a lot 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.169
 the buffer week i can do a lot for 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.060
 gameplays in terms of upload I can do everything 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.470
 arrange a lot and I am looking forward to that 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.320
 and by the way here now has a kem 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.570
 strike already in groups and I thought because 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.700
 one want that done before when I joined 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.110
 it was when he had more daily gameplay 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.850
 and kem strike 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.350
 and then I was on a high street and 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.090
 went to him in coal and so I really 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.600
 growling four or five times in succession 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.650
 cap upset just one that he failed them 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.470
 kem strike 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.820
 that then the completely misty before 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.410
 the as it were and that I then in one 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.790
 times 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.050
 Well then that I neck and nobody with it 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.510
 can find among other things and that it 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.860
 just really bastard to see here 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.150
 follows in itself also on toe 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.780
 but I've also had it on software 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.010
 a 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.630
 then he really got me and that 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.940
 is super annoying about software because 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.380
 of course you really have that too 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.090
 just and you can almost do that 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.860
 no hand in mind see me when 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.720
 case boys this was him 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.130
 I've had a lucky one so will you 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.900
 immediately see document last seconds 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.130
 I can still get lucky out of ten meters 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.460
 I was lifted off and then I could 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.470
 easy dq picking up but yes unfortunately 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.060
 I couldn't get him on time for that 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.890
 at least the jar was finished 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.570
 one cannot let him go off because 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.979
 I have got more and five or five 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.300
 seconds to play and the hour to 9 seconds 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.250
 let go of the thing but good 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.050
 guys this was watching a fire 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.520
 nice for scoring just let the thumbs down 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.419
 behind or a level thumb may if you 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.340
 of size and leave suggestions 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.340
 behind what i can do guys he is
