00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.930
 The bike season is now 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.310
 again in full swing 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.720
 Good weather and they are coming 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.350
 holiday time make you want to go 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.060
 bicycle tour 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.800
 At the latest now it will be time 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.000
 his old wire on frontman too 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.750
 bring or get a new one 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.760
 to purchase 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.930
 a good possibility about the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.580
 latest trends and models too 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.110
 inform or on this weekend 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.900
 the bicycle fair on the ground of 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.430
 bike xxl cold in ludwigshafen 10 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.230
 bike manufacturers and just as many 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.160
 Parts manufacturers presented their latest 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.060
 achievements 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.230
 yes we have our most important ones here 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.780
 bike manufacturer also invited to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 accompaniment exhibitors are here 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.870
 and show their latest bikes their 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.700
 news of their best bikes and the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 Of course you can also sample here 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.520
 take what there are the new trends which 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.350
 will be still good 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.960
 high quality mountain bikes the result 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.409
 they spring Mahlberg there is even on 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.719
 E-bike meanwhile already and stop topic 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.060
 Number one is ever the eternal one 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.649
 moment tedious kicking and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.969
 bathed in sweat it belong to the 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.509
 past when you have an e bike 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.729
 moves 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.020
 this one helps with driving and 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.779
 takes so much of the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.340
 Effort actually works for everyone 

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.899
 not only for the older ones 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 people but just for everyone was just 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.139
 You can decide for yourself 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.149
 in what way what wants to make an effort 

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:29.039
 how support is provided 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.349
 you can also drive without support 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.170
 So the e-bike is supporting our 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:35.639
 support up to 25 km / h 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.810
 So you have here practically just once 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:38.789
 the display 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.770
 then you can turn it on sees 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.270
 then how much battery power was left 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.249
 has in which level you drive how many 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.319
 kilometers you have already driven like 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:50.039
 fast one drives then one has here just 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.659
 the battery from the bike exactly and below 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.520
 then you have just the engine 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.859
 and one says so in the middle stage 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.270
 you can get up to 80 kilometers 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.159
 actually and then if you stop too 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.049
 you can also show up between times 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.609
 come to 100 or 150 kilometers 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.679
 Cycling is only fun if you 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.359
 The driver's seats are also comfortable 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.319
 are therefore constantly being developed 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.390
 and human physiology 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.319
 adapted and in the best case comfort too 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.349
 Offer 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.209
 this sitting bones here once left and 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.519
 on the right you can tolerate high pressure 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.499
 bones we can harden muscle 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.120
 long approaches and also sensitive 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.249
 Nervenbahnen run here 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.010
 they can not get used to pressure 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:27.719
 but the bones already take between 2 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.159
 to 5 exits then we have 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.569
 again sitting at this point 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.090
 I'm used to them and I can give them this 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.760
 once quite well illustrate the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.950
 Seated bones are so punctually 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.409
 burdened and by the built-in 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.750
 stage we reach the necessary clearance 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.909
 with man and woman alike 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.319
 and who knows not to let that happen 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.669
 no longer properly insert or 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.439
 the wires of the gear shift are 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.909
 worn out with the modern 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.810
 Electric gear shifting can do this 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.370
 not happen anymore 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.579
 here you can easily switch via 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.319
 button pressure so the first 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.719
 electronic gear shift came out well 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.389
 who is five to six years out of the 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.859
 advantage over mechanical circuit 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.409
 is that you just not normal 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.790
 Build trains has more but only 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.209
 electric cable and therefore also the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.090
 wear just much less one 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.129
 no wear no more on the trains 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.500
 the switching operations are just a lot 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.150
 executed more precisely than the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.780
 mechanical at always the same 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.879
 distance has to be chosen and it is 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.500
 also far or another advantage is 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.000
 that you just can not stop at one 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.189
 but the shift lever is tied 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.780
 all can drive even more 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.819
 and what's the use of the best and the most beautiful 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.799
 bike, however, if it is stolen 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.150
 A good lock is on the rise 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.250
 Number of drivers thefts 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.049
 so it still has to be everyone 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.370
 really good and safe 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.989
 you definitely want to go for one 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.729
 Iron lock decide depending 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.439
 of course, and we for which 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.909
 area you need the castle if 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.259
 you just want to go to the baker 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.180
 five minutes then they need no 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.560
 necessarily a massive iron lock if 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.060
 However , you live in the big city 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.340
 and of course a very high quality 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.989
 should have watt then one 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.030
 be a padlock or a high quality 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.560
 case conclusion as a rule of thumb 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.849
 bike locks they can 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.469
 actually remember about ten percent 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.150
 The value of the day should be a lock 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.159
 they are thus investing the 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.479
 can secure the reasonable 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.729
 Price range for bicycles is very high 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.810
 different from cheap 200 euro 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.759
 models up to exclusive 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.199
 high performance bikes for 7000 euro 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.900
 or more is for every use 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.430
 and taste something on the market to 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.700
 should think clearly before buying 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.990
 For 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.790
 you want to use a bike around 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.310
 as long as possible to advise something about it 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.710
 martin steiger first you have the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.600
 ask customers what are you planning to do with the 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.820
 bicycle 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:41.190
 Both drivers like much want to drive 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:45.270
 and we want to sit and then have to 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.370
 you just find out what the people of 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.580
 want to have quality on what you value 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.690
 put good wheels on it pay 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.970
 circuit should be reasonable and 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.890
 Of course, the very heart is 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.300
 frame the bike must be stable 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.000
 be firmly connected 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.410
 it should also be easy and there 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.410
 There are already significant differences
