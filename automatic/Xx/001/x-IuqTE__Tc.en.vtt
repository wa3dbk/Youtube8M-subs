00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.650
 Hello

 ah 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.689
 such as hello guys and Wednesday 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.630
 again and that means we go back 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.369
 with our program on windows 8 in 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.800
 os we discuss some of the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.070
 best apps and games that you can 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.900
 find in the windows store said this 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.900
 let's go see today's show 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.330
 online shopping grows at a fast pace 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.790
 unstoppable and will soon surpass the 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.830
 physical purchases and if there is a store 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.550
 online that exceeds the rest in all the 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.820
 planet 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.190
 that's amazon, bean, know that the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 company has launched an application for 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.110
 windows 8 thought especially for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.420
 tablets although that is also 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.450
 fully functional from a PC or 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450
 laptop 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.740
 the amazon application for windows 8 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.020
 have something that I love a design 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.909
 much better and more aesthetic than the web 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.700
 where I think they should do 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 substantial improvements the screen 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.659
 main shows us the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 typical recommendations of amazon but 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.039
 We can look for a product from the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.710
 own application bar or from the 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:29.290
 search menu for windows 8 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.900
 how amazon has such a wide catalog 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.940
 and it is often difficult to filter what 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.590
 we see the application includes a 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.200
 tool from which we can filter 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.479
 search factors as a category of 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.080
 priced product or brand reviews 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.240
 of the users as well as it could not be 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.979
 otherwise amazon allows us 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.320
 identify us in the application with 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.050
 our account and make purchases 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.119
 directly from it in addition to others 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.970
 options how to recommend a product to 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.630
 someone or mark it as of interest to 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.630

 squad of four mercenaries that 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.550
 They will have to carry out a series of 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.270

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.040
 time from one side to another nonetheless 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.030
 clicking on one and marking the point 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.440

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.280
 the game allows us to earn money with 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.620
 each mission or goal and destroyed already 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.599

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.730
 with this money we can make improvements in 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.280

 different extra powers let's call it that 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.439
 for complicated moments in this way 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.849
 for example we can ride 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.129
 automatic machine guns that have us 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.290
 support at certain times order the 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.239
 bombardment of a target or area from the 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.000
 air throw grenades place mines 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.400
 antipersonnel in a flank the paragraph 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.890
 cannes for haiti graphic is amazing 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.439
 and the sound goes with it perfectly 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.709
 It is also free what else you can 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.709
 ask 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.569
 but good not everything is going to be hit shots 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.909
 or break our heads with complex 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.329
 applications you also have to leave a 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.370
 hollow to feed and do well in 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.519
 this recipes and chefs 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.620
 kitchen channel are all experts and 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.310
 now the official application arrives for 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.310
 windows 8 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.800
 the interface is good and the content is 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.690
 very well organized we have the option of 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.330
 search recipes by type of dish 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.819
 environment per cook per program if you 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.220
 like some special one we can also 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.810
 perform specific recipe searches 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.810
 from the windows 8 search engine 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.040
 all this is positive but it touches 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.260
 talk about what is not so good 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.180
 I have the channel version installed 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.430
 kitchen for ipad means that the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.640
 windows 8 application is not even for 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.410
 I see a fifth of the years 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.530
 first we have noticed is a cookbook 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.810
 really small besides unlike 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.240
 their version for them the application of 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.970
 kitchen channel for windows 8 does not include 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.360
 recipes on video something that gets much worse 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.909
 the experience of use 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.639
 we have also noticed that this version is 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.680
 something slower that tells us that 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.960
 is very poorly optimized for the system 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.900
 since we are working right now 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.319
 with a very powerful pc and still the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.270
 version for ipad is much more fluid 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:11.000
 in short cooking channel for windows 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.580
 8 is an acceptable kitchen application 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.180
 but that needs a revision and improvements 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.180
 already 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.380
 and we ended up in the section 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.350
 applications and games for windows 8 of 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.479
 this week testing soccer fever what 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.240
 more like a football game that 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.790
 we found in the windows store is 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.919
 say in the microsoft store thought 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.590
 for applications with metro style e 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.040
 designed to be also executed in 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.040
 tablets 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.000
 in this soccer game for windows 8 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.970
 it's called soccer fever and it's 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.010
 basically a mix between the game of 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.590
 the veneers of all life and air 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.260
 jockey we will have the possibility of 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.720
 set up the games with a two or 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.030
 three badges per team and play or else in 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.540
 local mode with one or two players or in 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.550
 online mode soccer fever is super 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.040
 entertaining because it allows us to relive 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.530
 those little moments on the street 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.870
 playing the plates in turns but 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.970
 also adds excitement including 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.750
 physical system of tables 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.750
 hockey 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.509
 The good thing is that we can choose almost 

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:33.119
 all selections at the end of the 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.999
 world and cast a simple game or 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:38.069
 continue advancing in a championship with the 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:40.139
 finger or the mouse we will have to push the 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:43.229
 sheet against the ball to try 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.839
 score goal in the opposite goal 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:48.469
 It's easy but I assure you it's very 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.469
 entertaining 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.900
 good guys up here our 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.669
