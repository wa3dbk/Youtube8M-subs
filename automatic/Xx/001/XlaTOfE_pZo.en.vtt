 thank you very much for the invitation so 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.160
 I come a long time from recommendations of how 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.020
 increase christmas picture style 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 because you are hospitalized 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.369
 in addition there are desserts there are fritters all the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.439
 typical food that everyone wants 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.939
 eat and well we left there is a little bit 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.039
 of the diet but we come here with 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.660
 our expert to give us some 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.189
 tips as you know I was 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
 doing the challenge of the magician and you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.630
 they always want to know what it is that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 command how we do this then to 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.809
 end of the video we are going to tell you a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.000
 surprise that we bring you for January but 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.520
 for now let's give some consejitos 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.290
 to not exceed the limit in these 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 dates like that the turkey what are we going to do 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.100
 it's all this Christmas that what 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 I say the whole world is not do not pretend 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 that you are going to lose kilos of those kilos of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.100
 more we will not lose fat but what 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.809
 what are we going to do is this keep more 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 find that that's the number in the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.300
 balance does not increase nor does it 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.890
 go so if it goes like many people do 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 that is already black and has about 510 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.549
 kilos of more and neither is it looking 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.270
 coexist do not enter time because one is 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.210
 provoke 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.740
 we started Christmas a moment for 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.509
 sharing as a family is the moment where 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.840
 everything comes together and the idea to enjoy so much 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.969
 the food like the good family then 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.219
 let's give them tip number one is in 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.170
 the guayos and is that I always like in 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.789
 small plates this helps me to 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.709
 I have served the dish they look full 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.509
 then visually I'm full but 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.759
 our commented as much as if a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.579
 large and good plate there are studios where 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.829
 I have already done in large universities 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.840
 prestige including harvard and yale this 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.060
 in which he talks about the dishes 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.819
 little ones make psychologically the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.590
 person believe that he is eating more ok is 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.450
 because it does look fuller this will 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.459
 send a message from the brain up 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.739
 our body indicates that he already 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.569
 It is full and we see that it is useful for 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.159
 all year long be not only for life if 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.439
 you eat in smaller plates 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.090
 can control their portions better 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.979
 second clip that has already implemented from me 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.659
 diet and that is very important is to dine 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.969
 a little before going out to a party 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.590
 because if all a little more filled with 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.929
 more less at the party this is very 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.579
 normal if you leave hungry it's very 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.119
 likely to eat others and then you 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:14.470
 feel bad i told you 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.390
 and all those things 7 that's the way it is and reporting 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.030
 what are you saying when a person 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.950
 arrives and leaves hungry or without talent 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.840
 hungry without having eaten as the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.120
 person arrives and devours everything that is 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.849
 it gets ok there are times that even 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.110
 you do not even know what to do and not 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.489
 dinner has still arrived 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.430
 I was just on the street and you arrived 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.370
 and I bought you the conditional that the idea 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.720
 is to eat before at least one hour 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.909
 before so that when a moment that 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.030
 go to the Christmas dinner or dinner or the 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.220
 party and you go with the stomach a 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.200
 little bit more more full and avoid ya 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.660
 had to control portions which 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.440
 the idea is that that inner food to 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.840
 go to the party or to the meeting be 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.609
 choose many vegetables a good 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.040
 animal protein portion of something I 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.290
 fish this is enough meat and also 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.299
 grab what this would be and take 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.879
 enough water during the day and that would be 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.560
 up to number three hydration yes 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.090
 because there is to stay hydrated and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.040
 have accelerated metabolism a 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.569
 digestion much faster this one is going to 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.579
 allow what 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.409
 the additional we are eating has been 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.810
 discarded the fourth time that I gave them 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.540
 I can give is to exercise regularly 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.370
 less half an hour a day on these dates 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.139
 Christmas because people usually say 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.060
 I do not do anything on this date and 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.400
 Then in January, I go on an extreme diet 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.170
 and there yes army me not rings if we go 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.239
 to eat others we have to make sure 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.609
 do a little exercise 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.500
 that's right, I'll tell you that I have two 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.340
 Advisers who lived in the USA 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.150
 I have japan I have from more than 15 countries 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.980
 among them there are some that are 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.030
 training right now below zero that says 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.129
 also which -4 Â° this blood is that 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.109
 exactly no excuses many people 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.819
 it says good closes a gym 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.030
 it does not matter if you train at home or go to 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.040
 Park is the turn around your house 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.650
 At least 30 minutes a day 4 times a 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.449
 the week we're going to have a burn 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.099
 constant calorie is not known 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.469
 come out of cumming there is a study that 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.989
 shows that fast walking burns 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.720
 almost the same kilos of the days that what 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.430
 that burns the fact of going jogging 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.019
 you can walk fast and they will be 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.940
 burning calories can jump rope 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.670
 you can ride a bicycle you can 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.760
 just take the dog for a walk and you 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.830
 you put with the running and there you will be with the 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.630
 constant calorie burning and they already 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.220
 has also shown in the video of us 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.350
 pilates with me that you can do everything 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.120
 from the house good as you know 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.130
 I love the sweet then in this 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.470
 time is irresistible to eat me a piece 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.180
 of custard some rice with milk where 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.100
 all the typical desserts that we have 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.840
 here in my country they are delicious and I 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.180
 I think that these countries there are also many 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.400
 desserts then frame you think it's 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.170
 wrong to be with a little caprichito and 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.900
 eat a piece of some dessert not 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.780
 I'll go back to the beginning where you mentioned 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.240
 that this December only once 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.070
 to the year where you want because we eat 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.420
 other additional things 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.800
 and remember that if it's already a good 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.130
 feeding that there is a regime 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.890
 food good good nutrition 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.590
 where you arrive and grab everything 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.140
 breakfast lunch dinner snacks all 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.100
 well healthy not in the problem would be everything 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.200
 it's a week 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.060
 ok you grab but two times are two 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.250
 meals that there are people who get to everything 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.320
 the day with the heart and if there are two 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.480
 meals a week we call it a thousand 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.290
 Sometimes you hold on then eat what 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.610
 what you want 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.230
 twice a week 22 meals and 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.270
 distributed on the day you want 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.980
 now I want to ask you bitter here 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.050
 myth that we have good most of 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.660
 people that if we emit some food 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.730
 then we save on calories and not 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.090
 we can eat them you will show a 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.280
 time 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.470
 in a meal if you understand me as not 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.150
 have breakfast but cesc giant lunch you 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.040
 what do you think about that ok first thing is that 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.360
 whenever I experience what's in the 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.250
 there's breakfast that will allow us 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.580
 enough energy for our entire day 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.200
 a day 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.240
 I do not recommend stopping eating 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.190
 because there is rather I say to eat more 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.780
 sometimes small portions 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.970
 this so that the metabolism is very much 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.770
 more accelerated avoid anxiety avoid 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.630
 that you feel bad after eating 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.220
 accumulated of the day and a burning of 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.470
 constant calories because he has to 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.910
 process everything you 're eating and 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.440
 good girls these have all been 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.550

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.180
