the ones that go for cheap because

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.270 
the ones that go for cheap because
unless<00:00:55.140> there's<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> massive<00:00:55.800> loads<00:00:56.159> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
unless there's a massive loads of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.590 
unless there's a massive loads of
bidding<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:56.730> they're<00:00:57.179> not<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
bidding on them they're not going to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.520 
bidding on them they're not going to
reach<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> price<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.260> they're<00:00:58.350> actually

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
way to sell on for a bit of profit now

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.220 
way to sell on for a bit of profit now
you<00:01:51.120> can<00:01:51.330> see<00:01:51.480> that<00:01:51.510> I'm<00:01:51.690> just<00:01:51.870> flicking

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
you can see that I'm just flicking

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.690 
you can see that I'm just flicking
backwards<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> forwards<00:01:53.190> between<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.550> pages

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
backwards and forwards between the pages

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.640 
backwards and forwards between the pages
this<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.510> because<00:01:54.630> we've<00:01:54.900> hit<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.080> 59th

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
this is because we've hit the 59th

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.140 
this is because we've hit the 59th
minute<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.340> don't<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:56.790> any<00:01:56.910> fear

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
minute so we don't want to go any fear

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.030 
minute so we don't want to go any fear
that<00:01:57.300> into<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.570> hours<00:01:57.900> because<00:01:58.050> new<00:01:58.710> cards

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that into the hours because new cards

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.200 
that into the hours because new cards
won't<00:01:59.130> keep<00:01:59.340> getting<00:01:59.610> added<00:01:59.850> so<00:01:59.940> there's<00:02:00.120> no

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
won't keep getting added so there's no

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.760 
won't keep getting added so there's no
point<00:02:00.390> doing<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.500> need<00:02:01.650> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
point doing that so you just need to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.020 
point doing that so you just need to
flick<00:02:01.920> backwards<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.460> forwards<00:02:02.760> through<00:02:02.910> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
flick backwards and forwards through the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.580 
flick backwards and forwards through the
pages<00:02:03.210> until<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.810> refreshes<00:02:04.260> again<00:02:04.440> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
pages until it refreshes again and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.900 
pages until it refreshes again and
there's<00:02:04.740> new<00:02:04.890> cards<00:02:05.220> at<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.340> 59th<00:02:05.850> minute

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
there's new cards at the 59th minute

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.970 
there's new cards at the 59th minute
that's<00:02:06.810> basically<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.590> technique

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
that's basically it for this technique

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.160 
that's basically it for this technique
guys<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.550> simple<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.119> once<00:02:10.019> you've

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
guys it's as simple as that once you've

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
just do it yourself by searching out the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.330 
just do it yourself by searching out the
minimum<00:02:18.810> behind<00:02:19.170> out<00:02:19.260> price<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:19.800> then

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
minimum behind out price of them then

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.770 
minimum behind out price of them then
just<00:02:20.459> go<00:02:20.580> back<00:02:20.879> an<00:02:21.030> hour<00:02:21.180> later<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:21.690> can

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
just go back an hour later so you can

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
just go back an hour later so you can
play<00:02:21.989> some<00:02:22.050> games<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.590> between<00:02:22.710> or<00:02:23.069> carry<00:02:23.310> on
