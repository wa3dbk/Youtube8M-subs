00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
decided to name her C Mon it's a French
name<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.480> thought<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.989> would<00:01:04.110> be

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
name and I thought that that would be

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
name and I thought that that would be
good<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.949> father<00:01:05.189> from<00:01:05.309> France<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
good because my father from France it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.760 
was in between Bambi in Somali I thought
someone<00:01:09.119> would<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> best<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.560> she's
