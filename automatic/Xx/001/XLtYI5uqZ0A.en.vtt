00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.340
So we're going to try chocolate and churros,
which is a really typical Madrid snack to

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.770
have, not exactly light, melted chocolate
with fried dough dipped in it but its delicious

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.770
so lets go in and try it.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.739
Can you tell us a bit about this place and
why its important in Madrid and what you specialise

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.670
in?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.440
It opened in 1894. Before it was just a churros
shop but over time it gradually turned into

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.469
a chocolate shop and cafe. And churros with
chocolate are characteristic of Spain.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:45.009
And many famous people have been here?

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.979
The famous people who have been here are shown
in the photos handing on the walls. And they've

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.579
been through here at some point in their lives.
And have you seen any?

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.179
I've seen some. MOvies stars, theatre actors,
writers. In the olden days, more literary

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.899
people used to come around. such as Valle
Inchan, and other famous writers like her.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.060
Nowadays you see all types of people, its
a mix of people. The majority of our customers

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.509
are tourists. They come to see the place because
of its international reputation. They come

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:53.759
for the experience.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.149
I think its gone straight to my thighs. How
do the Spanish girls do it? Someone hand me

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.149
a cigarette.
So the waiter told us that a lot of famous

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.710
people come through here like Tina Turner
and Naomi Campbell. I don't think Naomi Campbell

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:18.629
actually ate anything here but I'm sure she
came because here's a photograph to show her

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.440
in the cafe.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.110
Open all day andnigt. For the party animals
of us. 24 hours.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.209
Its like Cheers, where everybody knows your
name.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.040
So we're even open 24 hours of the day and
every day of the year.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.830
I'm sure we'll be coming back for more on
our stay here in Madrid.
