00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
what if we came from elsewhere in the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.009 
what if we came from elsewhere in the
universe<00:04:03.140> but<00:04:03.470> we<00:04:03.530> came<00:04:04.130> as<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.850> and<00:04:05.269> didn't

from other planets that were not able to

from other planets that were not able to

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
sustain life anymore such as Mars and we

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.350 
sustain life anymore such as Mars and we
found<00:04:12.920> this<00:04:13.070> place<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.549> moved<00:04:13.730> here<00:04:13.970> would

found this place and moved here would

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.940 
found this place and moved here would
have<00:04:14.420> liked<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.720> divergent<00:04:15.290> series<00:04:15.530> we<00:04:15.829> were

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
have liked the divergent series we were

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.099 
have liked the divergent series we were
sent<00:04:16.220> here<00:04:16.370> as<00:04:16.549> an<00:04:16.669> experiments<00:04:17.299> because<00:04:17.450> we

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
sent here as an experiments because we

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.140 
sent here as an experiments because we
kind<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.440> destroyed<00:04:18.859> our<00:04:19.070> previous<00:04:19.579> homes<00:04:19.850> and

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
kind of destroyed our previous homes and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.640 
kind of destroyed our previous homes and
we<00:04:20.269> were<00:04:20.419> sent<00:04:20.690> here<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.840> see<00:04:21.140> if<00:04:21.260> we<00:04:21.380> could

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
we were sent here to see if we could

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.440 
we were sent here to see if we could
coexist<00:04:22.070> with<00:04:22.520> each<00:04:22.550> other<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:23.090> if<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.300> is

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
coexist with each other and if that is

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.060 
coexist with each other and if that is
the<00:04:23.570> case<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:23.960> are<00:04:24.050> definitely<00:04:24.410> filling<00:04:24.919> this

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
the case we are definitely filling this

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.280 
the case we are definitely filling this
experiment<00:04:25.669> but<00:04:25.940> regardless<00:04:26.900> if<00:04:27.050> you

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
experiment but regardless if you

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.620 
experiment but regardless if you
I<00:04:27.320> into<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.620> theory<00:04:28.010> of<00:04:28.040> panspermia<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:29.240> think

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
I into the theory of panspermia I think

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.930 
I into the theory of panspermia I think
the<00:04:29.690> takeaway<00:04:30.020> here<00:04:30.050> is<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.560> if<00:04:31.040> scientists

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
the takeaway here is that if scientists

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.180 
the takeaway here is that if scientists
do<00:04:32.210> believe<00:04:32.660> that<00:04:32.870> life<00:04:33.140> can<00:04:33.170> spread<00:04:34.040> around

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
do believe that life can spread around

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.370 
do believe that life can spread around
the<00:04:34.520> universe<00:04:34.910> that<00:04:35.450> would<00:04:35.690> mean<00:04:35.930> there<00:04:36.140> must

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
the universe that would mean there must

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.320 
the universe that would mean there must
be<00:04:36.650> countless<00:04:37.280> worlds<00:04:37.730> out<00:04:37.820> there<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:38.180> is

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
be countless worlds out there that is

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.990 
be countless worlds out there that is
actually<00:04:38.960> filled<00:04:39.500> with<00:04:39.860> life<00:04:40.280> then<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:40.940> would

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
actually filled with life then I would

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000 
actually filled with life then I would
think<00:04:41.450> many<00:04:41.690> of<00:04:41.840> them<00:04:41.990> could<00:04:42.290> be<00:04:42.320> home<00:04:42.710> to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
think many of them could be home to

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.520 
think many of them could be home to
intelligent<00:04:43.790> beings<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.450> not<00:04:44.720> just<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.140> planet

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
intelligent beings and not just a planet

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.280 
intelligent beings and not just a planet
full<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.770> tiny<00:04:46.430> micro<00:04:47.060> organisms<00:04:47.750> but<00:04:48.110> guys

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
of the universe do you think we all

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.740 
of the universe do you think we all
evolved<00:04:54.590> from<00:04:54.830> alien<00:04:55.390> microorganisms<00:04:56.390> or<00:04:56.630> do

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
evolved from alien microorganisms or do

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.510 
evolved from alien microorganisms or do
you<00:04:56.840> think<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:57.140> we<00:04:57.290> were<00:04:57.500> a<00:04:57.650> race<00:04:57.890> of<00:04:57.920> people

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
you think that we were a race of people

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.550 
you think that we were a race of people
that<00:04:58.760> actually<00:04:59.000> just<00:04:59.600> you<00:04:59.690> know<00:04:59.810> migrated

a new platform called vessel if you

check<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.390> out<00:05:08.540> is<00:05:08.720> a<00:05:08.750> new<00:05:08.990> platform<00:05:09.320> with

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
check it out is a new platform with

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.130 
check it out is a new platform with
content<00:05:10.250> from<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.790> lot<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.180> awesome<00:05:11.630> creators

content from a lot of awesome creators
and<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.500> cool<00:05:12.680> thing<00:05:12.710> about<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:13.190> vessel<00:05:13.520> is

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
and the cool thing about the vessel is

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.340 
and the cool thing about the vessel is
that<00:05:13.880> it's<00:05:14.030> going<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.210> have<00:05:14.360> my<00:05:14.630> content<00:05:15.200> in

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
that it's going to have my content in

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.050 
that it's going to have my content in
the<00:05:15.500> content<00:05:15.710> of<00:05:15.980> a<00:05:16.100> bunch<00:05:16.340> of<00:05:16.460> other<00:05:16.730> awesome

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
the content of a bunch of other awesome

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.420 
the content of a bunch of other awesome
creators<00:05:17.870> earlier<00:05:18.350> than<00:05:18.680> YouTube<00:05:19.100> so<00:05:19.280> my

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
creators earlier than YouTube so my

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.860 
creators earlier than YouTube so my
videos<00:05:19.790> are<00:05:19.880> going<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.060> appear<00:05:20.330> first<00:05:20.660> on

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
videos are going to appear first on

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.050 
videos are going to appear first on
vessel<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.560> then<00:05:21.890> on<00:05:22.130> YouTube<00:05:22.760> but<00:05:22.940> you

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
vessel and then on YouTube but you

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.490 
vessel and then on YouTube but you
really<00:05:23.360> won't<00:05:23.570> notice<00:05:23.840> any<00:05:24.140> difference

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
really won't notice any difference

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.930 
really won't notice any difference
because<00:05:24.590> I'm<00:05:24.890> going<00:05:25.010> to<00:05:25.070> continue<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.640> upload

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
because I'm going to continue to upload

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.480 
because I'm going to continue to upload
to<00:05:26.090> YouTube<00:05:26.660> on<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.290> regular<00:05:27.680> schedule<00:05:28.160> it's

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
to YouTube on the regular schedule it's

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.670 
to YouTube on the regular schedule it's
just<00:05:28.760> that<00:05:28.910> if<00:05:29.030> you<00:05:29.120> want<00:05:29.420> early<00:05:29.840> access<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.530> my
