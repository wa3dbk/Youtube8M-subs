00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.530
 another exercise of 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.760
 different from that of 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.680
 properly we could define them as the ones we did 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:12.809
 previously 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.139
 eh the execution of some 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.139
 so called pennati I call them that 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.150
 in my opinion they can serve 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.669
 with small oprandi variations 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.130
 performing songs or other songs 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.540
 cher a person who learns they are on the guitar may wish to 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.310
 and this rhythmic exercise and at the same time also one 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.060
 I call her 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.740
 made data counter hit 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.060
 because according to me in the 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.500
 in this typically American musical genre 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.530
 list of applicants 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.870
 rather often 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.550
 this 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.160
 who can d 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.630
 pinned this 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.010
 let us call it fish forms 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.830
 actually in the cauntri 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.830
 there are many Americans 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.830
 rhythmic figures for which it is not 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.550
 actually 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.120
 to be taken as 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.750
 an indisputable truth mine 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.310
 name of the attacker 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.480
 and also for 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.930
 to distinguish it from other pinnates 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.230
 and therefore giving a name has a stroke to be able to distinguish it then to be able to 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.100
 and understand when 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.450
 we move by doing lesson 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.810
 it is this picking is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.670
 possible to divide it into two parts 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.470
 for convenience of studies 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.780
 the first part consists of 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.990
 low ie 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.990
 you can do the usual 3 comments 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.340
 hence the usual - minimum solar consumption 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.210
 let's call it a generic step 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.510
 what and having the first descendant according to fascendini 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 this is the first part 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.250
 but if you want to follow 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.519
 but now you really are 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.649
 cold with confidence in this movement 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:21.029
 so a kiss for children I can't wait in English and a domain name 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.159
 moms 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.179
 the second part of this picking instead consists of 3 uk parties 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.099
 and I'm 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.190
 to perform 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.540
 with the first of the three starting from the bottom upwards ie with a tread 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.589
 ascending in this way 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.589
 mass 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.099
 we live in london glass 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.099
 I have not 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.849
 never 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.820
 the following this second part 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.699
 in its own right 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.109
 separated from everything else 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.809
 to gain confidence then you can begin to put the two together 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.809
 share the first part 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.829
 in the second ballet 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.889
 trying to get out 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.469
 shower 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.980
 - if you can bovine do 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.669
 the continuous cycle 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.789
 of pen 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.729
 type of exercise 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.729
 we can achieve this result 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.579
 Go 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.579
 I love you 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.549
 That 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.449
 come on 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.449
 I love you 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.669
 obviously the step or generic steps that 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.229
 with which this pen begins 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.279
 we love her 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.189
 eh an important reference even when you will do exercises with this 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.169
 pennata tonight that making songs 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.379
 es 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.889
 what to do if this is born with agreements I with the usual two chords la 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.879
 major I was following right now 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.499
 the minimum 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:18.849
 let me hear 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.519
 this round e 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.859
 see who 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.050
 id low 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.650
 the agreement also changes, i.e. low is executed as the first accent 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.370
 and in the agreement 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.219
 passing from lamma 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.970
 luigia mail 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.789
 sky me minor age 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.539
 menu 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.330
 from 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
 pato 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.020
 30 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.749
 huh 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:51.990
 maroc 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.219
 a 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.509
 meter 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.900
 mimmo 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.339
 go here 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.050
 I did the series 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.499
 elia photo 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:09.369
 always the major and minor always exchanging these two copies 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.870
 and how it was felt I did 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.520
 one strum newborn chamber 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.559
 Mamma Mia 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.629
 pro 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.490
 fractures can be made 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.040
 thematic series 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.889
 country 3 4 according to the wishes of those who are studying 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.889
 I do not recommend exaggerating to go beyond the three peaks because then 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.069
 you can also risk losing your account and so on 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.069
 however this re trekking 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.339
 interior details 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.789
