00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
АТО (Anti-terrorist Operation) Brotherhood.
        When volunteers sing. No. 2

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.820
Miroslav Gai, volunteer. "Bullfinch" folk epic song.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:20.805
As we are told, it is rather "hot" in Debaltseve, the town we are heading to.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:25.065
That is why, to lift the morale, here's “Bullfinch”,

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.665
a folk epic song of Ukrops.

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:31.340
Ukrops—word used by Russians to insult Ukrainians.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.400
This is a homonym for "ukrop", "dill", an aromatic plant, and derives from “Ukraine”.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:44.140
I remember us eating bullfinches, and you, asking me about whether you might have had fresh ones.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.860
"Pour me out something stiff" ("naley!")
was what we had heard from the fields.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.020
These are separatists, f.ck!
Don't you be afraid!

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:04.020
Oh yes, I'll sit astride my slave
and through the fields I will rush away

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.020
where it could be heard "naley".
Shake a leg, my slave!

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:19.940
We are stronger than them, anyway.
When I came in great hurry to the checkpoint

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.740
I saw the crucifix tall as a child there.
 Come on, lads, move on!

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.140
Kill the separatist!

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.940
I tell you, he's yummier than any bullfinch.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.520
I decided to join the Legion.
They say they receive around one million.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.920
Some NATO general
has been choosing for a while.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.760
Than he's chosen and took away my slave.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:07.400
Ouch, bullfinches, my bullfinches, you my birds!
 Bring me day-spring on your wings.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:17.900
Wifie said hello
 to console my soul...

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.500
Do we still need Donbass
or not any more.
