00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello everyone, Ive not noticed 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.629
 what's the recent number of films 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.820
 about superheroes and supervillains will kill everything 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.429
 imaginable and unthinkable records where not 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.590
 look everywhere super heroes games movies all 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.420
 replete with this theme that me as 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.900
 fan of this topic can not 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.160
 to please 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.810
 but unlike most people 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.119
 who are fan of the joker or 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.340
 iron man and look forward to 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.869
 new films with their participation i dream of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 tom to make a sequel 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.640
 dedicated to another no less famous 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.470
 whose character I adore the most 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.320
 young years as you probably already guessed 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.239
 Well, at least read the name of this video 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.520
 I am certainly talking about spawn 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.600
 met this character back in 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.170
 far childhood 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.239
 thanks to the spawn movie released in 1997 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 year the young part of my viewers think not 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.989
 I saw this movie but older 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.250
 generation must remember this cool 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.170
 mystical thriller 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.480
 think I'll start my main story 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.940
 of the hero, that is, with spawn 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.800
 knows who the guys are you are with 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.329
 what planet spawn is this and yet 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.579
 mystical super hero whose 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.920
 that macfarlane invented for the eponymous 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.170
 comic series itself spawn at all 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.930
 not unique like the same wolverine 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.119
 or spiderman i mean that spawn 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 in the water a lot because spawn is just 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.320
 the man who signed the deed 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.869
 after his death spawn of much on 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 let's talk about one named al simmons 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.290
 simmons worked on in his lifetime 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.240
 government or rather the secret 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.400
 service not now service in secret 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.869
 division we repeatedly 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.579
 ordered to kill people and like everyone 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.979
 good soldier he is not thinking 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.970
 executed orders bear he was not 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.979
 bad guy 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.259
 his conscience tormented him for what he did and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.299
 once he decided to quit with service but 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.040
 this was not to happen after 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.930
 resignations he was sent to 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.759
 last task after execution 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.979
 whose he burns alive 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.380
 own boss for sim he is too 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.420
 knew a lot after this the sine falls into 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.310
 hell where successfully concludes a contract with 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.380
 demon and miserable i seem to be right 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 uttered his name though not sure 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 for which he gets his life back well 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.469
 and as a nice little bonus live 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.659
 armor giving superpower well 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.219
 Of course a stylish raincoat but also 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.619
 many other gadgets such as 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.899
 regeneration increased force speed 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.399
 reflexes but similar pleasant 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.019
 things 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.970
 but not everything is as rosy as it can 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.860
 seem at first glance do you 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.689
 might have thought that the contract with the demon is not 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.329
 will bear the consequences but god 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.519
 resurrected simmons so but at the same time 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.409
 erased his memory and resurrection 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.420
 slightly delayed but so for five years 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.700
 tightened in general he revives the meaning 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.709
 5 years after his death, for it 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.780
 time beloved wife of simons by name 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.030
 wanda manages to marry him 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.250
 best friend and give birth to a daughter by name 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.989
 sai n so also to everything in addition body 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.849
 Simmons is very scary and mutilated 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.799
 terrible burns that does not give him 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.049
 opportunities to talk with his wife 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.450
 mutilated this is an understatement he just 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.750
 wishing a little spawn character 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.549
 tragic dark and noir can be so 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.739
 say and mons is constantly tormented by 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.170
 of memories that cuts like shards 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.239
 his soul is not where he can not find peace 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.170
 on the one hand his good part wants 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.389
 help people 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.650
 and on the other hand his warden 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.260
 presented to him in the form of a creepy 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.450
 the clown bows him to the dark side and 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.579
 constantly recalls his contract with 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.439
 demon and poor remember how in childhood to me 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.810
 liked this movie i was watching this 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.970
 times a hundred film well shot rich on 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.669
 beautiful action scenes and abundantly with good 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.310
 good computer graphics but good 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:24.919
 Of course for those times now these scenes 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.049
 look of course a little funny it 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.669
 to put it mildly but if not to carp at 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.949
 some moments then computer 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.480
 graphics to this day looks good in 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:35.269
 childhood I liked most 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.560
 abilities spawn and shootout now 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.690
 I find it more interesting to watch 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.269
 changes in the main character, I mean 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.489
 personality changes from a brutal killer 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.379
 up to the defender of the weak and as always i'm not 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.209
 was able to get round the soundtrack 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.609
 he creates heavy enough 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.769
 awesome atmosphere summing up i 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.959
 I will say this is a good organization 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.269
 comics slept and which to this day 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.010
 able to please her audience as 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.609
 Mighty game acting such an action 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.560
 scenes 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.900
 noticed that I said it was not bad 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.180
 the film version is because there is something 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.840
 better long ago when I studied at 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.970
 eighth grade or 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.129
 even the seventh friend gave me a day 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.530
 the birth of the Greek net with the animated series 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.660
 he is spawn and I remember the animated series now 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.430
 struck me deeply first 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.739
 queue of course its cruelty and 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.380
 darkness usually comics more 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.660
 cruel bloody than their film adaptation but 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.850
 the animated series spawn is an exception to 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.979
 rules in fact the animated series is much more 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.380
 dark and cruel than comics 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.840
 the animated series was very dynamic 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.760
 cruel bloody and very realistic 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.400
 the creators of this series were not afraid 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.889
 nothing and included in their creation scenes 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.200
 violence dismemberment murder and even 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.270
 candid sex scenes now you 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.780
 Do you understand why I grew up so fucked 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.760
 im cartoon series is also great 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.860
 reveals the identity of his spawn 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.229
 inner experiences and transition 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.970
 from dark to bright future yet 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.669
 a boy I loved this gloomy 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.620
 antihero has played a large part of this 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.630
 I remember the animated series as a child 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.610
 really liked the video sequences at the beginning 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.530
 each series in which he himself 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.199
 McFarlane explained some subtleties 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.940
 plot and also casually expressed their 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.450
 thoughts opening the eyes of the viewer on 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.460
 some things will be for you to do 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.330
 if at the time of death the races are sounding 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.620
 out of darkness would offer you life there 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.210
 thinking there will be no time left for you 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.160
 one in heart to a complete stop 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.050
 faster you say all this even more 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.050
 warmed the atmosphere of gloom 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.880
 mystical what I tell you if the movie 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.860
 I can hardly recommend you how 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.169
 special effects in it have long been outdated 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.150
 tass cartoon series is another story 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.580
 drawing cartoon pleases to this day 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.840
 she's pretty realistic and by no means 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.400
 case is not perceived as 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.020
 some kids cartoon 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.090
 if you are a connoisseur of dark tin 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.130
 mystical style then look 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.530
 this animated series is sure it is not you 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.419
 will also disappoint besides comic film and 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.160
 the animated series went out computer and 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.349
 video games 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.030
 but in my humble opinion none of 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.910
 these games don't deserve your attention 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.220
 yes what can I say here in '90 it was 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.470
 the peak of the popularity of the film spawned 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.300
 TV series show on tv and 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.669
 all the boys wanted to get a gift 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.830
 from parents of a favorite hero toy I 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.200
 I sincerely hope that the cinema will remember 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.350
 about this dark and mystical character and 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.300
 will give him a second life again returned 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.850
 and on movie screens all this time for 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.010
 microphone for you ive told each of 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.570
 I say thank you for your attention to all 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.570
 good luck and bye
