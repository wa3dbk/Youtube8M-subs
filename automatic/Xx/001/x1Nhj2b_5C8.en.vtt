is a really inexpensive price point the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.399 
is a really inexpensive price point the
100-page<00:02:23.560> map<00:02:23.950> pack<00:02:24.220> which<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.870> 100<00:02:25.870> different

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
100-page map pack which is 100 different

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.069 
100-page map pack which is 100 different
pages<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:27.069> mean<00:02:27.189> it's<00:02:27.340> all<00:02:28.060> pages<00:02:28.750> are

stuff which will be right here well now
we<00:03:11.440> go<00:03:11.650> into<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.099> you<00:03:13.090> know<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.540> comes<00:03:14.440> off

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
we go into the you know to a comes off

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.460 
we go into the you know to a comes off
like<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:15.700> with<00:03:16.599> 100<00:03:16.930> sheets<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.379> know<00:03:17.440> I

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
like like so with 100 sheets you know I

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.470 
like like so with 100 sheets you know I
was<00:03:17.560> trying<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.829> do<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:17.949> math<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.329> figure<00:03:19.329> out

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
was trying to do the math and figure out

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.689 
was trying to do the math and figure out
how<00:03:20.410> many<00:03:20.470> different<00:03:21.010> variations<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.669> can

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 
how many different variations you can

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.759 
how many different variations you can
lay<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.120> thing<00:03:22.180> out<00:03:22.510> in<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.139> I<00:03:23.230> was<00:03:23.319> figuring

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
lay this thing out in and I was figuring

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.949 
lay this thing out in and I was figuring
it<00:03:23.859> out<00:03:23.980> going<00:03:24.459> kind<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:26.129> exponentially<00:03:27.129> from

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
it out going kind of exponentially from

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.780 
it out going kind of exponentially from
with<00:03:28.959> 100<00:03:29.379> maps<00:03:29.590> how<00:03:29.859> far<00:03:30.069> how<00:03:30.220> big<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.519> get

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
with 100 maps how far how big you get

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.789 
with 100 maps how far how big you get
but<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.540> know<00:03:31.629> when<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.870> take<00:03:32.230> into<00:03:32.410> account

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
but you know when you take into account

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.460 
but you know when you take into account
that<00:03:32.980> if<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.519> turn<00:03:33.790> these<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:35.260> know<00:03:35.379> you

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
that if you turn these you know you

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.780 
that if you turn these you know you
don't<00:03:35.620> have<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.919> turn<00:03:36.069> them<00:03:36.250> all<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.459> exact

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
don't have to turn them all the exact

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.400 
don't have to turn them all the exact
same<00:03:37.000> way<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.319> number<00:03:38.560> gets<00:03:38.739> really<00:03:38.980> big

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
same way it the number gets really big

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.960 
same way it the number gets really big
so<00:03:41.410> check<00:03:41.709> out<00:03:41.799> that<00:03:42.069> room<00:03:42.250> that's<00:03:42.579> still<00:03:42.760> one
