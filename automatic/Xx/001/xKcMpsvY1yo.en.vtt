00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
go that's enough for me I can start the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
go that's enough for me I can start the
installation<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.680> simple<00:00:55.890> Sam<00:00:56.250> could

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
installation this is so simple Sam could

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.930 
installation this is so simple Sam could
do<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:57.920> anyway<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.820> there

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
do that right anyway so that's all there

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060 
do that right anyway so that's all there
is<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.840> clips<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is to it just clips right up there and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
is to it just clips right up there and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
under the firewall yet you want it as

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.780 
under the firewall yet you want it as

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
so you don't lose heat in in the line so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.609 
so you don't lose heat in in the line so
this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> running<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> time<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:10.020> yes<00:01:10.290> we

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this is running all the time then yes we

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.469 
this is running all the time then yes we
monitor<00:01:11.310> battery<00:01:11.670> voltage<00:01:12.150> through<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
monitor battery voltage through a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
monitor battery voltage through a
microprocessor<00:01:12.990> okay<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> start<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
microprocessor okay and you start the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
microprocessor okay and you start the
vehicle<00:01:14.939> when<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> battery<00:01:16.080> go<00:01:16.439> above

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
vehicle when we see the battery go above

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.160 
vehicle when we see the battery go above
13<00:01:17.159> volts<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.640> more<00:01:17.790> than<00:01:17.939> five<00:01:18.150> seconds<00:01:18.630> we

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
13 volts for more than five seconds we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.350 
13 volts for more than five seconds we
turn<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.680> Don<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.270> the

turn to you Don and then if the when the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.060 
turn to you Don and then if the when the
battery<00:01:21.630> goes<00:01:21.840> below<00:01:22.170> twelve<00:01:22.470> point<00:01:22.770> eight<00:01:22.890> we

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
battery goes below twelve point eight we

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
battery goes below twelve point eight we
shut<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.340> off<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.000> while<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> vehicle

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
shut it off and then while the vehicle

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.840 
shut it off and then while the vehicle
is<00:01:24.810> running<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.650> keeps<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.100> hot<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> time

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
is running it keeps it hot all the time

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
is running it keeps it hot all the time
now<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.450> hot<00:01:27.810> water<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.409> talking<00:01:28.740> about

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
now how hot water are you talking about

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
now how hot water are you talking about
on<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.579> heats<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> water<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:31.040> 160

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
on this it heats the water to 160

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
out of it that way the heat has got

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.830 
out of it that way the heat has got
water<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:24.640> it<00:04:24.730> won't<00:04:24.910> burn<00:04:25.060> itself<00:04:25.450> up

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
water and then it won't burn itself up
