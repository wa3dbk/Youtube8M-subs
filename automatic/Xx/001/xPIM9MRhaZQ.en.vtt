00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.149
 francesca brianza from the football gala 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.070
 of the light good evening the Rome is favored 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.829
 for the changeover in Europe 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.509
 league but certainly the rome with 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.650
 the experience that articulated this year 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.450
 in champions league 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.700
 we remember the games from a trader though 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.380
 I tried to play his game now 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.920
 a great opportunity in europe league 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.650
 and he has a game that he can surely do 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.570
 history of this competition for the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.050
 scudetto speech is still favored the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.280
 juve this one, however, is drawing 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.340
 often the Giallorossi are recovering 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.260
 also favored thinks there is a 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.090
 approaching a balance a little more 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.710
 between these three teams it is obvious that 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.690
 juventus remains a great team 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.700
 because he has also been playing together for many years 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.430
 has won three league titles in a row the Rome ha 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.800
 a culture of victory a little more 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.610
 small compared to its direct 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.899
 however, this is my opponent 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.790
 fighting nainggolan affects it as much 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.020
 an attacker is practically lying 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.180
 holland is really great 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.400
 player imposes himself in the midfield but 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.250
 he sees the door well and therefore we hope 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 continue like this can really be the year 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.100
 of Rome despite some highs 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.710
 and low he saw the pounds aside 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.170
 sick down there is in every team 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.490
 especially if the competitions that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.710
 this team have to face are not 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.659
 only focused on the series a 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.210
 in this case we have seen the Rome of 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.770
 return to the champions league spend the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.790
 his strengths this competition too 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.619
 we also see for the other teams 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.360
 so it's not a question of less 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.510
 be careful when you are busy 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.729
 when the forces are doubled and therefore 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.380
 you need to be more in the capital as it is 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.939
 the elimination from the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.330
 champions at some point it seemed 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.549
 formalities after the seven goals for CSKA Moscow 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.960
 formality no there was obviously still the 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.830
 hope however we know it was a desire to 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.450
 try replaying again 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.860
 the importance is not much to lose 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.650
 abandon the champions league now 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.610
 how to impose oneself to return the year 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.189
 next one 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.590
 we close with this rome and really 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.920
 capital of Italian football now with 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.300
 the second rome was the third Lazio 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.340
 the definitive overtaking on Milan this 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.230
 obviously you will have to see at the end 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.760
 at the end of the championship we hope to 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.470
 yes right now the rome is 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.420
 committing to continue doing well 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.640
 as he did last year to deserve 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.440
 certainly not only the latter 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.430
 place to which we hope to us by 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.430
 Romanists who are like this
