00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 how to maintain a ti lanza to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.870
 inside an epiphytic plants 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.430
 the Indian tilt is a plant with six 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.500
 axes there glue bag sticks there since it is 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.619
 able to live on a stone or on 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.689
 a rock in its natural environment then 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.150
 very high temperatures 1 since 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.029
 it's able to live between 10 30 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.490
 45 degrees for this variety of talents 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.890
 say who is a think that hector then 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.689
 this tillandsia that lives on a stone 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.160
 other Indian people are able 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.050
 also to live on a branch they say 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.580
 that they are epiphyte ti lendja 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.980
 epiphytes why because they live 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.320
 on branches the roots do not touch 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.329
 not land and it is not aimed at 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.640
 hooks of tears but simply 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.829
 as a support unlike a 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.079
 parasitic plant as the guide by 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.600
 example so this plant that is on 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.010
 a branch needs moisture and for 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.960
 it will have to be watered 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.030
 practically every day during 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.850
 the summer then we water them with different 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.100
 ways that we spray the foliage so 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.190
 you use a small sprayer 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.259
 with a tiny fog 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.390
 the summer you water them ray at least one 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.000
 times a day while on the other hand 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.560
 winter twice a week will suffice 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.360
 well there is also another system 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.130
 watering for that you can them 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.000
 soak in a bowl 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.189
 that's what we're going to do so 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.909
 you completely soak your they 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.920
 there was this blow leaves in a water at the 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.330
 same temperature as the room it makes 20 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.070
 degrees in the room it takes that water 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.040
 ie 20 degrees preferably use 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.400
 also from the other plus or so water 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.140
 demineralized it suits them very well 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.479
 Tunisians also need fertilizer 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.119
 for that you use a special fertilizer 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.340
 orchids on the other hand you decrease the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.159
 dose per 4 ie after if you 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.079
 give a dose of 2 g all it you the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.850
 report zero g 5 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.009
 olic for that you use a 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.649
 sprayer always with water 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.329
 demineralized or with rainwater 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.250
 that you bring on the foliage 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.680
 it is on strike where he began to bring 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.410
 in the spring when the ti lendja 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.179
 begins to grow indoors 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.040
 vote they said ah you can leave 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.440
 at the edge of a window in a place 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.239
 very bright and during the summer you 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.220
 put in a place write well and 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.819
 you take them outside to the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.859
 light 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.780
 or if or mid-long especially do not forget 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.959
 to water them practically every 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.959
 days
