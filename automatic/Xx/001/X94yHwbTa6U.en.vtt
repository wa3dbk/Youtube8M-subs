00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
first origami video today um I decided

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.220 
first origami video today um I decided
I'd<00:00:05.339> do<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.759> inflatable<00:00:06.390> strawberry<00:00:06.839> just

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
I'd do the inflatable strawberry just

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.780 
I'd do the inflatable strawberry just
because<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.529> really<00:00:07.620> like<00:00:07.859> strawberries<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.460> I

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
because I really like strawberries and I

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.980 
because I really like strawberries and I
thought<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.030> would<00:00:09.120> be<00:00:09.179> perfect<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:09.660> my<00:00:09.780> first

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
thought it would be perfect for my first

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.930 
thought it would be perfect for my first
video<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.590> these<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.920> kind<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.429> my<00:00:11.730> first

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
video so these are kind of like my first

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.060 
video so these are kind of like my first
attempts<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:13.349> one<00:00:13.500> sort<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.740> looks<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
attempts this one sort of looks like a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.230 
attempts this one sort of looks like a
tomato<00:00:14.400> cuz<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.969> blew<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.210> up<00:00:15.330> too<00:00:15.480> much<00:00:15.570> and

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
tomato cuz I blew it up too much and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.060 
tomato cuz I blew it up too much and
this<00:00:18.240> one's<00:00:18.390> my<00:00:18.539> second<00:00:18.869> attempt<00:00:19.260> oh<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.920> just

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
use white paper and this was my third

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
use white paper and this was my third
attempt<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> actually<00:00:24.240> was<00:00:24.449> filming<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
attempt that actually was filming the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.519 
attempt that actually was filming the
video<00:00:25.710> making<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.140> mistake

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
video making this one but I'm a mistake

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.200 
video making this one but I'm a mistake
at<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> end<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.279> holding<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> wrong<00:00:29.789> flops

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
at the end I was holding the wrong flops

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
at the end I was holding the wrong flops
when<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.510> blew<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.689> up<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:31.949> were<00:00:32.040> no

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
when I blew it up so there were no

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.600 
when I blew it up so there were no
leaves

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
leaves

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
leaves
I<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.880> numerous<00:00:33.120> employees<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> thought

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I was on numerous employees so I thought

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.280 
I was on numerous employees so I thought
I<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.190> done<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> video<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:36.210> no<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> wasn't<00:00:36.960> so

I was done the video but no I wasn't so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.170 
I was done the video but no I wasn't so
I<00:00:37.320> had<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.530> make<00:00:37.649> another<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.790> these<00:00:39.000> are

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
I had to make another one so these are

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.209 
I had to make another one so these are
my<00:00:39.300> first<00:00:39.660> attempts<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
my first attempts and I'm just going to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.100 
my first attempts and I'm just going to
using<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.180> plain<00:00:42.420> red<00:00:42.600> paper<00:00:42.840> this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
using like just plain red paper this

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.020 
using like just plain red paper this
time<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.680> case<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.950> mess<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:44.760> sure<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
time just in case I mess up I'm sure you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.150 
time just in case I mess up I'm sure you
won't<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.690> did<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> three<00:00:46.110> times<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
won't because I did it three times and I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.369 
won't because I did it three times and I
really<00:00:48.059> hoped<00:00:48.329> by<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> craft<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> now<00:00:49.050> so

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
really hoped by on the craft is now so

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.869 
really hoped by on the craft is now so

to start with the white side facing up
and<00:00:54.870> there's<00:00:55.260> actually<00:00:55.620> wait<00:00:55.800> there's<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and there's actually wait there's this

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
day but just start with it facing up on

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
day but just start with it facing up on
the<00:01:10.140> white<00:01:10.320> side<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:12.030> first<00:01:12.240> thing<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.420> want

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the white side the first thing you want

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.940 
the white side the first thing you want
to<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> fold<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
to do is you want to fold it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.050 
to do is you want to fold it
horizontally

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300 

make<00:01:21.990> sure<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> crease<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:23.130> well

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
make sure that you crease it really well

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:36.890 
make sure that you crease it really well
because<00:01:23.430> it'll<00:01:23.700> help<00:01:23.790> double<00:01:24.240> process<00:01:35.900> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
because it'll help double process and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.389 
because it'll help double process and
open<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:37.860> fold<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.250> diagonally

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
open it and then fold it diagonally

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:49.700 
open it and then fold it diagonally
right<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:45.320> crease<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:47.369> open<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.710> fold

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
diagonally along here hey and on this

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.969 
diagonally along here hey and on this
fold<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.289> did<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.800> fold

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.490 
it over the other side and this is just
to<00:02:06.210> make<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> next<00:02:06.690> step<00:02:06.750> easier<00:02:09.350> now<00:02:10.350> you
