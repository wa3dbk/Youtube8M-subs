00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
ones video on the bottom ones audio if

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.020 
ones video on the bottom ones audio if
you<00:02:27.480> look<00:02:27.780> under<00:02:28.050> Kodak<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:29.069> should<00:02:29.459> say<00:02:29.730> AC

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
you look under Kodak it should say AC

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.259 
you look under Kodak it should say AC
three<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.840> says<00:02:30.989> dmg<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:32.310> not<00:02:32.550> gonna<00:02:32.670> work<00:02:32.910> so

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
three it says dmg it's not gonna work so

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.460 
three it says dmg it's not gonna work so
make<00:02:34.110> sure<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.560> AC<00:02:34.980> three<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.750> reason<00:02:37.080> why

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
make sure it's AC three the reason why

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.150 
make sure it's AC three the reason why
is<00:02:37.530> because<00:02:37.769> dmg<00:02:38.730> will<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.709> play<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.739> most

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
is because dmg will not play on most

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.539 
is because dmg will not play on most
blu-ray<00:02:41.580> players<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:45.150> video<00:02:45.540> will<00:02:45.720> come<00:02:45.959> up

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
blu-ray players the video will come up

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.160 
blu-ray players the video will come up
but<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.700> audio<00:02:48.060> won't<00:02:48.180> play<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.870> make<00:02:49.140> sure

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
but the audio won't play so make sure

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.120 
but the audio won't play so make sure
it's<00:02:49.440> AC<00:02:49.650> 3<00:02:50.069> AC<00:02:50.549> 3<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.860> compatible<00:02:52.860> with<00:02:52.920> all

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it's AC 3 AC 3 is compatible with all

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.009 
it's AC 3 AC 3 is compatible with all
blu-ray<00:02:53.549> players<00:02:54.330> I'm<00:02:54.450> pretty<00:02:54.900> sure<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.840> once

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
blu-ray players I'm pretty sure but once

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.920 
blu-ray players I'm pretty sure but once
you<00:02:58.140> got<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.410> all<00:02:58.470> down<00:02:59.510> go<00:03:00.510> ahead<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.750> click

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you got that all down go ahead and click

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.289

I've<00:03:04.170> already<00:03:04.500> done<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.239> basically<00:03:06.239> a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
I've already done it so basically a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.759 
I've already done it so basically a
series<00:03:06.569> is<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> movie<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.410> going<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.620> take<00:03:07.739> a

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
series is a movie it's going to take a

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.280 
series is a movie it's going to take a
long<00:03:07.980> time<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.459> convert<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.989> but<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.080> it's

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
long time to convert it but if it's

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.860 
long time to convert it but if it's
video<00:03:10.890> shouldn't<00:03:11.580> take<00:03:11.730> too<00:03:11.760> long<00:03:11.940> but<00:03:12.840> I

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
video shouldn't take too long but I

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.380 
video shouldn't take too long but I
already<00:03:12.989> did<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.940> I'm<00:03:14.940> gonna<00:03:15.090> go<00:03:15.150> ahead<00:03:15.209> and

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
format change to AVC HD as you know it's

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.420 
format change to AVC HD as you know it's
not<00:03:53.280> an<00:03:53.400> MKV<00:03:53.970> anymore<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.170> basically<00:03:56.870> now<00:03:58.430> it's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
not an MKV anymore so basically now it's

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.770 
not an MKV anymore so basically now it's
compatible<00:03:59.819> with<00:04:00.030> your<00:04:00.239> blu-ray<00:04:00.480> player<00:04:02.780> so

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
compatible with your blu-ray player so

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.789 
compatible with your blu-ray player so
let's<00:04:03.930> go<00:04:04.049> ahead<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.260> close<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:04.440> all<00:04:04.650> these

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
let's go ahead and close that all these

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.830 
let's go ahead and close that all these
folders<00:04:05.250> let's<00:04:05.850> go<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.060> image<00:04:07.049> burn<00:04:07.639> um<00:04:08.840> image

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
folders let's go to image burn um image

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.960 
folders let's go to image burn um image
burn<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:10.170> really<00:04:10.410> easy<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.620> use<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:11.310> should

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
burn is really easy to use you should

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.050 
burn is really easy to use you should
know<00:04:12.209> about<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.660> but<00:04:12.840> if<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.049> don't<00:04:13.579> it's<00:04:14.579> it's

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
know about it but if you don't it's it's

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.240 
know about it but if you don't it's it's
pretty<00:04:15.299> simple<00:04:15.600> little<00:04:15.810> program<00:04:16.070> really<00:04:17.070> cool

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
pretty simple little program really cool

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.330 
pretty simple little program really cool
too<00:04:17.459> but<00:04:18.450> um<00:04:18.630> in<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.560> tutorial<00:04:19.739> we're<00:04:20.280> gonna

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
too but um in this tutorial we're gonna

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.230 
too but um in this tutorial we're gonna
be<00:04:20.549> writing<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.150> files<00:04:22.070> not<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.280> image<00:04:23.700> so

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
be writing the files not the image so

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.510 
be writing the files not the image so
make<00:04:24.479> sure<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.780> test<00:04:25.020> files<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.230 

basically<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:29.700> little<00:04:29.850> window<00:04:30.120> will<00:04:30.210> open

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
basically this little window will open

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.000 
basically this little window will open
up<00:04:30.510> go<00:04:31.260> ahead<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:31.560> pop<00:04:31.830> in<00:04:32.100> your<00:04:32.570> regular<00:04:33.570> DVD

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.590 

depending<00:04:38.010> on<00:04:38.100> your<00:04:38.220> file<00:04:38.580> size<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.420> it's

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
depending on your file size and it's

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.960 
depending on your file size and it's
like<00:04:39.780> 8<00:04:40.050> gigs<00:04:40.410> may<00:04:40.710> need<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.890> dual<00:04:41.190> layer<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:41.880> if

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
like 8 gigs may need a dual layer but if

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.640 
like 8 gigs may need a dual layer but if
it's<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.240> 4<00:04:42.540> gigs<00:04:42.810> you're<00:04:43.080> just<00:04:43.260> gonna<00:04:43.410> need

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
it's like 4 gigs you're just gonna need

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.880 
it's like 4 gigs you're just gonna need
a<00:04:43.680> regular<00:04:44.070> game<00:04:44.340> TV<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.900> remember<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:47.180> I
