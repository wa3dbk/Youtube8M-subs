00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
really the whole bundle should be should

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.749 
really the whole bundle should be should
have<00:01:42.170> one<00:01:42.440> rubber<00:01:42.649> band<00:01:42.920> around<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.640> you

have one rubber band around it and you

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.310 
have one rubber band around it and you
can<00:01:43.909> use<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.090> black<00:01:44.390> rubber<00:01:44.659> band<00:01:44.899> if<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.110> want

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.749 
can use a black rubber band if you want
to<00:01:45.470> but<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:45.800> just<00:01:45.979> used<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.250> button<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.520> rubber

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
to but I just used a button a rubber

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.710 
to but I just used a button a rubber
band<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.030> comes<00:01:47.330> with<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.409> hair<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.040> so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
band that comes with the hair and so

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.749 
band that comes with the hair and so
that's<00:01:50.720> how<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:50.929> create<00:01:51.200> your<00:01:51.649> bundles<00:01:52.220> so

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
that's how you create your bundles so

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.550 
that's how you create your bundles so
here<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.149> have<00:01:53.390> three<00:01:54.009> bundles<00:01:55.009> here's<00:01:55.729> one<00:01:56.560> two

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
here I have three bundles here's one two

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.060 
here I have three bundles here's one two
and<00:01:57.920> three<00:01:58.640> bundles<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.360> hair<00:01:59.600> now<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.380> have<00:02:00.770> the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
and three bundles of hair now I have the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.639 
and three bundles of hair now I have the
texture<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.429> my<00:02:01.520> hair<00:02:01.580> I<00:02:01.759> have<00:02:02.000> 4c<00:02:02.720> hair<00:02:03.050> so

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
that afro kinky bulk hair is almost the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.419 
that afro kinky bulk hair is almost the
exact<00:02:07.729> texture<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.420> my<00:02:08.570> 4c<00:02:09.200> hair<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.070> that's

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.300 
exact texture of my 4c hair so that's
one<00:02:10.880> reason<00:02:11.060> why<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.630> works<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.260> looks<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.709> my

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
one reason why it works it looks like my

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.580 
one reason why it works it looks like my
hair<00:02:13.550> because<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.450> almost<00:02:14.780> exact<00:02:15.410> to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
hair because it's it's almost exact to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.570 
hair because it's it's almost exact to
the<00:02:15.709> texture<00:02:16.069> of<00:02:16.160> my<00:02:16.450> 4c<00:02:17.450> hair<00:02:18.010> bobby<00:02:19.010> pin<00:02:19.340> and

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.100 

now<00:04:33.580> this<00:04:33.820> like<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.120> said<00:04:34.150> this<00:04:34.389> is<00:04:34.539> older<00:04:34.900> hair

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
so it sticks out a little bit so I just

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.290 
so it sticks out a little bit so I just
gather<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.949> underneath<00:04:39.479> to<00:04:40.479> make<00:04:40.509> a<00:04:40.750> bunch<00:04:42.300> and

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
gather it underneath to make a bunch and

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.860 
gather it underneath to make a bunch and
stick<00:04:43.600> it<00:04:43.690> there

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.260 

and<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:47.949> stick<00:04:48.100> it<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.669> side<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.090> my

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270

and I just stick it to the side of my
hand<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.690> depending<00:04:50.199> on<00:04:50.320> how<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.530> want<00:04:50.919> it

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.369 

to<00:05:11.050> make<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:11.949> little<00:05:12.129> smaller<00:05:12.639> so<00:05:13.379> you

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:14.379 
to make it a little smaller so you

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.350
