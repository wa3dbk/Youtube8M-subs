00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920
 oh that's heavy what's the same and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.940
 You, what are you doing 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.340
 never agree but now I'm trying 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.880
 to redo the decoration of my part with 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.920
 an iphone 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 yeah I have an app that me 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 let's see where I am going 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.380
 to place my future sofa in fact is there 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 in fact we have applications of said you can 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.920
 go from a sofa to 8 square meters 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.869
 ok but already these two square meters is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.700
 please and it's called the queen and 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.290
 increases and goes from work to not 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380
 confuse with the virtual reality that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.210
 she immerses the user 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.559
 in a completely virtual world with 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.149
 glasses for example levels of 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.440
 offshore gas the google nothing at all 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.780
 it's something that we find 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 example in video games or in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 Real estate when you are visited 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.309
 virtually the apartment of your 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.370
 dreams or typically mine the reality 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.199
 augmented reality ali and the 3d is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.829
 what I mean this contract is a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.870
 stock girl 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.210
 basically these handsets the real world the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.920
 virtual world in real time you can to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.049
 through your screen filming something 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.299
 and add one or more elements 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.520
 fictional fictitious 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.430
 but where do you get that in addition to enough 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.550
 world understood there you see how you want 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 but just the recipe for reality 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.430
 augmented so it's a camera that goes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.470
 allow you to capture a space of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.940
 wholesale one-piece objects to pose the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 framework to those operating that goes 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.240
 allow to calculate and process in 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.370
 real-time information that the camera 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.690
 in voice and finally a medium on which 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.729
 appears this augmented reality 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.810
 typically a screen or two if I have 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.070
 well understood for that reality 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.830
 augmented works it takes 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.630
 markers of geolocation and the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.979
 pattern recognition done at each 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.570
 once the camera moves you need it without 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.280
 stop recalculating the position of each 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.380
 object with geolocation and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 software on the other hand apart from the geeks 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.050
 who are too lazy to go to ikea for 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.300
 buy a couch jo can be at all 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.899
 and that they could be used to yeah bah 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.790
 just watch out 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.740
 beware, I'll give you 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.300
 a few small cases of used that uses 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.920
 augmented reality for example the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.000
 video games ah yeah whore is when you 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.649
 put on a mask and kind you can go 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.130
 in the video game in virtual mode and there 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.140
 you can kill zombies all that is 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.000
 virtual reality you were sure tyner 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.440
 or what when I explain to you is good so 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.340

 and l try glasses through the site of

 sure that they used to 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.440
 less once this application which 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.820
 allows you to simulate a make up and 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:08.070
 virtually test products and has 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:12.390

 additional driving them 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.490
 car manufacturers uses the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.110
 augmented reality by integrating 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.970
 directly into the windshields of their 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.920
 vehicle remembers that my tata such 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.710
 adjustments to the new fell

 gradually we see 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.770
 connected glasses such as google 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.690
 google place or the rollers lens 2 2 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.920
