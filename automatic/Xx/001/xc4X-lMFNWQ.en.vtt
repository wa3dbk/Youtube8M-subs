00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.200 
lock it up in there but you yours might
just<00:01:26.750> be<00:01:26.899> loose<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:27.500> just<00:01:28.189> pry<00:01:28.460> this<00:01:28.520> open<00:01:28.759> and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
just be loose so just pry this open and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.029 
just be loose so just pry this open and
jiggle<00:01:29.719> it<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:29.990> twist<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.469> in<00:01:30.619> there<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:30.920> it

jiggle it and twist it in there and it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.340 
jiggle it and twist it in there and it
might<00:01:31.189> just<00:01:31.430> be<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:32.659> replace<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.170> cover

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
might just be that to replace the cover

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.760 
might just be that to replace the cover
you<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:33.770> put<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:33.979> tab<00:01:34.460> back<00:01:34.729> in<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:36.200> push

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
you just put that tab back in and push

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.849 
you just put that tab back in and push
up<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.930> that's<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.140> overhead<00:01:39.469> dome<00:01:39.649> light

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859
