00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
helicopter and actually using that

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.040 
helicopter and actually using that
vehicle<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> wrecking<00:02:24.120> ball<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.960> it's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
vehicle as a wrecking ball so it's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.270 
vehicle as a wrecking ball so it's
really<00:02:25.200> useful<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.800> don't<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.130> waste

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
really useful if you don't want to waste

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.070 
really useful if you don't want to waste
ammo<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.940> we're<00:02:27.120> good

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.280 

it's<00:02:30.620> really<00:02:30.920> very<00:02:31.610> very<00:02:32.090> few<00:02:32.390> limitations<00:02:32.930> so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
it's really very very few limitations so
