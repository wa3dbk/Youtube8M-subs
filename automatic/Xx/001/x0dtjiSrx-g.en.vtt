00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.810
 The Caspian Sea is unique inland 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.350
 give with rich reserves of valuable breeds 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.230
 fish 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.480
 such as beluga sturgeon spike carp sturgeon 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.800
 and many other antiqued fishing 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.560
 was the main means of existence 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.660
 the local population and the security board 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.490
 then differed great severity on 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.640
 spawning time even in churches ceased 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.329
 ring the bells so as not to scare the fish 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.849
 the Caspian Sea has favorable 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.849
 legal conditions and growing up of young fish 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.810
 in the world sturgeon is officially recognized 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.880
 endangered species root causes 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.210
 ecological situation and growing 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.460
 catch 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.290
 to save the sturgeon gene pool 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.480
 it is necessary to develop their product on the soda 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.310
 growing growing fish in artificial 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.770
 reservoirs artificial breeding 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.690
 sturgeon are engaged in Russian Iranian 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.910
 only Kazakhstani fish farms 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.400
 for Kazakhstan this is a new direction in 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.680
 fish farming on a trance to mass trawl fish 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.660
 water plant grow hammer sturgeon 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.360
 fish species and creates hybrids by 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.400
 inter-species crosses for example by 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.740
 beluga and thorn crossing at the plant 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.210
 getting new bending is managed by the director 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.160
 plant ah from him it says that 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.330
 hybrid forms are more hardy to 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.330
 artificial conditions 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.590
 Cuprin also mode herd goose husky 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 ice poison you need 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.280
 bolt to ultra half dragon for sondo from 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.149
 back 2 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.920
 already many such experimental 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.869
 work coming to an end 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.700
 in the Atyrau region of the plant it seemed that 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.860
 you can manually breed fish and through 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.220
 four years from these fats again getting 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.409
 spawn 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.970
 we will continue this work in 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.190
 further we want the plant to work 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.890
 more actively supports this idea and 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.560
 states until 2009 we will 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.429
 expand the name from 2010 factory 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.670
 will start producing up to 12 million coins 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.479
 here is a certain lived amid the cameleon for 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.739
 scars and 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:10.729
 people according to scientists if experiments 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.010
 will be successful 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.019
 growing hybrids selling caviar and 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.900
 gourmet meat could bring 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.610
 Kazakhstan millions of profits about creating 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.489
 hybrid sturgeon farms will allow 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.780
 reduce poaching on the helmet 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.459
 Svetlana Surgut main fish here 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.739
 the plant is in her charge 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.450
 daily inspection of pets for 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.799
 the first year of life count grows very 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.799
 slowly speaks svetlana 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.540
 this is the most difficult for fry pirie 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.370
 keep special tanks around 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.079
 two weeks later releases in 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.299
 artificial ponds where small sturgeon 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.870
 and are required to walk at least 5 grams 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.579
 weight and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.420
 and only two months later T-shirts 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.420
 will be in the world 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:58.959
 experimental herd is its 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.930
 once left fry that we 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.560
 raised fed pure beluga species 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.069
 sturgeon 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.930
 stellate sticks and hybrids hybrids like this 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.909
 since they belong to the experimental 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.390
 state to look at squeeze on 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.700
 survival as they are on commodity 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.260
 for example and bogs suitable or not as 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.260
 when can I get a game from them 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.670
 Svetlana Surgut says that 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.859
 artificial breeding helps 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.260
 keep abundance and biodiversity 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.540
 fish in the wild due to 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.370
 poaching destruction spawning grounds and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.620
 water pollution achieve 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.200
 positive results not possible 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.989
 with their spawning grounds partially preserved 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.940
 on the river ural alice is weak due to 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:52.930
 the fact that not all migrating adults 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:54.609
 individuals can reach these places fish 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.340
 weakened to spawn because she's 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.739
 spawning period does not eat fish here 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.739
 divided into 2 categories there which 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.290
 it comes in the fall and they spend the winter in the river 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.540
 this time do not eat and 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.120
 due to this, they have their body weakens 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.220
 but still do the same migration 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.030
 go against the flow of water on the river 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:22.010
 also exhausting them all the power to save 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.750
 called the last sturgeon stronghold 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.690
 on the globe and there is no 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.700
 exaggeration about 90 percent of the world 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.860
 stocks of such fish is concentrated precisely 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.110
 here though since the 70s 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.240
 the number of sturgeon here has decreased 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.890
 from nine times today kazakhstan 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.180
 fish farmers make every effort to 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.010
 rebirth of the natural 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.010
 reproduction of valuable species of fish
