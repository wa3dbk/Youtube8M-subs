00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.560
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.860
 lending and today i would like 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.139
 present to you 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.249
 review comparing two tanks like 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.880
 object 143 3 55 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.380
 Yes, I know that object 140 is now 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.420
 not for sale and yes I know that probably 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.679
 almost no one left him but all the same 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.410
 times these two cars of the tenth level we 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.029
 there are very influences on each other 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.050
 it seems and have your own 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.199
 average tanks are probably worth it 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.780
 compare his sexes 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.410
 So I will begin the composition of the fatal objects as 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.210
 you already understood and would like to immediately have you something 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.670
 ask tried to tax we carry 60 fps 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.680
 process became hallelujah neck or whatever 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.810
 no difference you noticed but if 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.680
 it became better necessarily 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.720
 put your thumb over the water 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.460
 video 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.429
 object 140 we start of course without him 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.940
 what do we have here 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.770
 reloading on site 140 I noticed 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.960
 Miracle I will leave the coval on faster than 3 55 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.140
 only three tenths of a second 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.720
 sometimes maybe these three tenths of a second 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.229
 will be able to save your life though for it though 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.560
 obviously not vouch 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 stabilization here on level and something else 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.960
 I was more pleased because this is information 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.530
 this machine is mixing 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.640
 slightly more interesting to what 3 55 explaining 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.460
 why yes here anadira who shot 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.799
 seconds as 3 55 but 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.100
 if we are here and anb turn 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219
 corpus the summary information is wrong 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.209
 strongly loses as 55 there immediately about 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.240
 the tables are all lap of the size of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.719
 galaxy here we have this does not happen 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.909
 that is, we can fight the corps at 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.670
 this trying to substitute him 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.930
 right to go there the opponents of us are not 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.560
 struck 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.100
 about it by the way a little later and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.280
 at the same time we keep acceptable accurate 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.330
 firing 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.290
 This is the first plus compared to 3 55 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.160
 further armor compared 155 here 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.980
 just incredibly strong r r sick in him 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.630
 does not break us as you can see its object mso 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.010
 padding pp stan and this is a 300 millimeters 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.570
 breakthroughs who don't know us don't break through there 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.759
 no blue at all 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.849
 I tried lapin none for my money 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.769
 for your prompt this career 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.969
 I do not remember trips to Astana 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.019
 single penetration 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.430
 so that I have the top 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.969
 potential so this machine can im there 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.189
 forge while we still have creative tower 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.140
 yes he is already 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.300
 if enemies using golden shells with 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.620
 breaking 300 millimeters already scrap 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.520
 the tower begins to give in but up 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.959
 this same projectile quite steadfastly 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.499
 Of course the bottom scolded us 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.799
 breaks through but here by the way chic 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.679
 just a moment 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.799
 how he didn't shine after the shot didn't 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.659
 clear 0 is not the point 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.790
 The percentage of lower armor sheet we certainly do not 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.019
 so cool but the car is very low 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.569
 just incredibly low it is lower 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.809
 probably any other car on the tenth 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:55.359
 level 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.089
 but so the report can probably with her 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:58.060
 to compete 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.739
 and at the same time hit them almost 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:00.909
 is impossible 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.199
 The process of that is plum 200 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.139
 sheets 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.239
 he just won't be able to evict your corps 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.829
 will try to tower customer 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.909
 cling to get his accuracy hardly 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.479
 he will succeed 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.919
 that is, t 55 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.099
 and a little higher and again it can be 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.319
 attributed to the pros 140 sq. objects 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.709
 a couple of weeks no complaints in principle 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.719
 absolutely the same heavy 130 damage but 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.549
 that's a little better stabilization 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.400
 the armor is higher than that of 55 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.059
 I think because 55 is not so strong top 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.889
 boundaries although he is undoubtedly very 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:32.580
 is good 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.650
 im arable land but in principle the tower is such that 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.560
 probably just bigger sizes 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.439
 the bank itself is bigger 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.319
 here for days compactly crammed 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.319
 so let's say 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.979
 at the same time on kp of the car almost identical 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.419
 there are 3,400 there too 3 thousand thousand 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.579
 as far as I remember and that is for this 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.410
 indicator they are comparable but 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.110
 the speed of the car is slightly different 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.690
 he seemed to me that object 140 and a little 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.089
 faster though again this 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.599
 maybe it just might have been purely mine 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.389
 opinion so and mumps in fact they are not 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.890
 different st maybe 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.989
 and the very drops 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.259
 but at the same time we have here all the same more 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:10.859
 adequate stabilization on 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.649
 penny and a penny better scolding but 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.099
 so there in the tenth level 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.789
 that you could ever get in 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.759
 Roulette EC is just great too 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.359
 situation is fine then 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.409
 bartak here by the way cardboard how exactly 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.280
 any other soviet tanks 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.569
 average so you can not deliver them 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.189
 I think that object 140 is still on the food 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.749
 the point exceeds 55 but since so buy and you 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:32.569
 it's not possible now 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:33.319
 Who 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.089
 no problems arise no 

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.590
 must 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.540
 basically shoot like shot at 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.289
 Astelite what are the goals time 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.399
 u up to 3 meters see you next 

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.979
 video parts
