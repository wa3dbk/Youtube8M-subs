went the two or three hundred grams of
nuts<00:00:29.130> well<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> tried<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.740> two<00:00:31.740> days<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
nuts well I tried that for two days and

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.889 
nuts well I tried that for two days and
I<00:00:33.480> couldn't<00:00:33.870> eat<00:00:34.050> any<00:00:34.320> more<00:00:34.500> nuts<00:00:34.770> um<00:00:35.899> it's

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I couldn't eat any more nuts um it's

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
I couldn't eat any more nuts um it's
just<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.950> don't<00:00:38.190> even<00:00:38.309> feel<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.640> eating<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
just you don't even feel like eating it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.190 
just you don't even feel like eating it
so<00:00:40.460> yeah<00:00:41.460> nuts<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> equation<00:00:42.480> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so yeah nuts is out of the equation I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.470 
so yeah nuts is out of the equation I
mean<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:43.980> about<00:00:44.010> 50<00:00:44.700> grams<00:00:44.969> every<00:00:45.300> day

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
mean I can do about 50 grams every day

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.920 
mean I can do about 50 grams every day
but<00:00:46.170> any<00:00:46.410> more<00:00:46.649> than<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.120> it's<00:00:48.120> useless

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
but any more than that and it's useless

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.670 
but any more than that and it's useless
and<00:00:49.320> my<00:00:49.739> fat<00:00:50.010> was<00:00:50.190> around<00:00:50.430> 150<00:00:51.030> grams<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.420> day<00:00:51.680> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and my fat was around 150 grams a day so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.240 
and my fat was around 150 grams a day so
for<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> bitch<00:00:53.280> sluggish<00:00:54.239> although<00:00:55.250> etching

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
for a bitch sluggish although etching

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.240 
for a bitch sluggish although etching
there's<00:00:56.489> two<00:00:56.699> days<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.390> lost<00:00:57.809> weight

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
there's two days actually lost weight

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.900 
there's two days actually lost weight
which<00:00:59.250> also<00:00:59.489> wasn't<00:00:59.879> good<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.129> nuts<00:01:02.670> were

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
which also wasn't good and the nuts were

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.240 
which also wasn't good and the nuts were
taking<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.899> place<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.250> important

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
taking the place of important

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.109 
taking the place of important
carbohydrates<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:08.299> protein<00:01:09.710> because

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
carbohydrates and protein because

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
carbohydrates and protein because
there's<00:01:12.119> actually<00:01:12.510> more<00:01:12.720> protein<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.680> soy

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
there's actually more protein in soy

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.359 
there's actually more protein in soy
products<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.320> its<00:01:16.320> high<00:01:16.500> quality<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.890> not

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
products and its high quality and it not

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.530 
products and its high quality and it not
certainly<00:01:20.850> don't<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
certainly don't have a lot of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.050 
certainly don't have a lot of
carbohydrates<00:01:22.549> although<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.729> kind<00:01:24.000> of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
carbohydrates although I was kind of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.530 
carbohydrates although I was kind of
expecting<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:27.330> not

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
expecting that because it's it's not

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.420 
expecting that because it's it's not

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.500 
at my myfitnesspal and I realized that
I've<00:02:44.000> been<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.600> over<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.100> calories<00:02:46.640> had

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
I've been going over on the calories had

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.130 
I've been going over on the calories had
a<00:02:47.540> calorie<00:02:48.020> surplus<00:02:48.230> every<00:02:49.160> day<00:02:49.840> although<00:02:50.840> my

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
a calorie surplus every day although my

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.220 
a calorie surplus every day although my
weight<00:02:51.410> hasn't<00:02:51.680> been<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.520> up<00:02:52.810> as<00:02:53.810> much<00:02:54.050> as

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
weight hasn't been going up as much as

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.440 
weight hasn't been going up as much as
I'd<00:02:54.350> like<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.250> don't<00:02:55.850> think<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:56.150> really

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
I'd like it to I don't think it's really

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.000 
I'd like it to I don't think it's really
moved<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:58.130> couple<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.520> weeks<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.870> I'm<00:03:00.500> just

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
moved in a couple of weeks so I'm just

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.960 
moved in a couple of weeks so I'm just
wondering<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:03.410> app<00:03:03.560> says<00:03:03.920> 3,000<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.850> need

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
wondering the app says 3,000 I need

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.640 
wondering the app says 3,000 I need
three<00:03:05.120> thousand<00:03:05.540> four<00:03:05.690> hundred<00:03:05.720> calories<00:03:06.440> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
three thousand four hundred calories and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.170 
three thousand four hundred calories and
I<00:03:06.770> know<00:03:06.830> that's<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.340> bit<00:03:07.520> low<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:07.760> I've<00:03:08.030> been

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
I know that's a bit low so I've been

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.020 
I know that's a bit low so I've been
doing<00:03:08.650> 3700<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:12.340> mean<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.370> suppose<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:13.910> been

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
doing 3700 so I mean I suppose have been

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.590 
doing 3700 so I mean I suppose have been
consuming<00:03:14.600> about<00:03:15.940> 3,700<00:03:16.940> so<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.120> should<00:03:17.360> be<00:03:17.390> the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
consuming about 3,700 so I should be the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.509 
consuming about 3,700 so I should be the
same<00:03:17.780> way<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.200> i<00:03:21.230> probably<00:03:21.680> need<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:21.980> get<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:22.310> an

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
same way so i probably need to get in an

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.830 
same way so i probably need to get in an
extra<00:03:23.030> 300<00:03:23.269> calories<00:03:24.019> i'd<00:03:24.350> say<00:03:24.590> for<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.100> surplus

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
extra 300 calories i'd say for a surplus

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.960 
extra 300 calories i'd say for a surplus
so<00:03:26.840> now<00:03:27.320> I<00:03:27.350> know<00:03:27.560> exactly<00:03:27.799> what<00:03:28.400> calories<00:03:28.850> I

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
so now I know exactly what calories I

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.740 
so now I know exactly what calories I
need<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.510> build<00:03:30.200> muscle<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.890> add<00:03:31.850> weight<00:03:34.750> you

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
need to build muscle and add weight you

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.310 
need to build muscle and add weight you
could<00:03:36.019> add<00:03:36.260> weight<00:03:36.470> on<00:03:36.940> 3700<00:03:37.959> like<00:03:38.959> which<00:03:39.170> is

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
could add weight on 3700 like which is

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.340 
could add weight on 3700 like which is
the<00:03:39.530> mate<00:03:40.060> calorie<00:03:41.060> said<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.450> used<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:42.049> maintain

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
the mate calorie said I used to maintain

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.220 
the mate calorie said I used to maintain
my<00:03:42.799> weight<00:03:43.180> however<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.330> want<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.840> be<00:03:44.930> sure<00:03:45.200> that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
my weight however I want to be sure that

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.110 
my weight however I want to be sure that
i'm<00:03:47.260> getting<00:03:48.260> enough<00:03:48.440> calories<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.760> just

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
i'm getting enough calories so I just

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.740 
i'm getting enough calories so I just
make<00:03:50.360> sure<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.570> get<00:03:50.780> about<00:03:50.920> 4,100<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:52.430> day<00:03:52.750> from

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
make sure I get about 4,100 a day from

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.190 
make sure I get about 4,100 a day from
now<00:03:53.959> now<00:03:54.620> despite<00:03:55.070> my<00:03:57.130> calorie<00:03:58.130> maintenance<00:03:58.400> I

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
now now despite my calorie maintenance I

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.449 
now now despite my calorie maintenance I
have<00:04:00.200> been<00:04:00.470> my<00:04:00.769> strength<00:04:01.070> has<00:04:01.190> been

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
have been my strength has been

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.690 
have been my strength has been
increasing<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.269> did<00:04:03.200> one<00:04:03.620> or<00:04:03.799> three<00:04:04.010> kilograms

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
increasing I did one or three kilograms

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.690 
increasing I did one or three kilograms
on<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.180> squat<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:05.870> four<00:04:06.470> reps<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:09.430> as<00:04:10.430> it

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
on the squat for four reps and as it

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.490 
on the squat for four reps and as it
bench<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.269> being<00:04:11.480> able<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.750> do<00:04:11.930> ninety<00:04:12.320> five

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
bench of being able to do ninety five

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.319 
bench of being able to do ninety five
kilograms<00:04:13.160> per<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:14.260> 92.5<00:04:15.260> for<00:04:16.000> three<00:04:17.000> or

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
kilograms per to and 92.5 for three or

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.370 
kilograms per to and 92.5 for three or
four<00:04:17.660> current<00:04:18.500> three<00:04:19.040> probably<00:04:20.020> so<00:04:21.020> my

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
four current three probably so my

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.100 
four current three probably so my
strength<00:04:21.650> has<00:04:21.709> been<00:04:21.950> going<00:04:22.220> up<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.400> bit<00:04:23.110> so

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
strength has been going up a bit so

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.210 
strength has been going up a bit so
that's<00:04:24.650> good

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.920 

although<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.520> might<00:04:28.729> just<00:04:29.090> be<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.660> fact

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
although that might just be the fact

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.350 
although that might just be the fact
that<00:04:30.050> I'm<00:04:30.289> doing<00:04:30.530> lower<00:04:31.370> reps<00:04:31.699> at<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.030> moment

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
that I'm doing lower reps at the moment

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.120 
that I'm doing lower reps at the moment
I'm<00:04:32.690> training<00:04:33.280> three<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.370> four<00:04:34.550> times<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:35.030> week

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
I'm training three to four times a week

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.839 
I'm training three to four times a week
every<00:04:37.130> second<00:04:37.490> day<00:04:37.639> so<00:04:37.699> if<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.449> start<00:04:39.380> on<00:04:39.680> a

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
every second day so if I start on a

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.480 
every second day so if I start on a
Tuesday<00:04:40.849> upon<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.360> get<00:04:41.539> three<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:41.990> but<00:04:42.490> yeah

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
Tuesday upon you get three in but yeah

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.920 
Tuesday upon you get three in but yeah
if<00:04:43.699> I<00:04:43.819> start<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.180> monday<00:04:44.479> i<00:04:44.509> get<00:04:45.220> all<00:04:46.220> for<00:04:46.610> it

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
if I start on monday i get all for it

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.600 
if I start on monday i get all for it
the<00:04:47.930> reason<00:04:48.229> i<00:04:48.289> do<00:04:48.349> three<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:49.009> four<00:04:49.160> times<00:04:49.190> a

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
the reason i do three to four times a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.469 
the reason i do three to four times a
week<00:04:49.639> is<00:04:50.000> because<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:51.860> usually<00:04:52.190> if<00:04:52.819> you're

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
week is because you usually if you're

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.290 
week is because you usually if you're
doing<00:04:53.720> more<00:04:53.990> than<00:04:54.020> four<00:04:55.030> you're<00:04:56.030> usually

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
doing more than four you're usually

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.969 
doing more than four you're usually
overtraining<00:04:57.370> unless<00:04:58.370> you<00:04:58.610> have<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:59.979> don't

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
overtraining unless you have I don't

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.740 
overtraining unless you have I don't
know<00:05:01.069> what<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.370> reasons<00:05:01.759> are<00:05:01.940> behind<00:05:02.330> doing

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
know what the reasons are behind doing

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.640 
know what the reasons are behind doing
five<00:05:03.650> times<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:04.039> week<00:05:04.069> but<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.520> train<00:05:05.440> upper<00:05:06.440> body

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
five times a week but I train upper body

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.360 
five times a week but I train upper body
and<00:05:06.740> lower<00:05:06.949> body<00:05:08.020> twice<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.080> week<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:10.130> that

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
and lower body twice a week and that

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.620 
and lower body twice a week and that
seems<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:10.729> work<00:05:10.970> for<00:05:11.180> me<00:05:12.849> although<00:05:13.849> I<00:05:13.880> kind<00:05:14.569> of

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
seems to work for me although I kind of

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.760 
seems to work for me although I kind of
want<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.930> split<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.250> upper<00:05:16.759> day<00:05:16.909> into<00:05:17.419> two

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
want to split the upper day into two

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.399 
want to split the upper day into two
because<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:19.659> just<00:05:20.659> the<00:05:20.810> sheer<00:05:21.020> amount<00:05:21.080> of

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
because the just the sheer amount of

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.730 
because the just the sheer amount of
volume<00:05:21.620> I<00:05:22.039> do<00:05:22.250> on<00:05:22.819> one<00:05:23.419> day<00:05:23.659> seems<00:05:24.139> to<00:05:24.229> be<00:05:24.409> a<00:05:24.440> lot

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
volume I do on one day seems to be a lot

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.100 
volume I do on one day seems to be a lot
seems<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.370> be<00:05:25.430> too<00:05:25.639> much<00:05:25.669> you<00:05:26.569> know<00:05:26.659> once<00:05:26.870> i<00:05:26.960> get

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
seems to be too much you know once i get

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.140 
seems to be too much you know once i get
through<00:05:27.319> chest<00:05:27.680> back<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:31.000> biceps<00:05:32.000> and

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
through chest back and biceps and

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.980 
through chest back and biceps and
triceps<00:05:32.330> i<00:05:33.130> feel<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.690> shoulders<00:05:35.690> would

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
triceps i feel that shoulders would

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.080 
triceps i feel that shoulders would
almost<00:05:36.320> be<00:05:36.560> pointless<00:05:36.979> at<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:37.820> point

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
almost be pointless at that point

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.490 
almost be pointless at that point
because<00:05:38.419> besides<00:05:39.349> my<00:05:39.770> triceps<00:05:41.500> they're

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
because besides my triceps they're

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.999 
because besides my triceps they're
completely<00:05:43.130> burnt<00:05:43.430> out<00:05:43.639> by<00:05:43.849> that<00:05:44.090> time<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:45.009> i

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
completely burnt out by that time and i

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.490 
completely burnt out by that time and i
feel<00:05:46.430> that<00:05:48.370> yeah<00:05:49.370> so<00:05:49.610> legs<00:05:50.090> day<00:05:50.419> is<00:05:50.840> a<00:05:50.900> lot

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
feel that yeah so legs day is a lot

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.370 
feel that yeah so legs day is a lot
shorter<00:05:51.560> it's<00:05:52.219> only<00:05:52.490> about<00:05:53.259> three<00:05:54.259> or<00:05:54.289> four

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
shorter it's only about three or four

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.520 
shorter it's only about three or four
exercises<00:05:54.889> so<00:05:55.699> i<00:05:56.030> think<00:05:56.630> i<00:05:56.840> should<00:05:56.900> probably

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
exercises so i think i should probably

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.120 
exercises so i think i should probably
swap<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.990> shoulders<00:05:59.990> put<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.590> shoulders<00:06:00.979> on

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
swap the shoulders put the shoulders on

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.850 
swap the shoulders put the shoulders on
either<00:06:01.819> another<00:06:02.240> day<00:06:02.539> or<00:06:02.840> on<00:06:03.229> the<00:06:03.349> lakes<00:06:03.560> day

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
either another day or on the lakes day

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.700 
either another day or on the lakes day
and<00:06:04.159> then<00:06:04.759> keep<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.210> upper<00:06:05.449> upper<00:06:06.110> body<00:06:06.319> just

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
and then keep the upper upper body just

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.890 
and then keep the upper upper body just
back<00:06:07.370> and<00:06:07.580> chest<00:06:07.759> and<00:06:08.319> triceps<00:06:09.319> and<00:06:09.469> biceps

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
back and chest and triceps and biceps

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.760 
back and chest and triceps and biceps
basically<00:06:11.900> what<00:06:12.080> i<00:06:12.110> was<00:06:12.259> trying<00:06:12.409> to<00:06:12.560> do<00:06:12.650> with

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
basically what i was trying to do with

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.180 
basically what i was trying to do with
the<00:06:12.860> nuts<00:06:13.069> is<00:06:13.340> a<00:06:13.819> get<00:06:14.330> protein<00:06:14.810> but<00:06:15.199> also<00:06:15.469> be

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
the nuts is a get protein but also be

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.300 
the nuts is a get protein but also be
get<00:06:16.849> zinc<00:06:17.659> because<00:06:18.020> actually<00:06:18.800> nuts<00:06:19.069> have

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
get zinc because actually nuts have

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.610 
get zinc because actually nuts have
quite<00:06:19.639> a<00:06:19.669> lot<00:06:19.849> of<00:06:19.940> zinc<00:06:20.150> and<00:06:20.469> minerals<00:06:21.469> in

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
quite a lot of zinc and minerals in

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.300 
quite a lot of zinc and minerals in
general<00:06:22.300> however<00:06:23.300> they<00:06:23.599> were<00:06:23.810> high<00:06:24.110> in

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
general however they were high in

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.050 
general however they were high in
manganese<00:06:25.310> and<00:06:27.099> copper<00:06:28.099> and<00:06:28.580> a<00:06:28.639> few<00:06:28.789> others

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
manganese and copper and a few others

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.309 
manganese and copper and a few others
that<00:06:29.090> i<00:06:29.360> didn't<00:06:29.659> really<00:06:29.750> want<00:06:30.050> in<00:06:30.110> there

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 
that i didn't really want in there

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.519 
that i didn't really want in there

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
either so just the zinc supplement and

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.510 
either so just the zinc supplement and
fruits<00:06:34.099> and<00:06:34.279> veggies<00:06:34.699> and<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.990> soy<00:06:36.199> milk
