00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello how about friends in this new video 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.990
 I'll show you how to format 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.310
 USB memories or external hard drives 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.279
 from our mac 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.580
 as you can see this hard drive is not 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 empty 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.850
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.850
 enter the disk utility 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.500
 once in the disk utility let's 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.079
 select our hard drive 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.909
 and we are going to give it to erase 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.790
 here in format we are going to choose the 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:45.280
 format that we want to give 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.200
 if it is a usb memory of less than 4 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.630
 gigabytes the advisable thing is to kill it 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.270
 it's easy but if it's a hard drive 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.720
 external 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.640
 you have to format it in ntfs so it will be 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.050
 compatible with windows or with any 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.050
 another operating system 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.129
 let's put a name 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.129
 and then we give it to erase 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.930
 as you can see, the hard disk has changed 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.070
 name and it's completely 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.070
 formatted and clean 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.220
 in the partitions tab we can 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.740
 select how many parts we want 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.200
 give in this case up to 16 what we 're going 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.960
 to do us is partition arlo in 2 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.920
 we select one of the partitions you 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.920
 let's put a name 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.540
 In what format do we want it in this case? 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.970
 ntfs and the size we will leave it at 160 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.770
 since it is half of the hard disk the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.070
 another half we will change the name 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.070
 as well 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.000
 we select the file system 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.800
 ntfs 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.830
 and we leave it with the size that is already 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.690
 and then we will apply 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.160
 this message is telling us that it 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.000
 they will delete all the files that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.000
 have our hard drive 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.470
 it would be like a format again we're going 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.470
 to give create partition 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.400
 as you can see our hard disk is already 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.810
 partitioned we have two parts 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.810
 completely write them 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.300
 and ready to use in windows or in 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.300
 any other operating system 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.930
