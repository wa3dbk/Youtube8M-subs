00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it just sort of started differently than

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.279 
it just sort of started differently than
I'd<00:00:23.039> hoped<00:00:23.269> but<00:00:24.269> my<00:00:24.570> heavenly<00:00:24.960> was<00:00:25.080> sort<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
I'd hoped but my heavenly was sort of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.660 
I'd hoped but my heavenly was sort of
the<00:00:25.380> perfect<00:00:25.529> match<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.070> his<00:00:26.189> team's<00:00:26.400> I'm

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the perfect match for his team's I'm

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.150 
the perfect match for his team's I'm
adamant<00:00:27.180> unburden<00:00:27.810> obviously<00:00:28.320> that's<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
adamant unburden obviously that's the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
adamant unburden obviously that's the
only<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.519> good<00:00:29.550> side<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.090> run<00:00:30.210> normal<00:00:30.570> gym

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
only really good side to run normal gym

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.250 
only really good side to run normal gym
fake-out<00:00:31.230> rockside<00:00:31.830> high<00:00:32.250> jump<00:00:32.520> kick<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
fake-out rockside high jump kick and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.780 
fake-out rockside high jump kick and
lace<00:00:34.260> kick<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> skip<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
lace kick so I'm just going to skip to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.549 
lace kick so I'm just going to skip to
the<00:00:35.880> fifth<00:00:36.059> turn<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.260> that's<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the fifth turn as you can see that's the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.130 
the fifth turn as you can see that's the
main<00:00:37.710> reason<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.100> swapped<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:40.020> because

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
main reason I swapped out just because

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260 
main reason I swapped out just because
that<00:00:40.379> intimidate<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.399> probably<00:00:41.670> could<00:00:42.120> not

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
that intimidate I probably could not

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.090 
that intimidate I probably could not
have<00:00:42.390> gotten<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> sweep<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.890> honest

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
have gotten the sweep if that was honest

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100 
have gotten the sweep if that was honest
why<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.399> sort<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.550> swapped<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.180> did

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
why I just sort of swapped out and did

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.540 
why I just sort of swapped out and did
some<00:00:46.350> crazy<00:00:46.590> stuff<00:00:46.890> didn't<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> whole<00:00:47.489> lot

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
some crazy stuff didn't make a whole lot

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.950 
some crazy stuff didn't make a whole lot
of<00:00:47.670> differences<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.390> sort<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> weakened

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
of differences just sort of weakened

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.939 
of differences just sort of weakened
this<00:00:49.550> mega<00:00:51.320> gearless<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.530> doesn't<00:00:52.829> mega

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
this mega gearless and it doesn't mega
