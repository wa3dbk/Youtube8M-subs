00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
one of my favorite rides by the way the

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.069 
one of my favorite rides by the way the
wait<00:03:24.500> time<00:03:24.709> was<00:03:24.829> about<00:03:24.949> a<00:03:25.069> hundred<00:03:25.310> minutes

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
wait time was about a hundred minutes

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.930 
wait time was about a hundred minutes
but<00:03:27.079> in<00:03:27.409> that<00:03:27.709> hundred<00:03:28.129> minutes<00:03:28.280> using<00:03:28.729> the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
but in that hundred minutes using the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.119 
but in that hundred minutes using the
single<00:03:29.120> rider<00:03:29.449> system<00:03:29.959> i<00:03:30.139> was<00:03:30.680> able<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:30.979> ride

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
single rider system i was able to ride

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.110 
single rider system i was able to ride
it<00:03:31.250> may<00:03:31.400> be<00:03:31.599> 57<00:03:32.599> times<00:03:33.310> just<00:03:34.310> see<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.579> might<00:03:34.970> be

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
it may be 57 times just see it might be

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.309 
it may be 57 times just see it might be
appropriate<00:03:35.329> footage<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.870> stuff<00:03:36.079> and

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
appropriate footage and stuff and

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.580 
appropriate footage and stuff and
because<00:03:36.709> i<00:03:36.919> like<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.579> lot<00:03:38.409> the<00:03:39.409> only

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
because i like it a lot the only

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.520 
because i like it a lot the only
downside<00:03:39.829> is<00:03:40.099> is<00:03:40.549> if<00:03:41.389> you<00:03:41.900> do<00:03:42.049> single<00:03:42.379> rider

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
downside is is if you do single rider

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.680 
downside is is if you do single rider
there<00:03:42.859> might<00:03:43.430> be<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.699> chance<00:03:44.000> where<00:03:44.389> there<00:03:44.599> will

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
there might be a chance where there will

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.589 
there might be a chance where there will
never<00:03:44.870> be<00:03:45.049> an<00:03:45.319> opportunity<00:03:45.919> for<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:47.269> single

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
never be an opportunity for a single

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.020 
never be an opportunity for a single
rider<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.109> you<00:03:49.069> might<00:03:49.280> be<00:03:49.459> there<00:03:49.699> and

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
rider so you might be there and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.319 
rider so you might be there and
everyone's<00:03:50.780> an<00:03:50.930> even<00:03:51.229> party<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:51.889> i<00:03:52.220> guess<00:03:53.150> it's

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
everyone's an even party so i guess it's

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.629 
everyone's an even party so i guess it's
just<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:53.599> timing<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:54.139> you<00:03:54.440> need<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:55.549> get

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
just the timing that you need to to get

down on myself some other rides that
you'll<00:03:58.729> see<00:03:58.879> in<00:03:58.939> the<00:03:59.030> video<00:03:59.290> which<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.470> called

Sinbad storybook voyage when you look at
the<00:04:03.439> videos<00:04:03.769> it's<00:04:03.919> going<00:04:04.099> to<00:04:04.159> look<00:04:04.310> like<00:04:04.340> it's

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
the videos it's going to look like it's

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.839 
the videos it's going to look like it's
a<00:04:04.790> small<00:04:05.060> world<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.629> it's<00:04:06.620> not<00:04:06.889> they<00:04:07.729> actually

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
a small world but it's not they actually

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.479 
a small world but it's not they actually
have<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> story<00:04:08.629> of<00:04:08.900> beam<00:04:09.079> some<00:04:12.340> parts<00:04:13.340> of

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
have a story of beam some parts of

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.279 
have a story of beam some parts of
characters<00:04:14.090> actual<00:04:14.569> characters<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:16.060> the

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
characters actual characters in the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.899 
characters actual characters in the
audio-animatronic<00:04:18.289> so<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.590> robots<00:04:18.919> are<00:04:19.609> very

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:19.909 
audio-animatronic so the robots are very

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.959 
audio-animatronic so the robots are very
fluid<00:04:20.479> much<00:04:20.690> more<00:04:20.900> fluid<00:04:21.109> than<00:04:21.639> its<00:04:22.639> small

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:22.969 
fluid much more fluid than its small

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.969 
fluid much more fluid than its small
world

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.700 

besides<00:04:26.979> that<00:04:27.159> if<00:04:27.759> you<00:04:28.060> like<00:04:28.300> parades<00:04:28.810> and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
besides that if you like parades and

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
that was pretty interesting on very good

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.879

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
fireworks and a lot of cool engineering

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.629 
fireworks and a lot of cool engineering
that<00:04:51.370> went<00:04:51.490> on<00:04:51.669> with<00:04:51.819> it<00:04:53.219> the<00:04:54.219> park<00:04:54.460> does

everything within a few hours I mean
depending<00:05:05.020> on<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.229> wait<00:05:05.349> times<00:05:05.620> if<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.520> use

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
depending on the wait times if you use

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.430 
depending on the wait times if you use
like<00:05:06.940> Fast<00:05:07.240> Pass<00:05:07.449> efficiently<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.229> things

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
like Fast Pass efficiently and things

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.270
