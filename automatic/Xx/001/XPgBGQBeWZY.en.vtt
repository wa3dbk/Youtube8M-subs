00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 I hope you are quite well 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.020
 and in today's video I bring you a game 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.730
 that the fashion that comes 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.699
 being the south park district of truth 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.520
 truth is not everything and looking for 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.950
 it looks entertaining people like blondes like 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.320
 vegueta all that kind of people who are 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.660
 right now that's up gameplays are 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.629
 trying and I took it from there and then the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.570
 I really love you do not have good 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.880
 aspect and I have brought them from me 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.220
 for you 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.320
 the game consists of 22 parts are 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.830
 rises to half fire all weigh 200 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.360
 megas except the last weighs 40 is a 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.910
 little tedious to be downloading them 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.190
 guys but believe me 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.840
 that are worth downloading here in 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.239
 description will be the requirements 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.850
 minimum so that you can run 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.260
 the game although many times not 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.260
 certain because for example my 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.600
 computer does not run 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.020
 they do not have the minimum requirements but 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.230
 still it runs perfect now once 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.910
 that have the 22 files are going to 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.910
 select all and they will give you 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.750
 they select all they give him right click 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.030
 extract here is going to extract these two 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.890
 what they see as a rar file and the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.360
 executable that we're going to use the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.920
 executable is very important that not 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.690
 erase this one but new work 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.690
 we open the executable 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.180
 and thanks to the mastiff that 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.180
 They were the ones who gave us the game 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.490
 to be able to download it there previously 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.650
 it was what the location has been 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.700
 of the game and now what's coming starts 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.200
 being the installation for this you 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.690
 they see that it 's a little patient because 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.900
 it may take sometimes takes sometimes not 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.960
 but I'm going to put the video and when 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.710
 finish it resumed 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.710
 we came back 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.920
 good once you are about to 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.140
 finish they will appear this 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.880
 window that is being for 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.680
 identify what has been the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.739
 second part 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.920
 it's like who says the CD-2 is where 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.360
 we have the rar file that I told them that 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.460
 do not 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.320
 that you should not erase for this you 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.020
 they will find where they have 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.230
 decompressed the 22 parts in this case 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.890
 I have it here 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.890
 and here we're just going to put files and s 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.550
 we give to open 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.880
 and we give him ok 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.210
 was going to end bar bar rather it's going to 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.620
 finish installing already 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.959
 the last thing that the game lacks 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.599
 once you get there you will have finished 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.980
 this is going to show us a message 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.260
 I do not know if you are going to open the page 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.700
 it's not time a very good page 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.370
 where you can find enough 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.370
 games and here we see don 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.049
 indicates that it's over 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.069
 because key and not open it again 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.200
 is the page and now once 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.080
 let's have this we have access here 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.330
 direct I can not record it with qantas anymore 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.400
 so I'm going to use fraps and I'm going to 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.269
 leave what I'm doing so they see 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.590
 that if the game works on my part it 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.420
