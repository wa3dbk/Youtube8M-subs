out<00:00:27.410> for<00:00:27.439> a<00:00:27.590> spin<00:00:27.829> zero<00:00:28.669> to<00:00:28.790> 60<00:00:29.149> to<00:00:29.329> get<00:00:29.419> an

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
out for a spin zero to 60 to get an

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:36.250 
out for a spin zero to 60 to get an
average<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.169> let's<00:00:30.739> get<00:00:30.890> started<00:00:31.220> oh<00:00:35.260> that

even though it's kind of chilly outside

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.270 
even though it's kind of chilly outside
so<00:01:19.610> let's<00:01:19.790> reset<00:01:20.150> our<00:01:20.330> solo<00:01:20.720> DL<00:01:21.140> or<00:01:21.350> DL<00:01:21.920> solo

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
so let's reset our solo DL or DL solo

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.580 
so let's reset our solo DL or DL solo

performance timer which is GPS based and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.950 
performance timer which is GPS based and
we'll<00:01:25.220> get<00:01:25.370> an<00:01:25.520> accurate<00:01:25.909> reading<00:01:26.120> all<00:01:26.750> right

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
we'll get an accurate reading all right

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.340 
we'll get an accurate reading all right

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
6,000 rpm 4548 5055 there we go

you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.189> I've<00:01:41.280> seen<00:01:41.430> some<00:01:41.490> things<00:01:41.790> online

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you know I've seen some things online

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
you know I've seen some things online
they<00:01:42.479> say<00:01:42.950> 6.5<00:01:43.950> seconds<00:01:45.470> horrible<00:01:46.470> nine<00:01:46.770> point

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
they say 6.5 seconds horrible nine point

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.630 
they say 6.5 seconds horrible nine point
zero<00:01:47.310> five<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.869> first<00:01:49.140> run<00:01:49.430> I'm<00:01:50.430> gonna<00:01:50.580> do

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
zero five on my first run I'm gonna do

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.070 
zero five on my first run I'm gonna do
that<00:01:50.759> again<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> manual<00:01:52.049> transmission

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
that again with the manual transmission

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.480 
that again with the manual transmission
and<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.460> think<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> traction<00:01:54.420> control<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.020> set

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
and I think the traction control is set

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
and I think the traction control is set
default<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.940> be<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.470> do<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
default to be on I'm going to do that

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.600 
default to be on I'm going to do that
again<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.070> what<00:01:59.190> happens<00:02:01.250> all<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.310> one

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
again and see what happens all right one

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.070 
again and see what happens all right one
number<00:02:02.940> two<00:02:03.149> three<00:02:03.690> two<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:03.990> go

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.690 

almost<00:02:11.710> 6,500<00:02:12.340> rpm

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
almost 6,500 rpm

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.790 
almost 6,500 rpm
there<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:14.540> go<00:02:16.330> better<00:02:18.730> 8.5<00:02:19.730> seconds<00:02:20.620> 8.54<00:02:21.620> run

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
there we go better 8.5 seconds 8.54 run

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.070 
there we go better 8.5 seconds 8.54 run
number<00:02:22.040> two<00:02:22.239> just<00:02:23.239> getting<00:02:23.450> warmed<00:02:23.690> up<00:02:23.810> I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
number two just getting warmed up I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.010 
number two just getting warmed up I
think<00:02:24.590> we'll<00:02:24.890> try<00:02:25.300> without<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.569> traction

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
think we'll try without the traction

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.820 
think we'll try without the traction
control<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.590> run<00:02:28.280> number<00:02:28.520> three<00:02:29.500> okay<00:02:30.500> this

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
control on run number three okay this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.440 
control on run number three okay this
would<00:02:31.040> be<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> lot<00:02:31.310> more<00:02:31.489> fun<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.060> traction

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
would be a lot more fun the traction

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.290

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
better what do you think I mean you've

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.350 
better what do you think I mean you've
watched<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.650> number<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:05.950> these<00:04:06.070> am<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:07.180> getting

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
watched a number of these am I getting

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.690 
watched a number of these am I getting
better<00:04:07.540> I<00:04:07.870> was<00:04:08.470> able<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.650> shift<00:04:09.010> while<00:04:09.400> still

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
better I was able to shift while still

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.060 
better I was able to shift while still
spinning<00:04:10.330> in<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:11.050> second<00:04:11.320> gear<00:04:11.560> that's<00:04:11.920> kind

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
spinning in the second gear that's kind

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.480 
spinning in the second gear that's kind
of<00:04:12.100> cool

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
of cool

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.979 
of cool
all<00:04:13.390> right<00:04:13.570> last<00:04:13.960> run<00:04:14.640> 0-60<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:16.299> I<00:04:16.570> think<00:04:16.810> I'll

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
all right last run 0-60 and I think I'll

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.000 
all right last run 0-60 and I think I'll
take<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.680> trash<00:04:18.010> control<00:04:18.900> off<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.500> mean<00:04:20.890> I'll

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
take the trash control off I mean I'll

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.890 
take the trash control off I mean I'll
engage<00:04:21.580> it<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:22.030> now<00:04:22.240> we<00:04:22.270> have<00:04:22.630> traction

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
engage it so now we have traction

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.200 
engage it so now we have traction
control<00:04:23.020> on<00:04:23.410> so<00:04:24.340> we<00:04:24.460> shouldn't<00:04:24.730> get<00:04:24.850> as<00:04:25.000> much

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
control on so we shouldn't get as much

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.900 
control on so we shouldn't get as much
wheel<00:04:25.480> spin<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:26.220> maybe<00:04:27.220> that'll<00:04:27.520> help<00:04:27.550> out

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
wheel spin and maybe that'll help out

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.790 
wheel spin and maybe that'll help out
with<00:04:28.030> our<00:04:28.150> times<00:04:28.420> our<00:04:28.780> best<00:04:29.170> time<00:04:29.320> so<00:04:29.350> far<00:04:29.530> has

with our times our best time so far has

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.410 
with our times our best time so far has
been<00:04:29.920> eight<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.220> half<00:04:30.340> seconds<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.030> we

been eight and a half seconds and we

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.480 
been eight and a half seconds and we

have the traction control engaged at
that<00:04:33.760> time<00:04:34.050> let's<00:04:35.050> see<00:04:35.230> if<00:04:35.320> these

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
that time let's see if these

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.530 
that time let's see if these
high-performance<00:04:35.890> tires<00:04:36.400> will<00:04:36.790> do<00:04:36.970> their<00:04:37.150> job

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
high-performance tires will do their job

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.630 
high-performance tires will do their job
and<00:04:37.870> get<00:04:38.590> us<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.800> time<00:04:39.070> better<00:04:39.310> than<00:04:39.430> eight<00:04:39.610> and

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
and get us a time better than eight and

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.260 
and get us a time better than eight and
a<00:04:39.760> half<00:04:39.880> seconds<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:42.250> roads<00:04:42.460> are<00:04:42.610> cold<00:04:42.850> but

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
a half seconds the roads are cold but

a half seconds the roads are cold but
they're<00:04:43.420> not<00:04:43.570> wet<00:04:43.870> all<00:04:44.560> right<00:04:45.180> three<00:04:46.180> two<00:04:46.810> one
