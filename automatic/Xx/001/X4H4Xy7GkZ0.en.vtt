00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
sick of this so I decided to grab every

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.109 
sick of this so I decided to grab every
single<00:00:17.970> clamp<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.570> had<00:00:19.460> bitch<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.699> ain't<00:00:20.880> going

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
single clamp I had bitch you ain't going

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:36.430 
single clamp I had bitch you ain't going
nowhere<00:00:21.150> now

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.320 

I'm<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> take<00:00:38.540> washers<00:00:39.540> them<00:00:41.030> on<00:00:42.030> top<00:00:42.270> of

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
I'm going to take washers them on top of

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:54.990 
I'm going to take washers them on top of
one<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.780> bottom

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.569 

it's<00:00:56.000> kind<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.449> fairly<00:00:56.809> flat<00:01:00.460> washer<00:01:01.460> in

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
it's kind of fairly flat washer in

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.469 
it's kind of fairly flat washer in
between<00:01:02.949> it's<00:01:03.949> normally<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.489> good<00:01:04.699> idea<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.330> try

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
between it's normally a good idea to try

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.990 
between it's normally a good idea to try
to<00:01:05.509> get<00:01:05.690> your<00:01:05.840> engine<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.320> fit<00:01:06.860> as<00:01:07.040> flat<00:01:07.520> as<00:01:07.549> it

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
to get your engine to fit as flat as it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.230 
to get your engine to fit as flat as it
possibly<00:01:08.479> can<00:01:09.460> because<00:01:10.460> when<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.799> stick<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
possibly can because when you stick the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.350 
possibly can because when you stick the
engine<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:16.869> something<00:01:18.759> it's<00:01:19.759> not<00:01:19.940> completely

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
engine on something it's not completely

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.450 
engine on something it's not completely
flat<00:01:21.759> then<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:22.880> take<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.119> risk<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:24.399> when<00:01:25.399> you

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
flat then you take the risk of when you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.550 
flat then you take the risk of when you
go<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.640> tighten<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.330> down<00:01:26.470> cracking<00:01:27.470> your

the engine itself I've seen that done
before

know if you can see this on the camera

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.969 
know if you can see this on the camera
now<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.299> keyway<00:02:02.720> starts<00:02:03.229> up<00:02:03.409> here<00:02:03.710> comes

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
now but the keyway starts up here comes

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.020 
now but the keyway starts up here comes
down<00:02:04.189> here<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:04.640> ends<00:02:05.090> right<00:02:05.240> there<00:02:07.030> like

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
down here and it ends right there like

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.449 
down here and it ends right there like
an<00:02:08.149> inch<00:02:08.450> past<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.259> pillow<00:02:09.830> block<00:02:10.069> bearing

an inch past the pillow block bearing

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.660 
an inch past the pillow block bearing
this<00:02:11.360> over<00:02:11.780> here<00:02:13.720> extends<00:02:14.720> all<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.870> way<00:02:15.670> to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
this over here extends all the way to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.670 
this over here extends all the way to
about<00:02:16.910> four<00:02:17.390> inches<00:02:17.780> past<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:19.610> if<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.819> put<00:02:20.680> both

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
about four inches past but if I put both

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.309 
about four inches past but if I put both
brake<00:02:22.519> discs<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:26.890> sprocket<00:02:27.890> on<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:29.319> don't

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
brake discs and sprocket on here I don't

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:38.640 
brake discs and sprocket on here I don't
think<00:02:30.380> I'm<00:02:31.190> going<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.519> enough<00:02:31.760> room

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.360 

really<00:02:39.650> cutting<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.069> close

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.300 

and<00:02:43.849> both<00:02:44.060> sprocket<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:47.269> if<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.510> do<00:02:47.569> that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
and both sprocket in and if I do that

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.660 
and both sprocket in and if I do that
well<00:02:49.510> I'll<00:02:50.510> have<00:02:50.569> about<00:02:50.959> an<00:02:51.110> inch<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.799> usable

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
well I'll have about an inch of usable

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.339 
well I'll have about an inch of usable
keyway<00:02:55.299> that's<00:02:56.299> getting<00:02:56.629> that<00:02:56.720> really<00:02:57.170> damn

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
keyway that's getting that really damn

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.180 
keyway that's getting that really damn
close<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.950> sprockets<00:02:58.640> line<00:03:02.620> all<00:03:03.620> right<00:03:03.950> I

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
close to the sprockets line all right I

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.110 
close to the sprockets line all right I
could<00:03:04.940> do<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:06.220> if<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.549> say<00:03:07.670> screw<00:03:07.730> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
could do that if you just say screw it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.750 
could do that if you just say screw it
and<00:03:08.209> put<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.900> brake<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.920> outside<00:03:10.340> here

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
and put the brake on the outside here

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.819 
and put the brake on the outside here
because<00:03:11.540> if<00:03:11.690> i<00:03:11.810> were<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.049> take<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.349> axle<00:03:12.739> out

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
because if i were to take the axle out

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.920 
because if i were to take the axle out
and<00:03:13.040> turn<00:03:13.159> it<00:03:13.280> around<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.549> other<00:03:13.610> way<00:03:13.930> right

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
and turn it around the other way right

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.099 
and turn it around the other way right
having<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.260> longer<00:03:15.739> key<00:03:16.459> way<00:03:16.609> over<00:03:16.849> here<00:03:17.239> then<00:03:18.079> i

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
having a longer key way over here then i

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.009 
having a longer key way over here then i
would<00:03:18.379> have<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:20.090> little<00:03:20.420> bit<00:03:20.599> of<00:03:20.690> key<00:03:20.870> way

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
would have this a little bit of key way

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.920 
would have this a little bit of key way
over<00:03:21.290> here<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.340> that's<00:03:23.060> not<00:03:23.239> even<00:03:23.390> enough<00:03:23.750> and

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
over here and that's not even enough and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.539 
over here and that's not even enough and

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
that's where i'm at right now I've got

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.630 
that's where i'm at right now I've got
the<00:04:32.040> pillow<00:04:32.220> block<00:04:32.430> bearings<00:04:32.790> on<00:04:33.080> temporarily

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
thinking what I might do what you should

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.420 
thinking what I might do what you should
yet<00:04:41.150> but<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.210> might<00:04:42.650> put<00:04:43.650> some<00:04:43.770> extensions<00:04:44.310> on

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.510 
yet but I might put some extensions on
right<00:04:44.640> here<00:04:44.910> coming<00:04:45.210> out<00:04:45.540> at<00:04:45.930> an<00:04:46.110> angle<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.710> lot

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
right here coming out at an angle a lot

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.820 
right here coming out at an angle a lot
like<00:04:47.640> what<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:47.850> did<00:04:47.940> on<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.450> reverse<00:04:48.900> trike<00:04:49.200> or

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
like what I did on the reverse trike or

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.870 
like what I did on the reverse trike or
a<00:04:49.890> quad<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:51.330> come<00:04:51.540> out<00:04:51.570> here<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.620> way<00:04:52.880> I've

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
a quad it come out here so that way I've

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.060 
a quad it come out here so that way I've
got<00:04:54.150> like<00:04:54.390> a<00:04:54.420> bumper<00:04:54.960> protecting<00:04:55.650> this<00:04:55.830> back

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
got like a bumper protecting this back

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.980 
got like a bumper protecting this back
area<00:04:56.340> just<00:04:56.790> in<00:04:56.940> case<00:04:57.090> anything<00:04:57.360> runs<00:04:57.690> into<00:04:57.900> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
area just in case anything runs into the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.710 
area just in case anything runs into the
back<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.170> it<00:04:59.180> probably<00:05:00.180> would<00:05:00.330> be<00:05:00.480> a<00:05:00.510> pretty

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
back of it probably would be a pretty

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.940 
back of it probably would be a pretty
good<00:05:00.810> idea<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.500> do<00:05:02.010> something<00:05:02.040> like<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.670> so

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
good idea to do something like that so

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.480 
good idea to do something like that so
okay<00:05:04.950> well<00:05:05.720> looks<00:05:06.720> like<00:05:06.810> that's<00:05:07.710> as<00:05:08.280> far<00:05:08.430> as

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490
