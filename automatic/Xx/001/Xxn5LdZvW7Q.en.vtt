00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.000
 before the game begins the cheer already 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.000
 it was very lively 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.599
 on the one hand the fanatics for Flemish and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.610
 on the other by trade tell the players 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.460
 were very confident 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.699
 amon has been playing for seven years and since the year 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.500
 past is also part of the selection 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.029
 the expectation for the tournament 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 national is big 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.650
 he is training well he is well focused 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 has a strong team and managed to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.710
 bring players who played with the law 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.860
 of 2009 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.170
 we have a good base only 11 athletes 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.940
 of the Brazilian team thinks it's okay 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.469
 focused and the goal is it is undoubtedly is 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.020
 on national 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.559
 the house team the Greeks say train 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 Since 2008 this is their first game 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.320
 in Brazil this year and of course they 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.820
 also expect better disputes 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 We want to improve our 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.109
 participation in the past but we 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.719
 knows a third of 18 teams 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.519
 this year we want to get inside the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.920
 be the last wave in the last 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.549
 sigh of ours and we will give it all 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.470
 said 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.570
 the next grammy contest say 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.549
 mato grosso do sul will be on the 28th 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.310
 June in Sao Paulo against Corinthians 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.080
 the team that by the way was the champion of the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.100
 Brazilian in 2012 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.770
 We know it's going to be a match. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.890
 quite difficult is how you said it is 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.630
 a Brazilian champion then we will go 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.040
 continue to prepare as much as possible 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 possible to play hard and play hard 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.700
 against them there in sao paulo 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.280
 American football is not the sport 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.610
 Traditional in Brazil but okay 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.439
 organized who is in the field believes 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.670
 in the even greater growth of the modality 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.400
 to the sport a lot 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.560
 before the very dynamic sport then is 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.710
 thus seeking to bring the countries memso 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.580
 a wonderful sport different sport 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.399
 I think k 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.140
 Brazil is responding well look at the 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.320
 public who attended the stadium 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.810
 moreno american football has everything 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.000
 to gain more space 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.360
 even because in football matches 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.380
 traditional many times the bleachers 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.620
 do not be like this 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.690
 full of supporters their support will 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.790
 always be very good and very strong 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.620
 sure is going to give a whole new year 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.750
 for us the competition brought together a 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.239
 well-diversified public 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.370
 for example came with the family of 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.769
 SidrolÃ¢ndia for large field 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.090
 here was a first one that is 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.060
 playing in Flemish 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.370
 Many people do not even understand the game. 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.040
 to fully understand 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.140
 He even tried to explain that he did not 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.630
 It's difficult , I'm sorry. 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.640
 cool, understand something 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.430
 first two days of football type 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.780
 keeping my game trying, right? 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.950
 few who know how to achieve 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.370
 to better understand nih 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.140
 I came to see her cousin friend and so the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.880
 People do not understand much, but we see 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.470
 campaign the team comes to know a 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.600
 little more this sport that does not do 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.100
 part of our culture that the state is the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.100
 people are learning little things
