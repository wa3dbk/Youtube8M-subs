00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.410
 will teach you how to m os x 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.860
 laayoune so not mac washington mayenne 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.480
 on an external hard drive or even a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.679
 USB key 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.080
 so what you need is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.100
 a usb stick and then laguiole our 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 corners personally i'm going to put it 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 on paper already launched in a few 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.160
 moments 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.160
 I'll show you how it's going 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.079
 you have to know that if you are sure 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.140
 like me on the mountain bayonne and that 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.420
 wanted to install the lioness finally do 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.219
 the hand carried out the method that I'm going 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.379
 to do that is impossible because he's going 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.890
 you put a message like what you 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.239
 can not keep hop he tells you 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.239
 this version of mac os is too recent 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.460
 so that's why I'm going to use 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.460
 a virtual machine 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.299
 so what's needed is everything 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.130
 first that your usb stick is connected 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.130
 and if possible that she be a virgin 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 so mac os x the hyena I read here 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.880
 so that's the file you'll have 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.880
 when you download on the apple store 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.369
 so there you have little blah blah blah 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.000
 you do continue then there you 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.649
 have the regulations if you have the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.740
 time you can read it 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.579
 you are doing hockey 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 so here you do all post a 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.340
 disk and you are not selected your 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.799
 disk to wed am here and if that 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.360
 would not go you have to change it finally 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.049
 they may tell you what 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.039
 there is a problem 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:14.010
 so in this case this taste had to make 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.010
 it is good to see that he is a guide 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.250
 here is party table we leave if 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.790
 that's not the case you 're doing a 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.040
 partition and after you put chalkboard 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.730
 of sheet music guide is so the key has to 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.290
 absolutely deals in chords and are 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.970
 so sent mac os format being the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.280
 journalist so if in this case any 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.940
 is going well like me what you can 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.599
 do so is go back in the module 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.160
 installation and click on your 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.060
 client then you click on 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.720
 install you put your code 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.440
 I have not we are here so let you 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.519
 the installation will then launch 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.910
 the installation may vary depending on 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.280
 of your external device so no 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.640
 for example if it's a usb key 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.600
 it's a ntech you and how that 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.940
 takes in 34 minutes 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 so you know usb keys that's at 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.920
 flash memory 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.620
 so it's like it's going 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.430
 quickly that hard drives so that 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.840
 you do this will be a normal hard drive 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.049
 it may take more time 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.650
 so here's once this is over 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.870
 you start your mac 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.720
 by pressing alt so his little 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.579
 key that is left of commands that 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.859
 is left of the spaces and then you 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:51.880
 select the the second partition and 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.440
 so you can throw in his bones 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.060
 x laguiole 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.380
 while having another partition then 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.460
 which is practical with these so if 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.230
 you go on our computer 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.380
 finally if for example I had a 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.680
 500 gigas diffuser and you move 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.810
 I go to a friend's house or whatever and everything 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.000
 is on your external hard drive you 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.730
 connect to your friend and you can 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.019
 so recovers having all your 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.680
 information as if you were at home 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.760
 you and so here is so dare to question 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.840
 forever but ask it 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.840
 will answer quickly
