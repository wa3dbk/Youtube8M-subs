 Hello everyone, Svetlana, I recently 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.519
 here 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.240
 bought the seeds of the chefs 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.889
 bag 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.160
 today I will plant them today on June 4 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.160
 there is nothing written about her 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.990
 I land as usual 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.600
 plus perlite 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.469
 slightly moistened the gate on spread 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.469
 these seeds 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 I dig them a little bit because they 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.680
 should be sprinkled 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.329
 these are large seeds and they will be powdered 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.100
 top and 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:03.570
 Moisturize I sign 4 for 6 sheflera 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.080
 closed the greenhouse bright place and so 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.909

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.799
