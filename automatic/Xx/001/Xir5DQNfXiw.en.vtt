this talent what's it been like a switch

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.570 
this talent what's it been like a switch
from<00:01:03.960> your<00:01:04.080> high<00:01:04.229> school<00:01:04.530> team<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
from your high school team going to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.130 
from your high school team going to

playing on these kind of all-star teams
I<00:01:07.290> guess<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:08.159> definitely<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> level<00:01:08.880> up

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
I guess it's definitely a level up

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.020 
I guess it's definitely a level up
because<00:01:09.690> my<00:01:09.899> high<00:01:10.049> school<00:01:10.320> team<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:11.220> don't

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
