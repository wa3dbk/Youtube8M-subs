such<00:00:10.639> gluten<00:00:11.639> intolerance<00:00:12.240> today<00:00:12.509> or<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.780> many

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
such gluten intolerance today or so many

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.230 
such gluten intolerance today or so many
people<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.440> just<00:00:14.070> can't<00:00:14.340> tolerate<00:00:14.969> gluten

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
people are just can't tolerate gluten

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.010 
people are just can't tolerate gluten
and<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:16.980> only<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.490> grains<00:00:17.820> it's<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.810> many

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and it's not only in grains it's in many

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.230 
and it's not only in grains it's in many
other<00:00:19.230> things<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.699> talk<00:00:20.910> about<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
other things and can you talk about that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.870 
other things and can you talk about that
a<00:00:21.449> little<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.170> expound<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.519> from<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
a little and then expound on it from the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.790 
a little and then expound on it from the
meat<00:00:24.090> standpoint<00:00:24.660> because<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.380> 1<00:00:25.590> beta

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
meat standpoint because it's a 1 beta

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
meat standpoint because it's a 1 beta
casein<00:00:26.130> which<00:00:26.550> almost<00:00:27.090> reacts<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.689> gluten

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
casein which almost reacts like gluten

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.830 
casein which almost reacts like gluten
or<00:00:28.470> even<00:00:28.680> worse<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:30.090> talk<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
or even worse so first talk about the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.870 
or even worse so first talk about the
the<00:00:31.260> gluten<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> comment<00:00:32.219> radition<00:00:32.669> aliy

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the gluten the comment radition aliy

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.250 
the gluten the comment radition aliy
what<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.390> gluten<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.110> maybe

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
what we know is gluten and then maybe

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
what we know is gluten and then maybe
you<00:00:34.410> could<00:00:34.530> talk<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> a1<00:00:35.340> a2<00:00:35.520> beta

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
you could talk about the a1 a2 beta

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.530 
you could talk about the a1 a2 beta
casein<00:00:36.180> yeah<00:00:37.050> yeah<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> mean<00:00:38.030> you<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.059> it's

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
casein yeah yeah I mean you know it's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.840 
casein yeah yeah I mean you know it's
most<00:00:39.840> people<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.559> now<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:41.460> because

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
most people know of it now just because

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
most people know of it now just because
it's<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.360> has<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.809> many<00:00:42.960> symptoms<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it's you know has so many symptoms and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.160 
it's you know has so many symptoms and
effects<00:00:44.340> even<00:00:44.700> inability<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> lose<00:00:45.899> weight

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
effects even inability to lose weight

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
effects even inability to lose weight
right<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.829> feeling<00:00:47.280> well<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> three<00:00:48.480> hours

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
right not feeling well and three hours

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
right not feeling well and three hours
after<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.020> eat<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.140> don't<00:00:49.440> feel<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:49.920> well

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
after you eat you don't feel well well

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
after you eat you don't feel well well
what<00:00:51.000> happens<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.660> many<00:00:51.840> Americans<00:00:52.379> have

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
what happens is so many Americans have

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.470 
what happens is so many Americans have
what<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.770> call<00:00:52.949> leaky<00:00:53.340> gut<00:00:53.610> where<00:00:54.090> their<00:00:54.239> gut

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
what we call leaky gut where their gut

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.420 
what we call leaky gut where their gut
is<00:00:54.690> literally<00:00:55.079> allowing<00:00:55.620> undigested

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
is literally allowing undigested

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.209 
is literally allowing undigested
proteins<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.270> cross<00:00:57.570> over<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> gut<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.469> what

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
proteins to cross over the gut and what

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.319 
proteins to cross over the gut and what
happens<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.670> body<00:00:59.850> starts<00:01:00.210> making

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
happens is your body starts making

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.020 
happens is your body starts making
antibodies<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> drives<00:01:02.030> inflammation

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
antibodies to it it drives inflammation

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.020 
antibodies to it it drives inflammation
if<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> cell<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
if the cell right so you know it's a it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.760 
if the cell right so you know it's a it
acts<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.540> toxin<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.350> own<00:01:07.380> body

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
acts like a toxin right your own body

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
acts like a toxin right your own body
starts<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> create<00:01:08.909> inflammation<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
starts to create inflammation because of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.710 
starts to create inflammation because of
it<00:01:10.260> well<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.369> guess<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.820> need<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> back<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it well I guess we need to back up and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
it well I guess we need to back up and
say<00:01:13.110> well<00:01:13.710> why<00:01:13.920> does<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.310> many<00:01:14.460> people<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
say well why does so many people have a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.020 
say well why does so many people have a
leaky<00:01:15.030> gut<00:01:15.540> well<00:01:16.259> again<00:01:16.710> standard<00:01:17.580> American

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
leaky gut well again standard American

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.880 
leaky gut well again standard American
diet<00:01:18.299> chemicals<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.380> mean<00:01:19.530> all<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> things

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
diet chemicals I mean all the things

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.469 
diet chemicals I mean all the things
we've<00:01:20.250> been<00:01:20.280> talking<00:01:20.400> about<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.119> driving

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
we've been talking about that's driving

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.780 
we've been talking about that's driving
inflammation<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.259> gut<00:01:22.619> cells<00:01:23.009> there's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
inflammation of the gut cells there's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
inflammation of the gut cells there's
something<00:01:24.150> called<00:01:24.270> tight<00:01:24.570> junctions<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
something called tight junctions that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.460 
something called tight junctions that
really<00:01:26.159> make<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.850> GI<00:01:27.090> wall<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.869> these

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
really make up your GI wall in these

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
really make up your GI wall in these
tight<00:01:28.740> junctions<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:29.520> proteins<00:01:30.150> gluten

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
tight junctions these proteins gluten

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
tight junctions these proteins gluten
proteins<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.380> down<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:31.979> they

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
proteins can get down in there they

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460 
proteins can get down in there they
inflame<00:01:32.759> them<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.900> leak<00:01:34.170> across

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
inflame them and then they leak across

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.469 
inflame them and then they leak across
even<00:01:34.890> more<00:01:35.130> allowing<00:01:35.490> other<00:01:35.670> proteins<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
even more allowing other proteins that

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.020 
even more allowing other proteins that
come<00:01:36.630> across<00:01:36.829> body's<00:01:37.829> making<00:01:38.070> antibodies<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
come across body's making antibodies to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.109 
come across body's making antibodies to
it<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.420> making<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.200> feel<00:01:40.530> well<00:01:40.740> ok<00:01:41.369> so

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it and making you not feel well ok so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
it and making you not feel well ok so
when<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.360> get<00:01:42.479> rid<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.780> gluten<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> start

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
when we get rid of gluten we can start

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.350 
when we get rid of gluten we can start
to<00:01:44.130> diminish<00:01:44.460> some<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> inflammation

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to diminish some of that inflammation

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.859 
to diminish some of that inflammation
and<00:01:45.899> tighten<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.380> these<00:01:46.590> tight<00:01:46.829> junctions

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
and tighten up these tight junctions

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.020 
and tighten up these tight junctions
gluten<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.380> most<00:01:49.590> grains<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
gluten is in most grains and like you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.670 
gluten is in most grains and like you
mentioned<00:01:51.540> many<00:01:51.869> products<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.649> have

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
mentioned many products that we have

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.520 
mentioned many products that we have
contain<00:01:53.369> gluten<00:01:54.049> even<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.320> through

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
contain gluten even for just through

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.350

chemical and pesticide it was supposedly

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.580

so<00:03:07.269> farmers<00:03:07.630> didn't<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.079> use<00:03:08.230> as<00:03:08.380> much

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
so farmers didn't have to use as much

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.940 
so farmers didn't have to use as much
pesticide<00:03:08.970> because<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.090> produces<00:03:10.540> its<00:03:10.720> own

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950

healthy GI system that crosses into that

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.150 
healthy GI system that crosses into that
and<00:03:48.850> it's<00:03:48.970> making<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:50.079> chemical<00:03:50.950> factory

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
and it's making you a chemical factory

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.330 
and it's making you a chemical factory
it's<00:03:51.910> making<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:52.569> a<00:03:52.810> pesticide<00:03:53.350> producer<00:03:54.100> and

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
it's making you a pesticide producer and

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.220 
it's making you a pesticide producer and
you<00:03:54.760> wonder<00:03:55.060> why<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.269> can't<00:03:55.630> fix<00:03:55.840> your<00:03:56.019> gut

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
you wonder why you can't fix your gut

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.199 
you wonder why you can't fix your gut
because<00:03:56.859> eating<00:03:57.370> genetically<00:03:57.639> modified

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
because eating genetically modified

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.420 
because eating genetically modified
grains<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.780> cross<00:03:59.049> contaminating<00:03:59.829> into<00:04:00.160> your

grains is cross contaminating into your
DNA<00:04:00.700> ok<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.139> there's<00:04:02.470> multiple<00:04:02.769> problems<00:04:03.400> with

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
over just like gluten does so grains are

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.390 
over just like gluten does so grains are

all<00:04:48.800> right

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
all right

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.030 
all right
you<00:04:49.520> had<00:04:49.670> mentioned<00:04:49.880> beta<00:04:50.300> a1<00:04:50.690> protein<00:04:51.260> okay

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
you had mentioned beta a1 protein okay

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.000 
you had mentioned beta a1 protein okay
well<00:04:52.310> there<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.180> something<00:04:53.450> that<00:04:53.780> is<00:04:53.900> 23<00:04:54.710> times

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
well there is something that is 23 times

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.730 
well there is something that is 23 times
more<00:04:55.190> toxic<00:04:55.970> than<00:04:56.210> gluten<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.810> it<00:04:57.410> is<00:04:57.560> in<00:04:57.710> fact

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
more toxic than gluten and it is in fact

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.030 
more toxic than gluten and it is in fact
beta<00:04:58.340> a1<00:04:58.790> protein<00:04:59.390> where<00:04:59.630> do<00:04:59.720> we<00:04:59.840> find<00:05:00.140> it<00:05:00.410> we

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
beta a1 protein where do we find it we

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.430 
beta a1 protein where do we find it we
find<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:02.140> 99.9%<00:05:03.140> of<00:05:03.950> all<00:05:04.640> dairy<00:05:05.210> on<00:05:05.630> the

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
find that in a 99.9% of all dairy on the

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.830 
find that in a 99.9% of all dairy on the
market<00:05:06.920> it<00:05:07.070> is<00:05:07.220> we've<00:05:07.760> heard<00:05:07.970> of<00:05:08.090> casein<00:05:08.630> right

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
market it is we've heard of casein right

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.750 
market it is we've heard of casein right
why<00:05:09.020> Kate<00:05:09.380> no<00:05:09.620> we<00:05:10.070> aren't<00:05:10.250> gluten<00:05:10.700> in

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
why Kate no we aren't gluten in

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.040 
why Kate no we aren't gluten in
casein-free<00:05:11.180> diets

well<00:05:12.680> this<00:05:12.890> is<00:05:13.040> why<00:05:13.280> casein-free<00:05:14.030> diets

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
well this is why casein-free diets

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.020 
well this is why casein-free diets

literally<00:06:03.730> genetically<00:06:04.730> bred<00:06:04.970> back<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.660> cow

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
literally genetically bred back the cow

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.100 
literally genetically bred back the cow
because<00:06:06.260> this<00:06:06.500> beta<00:06:06.830> a1<00:06:07.310> protein<00:06:07.910> is<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:08.660> trans

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
because this beta a1 protein is a trans

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.200 
because this beta a1 protein is a trans
mutated<00:06:09.680> gene<00:06:09.950> it<00:06:10.130> wasn't<00:06:10.460> meant<00:06:10.640> to<00:06:10.730> be<00:06:10.850> that

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
mutated gene it wasn't meant to be that

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.690 
mutated gene it wasn't meant to be that
way<00:06:11.419> and<00:06:12.020> it's<00:06:12.200> very<00:06:12.260> toxic<00:06:12.740> so<00:06:13.550> they

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
way and it's very toxic so they

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.690 
way and it's very toxic so they
genetically<00:06:14.210> bred<00:06:14.780> back<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.500> cow<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:16.310> contain

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
genetically bred back the cow to contain

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.870 
genetically bred back the cow to contain
a<00:06:16.940> beta<00:06:17.300> a2<00:06:17.630> protein<00:06:18.410> which<00:06:18.950> does<00:06:19.250> not<00:06:19.490> have

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
a beta a2 protein which does not have

a beta a2 protein which does not have
that<00:06:20.090> effect<00:06:20.380> because<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:21.530> believe<00:06:21.890> that<00:06:22.160> in

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
that effect because I believe that in

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.770 
that effect because I believe that in
these<00:06:22.730> dairy<00:06:23.060> products<00:06:23.450> there<00:06:23.570> are<00:06:23.630> some

the<00:06:40.610> American<00:06:41.030> diet<00:06:41.240> but<00:06:41.600> the<00:06:41.720> problem<00:06:42.140> is<00:06:42.320> is

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
the American diet but the problem is is

the American diet but the problem is is
when<00:06:42.830> people<00:06:43.040> are<00:06:43.280> eating<00:06:43.610> dairy<00:06:43.880> standard
