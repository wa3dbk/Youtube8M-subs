00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.400 
seven years which is bare minerals
foundation<00:00:34.000> in<00:00:34.330> warm<00:00:34.629> dark<00:00:34.930> that's<00:00:35.170> the

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
foundation in warm dark that's the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.650 
foundation in warm dark that's the
foundation<00:00:35.860> I'd<00:00:35.980> traditionally<00:00:36.550> use<00:00:36.730> however

foundation I'd traditionally use however

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.009 
foundation I'd traditionally use however
I<00:00:38.290> was<00:00:38.830> tagged<00:00:39.160> several<00:00:39.760> times<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.180> do<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.449> $20

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
I was tagged several times to do the $20

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.860 
I was tagged several times to do the $20
and<00:00:41.140> under<00:00:41.620> tag<00:00:42.839> for<00:00:44.220> you<00:00:45.220> know<00:00:45.370> full<00:00:46.089> face<00:00:46.329> $20

that<00:00:49.690> foundation<00:00:49.840> cost<00:00:50.500> I<00:00:50.710> think<00:00:50.739> like<00:00:51.010> 20

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
that foundation cost I think like 20

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.470 
that foundation cost I think like 20
something<00:00:51.489> dollars<00:00:51.640> was<00:00:52.090> like<00:00:52.180> well<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.329> need

something dollars was like well I need

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.840 
something dollars was like well I need
to<00:00:52.690> try<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:53.320> drugstore<00:00:54.129> foundation<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:54.760> I'm

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
to try a drugstore foundation and I'm

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.369 
to try a drugstore foundation and I'm
always<00:00:55.149> skeptical<00:00:55.690> of<00:00:55.870> drugstore

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
always skeptical of drugstore

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.650 
always skeptical of drugstore
foundations<00:00:56.890> because<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.579> have<00:00:57.789> really<00:00:58.420> really

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
foundations because I have really really

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.660 
foundations because I have really really
sensitive<00:00:58.840> skin<00:00:59.079> particularly<00:01:00.039> I'm<00:01:00.190> not<00:01:00.460> just

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
sensitive skin particularly I'm not just

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.279 
sensitive skin particularly I'm not just
drugstore<00:01:01.090> rather<00:01:01.300> because<00:01:01.719> I<00:01:01.840> also<00:01:02.020> have

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
drugstore rather because I also have

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.079 
drugstore rather because I also have
this<00:01:02.379> issue<00:01:02.530> with<00:01:02.770> Mac<00:01:03.039> foundations<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:03.969> be

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
this issue with Mac foundations to be

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.660 
this issue with Mac foundations to be
honest<00:01:04.420> but<00:01:05.020> I<00:01:05.080> have<00:01:05.320> an<00:01:05.440> issue<00:01:05.530> with<00:01:05.770> for

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
honest but I have an issue with for

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.730 
honest but I have an issue with for
whatever<00:01:06.789> reason<00:01:07.240> with<00:01:07.390> liquid<00:01:08.200> foundations

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
whatever reason with liquid foundations

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.950 
whatever reason with liquid foundations
I<00:01:08.860> find<00:01:09.130> in<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.970> past<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.420> found<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.869> they

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
I find in the past I found that they

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.490 
I find in the past I found that they
just<00:01:11.140> didn't<00:01:11.560> worked<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:13.390> they<00:01:13.539> irritated

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
just didn't worked that they irritated

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.529 
just didn't worked that they irritated
my<00:01:14.649> skin<00:01:14.679> and<00:01:15.190> I<00:01:15.280> have<00:01:15.310> I'm<00:01:15.729> prone<00:01:16.509> to

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
my skin and I have I'm prone to

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:17.340 
my skin and I have I'm prone to
breakouts

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
breakouts

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.380 
breakouts
so<00:01:17.679> that's<00:01:18.160> why<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.369> was<00:01:18.490> reluctant<00:01:18.580> but<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.150> was

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
so that's why I was reluctant but I was

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.999 
so that's why I was reluctant but I was
like<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.630> know<00:01:19.720> what<00:01:19.869> let<00:01:20.320> me<00:01:20.350> expand<00:01:20.830> because

although I love bare minerals foundation

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.460

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
home and it just would not look anywhere

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.410

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
actually a little bit too dark for me I

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.790 
actually a little bit too dark for me I
could<00:02:41.420> wear<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:41.989> was<00:02:42.110> fine

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
could wear and it was fine

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.110 
could wear and it was fine
but<00:02:43.069> it<00:02:43.160> really<00:02:43.310> gave<00:02:43.550> me<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.849> kind<00:02:44.000> of

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
but it really gave me the kind of

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.240 
but it really gave me the kind of
coverage<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.690> felt<00:02:44.959> like<00:02:45.080> looked<00:02:45.620> heavier

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
coverage that I felt like looked heavier

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.850 
coverage that I felt like looked heavier
because<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:48.050> color<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.440> was<00:02:48.590> and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
because of the the the color it was and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.120 
because of the the the color it was and
it<00:02:48.920> just<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.400> really<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:50.209> took<00:02:50.959> away<00:02:51.440> all<00:02:51.739> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
it just it really just took away all the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.890 
it just it really just took away all the
light<00:02:52.430> areas<00:02:52.880> in<00:02:53.060> my<00:02:53.150> face<00:02:53.360> like<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.630> under

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
eye whatever weird like the Sun actually

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.630 
eye whatever weird like the Sun actually
hits<00:02:56.299> your<00:02:56.660> face<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.590> took<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> away<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.459> was

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
hits your face it took it away so I was

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.670 
hits your face it took it away so I was
spending<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.150> lot<00:02:59.180> more<00:02:59.360> time<00:02:59.590> bringing<00:03:00.590> it

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
spending a lot more time bringing it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.130 
spending a lot more time bringing it
back<00:03:00.830> with<00:03:01.190> using<00:03:01.610> other<00:03:02.269> concealers<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:02.959> so

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
back with using other concealers and so

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.780 
back with using other concealers and so
forth<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:03.620> because<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.069> that<00:03:04.160> reason<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.579> said

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
forth so because of that reason I said

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.699 
forth so because of that reason I said

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
but I used a bunch of CVS coupon so I

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.520 
but I used a bunch of CVS coupon so I
paid<00:06:41.410> like<00:06:41.560> four<00:06:41.830> bucks<00:06:42.010> for<00:06:42.430> it<00:06:42.460> and<00:06:43.350> so<00:06:44.350> the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
paid like four bucks for it and so the

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.290 
paid like four bucks for it and so the
color<00:06:44.740> like<00:06:44.920> I<00:06:45.010> said<00:06:45.220> that<00:06:45.340> I<00:06:45.400> use<00:06:45.670> is<00:06:45.910> mahogany

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
color like I said that I use is mahogany

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.000 
color like I said that I use is mahogany
that's<00:06:46.720> the<00:06:46.870> right<00:06:47.050> color<00:06:47.230> for<00:06:47.530> me<00:06:47.650> although<00:06:47.860> I

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
that's the right color for me although I

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.040 
that's the right color for me although I
could<00:06:48.370> also<00:06:48.580> use<00:06:49.030> mocha<00:06:49.330> which<00:06:49.600> is<00:06:49.720> a<00:06:49.750> little

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
could also use mocha which is a little

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.630 
could also use mocha which is a little
bit<00:06:50.140> darker<00:06:50.500> and<00:06:50.560> a<00:06:50.620> little<00:06:50.860> bit<00:06:50.980> more<00:06:51.160> red<00:06:51.430> so

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640 
bit darker and a little bit more red so

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.360 
bit darker and a little bit more red so
I<00:06:51.730> didn't<00:06:51.970> love<00:06:52.210> it<00:06:52.270> on<00:06:52.570> me<00:06:52.780> and<00:06:53.080> to<00:06:53.830> compare<00:06:54.250> it

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
I didn't love it on me and to compare it

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.910 
I didn't love it on me and to compare it
to<00:06:54.460> let's<00:06:54.670> say<00:06:54.820> a<00:06:54.850> Mac<00:06:55.150> Studio<00:06:55.510> fluid<00:06:56.440> bob

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
to let's say a Mac Studio fluid bob

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.010 
to let's say a Mac Studio fluid bob
bottle<00:06:57.610> which<00:06:57.790> is<00:06:57.820> I<00:06:58.060> think<00:06:58.300> this<00:06:58.420> is<00:06:58.540> like<00:06:58.690> 30

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
bottle which is I think this is like 30

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.420 
bottle which is I think this is like 30
bucks<00:06:59.260> I'm<00:06:59.470> not<00:06:59.650> sure<00:06:59.860> but<00:07:00.010> it's<00:07:00.130> in<00:07:00.280> that

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
bucks I'm not sure but it's in that

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.210 
bucks I'm not sure but it's in that
price<00:07:00.700> range<00:07:00.850> high<00:07:01.150> 20s<00:07:01.600> to<00:07:01.780> $30.00<00:07:02.440> and<00:07:02.650> this

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
price range high 20s to $30.00 and this

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.430 
price range high 20s to $30.00 and this
again<00:07:03.520> it's<00:07:03.730> the<00:07:03.850> same<00:07:03.880> exact<00:07:04.420> although<00:07:05.320> it

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
again it's the same exact although it

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.760 
again it's the same exact although it
looks<00:07:05.590> like<00:07:05.740> this<00:07:05.890> is<00:07:06.010> more<00:07:06.250> they're<00:07:06.700> both<00:07:06.970> um

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
looks like this is more they're both um

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.770 
looks like this is more they're both um
they're<00:07:08.770> both<00:07:08.800> one<00:07:09.340> ounce<00:07:09.460> of<00:07:09.910> product<00:07:10.540> so

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
they're both one ounce of product so

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.110 
they're both one ounce of product so
just<00:07:11.470> consider<00:07:11.620> that<00:07:12.010> in<00:07:12.190> terms<00:07:12.490> of<00:07:12.640> and<00:07:12.820> I<00:07:12.850> and

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
just consider that in terms of and I and

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.300 
just consider that in terms of and I and
I<00:07:13.180> and<00:07:13.540> this<00:07:13.690> I<00:07:13.930> actually<00:07:14.230> got<00:07:14.770> this<00:07:14.980> and<00:07:15.190> I
