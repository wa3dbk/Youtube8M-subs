00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.299
 short video I show you how you your 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.529
 samsung galaxy s 4 even faster 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.210
 can as it already is 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.679
 i am christ minister minister helper so wore 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.910
 and if you like this video then 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.160
 please give us a thumbs up 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 So much fun, we now come to trick 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.119
 number one if you are usually in 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.199
 an app or menu since and the home 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.820
 button presses and returns to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.920
 starting point is to get him 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.279
 here a small delay I firmly 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.670
 Show me that or I'll go to one 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.830
 app and now I'm responding now 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.540
 the hands this delay is because 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 that it thinks a lot that she might 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.649
 to turn on sv with a double click 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.000
 Now if you say so, try me 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.460
 and all the other creatures on this 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.680
 planets and also the developers of it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.120
 going on with trapped then used 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 her it was not because 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 the program is not the best on this 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.000
 So, world is what you can do 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.030
 opened it with a double click presses 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.840
 on menu already clear 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.120
 press menu settings now goes 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.159
 you can also open it via home button and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.960
 make the hook away if now again 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.270
 back responds the phone immediately 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 i do that we go into it flaws 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.360
 are in a good mood and the reaction is 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.619
 as soon as I go in the menu or in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.590
 any other we take as 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.060
 little boy village back and look if 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.710
 I arrived at the home screen 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.970
 therefore number one presses trick number 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.070
 two is even better 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.110
 whenever you have an app or menu 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.420
 opens a small animation with 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.100
 opened and displayed with this 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.590
 of course slows down the whole process 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.180
 By the way , we were also menu then 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.750
 the menu will be very slow from the bottom 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.860
 Pulled up or smo then 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.399
 The whole thing will be with an animation 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.170
 open now some do not mind 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.460
 some think when I leave that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.140
 makes the mobile faster 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.750
 then i do that too though this one 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.009
 it's practically practical to settings 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.259
 then go down to options 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.390
 developer option if you like the whole 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.549
 did not show it up 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.579
 click somewhere down here 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.110
 go and just hang up so long 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.369
 build number by a so far the says 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.400
 that the developer options now 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.860
 I'll show you this 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.390
 with me now is necessary because the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.090
 developer options are already displayed 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 but at all at all others should 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.689
 then the developer options here 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.799
 will be displayed here then looks back 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.370
 on developer options which we adjust the times 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.439
 up here 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.859
 yes down below completely down to me 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.780
 windows animation size you like her 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.209
 I'll click on it and put it 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.950
 whole on animation is off 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.440
 I'm doing the same thing all over 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.480
 animation size and also with 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.599
 animators duration scale so if I am now 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.790
 For example , I go back immediately 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.299
 here on the home screen 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 button then the menu is immediately 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.540
 since it immediately picked up when i got the planner 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.730
 opened immediately reacted 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.470
 So he's way faster than he is 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.930
 before and all because I was 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.829
 the animations have turned off that 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.959
 was in 2002 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.180
 Now we come to the last and best 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.900
 trick in this video namely bluetooth 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.790
 activate 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.169
 as pluto are any 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.040
 Pre-installed apps you do not 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.690
 can install 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.310
 why she's so hot because she's yours 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.799
 system in most cases in 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.349
 background but make slow if you 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.730
 do any of these processes 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.449
 Cats, as I said not 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.310
 uninstall 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.049
 but you can disable it like that 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.329
 I'll show you now looking for this 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.340
 she wants a bluetooth I want now 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.569
 Just have a look at this trip advisor here 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.209
 can not uninstall 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.709
 but I can turn it the 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.030
 then activate in the menu as well 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.609
 with names shown I go 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:53.069
 easy on settings options 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.849
 Application manager then I go all the way 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.389
 whoever is looking to the right for everyone 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:06.409
 in my case topmanager moment 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:06.409
 very down there again 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.049
 tripadvisor and you will notice 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.859
 okay i can do the updates though 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.590
 the install 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.570
 but the app itself is not what I am now 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.989
 I'll do the hook 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.769
 show notifications away and 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.769
 then press on deactivate 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.360
 according to me 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.419
 now the whole will be the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.060
 Updates the installed and the 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.770
 app is disabled 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.060
 If I go back to my menu now 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.530
 I will not find it anymore 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.099
 and somehow it's funny 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.780
 no more 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.220
 a huge advantage of this reactivation 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.110
 is that these apps are no longer in the 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.000
 background can run and so on 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.389
 Battery life does not adversely affect 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.740
 can 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.270
 neither does your system 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.560
 can slow down now 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.889
 warning notice, of course, still 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.080
 never never disable apps 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.690
 with an android male as a symbol 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.360
 why that is so because this system epss 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.199
 are and these help as a system 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.300
 reasonable to get started 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.949
 if he can disable this but the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.990
 it's a bit of a system 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.460
 strange reacts but that is not 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.169
 problem you can then immediately 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.909
 on the same path as once too 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.250
 disabled also reactivate again 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.530
 so if this video could help you 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.630
 then displays this video give us a 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.099
 thumb up supports this channel and 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.750
 subscribe to this channel for more such 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.750
