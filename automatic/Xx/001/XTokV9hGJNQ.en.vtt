00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and a different way where your makeup

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.359 
and a different way where your makeup
you<00:01:38.700> don't<00:01:38.850> always<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
you don't always have to do like this

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
you don't always have to do like this
but<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.850> fun<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.270> throw<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.810> like

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
but I think it's fun just throw in like

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
but I think it's fun just throw in like
maybe<00:01:43.229> once<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.560> twice<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.829> week<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.939> basically

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
maybe once or twice a week so basically

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.569 
maybe once or twice a week so basically
I<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:46.110> did<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> regular<00:01:46.740> face<00:01:47.040> everything's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579

normal<00:01:47.880> except<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> eyes<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.110> kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.409> focused

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
normal except the eyes I kind of focused

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.100

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
on making it dramatic eyeliner but the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.270 
on making it dramatic eyeliner but the
thing<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:52.710> working<00:01:53.070> with

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
thing is when you're working with

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.510 
thing is when you're working with
dramatic<00:01:53.759> eyeliner

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
dramatic eyeliner

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.399 
dramatic eyeliner
and<00:01:54.579> especially<00:01:55.509> when<00:01:55.810> you're<00:01:55.930> wearing<00:01:56.079> it<00:01:56.229> to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
and especially when you're wearing it to

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.899 
and especially when you're wearing it to
school<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.770> don't<00:01:56.799> want<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.280> color<00:01:57.579> to<00:01:57.820> be

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
school you don't want the color to be

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.179 
school you don't want the color to be
too<00:01:58.090> harsh<00:01:58.329> so<00:01:58.929> color<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.590> key<00:01:59.920> I

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
too harsh so color is the key I

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.249 
too harsh so color is the key I
basically<00:02:01.179> use<00:02:01.570> like<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.810> dark<00:02:02.140> brown

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
basically use like a dark brown

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.620 
basically use like a dark brown
eyeshadow<00:02:02.640> instead<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.759> using<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:04.119> black<00:02:04.390> like

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
eyeshadow instead of using a black like

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.959 
eyeshadow instead of using a black like
I<00:02:04.719> would<00:02:04.869> normally<00:02:05.259> use<00:02:05.289> an<00:02:06.280> inner<00:02:06.520> place<00:02:06.789> of

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
I would normally use an inner place of

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.880 
I would normally use an inner place of
that<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.210> can<00:02:07.360> use<00:02:07.600> like<00:02:07.899> any<00:02:08.200> color<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:08.800> if

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890

too<00:02:12.670> harsh<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.000> which<00:02:13.209> case<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.569> can<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.870> use

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
too harsh in which case you can just use

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.070 
too harsh in which case you can just use

reason<00:04:58.840> I<00:04:58.900> put<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.200> tape<00:04:59.410> there<00:04:59.590> so<00:04:59.770> that<00:04:59.800> we

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
reason I put the tape there so that we

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.010 
reason I put the tape there so that we
would<00:05:00.130> get<00:05:00.280> this<00:05:00.460> fine<00:05:00.790> kind<00:05:01.150> of<00:05:01.240> cat<00:05:01.540> I<00:05:01.570> point

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
would get this fine kind of cat I point

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.629 
would get this fine kind of cat I point
it's<00:05:02.320> kind<00:05:02.530> of<00:05:02.560> difficult<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:03.220> do<00:05:03.460> that

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
it's kind of difficult to do that

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.570 
it's kind of difficult to do that
precisely<00:05:04.030> with<00:05:04.419> eyeshadow<00:05:04.900> so<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:06.190> is<00:05:06.340> kind

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
precisely with eyeshadow so this is kind

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.610 
precisely with eyeshadow so this is kind
of<00:05:06.669> a<00:05:06.820> more<00:05:07.210> edgy<00:05:07.600> way<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:07.930> rock<00:05:08.200> eyeliner

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
of a more edgy way to rock eyeliner

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.770 
of a more edgy way to rock eyeliner
because<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:09.310> still<00:05:09.669> sort<00:05:09.970> of<00:05:10.030> subtle<00:05:10.389> enough

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
because it's still sort of subtle enough

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.750 
because it's still sort of subtle enough
because<00:05:11.169> you're<00:05:11.320> using<00:05:11.500> eyeshadow<00:05:11.830> but<00:05:12.639> it

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
because you're using eyeshadow but it

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.430 
because you're using eyeshadow but it
still<00:05:12.970> is<00:05:13.180> as<00:05:13.419> dramatic<00:05:13.930> as<00:05:14.080> if<00:05:14.200> you<00:05:14.320> were

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
still is as dramatic as if you were

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.440 
still is as dramatic as if you were
using<00:05:14.650> eyeliner<00:05:15.070> so<00:05:15.820> this<00:05:16.030> is<00:05:16.150> one<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.330> my

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
using eyeliner so this is one of my

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.210 
using eyeliner so this is one of my
favorite<00:05:16.900> ways<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.050> wear<00:05:17.380> eyeshadow<00:05:17.590> for

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
favorite ways to wear eyeshadow for

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.270 
favorite ways to wear eyeshadow for

using a matte color on the brow bone and
then<00:05:23.110> for<00:05:23.289> my<00:05:23.380> inner<00:05:23.590> corner<00:05:24.010> I'm<00:05:24.160> going<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.370> be

going in with a yellowy champagne e
color<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:27.010> that<00:05:27.789> usually<00:05:28.090> looks<00:05:28.479> better<00:05:28.690> on

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
color and that usually looks better on

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.659 
color and that usually looks better on
darker<00:05:29.229> skin<00:05:29.260> so<00:05:29.710> then<00:05:29.860> for<00:05:30.070> anyone<00:05:30.430> who<00:05:30.520> has

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
feel like this is really necessary

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.119 
feel like this is really necessary
because<00:05:57.020> you<00:05:57.289> don't<00:05:57.439> really<00:05:57.469> have<00:05:57.710> that<00:05:57.740> much

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
because you don't really have that much

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.480 
because you don't really have that much
like<00:05:58.340> black<00:05:58.729> definition<00:05:59.539> in<00:05:59.990> your<00:06:00.050> eyes

like black definition in your eyes

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.189 
like black definition in your eyes
because<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.669> blender<00:06:02.240> is<00:06:02.360> just<00:06:02.569> brown<00:06:02.780> smokey

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
because the blender is just brown smokey

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.110 
because the blender is just brown smokey
so<00:06:03.680> by<00:06:04.129> taking<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.490> eyeliner<00:06:04.759> you're<00:06:04.939> just

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
so by taking the eyeliner you're just

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.399 
so by taking the eyeliner you're just
giving<00:06:05.330> your<00:06:05.539> laugh<00:06:05.689> is<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:05.900> little<00:06:06.169> bit<00:06:06.289> more
