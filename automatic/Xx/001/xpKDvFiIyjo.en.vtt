00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
you're going to hit it a lot more energy

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.440 
you're going to hit it a lot more energy
well<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.469> guess<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.730> i'll<00:00:15.000> show<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.299> how<00:00:15.389> to

do<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.630> there<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.350> lot<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> things<00:00:17.490> I

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
do it there a lot of the things I

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.179 
do it there a lot of the things I
learned<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.210> martial<00:00:19.050> arts<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.800> simply

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
adaptable to go because in essence is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.099 
adaptable to go because in essence is
actually<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.430> gone<00:00:23.660> balance<00:00:24.680> power<00:00:25.970> breathing

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
actually is gone balance power breathing

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.259 
actually is gone balance power breathing
flexibility<00:00:28.109> energy<00:00:28.949> control<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.849> these

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
flexibility energy control all these

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
flexibility energy control all these
different<00:00:30.510> things<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.740> golf<00:00:31.949> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
before the only difference is one you

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
before the only difference is one you
hit<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> golf<00:00:36.719> ball<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:37.800> hit<00:00:37.950> bag<00:00:38.129> do

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
people all right but the energy source

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
people all right but the energy source
to<00:00:40.410> balance<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> all<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> flexibly<00:00:41.850> drills

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
to balance the all the flexibly drills

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.090 
to balance the all the flexibly drills
all<00:00:42.390> things<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.840> went<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.890> apply

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
all things that we went to it can apply

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.819 
all things that we went to it can apply
to<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.180> doesn't<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:46.140> simple<00:00:46.530> it's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to go and it doesn't it's simple it's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
to go and it doesn't it's simple it's
our<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> same<00:00:47.700> thing<00:00:47.809> let<00:00:48.809> me

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
our because it's the same thing let me

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.020 
our because it's the same thing let me
show<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.110> how<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> trap<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> wall<00:00:50.030> trapping

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
show you how to trap the wall trapping

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.500 
show you how to trap the wall trapping
the<00:00:51.149> ball<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:52.350> seems<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> me<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.510> trapping

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the ball it seems to me that trapping

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.279 
the ball it seems to me that trapping
the<00:00:54.719> ball<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:56.329> may<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.390> difficult<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.230> lot

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the ball is may be difficult for a lot

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
the ball is may be difficult for a lot
of<00:00:58.410> people<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.460> that<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> reason<00:01:00.180> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
of people and I think that the reason is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.060 
of people and I think that the reason is
because<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.079> flipped<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.440> hands<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:01.980> let

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
because you flipped your hands but let

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
because you flipped your hands but let
me<00:01:02.100> show<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.309> how<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> stop<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.409> i'm<00:01:04.409> going

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
me show you how to stop that i'm going

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.990 
me show you how to stop that i'm going
to<00:01:04.559> use<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> technique<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to use a technique that we do and you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
to use a technique that we do and you
can<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.299> alongside<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.140> don't<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
break I have to generate extra mount of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.499 
break I have to generate extra mount of
power<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.460> actually<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> trap<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
power and I actually have to trap the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.780 
power and I actually have to trap the
brick<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.979> had<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> break<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.700> away

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
brick so if I had a break and I put away

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
out here and i went to hit it I would

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
out here and i went to hit it I would
never<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:26.009> able<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.280> break<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> need

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
never be able to break it so what I need

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
never be able to break it so what I need
to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.810> bring<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> great<00:01:28.380> closer<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.040> me

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
to do is bring the great closer to me

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
to do is bring the great closer to me
and<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.909> my<00:01:30.090> body<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.630> over<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> break

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and you get my body more over the break

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.950 
and you get my body more over the break
and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.860> calm<00:01:32.430> down<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> palm<00:01:33.689> down

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and then calm down so that palm down

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.569 
and then calm down so that palm down
motion<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.009> trapping<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
motion you can see it is trapping the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.580 
motion you can see it is trapping the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
brick energy thought and I'm going to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.850 
brick energy thought and I'm going to
trap<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.160> ball<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:09.060> trapping<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> ball<00:02:10.080> not

law big much by palms and come up and
then<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.130> going<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.370> trap<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.760> ball<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.150> right

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
then is going to trap the ball so right
