wouldn't<00:02:34.800> be<00:02:34.980> able<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.220> break<00:02:35.400> through<00:02:35.580> but

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
wouldn't be able to break through but

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.520 
wouldn't be able to break through but
they<00:02:36.000> bring<00:02:36.930> through<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.170> right<00:02:37.320> hand

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
they bring through the right hand

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.920 
they bring through the right hand
sliding<00:02:37.940> flank<00:02:38.940> some<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.239> my<00:02:39.330> teammates<00:02:39.510> which

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
sliding flank some of my teammates which

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.250 
sliding flank some of my teammates which
meant<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.320> ended<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:40.680> getting<00:02:40.890> pushback

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
meant we ended up getting pushback

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.890 
meant we ended up getting pushback
second<00:02:43.260> round<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> bad<00:02:43.650> stuff<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:45.360> with<00:02:45.750> that

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
second round the bad stuff and with that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.170 
second round the bad stuff and with that
i'm<00:02:46.080> going<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.230> show<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.709> spawn<00:02:47.180> spawns

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
i'm going to show you the spawn spawns

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.699 
i'm going to show you the spawn spawns
of<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.360> places<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.780> want<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.989> be<00:02:49.110> for<00:02:49.350> offense

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
of the places you want to be for offense

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.470 
of the places you want to be for offense
but<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.580> really<00:02:50.790> don't<00:02:50.940> need<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.209> think<00:02:51.360> about

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
but you really don't need to think about

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.300 
but you really don't need to think about
it<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:52.320> you're<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.739> top<00:02:52.890> again<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.220> is

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it if you're in the top again that is

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.680 
it if you're in the top again that is
just<00:02:53.580> for<00:02:53.700> everyone<00:02:53.970> else<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.450> spawn

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
just for everyone else but the spawn

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.000 
just for everyone else but the spawn
points<00:02:55.049> are<00:02:55.200> really<00:02:55.500> important<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.950> think

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
points are really important to think

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.729 
points are really important to think
about<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> push<00:02:57.360> too<00:02:57.390> hard<00:02:57.739> it

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
about because if you push too hard it

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.740 
about because if you push too hard it
take<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> titan<00:03:00.030> take<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> minute<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.510> look<00:03:00.600> at

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
take a titan take a minute to look at

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.150 
take a titan take a minute to look at
that<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.140> go<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.410> any<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.799> those<00:03:01.890> spots

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
that if you go to any of those spots

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
that if you go to any of those spots
you'll<00:03:02.400> protect<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:02.880> entire<00:03:03.150> team<00:03:03.330> eight<00:03:03.540> so

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
you'll protect your entire team eight so

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.740 
you'll protect your entire team eight so
you're<00:03:03.810> completely<00:03:04.110> set<00:03:04.320> up<00:03:04.350> but<00:03:05.190> um<00:03:05.540> if<00:03:06.540> you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
you're completely set up but um if you

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.060 
you're completely set up but um if you
look<00:03:06.900> by<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.140> loading<00:03:07.380> bay<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.920> map

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
look by the loading bay on the map

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.280 
look by the loading bay on the map
that's<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.120> most<00:03:09.239> dangerous<00:03:09.720> place<00:03:10.019> that

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
that's the most dangerous place that

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.960 
that's the most dangerous place that
they<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.620> spawn<00:03:10.890> there<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.400> they<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.730> spawn

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
they can spawn there and they can spawn

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.160 
they can spawn there and they can spawn
all<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.330> way<00:03:12.420> into<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.750> middle<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.019> map

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
all the way into the middle of the map

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.800 
all the way into the middle of the map
if<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.560> push<00:03:13.769> too<00:03:13.799> far<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.400> hand<00:03:14.640> side<00:03:14.850> but<00:03:15.720> it

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
if you push too far one hand side but it

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.560 
if you push too far one hand side but it
shouldn't<00:03:16.080> happen<00:03:16.230> if<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.620> cell<00:03:16.769> by<00:03:16.980> this

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
shouldn't happen if your cell by this

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.040 
shouldn't happen if your cell by this
switching<00:03:18.570> sides<00:03:18.780> um

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
switching sides um

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.010 
switching sides um
nearly<00:03:22.050> ready<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.410> rock<00:03:23.300> this<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.660> actually

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
nearly ready to rock this I actually

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.300 
nearly ready to rock this I actually
didn't<00:03:25.470> speed<00:03:25.680> up<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.860> chopper<00:03:26.040> gunner

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
didn't speed up the chopper gunner

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.820 
didn't speed up the chopper gunner
because<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.810> pretty<00:03:28.140> useful<00:03:28.319> and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
because this is pretty useful and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.520 
because this is pretty useful and
showing<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.000> spawns<00:03:30.270> like<00:03:30.810> exactly<00:03:31.350> how<00:03:31.500> I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
showing the spawns like exactly how I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.949 
showing the spawns like exactly how I
said<00:03:31.800> it<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.270> can<00:03:33.480> see<00:03:33.630> when<00:03:33.840> my

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
said it and you can see when my

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.260 
said it and you can see when my
teammates<00:03:34.290> push<00:03:34.440> too<00:03:34.709> far<00:03:34.740> both<00:03:35.190> sides<00:03:35.490> you

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
teammates push too far both sides you

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.870 
teammates push too far both sides you
see<00:03:36.300> what<00:03:36.600> else<00:03:36.810> what<00:03:36.989> as<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.140> result<00:03:40.730> ACL<00:03:41.730> red

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
see what else what as a result ACL red

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.190 
see what else what as a result ACL red
dot<00:03:42.000> sight<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.300> perfect<00:03:42.750> for<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:42.959> kind<00:03:43.140> of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
dot sight is perfect for this kind of

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.380 
dot sight is perfect for this kind of
thing<00:03:43.290> because<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.739> can<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.239> people<00:03:45.239> call

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
thing because you can just people call

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.910 
thing because you can just people call
it<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.600> laser<00:03:45.810> gun<00:03:45.959> because<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.530> can<00:03:46.680> kind<00:03:46.890> of

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
it a laser gun because you can kind of

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.559 
it a laser gun because you can kind of
just<00:03:46.980> point<00:03:47.400> hold<00:03:47.910> down<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.120> trigger<00:03:48.450> and

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
just point hold down the trigger and

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.900 
just point hold down the trigger and
something<00:03:48.840> I'll<00:03:48.900> be<00:03:49.020> dead<00:03:49.200> whereas<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.910> other

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
something I'll be dead whereas you other

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.070 
something I'll be dead whereas you other
guns<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.270> have<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:52.340> put<00:03:53.340> more<00:03:53.519> time<00:03:53.760> into

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
guns you have to put more time into

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.990 
guns you have to put more time into
realign<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.200> your<00:03:55.320> shot<00:03:55.500> off<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.860> recoil

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.590 

and<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:02.170> right<00:04:02.470> now<00:04:03.090> they're<00:04:04.090> off<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.330> sports

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
and so right now they're off the sports

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.690 
and so right now they're off the sports
so<00:04:04.750> they've<00:04:05.170> pushed<00:04:05.500> able<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.190> pretend<00:04:06.430> about

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
so they've pushed able to pretend about

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.280 
so they've pushed able to pretend about
the<00:04:06.850> very<00:04:07.030> hard<00:04:07.210> at<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.480> supporting<00:04:07.840> outside

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
the very hard at the supporting outside

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.440 
the very hard at the supporting outside
just<00:04:09.250> outside<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.730> hanger<00:04:10.030> which<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.270> one<00:04:10.390> of

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
just outside the hanger which is one of

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.110 
just outside the hanger which is one of
the<00:04:10.540> score<00:04:10.750> points<00:04:10.930> are<00:04:11.110> labeled

my chopper gunners at a bar position

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.979 
my chopper gunners at a bar position
right<00:04:18.890> now<00:04:18.920> okay<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:19.910> now<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:20.360> morning<00:04:20.720> just
