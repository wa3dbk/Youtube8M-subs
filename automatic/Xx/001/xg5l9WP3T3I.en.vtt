00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.570
 How to assemble a chocolate fountain 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.320
 Then let's have a picture of the chocolate barn pain formed 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.919
 I will explain how to assemble using 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.489
 Even if the size changes, how to assemble and the structure are basically 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:14.619
 Is the same 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.779
 At first I take out the base band from the case 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.589
 At this time, check if the constant farewell literature is firm 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.089
 please 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.289
 If the safety device works and power does not turn on if it is various 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.470
 there is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.919
 Then take out the cylinder 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.329
 Ase cut and cylinder Totti are selling association 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.660
 It was crowded 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.970
 Then insert the crossing 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.840
 At this time, put on the Creutz stabilizer 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.770
 I will 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.900
 I slowly poured into the cylinder 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.210
 That's surprising 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.210
 We will combine video text 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.470
 The clan is defeated finally after inserting in a large plate in order 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 If it is completed 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.920
 The pre-heater has turned the baker's race warm 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.590
 I poured in chocolate and was charged 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.130
 Beautiful chocolate fountain is 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.470
 It flows 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.470
 Next is the explanation of the investigation but it is very easy 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.820
 Installation of pre-heater and motor for the first time 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.030
 Suzuka Hearing to the right is troubled with the results 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.920
 Temperature control is difficult, but this time, referring to the manual 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.220
 Please 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.060
 Chocolate circulates well in the form used for the first time 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 I have a question that I do not 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.940
 There is something I would like to confirm at that time 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.850
 Is the equipment properly placed in a large place 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.410
 Are you betting enough on chocolate 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.220
 Did you add too much oil? 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.290
 It will not be well nokia too 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.490
 In rare cases where air is trapped in the cylinder 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.890
 Because there is, I stop the song once and it's in the cylinder 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.870
 Bet the chocolate and run the motor again 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.890
 Please 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.690
 When a cylinder or brook sounds in winter etc. 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.670
 Once warmed up and used inside 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.009
 We prevent chocolate from hardening 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.939
 Finally, pay attention to health and safety so that there are no accidents 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.149
 Enjoy the Chocolate Fountain
