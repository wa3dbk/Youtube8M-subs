00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
different ways to display what your log

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.119 
different ways to display what your log
has<00:01:04.140> been<00:01:04.170> collecting<00:01:04.650> while<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:04.920> been<00:01:04.979> up

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
has been collecting while it's been up

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
has been collecting while it's been up
in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> field<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:06.540> also<00:01:06.780> go<00:01:06.900> through<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
in the field will also go through the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.310 
in the field will also go through the
hardware<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> CL<00:01:08.880> 1000<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> CR<00:01:09.869> 800

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
hardware of the CL 1000 or the CR 800
because<00:01:10.770> they're<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.100> similar<00:01:11.750> we'll<00:01:12.750> go

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
because they're very similar we'll go

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.359 
because they're very similar we'll go
through<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.140> channels<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.040> through

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
through the channels will go through

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.700 
through the channels will go through
what<00:01:15.240> sensors<00:01:15.659> connected<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.290> channels

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
what sensors connected which channels

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
what sensors connected which channels
will<00:01:17.369> go<00:01:17.520> through<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:18.390> much<00:01:18.509> memory<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
will go through how much memory the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.640 
will go through how much memory the
logger<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.350> things<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.750> now<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.110> we

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
logger has things like that now it's we

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.929 
logger has things like that now it's we
call<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> programming<00:01:23.400> course<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.759> there's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
call it a programming course so there's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.219 
call it a programming course so there's
definitely<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.390> programming<00:01:24.810> involved

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
definitely some programming involved

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.100 
definitely some programming involved

to wire them up we'll show you how to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.749 
to wire them up we'll show you how to
program<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.649> them<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:44.490> show<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.670> how<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
program for them will show you how to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.789 
program for them will show you how to
collect<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> data<00:01:45.299> later<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:46.680> those

we<00:01:56.730> cover<00:01:56.940> things<00:01:57.150> like<00:01:57.240> STI<00:01:57.750> 12<00:01:58.080> sensors<00:01:58.590> so

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
we cover things like STI 12 sensors so

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.250 
we cover things like STI 12 sensors so
if<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.400> STI<00:01:59.670> 12<00:01:59.970> sensors<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.990> need

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
if you have some STI 12 sensors and need

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.740 
if you have some STI 12 sensors and need
to<00:02:01.350> program<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.920> them<00:02:02.010> we'll<00:02:02.280> cover<00:02:02.430> those

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
to program for them we'll cover those

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.970 
to program for them we'll cover those
wiring<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.900> multiplexers<00:02:04.620> to<00:02:04.830> measure

multiple<00:02:05.370> sensors<00:02:05.760> will<00:02:05.940> go<00:02:06.060> through<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> as

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
multiple sensors will go through that as

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.290 
multiple sensors will go through that as
well<00:02:07.070> we<00:02:08.070> go<00:02:08.190> through<00:02:08.369> schedule<00:02:08.759> collections

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
well we go through schedule collections

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.020 
well we go through schedule collections
setting<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:10.050> schedule<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.530> login<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.880> go

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
setting up a schedule and login it we go

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.990 
setting up a schedule and login it we go

all your loggers together in the network
using<00:02:16.770> radios<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.730> there'll<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.000> lots<00:02:18.180> of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
using radios and there'll be lots of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.590 
using radios and there'll be lots of
time<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.200> one-on-ones<00:02:20.120> lots<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.240> time<00:02:21.420> during

day 2 and day 3 that if you have a
particular<00:02:23.580> application<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.600> mind<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.350> just

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
particular application in mind I just

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.900 
particular application in mind I just
tapped<00:02:25.920> me<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.190> shoulder<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.820> go

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
tapped me on the shoulder we can go

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.699 
tapped me on the shoulder we can go
through<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.210> whole<00:02:27.300> application<00:02:27.709> what's

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
through the whole application what's

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.170 
through the whole application what's
involved<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.130> programming<00:02:29.640> what's<00:02:29.940> involved

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
involved in programming what's involved

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.880 
involved in programming what's involved
in<00:02:30.330> wiring<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.840> everything<00:02:31.140> else<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.680> loads

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
in wiring and everything else so loads

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.199 
in wiring and everything else so loads
of<00:02:32.040> time<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:32.340> you've<00:02:32.459> got<00:02:32.610> something<00:02:32.820> in<00:02:33.030> mind

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
of time if you've got something in mind

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.540 
of time if you've got something in mind
that<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.480> want<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.690> talk<00:02:33.810> about<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.370> that's<00:02:35.490> a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
that you want to talk about so that's a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.180 
that you want to talk about so that's a
