00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
upside down because when I mounted it on

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.700 
upside down because when I mounted it on
the<00:01:59.580> top<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.240> was<00:02:00.720> seeing<00:02:00.870> way<00:02:01.050> too<00:02:01.110> much<00:02:01.380> of

the top I was seeing way too much of
this<00:02:01.890> upper<00:02:02.159> fairing<00:02:02.550> and<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.729> didn't<00:02:03.030> like

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
this upper fairing and I didn't like

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.680 
this upper fairing and I didn't like
that<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.690> I<00:02:03.900> wanted<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.890> mount<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.310> lower<00:02:05.690> so

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
that so I wanted to mount it lower so

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.779 
that so I wanted to mount it lower so
that<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.840> could<00:02:07.080> see<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> wheel<00:02:07.710> moving<00:02:08.340> or
