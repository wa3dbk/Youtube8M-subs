what's going on a VR Malik sending this
video<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> little<00:00:08.760> comparison<00:00:09.179> between<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
video a little comparison between the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.499 
video a little comparison between the
fingerprint<00:00:10.559> sensor<00:00:10.980> on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.250> meizu<00:00:11.759> mx4<00:00:12.269> pro

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
fingerprint sensor on the meizu mx4 pro

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.589 
fingerprint sensor on the meizu mx4 pro
and<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.830> fingerprint<00:00:14.460> sensor<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> iphone

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
and the fingerprint sensor on the iphone

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.429 
and the fingerprint sensor on the iphone
6<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> first<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.910> all<00:00:21.000> I'm<00:00:21.119> gonna<00:00:21.270> set<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
6 so first of all I'm gonna set up a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.589 
6 so first of all I'm gonna set up a
finger<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.189> each<00:00:23.369> device<00:00:29.210> i'm<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> set

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
finger for each device i'm going to set

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
finger for each device i'm going to set
up<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> finger<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.590> each<00:00:32.160> hand<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.759> i<00:00:32.820> can

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
up a finger from each hand so i can

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.950 
up a finger from each hand so i can
press<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> same<00:00:33.780> time<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
press them in the same time so this is

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.709 
press them in the same time so this is
how<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.140> set<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.370> finger<00:00:41.879> printer<00:00:42.420> on

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
how you set up the finger printer on

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.279 
how you set up the finger printer on
both<00:00:43.079> devices<00:00:43.399> this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> bit<00:00:44.930> faster<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
both devices this is a bit faster on the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.479 
both devices this is a bit faster on the
iphone<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.950> seems<00:00:47.870> it's<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:50.010> longer<00:00:50.309> on

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
iphone it seems it's a a bit longer on

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.209 
iphone it seems it's a a bit longer on
the<00:00:50.700> major

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.420 

it's<00:00:57.219> Donald<00:00:57.699> I<00:00:57.879> for<00:00:58.270> most<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.280> set<00:01:00.280> up

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
it's Donald I for most of the set up

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.600 
it's Donald I for most of the set up
anyways<00:01:04.350> basically<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.530> iphone<00:01:06.040> does<00:01:06.280> this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
anyways basically the iphone does this

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.940 
anyways basically the iphone does this
in<00:01:06.850> two<00:01:07.030> steps<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.869> maze<00:01:08.170> does<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.770> in<00:01:08.920> one

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
in two steps the maze does it in one

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.770 
in two steps the maze does it in one
step<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.640> now<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.700> iphone<00:01:13.180> i<00:01:13.270> have<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.600> pull

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
step and now the iphone i have to pull

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.420 
step and now the iphone i have to pull
the<00:01:13.810> sides<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.560> finger<00:01:14.890> which<00:01:15.040> i<00:01:15.190> did

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
and it's done on both devices so next

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.680 
and it's done on both devices so next
I'm<00:01:32.230> gonna<00:01:32.440> done<00:01:33.250> both<00:01:33.580> of<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:34.030> device<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.660> off

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
I'm gonna done both of the device is off

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.380 
I'm gonna done both of the device is off
so<00:01:37.690> first<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.170> press<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.890> button<00:01:39.040> once<00:01:39.460> then

seen now we'll try the wrong finger on

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.720 
seen now we'll try the wrong finger on
both<00:01:55.750> devices<00:01:56.010> so<00:01:57.010> this<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.220> not<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.640> right

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730
