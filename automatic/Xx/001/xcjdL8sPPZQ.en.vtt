00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 the fire said mission 65 and robben 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 in certain secondary missions for the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.040
 wong kar dealer yes it is 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.929
 true that they do not help us for the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.580
 story of the game help us for the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.679
 100% and we are going to take advantage of it since 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.450
 we are instance well we are here 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.789
 we are playing cards as you know the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.130
 pando wine de jethro and that does not like 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.410
 attend since she wants to achieve something 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.779
 for the business something can garage but 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.359
 then Oscar begins to explain 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.830
 that is not what you are thinking is 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.029
 playing cards yes but we are also 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 doing projects are making plans 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.610
 and tails 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 then it seems to dealer we have 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.880
 than getting vehicles without vehicles 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.920
 that is not so easy to get going 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.270
 to take some risks the first 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 vehicle that after getting is also not 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.739
 as it returns to say that it is very easy 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.440
 but it has invented something that we will 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.660
 to facilitate finding that vehicle you are going to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.960
 explain nonsense but following you 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 he understands not a damn but equal hands to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.500
 the work we are going to start then now 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.239
 if not 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 will go on to explain what it is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.440
 this this works through a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.789
 satellite and back of the cell the person 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.229
 that will drive that vehicle that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.659
 you need is a place we this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.789
 woman here will use your phone 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.920
 that call will leave us a trail a 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.450
 red trail and a gasol that will come out in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.700
 to radar is there then we have to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 avoid that trace is lost and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.609
 apart we have to get that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.170
 vehicle and to get that vehicle 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.909
 we have to be the technique of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.770
 detention yes we're going to turn on another 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.420
 school ok let's go front and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.390
 just when we turn we're going to crash the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.399
 car like that so that fast speedy fast 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.890
 because if not then the vehicle will go 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.469
 moving very fast if we are going to take 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.959
 a lot of time yes then take advantage of 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.149
 I turned around and there I had all 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.709
 speed and there collides of the part 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.170
 back as we have been taught in the 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.239
 part in which cars in the art 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.280
 of test or simple we have to leave 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:49.439
 this vehicle is to throw us to the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.289
 Garage in back is fine although the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.319
 bumper is damaged but to hell if 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.629
 you do not care so much right now 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.069
 we have available what is this 

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:01.469
 car modification that is willard 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.959
 angels yes here we will be able to modify 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.960
 our vehicles in a special way of 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:10.810
 a way not like us but more 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.120
 well we have the mission exceeded 5000 the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.350
