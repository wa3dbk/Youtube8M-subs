task manager the one has built in the
windows<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:40.140> bit<00:01:40.290> better<00:01:41.180> but<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
windows is a little bit better but if I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
have a suspicion that that task manager

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.300 
have a suspicion that that task manager
isn't<00:01:46.799> showing<00:01:47.190> me<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:48.530> suspected<00:01:49.530> process

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
isn't showing me a suspected process

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.980 
isn't showing me a suspected process
because<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.700> some<00:01:51.210> reason<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.690> hiding

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
because for some reason it's hiding

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.320 
because for some reason it's hiding
itself<00:01:52.440> windows<00:01:53.280> task<00:01:53.610> manager

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
itself windows task manager

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.910 
itself windows task manager
I<00:01:54.380> have<00:01:55.380> found<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.800> D<00:01:56.190> task<00:01:56.580> manager<00:01:57.240> will<00:01:57.920> has

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
I have found it D task manager will has

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
I have found it D task manager will has
a<00:01:58.950> higher<00:01:59.490> chance<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.149> picking<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:02.840> another

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
a higher chance of picking it up another

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.139 
a higher chance of picking it up another
thing<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.649> take<00:02:05.069> to<00:02:05.190> customers<00:02:05.640> houses<00:02:05.789> is

the<00:02:45.790> reason<00:02:46.120> why<00:02:46.240> I<00:02:46.270> like<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.690> over<00:02:47.230> what's

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
the reason why I like it over what's

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.060 
the reason why I like it over what's
built<00:02:47.770> into<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.550> system<00:02:48.790> itself<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:50.070> mainly

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
built into the system itself is mainly

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.180 
built into the system itself is mainly
that<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.640> has<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> visual<00:02:52.690> diagram<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.710> what's

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
that it has a visual diagram of what's

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.630 
that it has a visual diagram of what's
happening<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:55.480> helps<00:02:55.900> me<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.050> describe<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.550> the
