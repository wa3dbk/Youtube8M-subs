warm-up program in addition to the fact

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.490 
warm-up program in addition to the fact
of<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.580> going<00:00:38.910> slow<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.540> find<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> lot

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
of really going slow I find that a lot

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950 
of really going slow I find that a lot
of<00:00:40.560> my<00:00:40.800> older<00:00:41.250> patients<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.360> are<00:00:42.390> much<00:00:42.750> more

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
of my older patients that are much more

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.560 
of my older patients that are much more
active<00:00:43.460> tend<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.610> push<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.880> little<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.300> too

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
active tend to push a little bit too

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.260 
active tend to push a little bit too
hard<00:00:45.900> too<00:00:46.500> early<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> younger

hard too early for the younger

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
hard too early for the younger
population<00:00:48.900> I<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.260> also<00:00:49.440> very

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710

important to continue with a good

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
important to continue with a good
