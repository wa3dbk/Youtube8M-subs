00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
we did from that garage that I thought

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.640 
we did from that garage that I thought
we<00:00:27.180> should<00:00:27.240> put<00:00:27.510> onto<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.900> new<00:00:28.050> channel<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
we should put onto the new channel and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.939 
we should put onto the new channel and
so<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.820> digging<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.390> those<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.199> today

you need for your fender well in our

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.510 
you need for your fender well in our
case<00:02:49.660> we<00:02:50.350> needed<00:02:50.650> something<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.040> was<00:02:51.280> about

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
case we needed something that was about

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.059 
case we needed something that was about
3/4<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.209> an<00:02:52.390> inch<00:02:52.480> wide<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.680> when<00:02:53.890> the

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
3/4 of an inch wide so that when the

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.580 
3/4 of an inch wide so that when the
fender<00:02:54.430> was<00:02:54.640> on<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.970> body<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:56.200> would<00:02:56.380> cover

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
fender was on the body it would cover

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.660 
fender was on the body it would cover
over<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> tire<00:02:57.250> something<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:59.670> we

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
over the tire something like this so we

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.910 
over the tire something like this so we
cut<00:03:00.910> off<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.840> fender<00:03:02.080> we<00:03:02.410> marked<00:03:02.680> him<00:03:02.800> out

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
cut off the fender we marked him out

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.860 
cut off the fender we marked him out
with<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.069> marker<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:04.600> cut<00:03:04.750> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
with a marker and then we cut the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.460 
with a marker and then we cut the
fenders<00:03:05.230> off<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.590> our<00:03:05.740> Bowl<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:08.140> ended<00:03:08.410> up

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
fenders off of our Bowl so it ended up

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.850 
fenders off of our Bowl so it ended up
being<00:03:08.680> about<00:03:08.890> half<00:03:09.190> size<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.720> then<00:03:10.989> as<00:03:11.709> you

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
being about half size and then as you

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.100 
being about half size and then as you
can<00:03:12.010> see<00:03:12.220> because<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.819> Kliq<00:03:13.060> lid<00:03:13.330> fits<00:03:13.870> on

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
can see because the Kliq lid fits on

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.990 
can see because the Kliq lid fits on
here

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
here

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.070 
here
there's<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.600> spot<00:03:15.990> on<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:17.840> where<00:03:18.840> there's

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
there's this spot on here where there's

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.830 
there's this spot on here where there's
like<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.290> double<00:03:19.680> lip<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.160> here<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.840> of

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
like a double lip on it here and of

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.210

course<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.170> double<00:03:22.470> lip<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.830> something<00:03:23.130> you

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
course the double lip is something you

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.890 
course the double lip is something you
don't<00:03:23.340> want<00:03:23.670> because<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:24.330> not<00:03:24.570> gonna<00:03:24.720> look

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
don't want because it's not gonna look

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.870 
don't want because it's not gonna look

number five a number five is

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.940 
number five a number five is
polypropylene<00:04:57.229> it's<00:04:58.229> a<00:04:58.410> really<00:04:58.710> flexible

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
polypropylene it's a really flexible

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.210 
polypropylene it's a really flexible
material<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.930> can<00:05:01.080> get<00:05:01.290> lots<00:05:01.560> of<00:05:01.740> use<00:05:01.979> and

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
material you can get lots of use and

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.450 
material you can get lots of use and
wear<00:05:02.400> out<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.790> it<00:05:03.330> does<00:05:03.600> crack<00:05:04.050> if<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:05.220> have

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
wear out of it it does crack if you have

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.050 
wear out of it it does crack if you have
a<00:05:05.760> jagged-edged<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:07.050> what<00:05:07.890> I<00:05:07.919> recommend<00:05:08.490> is

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
a jagged-edged so what I recommend is

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.690 
a jagged-edged so what I recommend is
after<00:05:09.540> you're<00:05:09.690> done<00:05:09.810> cutting<00:05:10.050> it<00:05:10.290> off<00:05:10.700> sand

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
after you're done cutting it off sand

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.940 
after you're done cutting it off sand
the<00:05:11.880> edges<00:05:12.030> smooth<00:05:12.510> because<00:05:13.500> if<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.740> have<00:05:13.919> a

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
the edges smooth because if you have a

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.250 
the edges smooth because if you have a
smooth<00:05:14.310> edge<00:05:14.520> on<00:05:14.760> it<00:05:14.910> it's<00:05:15.600> really<00:05:15.900> flexible

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
smooth edge on it it's really flexible

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.230 
smooth edge on it it's really flexible
and<00:05:16.710> it's<00:05:17.250> not<00:05:17.400> going<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:17.669> break<00:05:17.850> when<00:05:18.090> you're

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
and it's not going to break when you're

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.900 
and it's not going to break when you're
out<00:05:18.330> on<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.540> trail<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:19.550> how<00:05:20.550> do<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.729> mount

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
out on the trail so how do you mount

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.760 
out on the trail so how do you mount
these<00:05:21.030> up<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.419> body<00:05:21.600> well<00:05:21.840> what<00:05:22.229> we<00:05:22.350> did<00:05:22.590> is

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
these up to the body well what we did is

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.940 
these up to the body well what we did is
we<00:05:23.070> took<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.760> two<00:05:24.270> millimeter<00:05:24.720> bolts<00:05:25.169> that<00:05:25.830> we

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
we took the two millimeter bolts that we

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.520 
we took the two millimeter bolts that we
were<00:05:26.070> going<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.370> use<00:05:26.580> on<00:05:27.000> our<00:05:27.510> plastic<00:05:27.750> fenders

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
were going to use on our plastic fenders

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.910 
were going to use on our plastic fenders
