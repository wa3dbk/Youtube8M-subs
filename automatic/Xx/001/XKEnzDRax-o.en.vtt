00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
while I like the page I noticed that my

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.930 
while I like the page I noticed that my
eye<00:00:32.219> isn't<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.950> drawn<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.219> stay<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
eye isn't really drawn to stay on the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
eye isn't really drawn to stay on the
page<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> things<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
page and so one of the things I like to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.200 
page and so one of the things I like to
do<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.040> happens<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.879> create<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
do and that happens is to create a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.180 
do and that happens is to create a
little<00:00:39.450> frame<00:00:39.840> around<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.890> edge<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.129> my

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
little frame around the edge of my

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.700 
little frame around the edge of my
layout<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.809> way<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> create

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
layout so the way that I like to create

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.650 
layout so the way that I like to create
a<00:00:43.800> frame<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.399> take<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> contrasting<00:00:45.450> color

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
a frame is to take a contrasting color

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.260 
a frame is to take a contrasting color
of<00:00:45.750> card<00:00:46.020> stock<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.219> layer<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.760> underneath

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
of card stock and to layer it underneath

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270 
of card stock and to layer it underneath
and<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.840> case<00:00:49.110> I've<00:00:49.320> chosen<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.890> darker

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and in this case I've chosen this darker

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.270 
and in this case I've chosen this darker
blue<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.800> adding<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
blue and you can see just adding it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
blue and you can see just adding it
there<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.910> already<00:00:54.120> tell<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.660> there's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
there you can already tell that there's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
there you can already tell that there's
a<00:00:54.930> difference<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> brings<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:55.980> eye<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
a difference it brings your eye in to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.869 
a difference it brings your eye in to
the<00:00:57.300> center<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> layout<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.760> we'll

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the center of the layout but what we'll

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.340 
the center of the layout but what we'll
need<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.660> we're<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> trim<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
into the layout it gives it a nice frame

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.100 
into the layout it gives it a nice frame
and<00:01:17.610> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> gives<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.390> eye<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.509> place<00:01:18.900> to

and kind of gives your eye a place to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.020 
and kind of gives your eye a place to
rest<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.590> also<00:01:19.710> plays<00:01:20.070> off<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.580> frame<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
rest it also plays off at this frame I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
rest it also plays off at this frame I
created<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> middle<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> layout<00:01:22.549> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
created in the middle of the layout so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
created in the middle of the layout so
it<00:01:23.820> has<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> nice<00:01:24.299> foundation<00:01:24.689> now<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> it's

and a half so I did it the same

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.359 
and a half so I did it the same
measurement<00:02:03.689> from<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.049> blade<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.040> end<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
measurement from the blade to the end of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.950 
measurement from the blade to the end of
the<00:02:05.430> paper<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.939> also<00:02:06.270> from<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> top<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720 
one and a half and then I'm just gonna
keep<00:02:18.959> doing<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.709> on<00:02:20.189> all<00:02:20.400> four<00:02:20.430> sides

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
keep doing this on all four sides

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.270 
keep doing this on all four sides
measuring<00:02:21.629> again<00:02:21.959> at<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.769> half<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.189> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
measuring again at one and a half on the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.729 
measuring again at one and a half on the
sides<00:02:23.579> and<00:02:24.299> one<00:02:24.359> and<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.319> half<00:02:25.469> at<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.709> top<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
sides and one and a half at the top and

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:40.069 
sides and one and a half at the top and
I'll<00:02:32.159> flip<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.790> do<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.150> again<00:02:38.840> now<00:02:39.840> this

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
I'll flip it and do that again now this

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.440 
I'll flip it and do that again now this
paper<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:41.609> way<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.879> we're<00:02:42.000> doing<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.359> on

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
paper the way that we're doing it on

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.509 
paper the way that we're doing it on
this<00:02:42.569> layout<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.139> will<00:02:43.319> be<00:02:43.439> underneath<00:02:43.829> so<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
this layout it will be underneath so the

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.839 
this layout it will be underneath so the
cuts<00:02:44.760> are<00:02:45.000> exact<00:02:45.950> that's<00:02:46.950> okay

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
cuts are exact that's okay

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.149 
cuts are exact that's okay
and<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.329> can<00:02:48.569> see<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.349> actually<00:02:49.409> need<00:02:49.829> a<00:02:49.859> little

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
and you can see I actually need a little

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.580 
and you can see I actually need a little
bit<00:02:50.280> more<00:02:50.519> because<00:02:50.669> here<00:02:53.900> see<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:54.930> popped<00:02:55.409> out

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
bit more because here see I popped out

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.020 
bit more because here see I popped out
the<00:02:55.769> center<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.609> see<00:02:56.760> some<00:02:56.939> of

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the center of that you can see some of

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.089 
the center of that you can see some of
those<00:02:57.090> cuts<00:02:57.389> aren't<00:02:57.629> exact<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.560> that's<00:02:58.799> okay

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
those cuts aren't exact and that's okay

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.409 
those cuts aren't exact and that's okay
because<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.579> gonna<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.909> underneath<00:03:00.150> our

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
because it's gonna be underneath our

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.020 
because it's gonna be underneath our
layout<00:03:00.689> but<00:03:01.230> now<00:03:01.379> we<00:03:01.439> have<00:03:01.919> this<00:03:02.099> nice<00:03:02.370> piece

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
layout but now we have this nice piece

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.599 
layout but now we have this nice piece
about<00:03:03.450> eight<00:03:04.019> by<00:03:04.500> eight<00:03:04.859> eight<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.459> half<00:03:05.489> by

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
about eight by eight eight and a half by

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.110 
about eight by eight eight and a half by
eight<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.239> half<00:03:06.829> square<00:03:07.939> cardstock<00:03:08.939> that

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
eight and a half square cardstock that

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.789 
eight and a half square cardstock that
we<00:03:09.180> can<00:03:09.359> use<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:09.659> another<00:03:09.900> layout<00:03:10.139> we<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.680> use

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
we can use on another layout we can use

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.860 
we can use on another layout we can use
it<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.010> mat<00:03:11.280> pictures<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.569> current

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
it to mat pictures for the current

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.990 
it to mat pictures for the current
layout<00:03:13.049> I've<00:03:13.409> already<00:03:13.680> done<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:14.400> here<00:03:14.790> so

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
layout I've already done that on here so

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.059 
layout I've already done that on here so
we<00:03:15.120> won't<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.359> doing<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.659> but<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.799> lose

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
we won't be doing that but this lose

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.979 
we won't be doing that but this lose
room<00:03:17.280> with<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> nice<00:03:17.669> scrap<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.299> be<00:03:18.389> able<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.720> use

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
room with a nice scrap to be able to use

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.219 
room with a nice scrap to be able to use
on<00:03:19.349> another<00:03:19.829> layout<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:21.329> also<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:22.049> use

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
on another layout and also you can use

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.229 
on another layout and also you can use
this<00:03:22.440> technique<00:03:22.859> not<00:03:23.129> just<00:03:23.400> for<00:03:23.579> framing<00:03:23.879> a

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
this technique not just for framing a

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.990 
this technique not just for framing a
layout<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.229> also<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.620> used<00:03:26.159> it<00:03:26.370> when<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.549> created

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
layout but also I used it when I created

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.449 
layout but also I used it when I created
this<00:03:27.239> frame<00:03:27.629> in<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.680> middle<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.129> layout
