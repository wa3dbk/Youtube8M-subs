things grow but what impresses me the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.950 
things grow but what impresses me the
most<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.640> how<00:01:27.759> it<00:01:27.910> engages<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.600> Googler

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
most is how it engages the Googler

most is how it engages the Googler
people<00:01:29.710> come<00:01:29.890> out<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.039> actually<00:01:30.310> look<00:01:30.700> at<00:01:30.910> the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
people come out and actually look at the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.029 
people come out and actually look at the
box<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.539> engineers<00:01:32.020> walk<00:01:32.289> around<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.979> they

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
box the engineers walk around and they

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.609 
box the engineers walk around and they
kind<00:01:33.190> of<00:01:33.310> say<00:01:33.490> hmm<00:01:34.240> tell<00:01:34.780> me<00:01:34.930> how<00:01:35.080> this<00:01:35.320> works

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
explain this to me and in my opinion we

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.840 
explain this to me and in my opinion we
could<00:01:38.259> have<00:01:38.410> five<00:01:38.649> acres<00:01:39.039> planted<00:01:39.250> here<00:01:39.640> in

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
could have five acres planted here in

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.180 
could have five acres planted here in
the<00:01:40.060> dirt<00:01:40.270> under<00:01:40.690> their<00:01:40.869> noses<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.470> never<00:01:41.979> get

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
the dirt under their noses and never get

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.950 
the dirt under their noses and never get
the<00:01:42.310> attention<00:01:42.580> that<00:01:42.880> we're<00:01:43.119> getting<00:01:43.270> because
