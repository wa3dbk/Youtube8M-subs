00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
it you wanna mess so I guess they just

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
like the ones in the set so I guess it

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.050 
like the ones in the set so I guess it
will<00:04:41.300> go<00:04:41.450> out<00:04:41.479> to<00:04:41.870> make<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.110> title<00:04:42.729> I've<00:04:43.729> got

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.120 
will go out to make a title I've got
this<00:04:44.240> nail<00:04:44.510> polish<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:45.979> can

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130

complete the whole look and actually the

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.320 
complete the whole look and actually the
black<00:04:48.680> one<00:04:48.919> would<00:04:49.130> be<00:04:49.250> enough<00:04:49.520> but<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.940> thought

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
black one would be enough but I thought

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.670

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.180 
either go on and then one is six ninety

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.710 
one five inch thick cut this fedora hat
which<00:05:06.380> would<00:05:06.620> cost<00:05:06.910> $35<00:05:07.910> in<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.150> set<00:05:08.419> but<00:05:08.450> I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
which would cost $35 in the set but I

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.800 
which would cost $35 in the set but I
got<00:05:08.930> it<00:05:09.050> for<00:05:09.229> twelve<00:05:10.240> usually<00:05:11.240> you'll<00:05:11.360> find<00:05:11.690> it

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
got it for twelve usually you'll find it

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
got it for twelve usually you'll find it
for<00:05:11.960> 15<00:05:12.470> so<00:05:13.039> I<00:05:13.070> guess<00:05:13.310> top<00:05:13.550> is<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:13.729> really<00:05:14.090> good

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
for 15 so I guess top is a really good

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.780 
for 15 so I guess top is a really good
and<00:05:15.030> it's<00:05:16.030> not<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.360> soft<00:05:17.170> kind<00:05:17.590> of<00:05:17.800> head<00:05:18.580> la

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
and it's not the soft kind of head la

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.820 
and it's not the soft kind of head la
it's<00:05:19.180> quite<00:05:19.480> hard<00:05:19.780> I<00:05:20.050> don't<00:05:20.230> know<00:05:20.470> if<00:05:20.590> it's<00:05:20.740> a

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
it's quite hard I don't know if it's a

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.650 
it's quite hard I don't know if it's a
good<00:05:20.980> or<00:05:21.130> bad<00:05:21.160> thing<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:22.150> you<00:05:22.210> might<00:05:22.510> have

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
good or bad thing so you might have

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.570 
good or bad thing so you might have
noticed<00:05:23.080> that<00:05:23.170> in<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.500> set<00:05:23.770> right<00:05:24.070> there's<00:05:24.370> no

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
noticed that in the set right there's no

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.240 
noticed that in the set right there's no
back<00:05:24.970> or<00:05:25.210> collector<00:05:25.960> on<00:05:26.020> any<00:05:26.200> of<00:05:26.350> salt<00:05:26.740> so

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
back or collector on any of salt so

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.430 
back or collector on any of salt so
since<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.580> got<00:05:27.730> extra<00:05:28.120> money<00:05:28.450> I<00:05:28.630> went<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.200> hunt

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
since I got extra money I went to hunt

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.910 
since I got extra money I went to hunt
for<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.980> bag<00:05:30.430> for<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.240> and<00:05:31.540> it<00:05:32.170> happens<00:05:32.590> to<00:05:32.680> be

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.880

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
I thought it will go very well with the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.240 
I thought it will go very well with the
whole<00:05:39.130> kind<00:05:39.640> of<00:05:39.760> smut<00:05:40.330> but<00:05:40.690> casual<00:05:41.650> look<00:05:41.950> and

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
whole kind of smut but casual look and

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.340 
whole kind of smut but casual look and
the<00:05:42.670> inside<00:05:43.000> is<00:05:43.030> quite<00:05:43.300> nicer<00:05:43.540> it's<00:05:43.900> like<00:05:44.080> suit

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.780 
you can just cap it like this Hey yeah
and<00:05:55.110> also<00:05:56.110> they<00:05:56.350> have<00:05:56.590> like<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:56.980> chain<00:05:57.340> for<00:05:57.670> you

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
to chain it which I think will look very

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.080 
to chain it which I think will look very
very<00:05:59.530> ugly<00:05:59.650> so<00:06:00.310> I<00:06:00.340> don't<00:06:00.580> suggest<00:06:00.730> you<00:06:01.060> use
