equipment so i made this kind of that

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
equipment so i made this kind of that
semi<00:00:34.710> ambient<00:00:35.430> track<00:00:35.760> kind<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.270> an<00:00:36.420> artsy

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
semi ambient track kind of like an artsy

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.310 
semi ambient track kind of like an artsy
fartsy<00:00:37.380> type<00:00:37.890> thing<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.690> as<00:00:39.690> i<00:00:39.809> listened<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
thing so i found a beat hanging around

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.350 
thing so i found a beat hanging around
that<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.800> little<00:00:50.010> sweet<00:00:50.460> revenge<00:00:50.730> because

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
and now i'm using a beat of theirs to

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.250 
and now i'm using a beat of theirs to
fatten<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.210> track<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.199> to

fatten up this track and it's going to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.289 
fatten up this track and it's going to
be<00:01:04.409> no<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:04.890> will<00:01:05.040> ever<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.430> who<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> and

I'm not going to mention any names now
to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.030> fatten<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> beat<00:01:10.260> I'm<00:01:10.530> going

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to the fatten of the beat I'm going

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.219 
to the fatten of the beat I'm going
through<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:12.150> crazy<00:01:12.930> filter<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.900> analog<00:01:15.900> delay

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
through a crazy filter and analog delay

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.170 
through a crazy filter and analog delay
and<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> dbx<00:01:18.210> 160<00:01:19.130> 370's<00:01:20.180> compressor

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and then a dbx 160 370's compressor

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
and then a dbx 160 370's compressor
really<00:01:21.600> fatten<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.340> beat<00:01:23.729> is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
really fatten it up so that beat is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.969 
really fatten it up so that beat is
going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.240> slamming<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:26.150> the

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
going to be slamming and then the

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.789 
going to be slamming and then the
ambient<00:01:28.979> track<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.509> call<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> is

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
ambient track if you can call it that is

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.899 
ambient track if you can call it that is
coming<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:34.140> mono<00:01:34.590> channels<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.579> coming

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
coming out to mono channels is coming

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.850 
coming out to mono channels is coming
out<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.750> channel<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.590> through<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
out on one channel is going through a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.060 
out on one channel is going through a
raw<00:01:38.729> space<00:01:39.240> distortion<00:01:39.780> from<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> 70s<00:01:40.920> which

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
raw space distortion from the 70s which

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.609 
raw space distortion from the 70s which
I<00:01:41.250> modified<00:01:41.850> did<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> little<00:01:42.810> circuit<00:01:43.290> bending

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
I modified did a little circuit bending

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
I modified did a little circuit bending
on<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.610> then

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
on it and then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.249 
on it and then
before<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.530> its<00:01:46.829> first<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.549> through<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
before that its first going through a

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.179 
before that its first going through a
ring<00:01:49.259> modulator<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.219> a<00:01:50.579> new<00:01:50.909> ring<00:01:51.240> modulator

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
ring modulator of a new ring modulator

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.100 
ring modulator of a new ring modulator
the<00:01:53.189> other<00:01:53.340> channel<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.060> first<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.659> through

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the other channel is first going through

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.310 
the other channel is first going through
the<00:01:55.890> 80s<00:01:56.520> digital<00:01:57.090> flanger<00:01:57.810> which<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.140> really

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the 80s digital flanger which is really

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.649 
the 80s digital flanger which is really
outrageous<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.369> then<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.270> going

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
outrageous and then this is going

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.429 
outrageous and then this is going
through<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.670> tremolo<00:02:02.670> which<00:02:03.600> I've<00:02:03.780> got<00:02:03.960> sent<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
through a tremolo which I've got sent to

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.999 
through a tremolo which I've got sent to
a<00:02:04.470> square<00:02:04.920> wave<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.399> kind<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.840> stutter<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.079> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
a square wave to kind of stutter it that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.949 
a square wave to kind of stutter it that
I've<00:02:08.130> also<00:02:08.340> got<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.819> new<00:02:09.060> favorite<00:02:09.660> toy<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:11.959> my

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.420 
I've also got my new favorite toy my my
crazy<00:02:13.290> beatbox<00:02:15.410> sound<00:02:16.410> maker<00:02:16.769> going<00:02:17.160> through

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
crazy beatbox sound maker going through

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.630 
crazy beatbox sound maker going through
a<00:02:17.459> delay<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:17.849> flanger<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.470> anyways<00:02:20.190> enough

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
a delay in flanger so anyways enough

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.130 
a delay in flanger so anyways enough
about<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.630> how<00:02:21.780> I'm<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.080> to
