00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
you do get quite pretty nervous but I

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.199 
you do get quite pretty nervous but I
think<00:03:07.890> today<00:03:08.890> they<00:03:09.099> they<00:03:09.579> play<00:03:09.790> really<00:03:09.970> well

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
think today they they play really well

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.030 
think today they they play really well
as<00:03:10.329> a<00:03:10.359> team<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:11.109> try<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.379> play<00:03:11.590> from<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.859> back

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
as a team we try to play from the back

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.000 
as a team we try to play from the back
we<00:03:12.250> didn't<00:03:12.489> play<00:03:12.640> our<00:03:12.670> best<00:03:12.959> football<00:03:14.010> tonight

well for us but we consider goal in the
second<00:03:22.780> half<00:03:22.959> but<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:23.319> don't<00:03:23.590> give<00:03:24.459> up<00:03:24.609> we<00:03:24.760> come
