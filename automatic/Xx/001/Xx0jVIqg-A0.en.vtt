00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
in the background um it would be really

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.769 
in the background um it would be really
nice<00:00:17.400> if<00:00:17.460> there<00:00:17.880> was<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.420> just<00:00:18.660> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
yeah I guess that's it oh and if you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
yeah I guess that's it oh and if you
turn<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.170> switch<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.770> actually<00:01:31.950> turns<00:01:32.400> up

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
turn that switch it actually turns up

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.850 
turn that switch it actually turns up
the<00:01:32.670> volume<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:33.360> your<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.439> iPhone

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
when my ringer was down to the lowest

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.990 
when my ringer was down to the lowest
possible<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.009> I'm<00:01:41.009> hardly<00:01:41.220> woke<00:01:41.430> me<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.610> good

iPhone or your iPad and using that will

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.810 
iPhone or your iPad and using that will
actually<00:04:35.950> diminish<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.130> quality<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.610> your

actually diminish the quality of your
oleophobic<00:04:38.630> screen<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.320> whole<00:04:39.950> lot<00:04:40.220> faster<00:04:40.490> and

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
oleophobic screen a whole lot faster and

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.790 
oleophobic screen a whole lot faster and
this<00:04:41.180> movie<00:04:41.510> this<00:04:41.720> video<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.200> longer<00:04:42.560> than<00:04:42.680> I

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
this movie this video is longer than I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.020 
this movie this video is longer than I
thought<00:04:43.479> well<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:44.510> guess<00:04:44.750> that's<00:04:44.870> it
