you how to make the gusset for the dag
the<00:00:14.940> gusset<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.839> part<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.350> bag<00:00:16.529> that

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the gusset is the part of the bag that

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.920 
the gusset is the part of the bag that
determines<00:00:17.490> how<00:00:18.000> far<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> bag<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.720> going<00:00:18.869> to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.030 
long piece of oak Tazz and we're going
to<00:00:29.429> get<00:00:29.849> about<00:00:30.810> try<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> find<00:00:31.619> them<00:00:31.769> about<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
to get about try to find them about the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.740 
to get about try to find them about the
middle<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> them<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.969> about<00:00:33.120> 22<00:00:33.719> inches

middle of them this is about 22 inches

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.510 
middle of them this is about 22 inches
I'm<00:00:34.590> gonna<00:00:35.040> pin<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.430> right<00:00:35.460> here

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.400 

draw<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.210> line<00:00:41.510> we're<00:00:41.809> going<00:00:41.899> to<00:00:41.960> make<00:00:42.170> this

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
draw a line we're going to make this

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.020 
draw a line we're going to make this
piece<00:00:42.739> of<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:43.010> paper<00:00:43.480> symmetrical<00:00:45.820> so<00:00:46.820> I'm

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
piece of a paper symmetrical so I'm

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.330 
piece of a paper symmetrical so I'm
going<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.239> fold<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:50.559> turn<00:00:51.559> it<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:51.860> way<00:00:51.920> and

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
going to fold this turn it this way and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.759 
going to fold this turn it this way and
get<00:00:52.610> about<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.210> center<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.750> this<00:00:53.930> part<00:00:54.260> which

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
get about the center of this part which

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:01.130 
get about the center of this part which
is<00:00:54.949> about<00:00:57.670> here

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.719 

pin<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.980> open<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:03.660> score<00:01:04.550> go<00:01:05.550> in<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
pin it open it up and score go in the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:24.789 
pin it open it up and score go in the
opposite<00:01:06.120> direction

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.069 

so<00:01:25.520> at<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:25.880> point<00:01:26.210> what<00:01:26.479> we're<00:01:26.600> going<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.840> do

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
so at this point what we're going to do

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.160 
so at this point what we're going to do
is<00:01:27.439> try<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.369> determine<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.210> length<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.630> our

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
is try to determine the length of our

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.560 
is try to determine the length of our
gussev<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.219> order<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.640> do<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.119> we<00:01:32.359> have

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
gussev and in order to do that we have

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.600 
gussev and in order to do that we have
to<00:01:32.689> take<00:01:32.869> our<00:01:33.110> front<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.039> back<00:01:34.250> master

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
to take our front and back master

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.410 
to take our front and back master
pattern<00:01:35.030> fold<00:01:35.719> it<00:01:35.899> in<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.079> half<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.969> take<00:01:37.969> this

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
pattern fold it in a half and take this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.719 
pattern fold it in a half and take this
is<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.750> middle<00:01:39.049> notch<00:01:39.380> here<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:39.829> right<00:01:40.490> here

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
is the middle notch here and right here

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.569 
is the middle notch here and right here
is<00:01:40.819> the<00:01:40.969> center<00:01:41.329> of<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:41.960> gusset<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:42.679> you

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
is the center of this gusset and you

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.559 
is the center of this gusset and you
line<00:01:43.850> that<00:01:44.149> up<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:48.880> put<00:01:49.880> your<00:01:49.969> finger<00:01:50.329> there

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
line that up and put your finger there

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.330 
line that up and put your finger there
and<00:01:50.929> hold<00:01:51.469> your<00:01:51.679> all<00:01:51.950> down<00:01:52.450> while<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.659> swing

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
and hold your all down while you swing

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.760 
and hold your all down while you swing
the<00:01:55.340> pattern<00:01:55.700> over<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.119> line<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.509> up<00:01:59.770> you'll

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
the pattern over and line it up you'll

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.160 
the pattern over and line it up you'll
actually<00:02:00.920> start<00:02:01.459> from<00:02:01.700> right<00:02:01.970> there<00:02:02.299> from<00:02:03.140> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
actually start from right there from the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.990 
actually start from right there from the
flattest<00:02:03.619> part<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.250> then<00:02:04.729> when<00:02:04.880> you're

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
flattest part and then when you're

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.690 
flattest part and then when you're
getting<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:05.509> curve<00:02:05.989> you<00:02:06.289> hold<00:02:07.280> your<00:02:07.489> all

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
getting to this curve you hold your all

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.990 
getting to this curve you hold your all
down<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.450> walk<00:02:09.519> that<00:02:10.519> curve<00:02:12.010> around<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.640> edge

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
down and walk that curve around the edge

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.690 
down and walk that curve around the edge
of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:16.310> middle<00:02:16.579> part<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.060> gusset<00:02:18.700> okay

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
of the middle part of that gusset okay

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.330 
of the middle part of that gusset okay
you<00:02:19.760> walk<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.329> all<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.630> way<00:02:20.750> around<00:02:21.340> holding

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
you walk it all the way around holding

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.860 
you walk it all the way around holding
your<00:02:22.370> left<00:02:22.640> hand<00:02:22.910> down<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:23.629> when<00:02:23.780> you're

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
your left hand down and then when you're

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.960 
your left hand down and then when you're
making<00:02:24.049> it<00:02:24.230> turn<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.980> hold<00:02:25.220> your<00:02:25.400> all<00:02:25.610> down

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
making it turn you hold your all down

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.620 
making it turn you hold your all down
and<00:02:26.799> then<00:02:27.799> when<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.129> get<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.370> your<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:29.359> flat

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
and then when you get to your the flat

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.949 
and then when you get to your the flat
part<00:02:30.370> you're<00:02:31.370> at<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.670> end<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:32.120> where<00:02:32.780> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
part you're at the end of where the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.250 
part you're at the end of where the
gusset<00:02:33.319> will<00:02:33.440> be<00:02:33.620> okay<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.750> pin<00:02:36.079> it<00:02:36.109> right

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
gusset will be okay so you pin it right

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.330 
gusset will be okay so you pin it right
there<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.840> actually<00:02:38.989> do<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.440> other<00:02:39.560> part

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
there you can actually do the other part

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.729 
there you can actually do the other part
too<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.930> you'll<00:02:42.049> be<00:02:42.170> able<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.470> cut<00:02:42.709> it

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
too so that you'll be able to cut it

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.910 
too so that you'll be able to cut it
straight<00:02:43.190> across

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:55.070 

fold<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.280> half<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:51.260> now<00:02:52.490> you<00:02:53.490> can<00:02:54.080> cut

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
fold this in half and now you can cut

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.809 
fold this in half and now you can cut
right<00:02:55.110> there<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:55.830> we'll<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.190> length<00:02:56.580> of

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
right there now we'll have the length of

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.300 
right there now we'll have the length of
the<00:02:57.000> gusset<00:03:00.830> first<00:03:01.830> you're<00:03:01.980> getting<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
the gusset first you're getting the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.250 
the gusset first you're getting the
length<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.790> your<00:03:02.910> desk<00:03:03.120> now<00:03:03.720> what<00:03:04.110> you're

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
length of your desk now what you're

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.690 
length of your desk now what you're
doing<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:05.180> getting<00:03:07.070> working<00:03:08.070> with<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.430> lip

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
doing is getting working with the lip

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.470 
doing is getting working with the lip
the<00:03:08.910> width<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.440> how<00:03:10.440> wide<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.670> decided

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the width of how wide it is so I decided

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.360 
the width of how wide it is so I decided
I<00:03:12.720> wanted<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.290> be<00:03:13.440> four<00:03:13.739> inches<00:03:13.770> on<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
I wanted it to be four inches on the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.240 
I wanted it to be four inches on the
bottom<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:15.110> about<00:03:16.110> three<00:03:16.470> inch<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.860> three

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
bottom and about three inch and three

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.479 
bottom and about three inch and three
inches<00:03:17.520> on<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> top<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.810> because<00:03:19.489> we're

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
inches on the top so because we're

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.350 
inches on the top so because we're
working<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.500> double<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.790> don't<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.150> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
working in a double you don't have to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.240 
working in a double you don't have to
you<00:03:24.840> can<00:03:24.959> just<00:03:24.989> measure<00:03:25.350> two<00:03:25.680> inches<00:03:25.709> over

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
you can just measure two inches over

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.430 
you can just measure two inches over
here<00:03:30.950> type<00:03:31.950> in

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
here type in

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.080 
here type in
I'll<00:03:33.830> actually<00:03:34.040> look<00:03:34.310> on<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.550> bottom<00:03:34.880> I'm

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
I'll actually look on the bottom I'm

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.520 
I'll actually look on the bottom I'm
sorry

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.650 

so<00:03:38.130> I'll<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.640> actual<00:03:39.030> bottom<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
so I'll get the actual bottom of the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.480 
so I'll get the actual bottom of the
pattern<00:03:40.490> has<00:03:41.490> two<00:03:41.910> inches<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> top

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
pattern has two inches and on the top

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.680 
pattern has two inches and on the top
since<00:03:47.490> it's<00:03:47.640> going<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.820> be<00:03:47.910> three<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.270> just<00:03:48.450> go

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
since it's going to be three I just go

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.340 
since it's going to be three I just go
down<00:03:49.580> one<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.760> half<00:03:50.910> inches<00:03:51.390> from<00:03:52.200> this

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
down one and a half inches from this

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.450 
down one and a half inches from this
part

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.770 

and<00:04:00.460> they<00:04:00.670> fold<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.210> because<00:04:01.450> I'm<00:04:01.540> going<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.690> be

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
and they fold it because I'm going to be

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.070 
and they fold it because I'm going to be
cutting<00:04:02.020> these<00:04:02.860> two<00:04:03.190> pieces<00:04:03.430> these<00:04:03.910> two<00:04:04.810> sides

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
cutting these two pieces these two sides

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.320 
cutting these two pieces these two sides
at<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.350> same<00:04:05.560> time

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.490 

matching<00:04:10.330> those<00:04:10.480> pins<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.170> cut

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.860 

okay<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:19.769> since<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.640> same<00:04:20.910> it's<00:04:21.720> gonna

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
okay and since it's the same it's gonna

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.620 
okay and since it's the same it's gonna
be<00:04:21.989> symmetrical<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.740> can<00:04:22.920> just<00:04:23.390> fold<00:04:24.390> this

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
be symmetrical so I can just fold this

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:33.770 
be symmetrical so I can just fold this
over<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:26.300> pin<00:04:29.450> at<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.480> points<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:33.180> line<00:04:33.540> up

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
over and pin at the points that line up

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.620 
over and pin at the points that line up
at<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.050> other<00:04:34.140> side<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.970> can<00:04:36.000> pin<00:04:36.330> all<00:04:36.510> the

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
at the other side you can pin all the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.120 
at the other side you can pin all the
way<00:04:36.750> through<00:04:37.050> see<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.440> have<00:04:37.620> your<00:04:37.740> holes<00:04:37.920> in

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
way through see you have your holes in

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.750 
way through see you have your holes in
the<00:04:38.220> back<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:39.180> if<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.360> flip<00:04:39.600> it<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.640> you'll<00:04:41.640> be

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
the back so if you flip it and you'll be

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
the back so if you flip it and you'll be
able<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.090> cut<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:43.290> part

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.010 

so<00:04:58.780> that's<00:04:59.020> your<00:04:59.460> your<00:05:00.460> master<00:05:01.030> gusset<00:05:01.840> you

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
so that's your your master gusset you

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.320 
so that's your your master gusset you
can<00:05:02.169> also<00:05:02.350> check<00:05:02.800> your<00:05:02.979> measurement<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:04.180> make

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
can also check your measurement to make

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.960 
can also check your measurement to make
sure<00:05:04.540> it's<00:05:04.690> correct<00:05:05.010> by<00:05:06.010> walking<00:05:06.520> it<00:05:06.639> again

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
sure it's correct by walking it again

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.520 
sure it's correct by walking it again
it'll<00:05:07.270> just<00:05:07.570> doesn't<00:05:07.840> take<00:05:07.990> very<00:05:08.020> long<00:05:08.229> you

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
it'll just doesn't take very long you

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.340 
it'll just doesn't take very long you
just<00:05:08.560> kind<00:05:08.919> of<00:05:09.030> line<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.210> up

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.610 

just<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.130> make<00:05:16.280> sure<00:05:16.640> everything<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.620> gonna

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
just to make sure everything is gonna

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.760 
just to make sure everything is gonna
fit<00:05:19.040> because<00:05:19.280> then<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:19.550> don't<00:05:19.700> have<00:05:19.820> to<00:05:20.770> redo

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
fit because then you don't have to redo

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.700 
fit because then you don't have to redo
it

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.270 

yeah<00:05:26.220> it's<00:05:26.669> perfect<00:05:27.449> it<00:05:28.169> lines<00:05:28.530> up<00:05:28.770> perfect

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
yeah it's perfect it lines up perfect

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.100 
yeah it's perfect it lines up perfect
right<00:05:29.430> there

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
right there

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.110 
right there
so<00:05:31.110> that's<00:05:31.289> your<00:05:31.440> gusset<00:05:31.680> pattern<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.550> if<00:05:33.000> you

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
so that's your gusset pattern and if you

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.120 
so that's your gusset pattern and if you
also<00:05:33.240> want<00:05:33.509> to<00:05:33.539> not<00:05:33.750> do<00:05:33.960> your<00:05:34.110> notch<00:05:34.320> here<00:05:34.710> in

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
also want to not do your notch here in

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.350 
also want to not do your notch here in
the<00:05:35.250> center<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:35.789> you<00:05:35.820> always<00:05:36.030> know<00:05:36.330> where

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
the center so you always know where

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.340 
the center so you always know where
you're<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.770> middle<00:05:38.039> of<00:05:38.100> your<00:05:38.250> bag<00:05:38.430> is<00:05:39.080> so<00:05:40.080> very

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
you're the middle of your bag is so very

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.830 
you're the middle of your bag is so very
small<00:05:40.470> knotch

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
small knotch

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.629 
small knotch
okay<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:43.910> then<00:05:44.910> you<00:05:45.060> mark<00:05:45.330> your<00:05:45.800> pattern<00:05:46.800> this

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
okay and then you mark your pattern this

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:54.260 
okay and then you mark your pattern this
is<00:05:47.880> the<00:05:48.979> master<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:51.030> it's<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.360> gusset<00:05:53.090> okay<00:05:54.090> and

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
is the master and it's a gusset okay and

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.830 
is the master and it's a gusset okay and
you<00:05:54.360> just<00:05:54.509> cut<00:05:54.780> one<00:05:55.160> okay<00:05:56.160> and<00:05:56.449> the<00:05:57.449> bag<00:05:57.630> is

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
you just cut one okay and the bag is

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.409 
you just cut one okay and the bag is
called<00:05:58.080> demo<00:05:58.470> one<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:58.919> that's<00:05:59.729> riedesel<00:06:00.090> is

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
called demo one and that's riedesel is

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.860 
called demo one and that's riedesel is
going<00:06:00.660> that's<00:06:00.900> going<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.139> be<00:06:01.289> wrapping<00:06:02.099> around

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
going that's going to be wrapping around
