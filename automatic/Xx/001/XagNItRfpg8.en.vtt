00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
should get a picture of len lube but the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.570 
should get a picture of len lube but the
powers<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:59.060> our<00:03:00.060> friend<00:03:00.450> over<00:03:00.690> one<00:03:01.410> yeah<00:03:02.310> and

powers of our friend over one yeah and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.330 
powers of our friend over one yeah and
then<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.450> third<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.080> stand<00:03:04.290> one<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:05.040> pick

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
then the third on the stand one you pick

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.260 
then the third on the stand one you pick
sapper<00:03:05.970> sapper<00:03:06.810> out<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.920> then<00:03:08.700> you

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
sapper sapper out here and then you

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.360 
sapper sapper out here and then you
scroll<00:03:09.780> down<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.990> vulnerability<00:03:12.990> and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
scroll down to and vulnerability and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.550 
scroll down to and vulnerability and
then<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.300> fifth<00:03:15.450> power<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.230> should<00:03:16.530> be

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
then on the fifth power it should be

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.880 
then on the fifth power it should be
earth<00:03:17.370> shaker<00:03:17.540> then<00:03:18.540> bombard<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.650> should

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
earth shaker then bombard this should

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.070 
earth shaker then bombard this should
come<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.810> then<00:03:22.790> on<00:03:23.790> your<00:03:24.390> seventh<00:03:24.780> power

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
come up and then on your seventh power

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.770 
come up and then on your seventh power
it<00:03:25.380> should<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.770> like<00:03:26.070> this<00:03:26.180> battle<00:03:27.180> rage<00:03:27.360> acts

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
it should be like this battle rage acts

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.480 
it should be like this battle rage acts
through<00:03:28.170> improved<00:03:28.680> supper<00:03:29.280> and
