coming<00:00:01.380> but<00:00:01.800> it<00:00:02.010> looks<00:00:02.220> like<00:00:02.280> it's<00:00:02.550> here<00:00:02.700> at

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
coming but it looks like it's here at

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.550 
coming but it looks like it's here at
last<00:00:02.820> well<00:00:03.540> fingers<00:00:03.720> crossed<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.170> think<00:00:04.350> we're

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
last well fingers crossed I think we're

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.249 
last well fingers crossed I think we're
all<00:00:04.650> pretty<00:00:04.680> positive<00:00:05.250> now<00:00:05.670> as<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.899> say<00:00:07.080> it's

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
all pretty positive now as you say it's

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.650 
all pretty positive now as you say it's
had<00:00:07.589> its<00:00:07.770> little<00:00:08.069> rollercoaster<00:00:08.400> ride<00:00:08.910> but<00:00:08.940> I

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
had its little rollercoaster ride but I

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.470 
had its little rollercoaster ride but I
think<00:00:10.469> every<00:00:10.679> key<00:00:11.580> factor<00:00:12.120> now<00:00:12.240> as<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
think every key factor now as the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.030 
think every key factor now as the
stakeholders<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.080> all<00:00:13.200> behind<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.710> know<00:00:13.889> we

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
stakeholders are all behind it I know we

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.599 
stakeholders are all behind it I know we
had<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.000> or<00:00:15.360> two<00:00:15.389> at<00:00:15.719> different<00:00:16.020> times<00:00:16.609> that

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
had one or two at different times that

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.670 
had one or two at different times that
not<00:00:17.820> being<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> hundred<00:00:18.600> percent<00:00:18.660> back<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.619> it

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
not being a hundred percent back to it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.929 
not being a hundred percent back to it
but<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.189> understand<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> philosophy

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
but now they understand the philosophy

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.000 
but now they understand the philosophy
and<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.660> seems<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.230> everyone<00:00:22.859> is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and all that it seems that everyone is

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.609 
and all that it seems that everyone is
fully<00:00:23.939> supported<00:00:24.150> Dave<00:00:24.990> Sheepshanks<00:00:25.470> been

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
fully supported Dave Sheepshanks been

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.380 
fully supported Dave Sheepshanks been
working<00:00:26.160> hard<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.789> particular<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
working hard on that in particular and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.320 
working hard on that in particular and
so<00:00:28.320> we're<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.800> pretty<00:00:29.010> sure<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:30.090> going

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
so we're all pretty sure that it's going

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.429 
so we're all pretty sure that it's going
to<00:00:30.390> happen<00:00:30.480> obviously<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.019> sensitive

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to happen obviously got the sensitive

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.500 
to happen obviously got the sensitive
plan<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.700> i<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> local

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
plan in but i think the local

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.060 
plan in but i think the local
authorities<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.140> local<00:00:34.469> community<00:00:35.040> i

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
authorities and a local community i

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.260 
authorities and a local community i
think<00:00:35.130> would<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.850> happen<00:00:36.090> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
think would like to see it happen and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.720 
think would like to see it happen and
then<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> tender<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.550> time

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
then go out to tender because good time

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.729 
then go out to tender because good time
to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> pricing<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.260> we'd<00:00:40.590> like

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
to do that for the pricing and we'd like

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.549 
to do that for the pricing and we'd like
to<00:00:40.920> think<00:00:41.070> they're<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.750> late<00:00:42.750> autumn<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to think they're up here late autumn and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
to think they're up here late autumn and
away<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.280> where<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:44.879> completion<00:00:45.450> when

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
away and where do we see completion when

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.819 
away and where do we see completion when
do<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.379> think<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.800> be

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
do we think that I think it would be

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.850 
do we think that I think it would be
first<00:00:47.520> half<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.420> 212<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.230> probably<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
first half of 212 you know probably I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.119 
first half of 212 you know probably I
mean<00:00:50.399> ideally<00:00:50.960> like<00:00:51.960> Easter<00:00:52.320> time<00:00:52.500> before<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
mean ideally like Easter time before I

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
mean ideally like Easter time before I
suppose<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.239> you've<00:00:54.390> got<00:00:54.480> European

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
suppose because you've got European

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.560 
suppose because you've got European
Championships<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> summer<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.570> hopefully

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
Championships that summer and hopefully

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.880 
Championships that summer and hopefully
would<00:00:57.719> qualify<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.440> also<00:00:58.710> he<00:00:58.770> got

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
would qualify by then and also he got

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.470 
would qualify by then and also he got
the<00:00:59.010> Olympic<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> got<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.820> double

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the Olympic so you got a double

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.920 
the Olympic so you got a double
tournament<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.079> summer<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.789> yeah<00:01:02.930> it's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
tournament that summer but yeah it's

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.890 
tournament that summer but yeah it's
then<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:06.030> open<00:01:06.720> by

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
then they would like to see a open by

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.690 
then they would like to see a open by
the<00:01:06.960> first<00:01:07.170> half<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.470> 212<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.610> just

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the first half of 212 and it's not just

I mean it's an interesting
administrators<00:01:17.490> referees<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.240> look

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
administrators referees but if you look

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.090 
administrators referees but if you look
at<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.570> from<00:01:18.659> coaching<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.619> players<00:01:19.799> point<00:01:19.979> of

at it from coaching and players point of
view<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.250> might<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.850> initially<00:01:21.240> emphasis<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> on

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
view I might my initially emphasis it on

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.410 
view I might my initially emphasis it on
the<00:01:21.900> coaching<00:01:22.110> side<00:01:22.380> because<00:01:22.880> yeah<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.030> want

good players to come but we believe it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
good players to come but we believe it
it<00:01:27.060> comes<00:01:27.330> out<00:01:27.540> improving<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> quality<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it comes out improving the quality of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
it comes out improving the quality of
the<00:01:28.770> coaches<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.250> work<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:30.180> the

the coaches that work and we know the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210 
the coaches that work and we know the
time<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> used<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.650> come<00:01:31.860> over<00:01:31.890> from
