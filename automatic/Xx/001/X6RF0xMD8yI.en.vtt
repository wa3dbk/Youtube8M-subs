00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.800 
off a flywheel i believe so it's only
making<00:02:05.110> about<00:02:05.259> 530<00:02:05.979> or<00:02:06.130> 540<00:02:06.940> horsepower<00:02:07.119> which

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
making about 530 or 540 horsepower which

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.570 
making about 530 or 540 horsepower which
is<00:02:07.929> plenty<00:02:08.229> surprisingly<00:02:09.190> because<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.520> the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
is plenty surprisingly because of the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
perfect s100 in this car now that I've

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.640

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
have the suspension on it is probably

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.360 
have the suspension on it is probably
one<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:20.980> my<00:02:21.100> favorite<00:02:21.640> handle

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
drift cars in the game bar none um you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.589 
drift cars in the game bar none um you
know<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:27.830> not<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> like<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> Corvette<00:02:29.209> or

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
know it's not like a like a Corvette or

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.490 
know it's not like a like a Corvette or
camaro<00:02:30.140> or<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:31.250> mustang<00:02:31.909> boss<00:02:32.299> where<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.349> can

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
camaro or a mustang boss where you can

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.009 
camaro or a mustang boss where you can
hold<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.860> at<00:02:33.980> ridiculous<00:02:34.610> angles<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.599> you

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
hold it at ridiculous angles and you

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.869 
hold it at ridiculous angles and you
know<00:02:36.140> because<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> big<00:02:36.799> fat<00:02:37.010> tired<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.700> I

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
know because of the big fat tired this I

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.550 
know because of the big fat tired this I
think<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.120> only<00:02:38.180> has<00:02:38.390> like<00:02:38.540> 295<00:02:39.079> s<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.409> back

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
think it only has like 295 s in the back

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.770 
think it only has like 295 s in the back
so<00:02:40.099> those<00:02:40.280> compared<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.940> other<00:02:41.090> cars<00:02:41.360> are<00:02:41.629> not

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
so those compared to other cars are not

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.770 
so those compared to other cars are not
massive<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.709> know<00:02:42.860> um<00:02:43.730> it's<00:02:44.360> not<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.569> God

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
massive you know um it's not a God

doesn't have a lot of horsepower you

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.100 
doesn't have a lot of horsepower you
know<00:02:46.430> it's<00:02:46.610> it's<00:02:46.760> probably<00:02:47.239> not<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> fast<00:02:47.810> car

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110
