00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 um 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.470
 my name is to open it fridman I am the 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.450
 director of the design degree 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.190
 graphic of the science faculty of the 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.110
 open university communication 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.060
 inter-American my intention is 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.680
 invite them to know a little about what 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.029
 deals with our career and what are the 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.550
 benefits of studying in our 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.890
 La Terre University is organized in 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.270
 two cycles is a three- year cycle in 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.790
 where they would be receiving a degree 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.739
 graphic designer and then taking a 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.690
 year more plus being a final work of 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.210
 theses would be receiving from graduates 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.920
 graphic design them this title 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.690
 allows to work in all areas of 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.980
 design this is for example the design 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.290
 editorial that is book design 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.329
 journals inserts any of 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.820
 the branches of the printed design of a 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.920
 interesting technological modern way and 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.840
 to arrive in a correct way at 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.489
 consumer another of the branches that we are going to 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.530
 address is the product and packaging 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.820
 called packaging where the designer 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.830
 is going to take care of the whole part 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.300
 communicational design of these 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.160
 packaging this is how to do the most 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.780
 eye-catching how to make people 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.039
 be interested in that container when you see it 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.570
 in the gondola in front of the competition 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.950
 how to make it lodge 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.110
 correctly to the product that is 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.549
 inside it another one of the branches of the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.750
 design is what is called design for 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.610
 education or design 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.770
 information where what we do for 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.450
 example are student manuals manuals 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.490
 as to make it more practical 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.830
 use of a cell phone or the use of a 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.479
 VCR or one of those things that 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.920
 they are very complicated to use because they do not 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.930
 a designer vehicles dow the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.300
 information another of the branches that 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.950
 we approach is what is called signage 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.479
 and it has to do with how to signal 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.970
 spaces that can be opened or 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.320
 closed from how to handle us in a 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.390
 highway to know what are the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.240
 maximum speeds the minimums to what 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.880
 handle us and this implies by 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.250
 supposedly save lives and on the other hand 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.750
 also in small spaces or spaces 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.610
 internal as it can be a room 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.380
 hospital where one arrives with a 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.030
 particular anxiety for example I want 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.710
 Go to cardiology but not 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.600
 understands where to go simply 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.729
 because the signs are badly placed 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.289
 or are poorly designed all this does 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.789
 the designer like to vehiculate the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.890
 information that this was given from a 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.200
 way better and more interesting for the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.459
 user well another of the ladies we're going 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.080
 to cover is the one that has to do with 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.370
 web pages and it's not just the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.709
 web page design where 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.959
 specifically we see tools of 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.489
 design from the programs that we are going to 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.010
 address throughout the career as 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.769
 They may be 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.810
 corel the index in the face maker the 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.209
 photoshop but also what we're going 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.129
 to do is see the specific programs 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.989
 as flash for animation or dream 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.430
 bolívar to hang them on the web of such 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.739
 way that you cover all the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.569
 technological areas another of the legs of 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.010
 the race sits in the programs 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.569
 humanities that have to do with the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.640
 art history psychology the 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.500
 philosophy to know the profile well 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.709
 of the consumer that we are 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.390
 directing finally appears all the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.849
 artistic part that has to see from 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.950
 the drawing workshop the morphology the 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.209
 communication and vision this refers to 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.340
 the plastic aspects of the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.620
 visual communication color management 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.090
 of the shape of space this is 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.220
 accompanied also by the study of 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.930
 typography that is the study of the letter 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.700
 in all its dimensions from the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.530
 historical questions of how we write 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.629
 why do we write what kind of letters 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.250
 we use and they communicate up to 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.840
 supports techniques and materials 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.120
 they used from antiquity to 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.099
 our days in our title is very 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.349
 is going to be given over time the 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.959
 career started in 1998 and at this time 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.150
 the design of web pages did not exist without 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.800
 But now it was added and in the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.300
 As the race continues 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.890
 being and that the market keeps asking 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.330
 designers we are adding new 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.550
 subjects of such way of being 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.380
 always with the technological vanguard and 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.200
 We expect many communication 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.690
 thanks the cosmovision of the foundation 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.600
 educational vanguard in development 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.820
 of the pedagogical system for netbook a 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 through the open university 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:57.050
 Interamericanism is of a humanist character 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.200
 and its epistemological approach in all the 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.860
 science that calls the uai style 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.340
 pedagogue in all his careers the web 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.190
 has internship programs since 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.690
 the first year of study in companies 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.790
 multinationals so that the student can 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.040
 be incorporated immediately in the

 functional our students in addition 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.110
 they are inserted into the world through 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.710
 agreements 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.650
 with American and European universities 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.830
 that facilitate their improvement and the 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.590
 professional exercise in another country 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.660
 the vaneduc pedagogical approach involves 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.700
 from the activities and 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.660
 concrete problems of each

 curricular units to transfer it 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.850
 to solving problems and 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.460
 develop through research 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:20.080
 new proposals that install or 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.200
 develop critical thinking 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.600
