00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.269
 This is the Dacia Sandero model 2013 and 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.700
 this particular unit 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.039
 carries the diesel engine 1.5 of 6 of 90 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.010
 horses what you want to teach in this 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:21.359
 video is like lighting in your headlights 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.550
 let's go there I start the engine and 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.830
 I connect the lights 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.189
 right now with regular in your position 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.710
 of maximum height which is the most appropriate 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.100
 to travel with little load in this case 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.309
 I go alone and this inferior position is 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.900
 to circulate at full load you see 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.339
 clearly the contrast between a 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.339
 position and other 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.210
 a peculiarity of these headlights is that 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.140
 they have h4 bulbs that implies having 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.210
 good bulbs h4 those light bulbs 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.300
 They contain two filaments 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.839
 a filament makes the light function of 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.020
 short reach and the other filament does 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.940
 the function of road light or lights 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.130
 long 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.440
 this type of light bulb implies that 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.280
 when we put long-range lights 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.460
 what are these the filament of 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.200
 short-range light 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 there we have it I think it looks 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.310
 clearly 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.860
 what happens is that we lose 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.369
 luminosity close and we win it at 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.619
 far good let's see what this implies 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.619
 what does this mean on the road 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.000
 I do not know if the odometer looks good 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.780
 but I will go from time to time singing the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.370
 speed at which we circulate good 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.370
 we left the usual road 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.550
 we are already 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.690
 and well and now we go to 50 for now 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.820
 let's see a little bit of speed in 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.820
 as much as possible up to 90 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.030
 well we get to 90 per hour and we go in 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.890
 short-range lights and good what 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.130
 we can say of those lights is that to give 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.020
 a normal a little yellowish but it's 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.760
 something completely normal since they are 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:29.390
 halogen lights and this does let's say that 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.490
 it's normal now let's see what happens 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.140
 when we connect long these are the 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.960
 long here we can see the contrast 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.330
 between the air in long and short 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.920
 and when we put long what happens is 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.080
 that we lose luminosity 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.990
 we lose a lot of light right in front of the 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.120
 car because good because because as 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.750
 we have said before the filament that makes 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.080
 the light function of 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.030
 short range is switched off and only 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.950
 the big one is connected the long one 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.910
 reach therefore we lose a lot of light 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.220
 right in front of the car but neither is 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.910
 critical because because what good 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.880
 we look for in this occasion is to see far and 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.380
 I think that more or less the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.210
 as is 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.170
 road lighting 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.010
 is a 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.130
 it's a bit intense but it's 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:33.980
 sufficiently broad and sufficiently 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.980
 long with short of those are long 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.870
 because when it is put into the coffers it goes out 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.430
 the short-range filament good then 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.609
 I do not know for sure but I imagine 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.750
 I imagine it is so that the lamp does not 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.750
 reaches excessive temperature 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.100
 and you can then melt these echoes 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.320
 they do as a security measure 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.660
 and it is common for all the sanpara 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.020
 4 at least for all those that 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.020
 I know 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.220
 long 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.540
 short 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.540
 in this way a little faster we go 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.620
 to roll around 100 per hour more or 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.729
 less 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.729
 and we're going to 100 per hour 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.700
 this engine moves the car very well and 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.780
 well we go in short and now I put 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.780
 long to see the contrast 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.630
 here we have it 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.430
 and what is my opinion about these lights 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.550
 by opinion on health is that 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.600
 are at the height of gold minus the 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.600
 height of the rest of the car 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.810
 and they are completely consistent with the 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:05.550
 price of this model remember the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:09.770
 dacia sandero the base price of the trail 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.770
 is well below 10 thousand euros 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.479
 and below that price level is 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.330
 hard to find a car with the 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.139
 clearly better lighting than the one 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.139
 offers this model
