00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.180
 Greetings and welcome today how gray I am 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.700
 he said back to a post that there was 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.650
 released prior to defend since 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.320
 is being attacked and passing 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.300
 we will get the bronze trophy 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.179
 relatively easy to get 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.070
 pretty easy defender the only thing that 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.050
 we must do is repel fairy and enemy 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.029
 eliminating those and once we have a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.070
 number of casualties our position will return to 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.169
 normal to not skip 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.329
 trophy we should do this three times 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.189
 it's that simple and as he said 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.859
 before, the 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.120
 difficulty to get it the funny thing 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.559
 of all this is that if you move away 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.780
 too much of a position that is being 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.300
 attacked then lets us defend it by 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.940
 course and in principle I should go back to 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.649
 enemy hands however it is not like that and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.600
 I think for a better experience of 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.879
 game what you would have to do to 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.519
 to recover it is to release it again from 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.589
 again once I knew this I already had the 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.850
 trophy I many times worried 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.980
 every time he was being a position 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.629
 attacked although good is a good 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.210
 opportunity to get something from 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.489
 money and also of objects looting 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.380
 the enemies apart also from getting 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.730
 the defending trophy we can take advantage of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.290
 this situation for 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.110
 get another one of the trophies that you 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.080
 call flames to me that we have to finish 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.820
 with 50 enemies with fire once 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.650
 let's have our position defended by 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.780
 complete will call us one of our 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.260
 allies we approach him we interact 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.940
 and it will give us some money 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.410
 now I leave you with a little my lack of 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.570
 video that's all 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.890
 I hope I helped you, I say goodbye 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 the next video 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.270
 we could have lost this post 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.270
 Thank you 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.590
 with you, take this, thank you very much 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.649
 good 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.649
 OK OK
