00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.300
 maycroft deshin everyone's favorite card 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.140
 rules and it is almost no different 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.670
 from the computer version to me very 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.940

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.330
 map 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.860
 for those who do not know what it is 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.150

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.549
 4 layer of earth to the ground and here is limited 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 this world does not seem to be generated 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.680
 all the most get damn I lost my 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.140
 task sheet okay from memory 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.770
 I will do the first task 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.490
 generator 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.020

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.140
 it was very file I will tell you 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.990
 I hope this series will be normal 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:17.440
 as you can see I made good graphics 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:22.760
 there is a detailed so that everything was beautiful 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.040
 the second task here you need some kind of bridge 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.810
 do give another island 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.700

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:14.510
 little stone but probably end up on 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:21.519

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.519

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.110
 I will continue to pass this card to 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.830
 Unfortunately, I do not know what to talk about 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:06.690
 that I will talk a little here 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:13.350
 basically you need to look well, I wanted you 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:14.900
 there to jump the pancake along the generators 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.880
 I will have wood 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:29.160
 I am interested in it does not burn or 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:34.620
 but from lava okay damn that's just one 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:37.320
 What is missing is nothing else to take 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.060
 well, right here I will have both 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.690
 have formed a stone then you only need to 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.990
 made a hole 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:05:00.480
 no, it is not necessary as this all happens me 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:05:03.030
 I do not remember damn cho for garbage about exactly 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:08.300
 let's compare on the sides on the sides they are not 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:13.980
 so need a pancake here this car jump 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:18.330
 a little interfere here small here 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.129
 here we put the water here just right 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:29.039
 what i wanted 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:36.409
 I am lucky I am very lucky so let's just 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:39.449
 let's drop 20 probably stones and make a bridge 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:42.360
 although what 20 let's do 10 because 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:46.249
 that 20 digging arrears I passed close 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:58.039
 dig and you for hollow watch it all 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:06:07.159
 in total 8 9 10 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:07.159
 it seems to me that the island is there 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:20.999
 no flies no there nothing no let's here 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:26.610
 so we will expand our island and drip more 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:29.809
 a little stone guys but this series will 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.929
 very short but because she 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:34.619

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:44.159

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:58.409
 to hammer on her i think everyone will want to 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:59.149
 I ask her, okay, everybody thanks for
