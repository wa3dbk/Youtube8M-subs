00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.629
 and what happens people I am re goye and today we have 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.609
 returned to the map of beer and soda and rice 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.860
 how do you want to call him to teach you 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.500
 how to activate music on this map 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.750
 then you need 3,000 250 points 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.699
 you open the first door of the map that 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.769
 you have seen a little bit fast, jump by 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.990
 the hole and here we find the 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.550
 first little bear this has gone a little fast 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.989
 but it's very easy you just have to 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.179
 open the door to jump through the hole 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.349
 on the left and there you will find the 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.539
 first bear you have seen before 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.510
 now it would be to follow this route 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.820
 go down to the bottom of the map throw yourself 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.190
 for all the ramps come down all 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.050
 the ins and outs and the truth is that this 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.460
 it's quite interesting because good 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.950
 you see there are quite a few alleys and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.060
 quite some routes that in principle 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.370
 good you have to go around 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.740
 find them this would be one of them that 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.600
 you have to go jumping here de decombro 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.150
 in rubble until you reach the plant more 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.860
 low and calm because if you jump well 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.750
 Moris you not only you have to fijaros 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.130
 fix a bit but no problem 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.990
 then this would be the penultimate is the 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.089
 last there and well then we would already be 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.400
 on the lowest floor now here would have 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.310
 to get another sofa that is this from here 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.070
 That's 750 points, that's why I'm telling you 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.110
 total points are 3 thousand 250 and 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.760
 well here we would come to this room and 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.920
 at the bottom up to the right, because 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.130
 you see the teddy bear this is the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.080
 second you give with the button on the x in 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.030
 the xbox is the reload button and in 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.130
 playstation 3 it would be the square 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.320
 for when the map comes out then good 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.720
 that would be the second stuffed toy we went up 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.880
 this kind of collapsed column and here 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.370
 we would have another door that costs 1000 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.520
 points and then we would have the last 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.770
 that are 750 again it is already the room of the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.040
 electricity and here we would have the last 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.810
 stuffed so you do not give anything to the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.280
 button and you can activate the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.110
 electricity if you want as you see in 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.670
 less than two minutes we got it 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.740
 the most complicated thing is to get two 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.760
 points so nothing here I leave you a little 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.500
 listen to the background song 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.119
 remember that as always like favorites 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.100
 if you liked it helped me a lot 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.240
 spread the videos so nothing what 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.619
 I said I hope you liked it and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.619
 see you in the next goodbye 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.270
 private 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.840
 clear that this component is part of 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.849
 something else but from you 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.500
 if you love yourself in a simple matter 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.500
 fix this to that 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.410
 but the thing
