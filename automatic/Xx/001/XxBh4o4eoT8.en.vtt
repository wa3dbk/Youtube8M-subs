00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
i had seen some other videos and the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.249 
i had seen some other videos and the
other<00:02:04.799> boxes<00:02:05.159> were<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> same<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.899> however<00:02:06.899> my

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
other boxes were the same way however my

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.559 
other boxes were the same way however my
guess<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.740> maybe<00:02:08.039> possibly<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> first

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
guess is maybe possibly like the first

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.110 
guess is maybe possibly like the first
wave<00:02:09.840> maybe<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.190> know<00:02:11.310> miss<00:02:11.610> packaged

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
wave maybe it's you know miss packaged

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.640 
wave maybe it's you know miss packaged
or<00:02:12.270> whatever

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
or whatever

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.130 
or whatever

and later on we'll start seeing them

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.319 
and later on we'll start seeing them
package<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.010> other<00:02:16.159> way<00:02:16.310> I'm<00:02:16.790> not<00:02:17.120> too

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329
