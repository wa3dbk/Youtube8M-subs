00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:15.170
 We're good at introducing the new 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.050
 are 1.30 f500 which brings a lot function 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.840
 important in that he had a lot of work 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.720
 involved test that is the correction of 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.910
 mesh closed by good probe 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.699
 first I 'll show you a little how it is 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.130
 configures this function 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.050
 for when you update the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.510
 500 software already out 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.940
 using reminiscing to make the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.330
 update you can press e-click 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.059
 tools quickly and it will already open 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.760
 screen is the update that even has 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.460
 a detailed list of all functions 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.150
 that encompasses this new version and you can 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.830
 read these functions calmly here 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.869
 click refresh and wait for the 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.670
 important process you always do with your 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.989
 laptop battery charger 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.960
 connected 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.440
 once it is updated it will 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.799
 activate it will open will introduce the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.650
 closed on the map already 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.450
 disabled good to enable it is 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.220
 It is important to check the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.010
 settings and check that they are 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.540
 contemplate the desired application 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.610
 the first thing if you click enable and 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.710
 there we have parameters here that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.050
 begins as the minimum temperature for 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.550
 activate a closed area or in this case 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.630
 If you are using 30 degree 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.190
 engine temperature 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.650
 so every time a proposal of 30 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.520
 degrees he is now free to do 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.700
 the closed suitcase there is an 11 item that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.640
 calls your achievement for low load 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.130
 which is a number that actually 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.290
 the softer the number and will stay 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.960
 at low idle speed 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.600
 probe correction so if you have a car 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 for example a probe well away from the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.229
 leakage or sometimes even a stroller 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 the probe in the middle of the car rolling behind 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.520
 the car in general needs to smooth the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.970
 in the area closed by the time of 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.280
 delay it is from reading the probe 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.640
 in this case the highest value around 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.870
 25 then 30 for example if you have a 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.090
 car that has really good subject matter 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.090
 close to the engine or have a response 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.400
 faster than usual and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.560
 taking too long to reach the target 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.550
 probe can use smaller values 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.840
 here 56 and so on until you get one with 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.580
 this option from cet 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.080
 without passing the target and at the same time 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.220
 reaching him at a suitable time 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.370
 then we have a parameter of 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.129
 forest control lock closed 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.140
 if you wish, for example, that you do not 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.000
 example below 2000 rpm 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.220
 the closed loop can activate this 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.049
 here and change and repress and become 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.660
 normally used for home where by 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.400
 example the idle of the car does not 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.110
 has an accurate reading of the probe 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.090
 by the valve control or 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.120
 by the position of the open exhaust probe 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.629
 or any other option you no longer have 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.730
 closed uncertain rotation in same way 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.530
 if you have an option to turn off the control 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.480
 above another vote 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.730
 so yes you can for some reason 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.340
 you want to have the control note closed 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.640
 for high money can be disabled 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.379
 he chooses the poll wants to deactivate him 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.430
 after that we have the limits of 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.530
 these are the percentages that the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.859
 closed loop retains authorization for 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.870
 correct on the map or we have a 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.579
 upper limit that is when as 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.230
 per cent of possible fuel and 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.180
 allowed a closed area to add 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.799
 on the map to reach the probe target 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.769
 so in this example here we used 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:47.019
 15% to 0 6/1 and from a bar to 3 bar of 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.940
 boost pressure and allows us 25% 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.889
 correction 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.680
 the lower limit is how many percent 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.569
 can be taken off the map and 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.519
 in this example you are using 5% 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.099
 in all tracks 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.780
 for example if you wish not to 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.720
 operate the closed loop in a given 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.099
 for example it is possible to come here and 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.579
 enter 0 for example and minus 10 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.620
 he is not allowed to neither 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.880
 draw fuel on the map above a 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.959
 for example 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.950
 then it is an example that can be done if 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.560
 fit it there 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.330
 and if you wish to change these 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.919
 pressure values here that are less 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.790
 a bar - 08 30 and 50 bar just click here 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.460
 editing axes 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.070
 This one has the points here to change 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.050
 for example I will not use 3/1 a dot 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.400
 here 1.2 bar and another point and 0.5 bar 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.890
 for example 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.050
 and then he creates new points here in an ok 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:53.600
 it already reschedule my table the 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.650
 last configuration parameter is a 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.780
 if you want to activate the closed loop with 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.150
 cutting or cutting cuts than 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.460
 tri steppe and steppe by mode 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.070
 renault for example usually a car 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.080
 with manual gearboxes that work 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.880
 already in the cut and the rotation already 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.850
 goes straight from the cut as soon as you step on the 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.380
 background is usually not if you do not 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.360
 use this disable closed loop 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.090
 at the moment a car with exchange 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.250
 automatic where the car has a converter 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.780
 of torque on the automatic 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.550
 that beat the converter to get on the 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.960
 cut and even when it comes in cut it 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.560
 actually has a very large load on the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.530
 exchange then cut is much more pleasant it 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.300
 normally used this function of having 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.230
 an enclosed area to really adjust 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.200
 well to male the mixture in the transbank a 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.330
 Once the closed loop is configured, the 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.900
 People have to indicate what the target is. 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.760
 of landa that we want for example 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.040
 a car in different situations 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.510
 here we have the example where I have 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.710
 9,000 rpm 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.930
 7 - only 5 thousand and 3 thousand rpm and here 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.750
 in the columns - it is with you low pressure 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.980
 of everything but r 300 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:10.340
 03 06 09 Inquirers as well as all 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.070
 the tables of the 500's come 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.750
 here editing axes you can change and 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.580
 You have a number of positions in this 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.610
 if here 16 points 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.260
 is 16 points to be able to change 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.330
 so if I want to include a 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.580
 higher resolution for example I want 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.660
 include a point at 2000 rpm 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.670
 only digit here he already does gift whom he 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.340
 ready you have now inserted a line in 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.080
 2011 has already calculated the 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.300
 interconnection between the two points here 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.010
 I did not have 0 88 says of landa 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.550
 and here we have 90 he created 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.410
 exactly in the middle with 10 89 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.990
 It's so good that we put it 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.340
 that it is the target of the closed mesh that 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.680
 she will get to fix the probe 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.040
 then in this example here in all this 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.800
 region here that is 06 boat up 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.640
 in all the votes a was chosen by 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.860
 example 0.75 netherlands 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.730
 in this column of 0.3 bar pressure 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.740
 0 turbine 78 years in this area that is 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.500
 an area thus taken up in an example 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:16.640
 of a street car from the audi q5 circuit 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:19.520
 quote rebate and half got caught with 50 82a here 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.760
 in the idle region eg 0 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:26.120
 88 when I already did a little more in 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.380
 low turnover to 85 and if giving 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.330
 really mark a situation of 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.240
 very low load that goes very 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.390
 3,000 rpm up road shares 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.160
 for example a car 90 for example in 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.750
 some other points had no way 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.840
 that to have a transition 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.720
 between them are basically 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.460
 Any value you want is just for 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.210
 I will not have just want to cause you to 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:53.390
 it two change this value put instead 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.530
 of 0 75 want to put 0 73 already have one 

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.190
 greater security 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:08:01.370
 he already did basically he will follow 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.460
 this target correction table 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.460
 closed
