00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.090
 the 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.090
 both the return 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.929
 just the gang 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.459
 a statement in traffic 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.689
 and 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.359
 for traffic 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.749
 however, it doesn't work 2 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.749
 I have to admit 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.669
 parent church 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.179
 I don't think so 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.380
 but they just do 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.410
 lÃ¶w you can do that 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.519
 with that goal 2 2 i am belgium 2 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.519
 also language it true 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.070
 the the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.960
 I am 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.080
 it sounds like the dot 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.080
 the remaining matches 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.500
 a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.280
 to get 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 one it extends 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.190
 if you cost 10 euros they can self 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.770
 develop my children 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.430
 the buyer found 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.340
 such a title 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.250
 but i play 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.900
 roj so the newest becomes the 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.060
 I look 13 if not then 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.450
 And not even there is always the police talking about it 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.830
 you buy an optimist 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.220
 at the uci 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.000
 That means that there is this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.860
 a little walk 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.040
 It feels 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.900
 this is right 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.990
 nice 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.280
 started soon 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.620
 when I got sick 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.390
 Sven Kramer spouts 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.530
 literally 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.330
 we had to do that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.440
 the choir 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.860
 the products partner beat the clock 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.380
 the cda had blocked at the kitchen 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.140
 I am not the president's newspaper that lottery tickets got a crook yet 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.329
 but just recovered I am currently in terms of 2 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:09.659
