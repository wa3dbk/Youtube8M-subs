00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
brushes one is from Brandon I have used

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.640 
brushes one is from Brandon I have used
this<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.030> probably<00:03:18.630> years<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.320> shouldn't

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
this for probably years I shouldn't

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.229 
this for probably years I shouldn't
throw<00:03:19.800> this<00:03:19.920> out<00:03:20.040> years<00:03:20.340> ago<00:03:20.610> but<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:20.940> really

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
throw this out years ago but it's really

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.180 
throw this out years ago but it's really
a<00:03:21.269> great<00:03:21.510> shape<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.200> like<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
a great shape and I really like it the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.590 
a great shape and I really like it the
other<00:03:23.340> one<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.550> from<00:03:23.760> Tarte<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.300> more<00:03:24.510> of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
other one is from Tarte this is more of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.210 
other one is from Tarte this is more of
a<00:03:24.690> dome<00:03:24.989> shape<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.620> really<00:03:25.769> depends<00:03:26.130> on

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
a dome shape so it really depends on

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.949 
a dome shape so it really depends on
what<00:03:26.370> you're<00:03:26.550> going<00:03:26.700> for<00:03:26.850> but<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.390> usually

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
what you're going for but I usually

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.150 
what you're going for but I usually
reach<00:03:28.110> for<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.350> band<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.650> I'm<00:03:28.769> also<00:03:28.920> not

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
reach for the band and I'm also not

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.500 
reach for the band and I'm also not
worried<00:03:29.519> about<00:03:29.670> traveling<00:03:29.940> with<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.330> or

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
worried about traveling with it or

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.180 
worried about traveling with it or
getting<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.050> squashed<00:03:31.560> because<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.100> is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
getting it like squashed because it is

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.550 
getting it like squashed because it is
so<00:03:32.340> old<00:03:32.750> but<00:03:33.750> I'm<00:03:33.810> gonna<00:03:33.959> take<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.440> my

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
so old but I'm gonna take it in my

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.770

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
simplicity's sake I don't like to clean

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.920 
simplicity's sake I don't like to clean
a<00:03:47.280> lot<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.580> brushes<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.300> is<00:03:48.420> what<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.600> use

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
a lot of brushes so this is what I use

a lot of brushes so this is what I use
but<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.410> would<00:03:49.620> recommend<00:03:49.739> using<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.519> um<00:03:50.760> you

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
but I would recommend using like um you

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.820 
but I would recommend using like um you
know<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.420> blender<00:03:51.870> brush<00:03:52.050> or<00:03:52.410> something<00:03:52.739> like

know a blender brush or something like

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.970 
know a blender brush or something like
that<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.640> way<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.900> don't<00:03:55.050> have<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.290> so

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
that so it that way you don't have is so

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.190 
that so it that way you don't have is so
that<00:03:56.220> way<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.550> don't<00:03:56.700> have<00:03:56.730> as<00:03:56.940> much<00:03:57.150> bulk<00:03:57.750> to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
that way you don't have as much bulk to

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.479 
that way you don't have as much bulk to
this<00:03:58.350> brush<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:58.980> doesn't<00:03:59.220> get<00:03:59.280> all<00:03:59.400> over

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
this brush and it doesn't get all over
