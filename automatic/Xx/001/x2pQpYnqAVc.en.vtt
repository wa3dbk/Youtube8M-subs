00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.059
 hardly anything is more beautiful than a night in 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.400
 free nature it right in a good 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.900
 But what counts is what counts 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.000
 there are lots of different models 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.949
 on the market as there once was one tunnel 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.519
 group counted then we have the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.039
 Geodesics and various special and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.050
 mixed forms such as one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.390
 rough counted for which one 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.309
 definitely decides the first 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.230
 field of application, however, too 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 personal preferences we are looking now 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.030
 So the best times the single models 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.440
 a bit closer to crumbly tents 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.200
 from two to three in a row 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 arranged rod allowed 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.260
 They are very easy for your size and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260
 let them build extremely easy 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.559
 Most tunnel tents stand out 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.539
 through a very good space utilization 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.670
 that means the side walls in the tent 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.350
 climb steeply up so much 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.070
 Place in shoulders he has and comfortable 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.229
 can sit 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.790
 the only disadvantage of tunnel tents 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.500
 is that you really credit them 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.270
 You should also be stable in the wind 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.740
 then stay put 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.450
 However, tunnel really did count 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.190
 use in residential areas 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.080
 that means three cultures in scandinavia 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.700
 for example or ideal for 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.149
 Lightweight tours that are on 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.520
 every gram arrives inset 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.200
 from two to three crossing each other in the zenith 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.300
 The rods bend and let themselves 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.500
 relatively easy even with a few 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.659
 build up herring 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.179
 the biggest advantage of dangling tent is 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.759
 that you have some on page 2 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.110
 so everyone has their own entrance 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.729
 and must not go over the other 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.729
 exceed if he gets out more at night 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.490
 must be ideal can be untangled 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.310
 Actually deploy on the tent site 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.600
 on treks as well as in the mountains knows 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.890
 I already with a few years 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.239
 Surely there are geodesic tents 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.069
 from many to crucify themselves several times 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.050
 The arches bend and form a very 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.599
 stable resistant scaffold 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.000
 This not only makes them very stable 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.009
 in the wind but they can also well 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.989
 Winter tours use the snow loads 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.670
 do not mind them that is 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.140
 if at night on this tent a lot 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.180
 snow falls then it will not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.580
 pressed in and you can calm down 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.920
 dodging disequilibrium of the geodesic 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.599
 camping is of course once the relative 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.150
 lengthy construction process of not synonymous 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.250
 The high weight is quite uncomplicated 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.670
 and of course a corresponding one 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.280
 Price ideal to use this 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.349
 Tents are best for winter tours 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.300
 expeditions or even store high for 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.629
 the home campsite and so on 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.220
 further they are less recommendable 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.980
 a bow counted first 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.849
 line to such hikers the most 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.340
 want to be lightweight 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.120
 and at night with little space 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.860
 get by 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.019
 the biggest advantage of these tents is 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.760
 the low weight the two persons 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.980
 Variations do not weigh up to two kilos 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.480
 one-person variants because of sometimes 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.190
 even under one kilo 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.690
 they are relatively easy to set up 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.710
 but have to be stretched wind well 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.660
 before you go for a model 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.830
 should also decide once the 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.220
 take a closer look at the details 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.710
 for example the storm voltage you 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.210
 make sure that the tent is strong 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.790
 still standing still stable 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.840
 but only if they are right on 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.070
 rods are also important 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.050
 The fans are fan inside 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.070
 for a pleasant climate when you are 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.040
 tent for example in rainy weather 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.709
 they should completely shut up 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.440
 be large and inside with 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.660
 mosquito net equipped so no 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.720
 annoying insects into the tent 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.980
 can get another important 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.870
 Outfitters are the hearings 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.640
 loop at least the four 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.880
 loops at the corners of the tent 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.110
 to be adjustable in length 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.730
 This makes them much more flexible 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.440
 construction of the tent if you have one 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.360
 stone in the ground you can have the 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.430
 simply place herring next to it and 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.510
 the need to compensate the loop 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.510
 do not move the whole tent 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.319
 especially important is the entrance 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.500
 he should be easy to operate 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:21.650
 and as far as possible also open this 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.330
 Must agree with you in the tent 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.639
 can get there and also out again 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.800
 and not on all fours in the match room 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.650
 So you have to crawl on everyone 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.600
 Fall down the tent before you go for it 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.690
 decide once and look 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.710
 the details exactly 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.780
 no matter which tent they were for 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.100
 It is important that you decide in the 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.130
 tent have enough space 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.770
 Therefore, calculate them as the minimum measure for the 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.570
 width of 55 centimeters per person 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.169
 want to have it comfortable now 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.389
 They even invest in 65 centimeters 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.550
 length of the tent depends on yours 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.220
 body size here they should be at least 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.410
 30 centimeters again on her size 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.630
 give it so that they are not lying 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.840
 with sleeping bag head or foot part in 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.479
 However, the tent can bump 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.250
 not necessarily everything about 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.470
 the real space ratio in the tent 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.550
 So look for yourself before you go 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.009
 decide on a model 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.250
 In any case, the tent from the inside 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.889
 exactly built on a wheel at the end 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.050
 before you go on tour with your new tent 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.599
 They should go at least once 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.610
 at home have rested around yourself 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.990
 to familiarize with the construction and around 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.330
 to control everything 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.099
 complete then you are on tour 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.099
 doggedly surprises immune
