00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
we'll start off with shipping its it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.910 
we'll start off with shipping its it
took<00:00:47.190> three<00:00:47.460> days<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> me<00:00:48.440> but<00:00:49.440> that's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
took three days to get to me but that's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100 
took three days to get to me but that's
usually<00:00:50.730> how<00:00:50.850> long<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.329> everything<00:00:51.870> takes

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
usually how long like everything takes

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.889 
usually how long like everything takes
when<00:00:52.920> you're<00:00:53.010> shipping<00:00:53.340> within<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> u.s.<00:00:53.940> so

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
when you're shipping within the u.s. so

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.479 
when you're shipping within the u.s. so
I<00:00:55.260> don't<00:00:55.469> know<00:00:55.559> unless<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.920> live<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> the

I don't know unless you live out of the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
I don't know unless you live out of the
United<00:00:56.879> States<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.079> probably<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
