00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
start with this one here so I'm going to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
start with this one here so I'm going to
load<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.350> onto<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> deck<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> hit<00:00:47.579> play<00:00:47.760> so

load this onto the deck and hit play so

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
load this onto the deck and hit play so
that<00:00:48.539> tune<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.899> now<00:00:49.079> playing<00:00:49.440> away<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that tune is now playing away there I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.060 
that tune is now playing away there I
could<00:00:51.120> look<00:00:51.300> by<00:00:51.629> swiping<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.590> tune<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
could look by swiping out the tune in a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
could look by swiping out the tune in a
little<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.340> more<00:00:53.460> detail<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
little bit more detail here so here is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
little bit more detail here so here is
the<00:00:55.170> tune<00:00:55.530> itself<00:00:55.920> or<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> BPM<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the tune itself or the BPM and a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.279 
the tune itself or the BPM and a
countdown<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> name<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.260> even

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
countdown and the name and so on even

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
countdown and the name and so on even
the<00:00:58.620> keys<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.910> down<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> bottom

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the keys there and down at the bottom

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.880 
the keys there and down at the bottom
here<00:01:00.600> we've<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> few<00:01:01.140> clever<00:01:01.500> bits<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
here we've got a few clever bits and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
here we've got a few clever bits and
pieces<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> tune<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
pieces that we can do with the tune so

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
pieces that we can do with the tune so
for<00:01:04.080> instance<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.680> choose<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> loop<00:01:05.640> length

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
for instance I can choose a loop length

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.300 
for instance I can choose a loop length
and<00:01:06.780> loop<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.650> now<00:01:07.799> looping<00:01:08.130> four

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and loop it that's now looping four

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
and loop it that's now looping four
beats<00:01:08.549> from<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> tune<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.630> reduce<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.200> for

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
beats from the tune and reduce it for

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.990 
beats from the tune and reduce it for
the<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.590> drumroll<00:01:10.799> effect<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.580> all

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the little drumroll effect that's all

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.940 
the little drumroll effect that's all
pretty<00:01:12.270> standard<00:01:13.170> stuff<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> will<00:01:13.770> hear

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
pretty standard stuff that you will hear

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.910 
pretty standard stuff that you will hear
on<00:01:14.040> bigger<00:01:14.250> DJ<00:01:14.549> software

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.529 

and<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.819> must<00:01:23.969> have<00:01:24.149> effects

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
and now that one we must have effects

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.239 
and now that one we must have effects
here<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.079> for<00:01:25.319> instance<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:25.829> an<00:01:25.979> echo<00:01:26.219> effect

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
here so for instance with an echo effect

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:28.219 
here so for instance with an echo effect
let's<00:01:26.969> go<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.179> a<00:01:27.299> different<00:01:27.420> effective<00:01:27.960> phaser

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
let's go to a different effective phaser

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.020 
let's go to a different effective phaser
or<00:01:28.530> something<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.829> flanger<00:01:29.189> will<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.399> there

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
or something like flanger will do there

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
or something like flanger will do there
you<00:01:30.119> go

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.710 

so<00:01:38.430> there's<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.760> tip<00:01:39.030> turn<00:01:39.330> off<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so there's one tip turn off the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.899 
so there's one tip turn off the
notifications<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.250> phone<00:01:41.580> if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> want

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
notifications on your phone if you want

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.960 
notifications on your phone if you want
to<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.920> DJing<00:01:43.920> three<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.370> things<00:01:44.580> popping

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to have a DJing three of things popping

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700 
to have a DJing three of things popping
up<00:01:45.060> set<00:01:45.690> yourself<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:46.050> flight<00:01:46.260> mode<00:01:46.500> for

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
up set yourself with flight mode for

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.760 
up set yourself with flight mode for
best<00:01:46.890> effect<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:49.080> also<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.440> low-pass

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
best effect so we also have the low-pass

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.740 
best effect so we also have the low-pass
filter<00:01:50.190> here<00:01:50.369> which<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.300> kind<00:01:51.510> of<00:01:51.540> turns

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
filter here which you just kind of turns

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.900 
filter here which you just kind of turns
on<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.080> off<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.130> high-pass<00:01:53.490> filter

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
on and off and the high-pass filter

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.400 
on and off and the high-pass filter
again<00:01:54.210> which<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.540> turns<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> off<00:01:57.410> let's

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
again which just turns on and off let's

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.230 
again which just turns on and off let's
go<00:01:58.530> back<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.400> top<00:01:59.880> here<00:01:59.910> you<00:02:00.210> can

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
go back to the top here you can

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.109 
go back to the top here you can
hopefully<00:02:01.050> see<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> small<00:02:02.369> circle<00:02:02.970> going

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
hopefully see on the small circle going

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.430 
hopefully see on the small circle going
around<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.630> way<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.050> fifth<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
around there the way about a fifth of

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.870 
around there the way about a fifth of
the<00:02:04.530> way<00:02:04.619> through<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.920> track<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.790> this

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the way through the track there and this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
the way through the track there and this
will<00:02:06.030> continue<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.509> fill<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.590> go

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
will continue to fill up as we go

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.169 
will continue to fill up as we go
through<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> track<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:08.940> skip

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
through the track you can actually skip

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
through the track you can actually skip
through<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> track<00:02:09.690> mode<00:02:09.869> by<00:02:10.860> touching<00:02:11.160> these

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
through the track mode by touching these

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.190 
through the track mode by touching these
little<00:02:11.700> buttons<00:02:12.330> here<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.720> skips<00:02:12.959> through

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
little buttons here and it skips through

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.740 
little buttons here and it skips through
a<00:02:13.350> beat<00:02:13.830> match<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.300> nice

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
a beat match this is nice

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.960 
a beat match this is nice
so<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.680> can't<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.040> hear<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.340> changing<00:02:17.820> but

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
so you can't really hear it changing but

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.759 
so you can't really hear it changing but
we<00:02:18.060> are<00:02:18.180> skipping<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.870> long<00:02:19.380> way<00:02:19.500> through<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
we are skipping a long way through the

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.070 
we are skipping a long way through the
track<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:22.760> was<00:02:23.760> finally<00:02:24.120> CDJs<00:02:24.690> did<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
track there was finally CDJs did that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.690 
track there was finally CDJs did that
that's<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.350> lot<00:02:25.500> better<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.890> lot<00:02:26.100> better<00:02:26.310> way<00:02:26.640> of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
that's a lot better a lot better way of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.790 
that's a lot better a lot better way of
skipping<00:02:26.970> than<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.450> randomly<00:02:28.380> jumping

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
skipping than it just randomly jumping

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.680 
skipping than it just randomly jumping
forward<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.190> track<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.420> you're<00:02:30.630> not

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
forward in the track so if you're not

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.120 
forward in the track so if you're not
really<00:02:30.900> too<00:02:31.170> keen<00:02:31.410> on<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> track<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.950> can

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
really too keen on the track you can

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.650 
really too keen on the track you can
skip<00:02:32.610> yourself<00:02:32.880> towards<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> point<00:02:33.420> where<00:02:33.600> you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
skip yourself towards a point where you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.360 
skip yourself towards a point where you
might<00:02:33.810> want<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.019> mix<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.320> another<00:02:34.590> track<00:02:34.860> like

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
might want to mix in another track like

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.430 
might want to mix in another track like
that<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.360> let's<00:02:36.540> go<00:02:36.570> find<00:02:36.870> another<00:02:36.959> track<00:02:37.320> to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
that so let's go find another track to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.890 
that so let's go find another track to
mix<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.430> load<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.700> here<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.390> deck

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
mix in we can load it here on this deck

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.720 
mix in we can load it here on this deck
by<00:02:40.050> pressing<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.440> big<00:02:40.590> button<00:02:40.830> here<00:02:41.070> or<00:02:41.280> we

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
by pressing the big button here or we

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.280 
by pressing the big button here or we
could<00:02:41.940> move<00:02:42.120> over<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.570> deck<00:02:42.720> itself<00:02:43.079> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
could move over to the deck itself to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.259 
could move over to the deck itself to
load<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.620> doesn't<00:02:43.890> really<00:02:43.980> matter<00:02:44.220> I'm<00:02:45.060> going

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
load it doesn't really matter I'm going

onto the deck it's now stuck there
waiting<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:55.810> us<00:02:56.019> if<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.069> go<00:02:57.219> back<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.489> the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
waiting for us if I go back to the

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.309 
waiting for us if I go back to the
middle<00:02:57.819> here<00:02:57.849> it's<00:02:58.329> got<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.599> big<00:02:58.810> fat<00:02:59.019> sync

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
middle here it's got a big fat sync

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.809 
middle here it's got a big fat sync
button<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.799> middle<00:03:00.069> which<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.609> really

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
button in the middle which is a really

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.869 
button in the middle which is a really
nice<00:03:01.030> feature<00:03:01.469> because<00:03:02.469> obviously<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.639> can't

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
nice feature because obviously you can't

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.970 
nice feature because obviously you can't
fit<00:03:04.060> pitch<00:03:04.329> failings<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.840> stuff<00:03:05.079> into<00:03:05.379> a<00:03:05.590> tiny

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
fit pitch failings and stuff into a tiny

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.770 
fit pitch failings and stuff into a tiny
little<00:03:06.159> watch<00:03:06.639> so<00:03:07.209> if<00:03:07.359> you're<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.659> be

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
little watch so if you're going to be

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.690 
little watch so if you're going to be
DJing<00:03:08.530> with<00:03:08.709> dance<00:03:08.920> music<00:03:09.010> here<00:03:09.400> having<00:03:09.639> a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
DJing with dance music here having a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.520 
DJing with dance music here having a
sync<00:03:09.939> button<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.269> certainly<00:03:10.599> well<00:03:11.019> worth<00:03:11.200> at

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
sync button is certainly well worth at

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.649 
sync button is certainly well worth at
well<00:03:11.769> worth<00:03:11.950> doing<00:03:12.280> let's<00:03:13.180> jump<00:03:13.329> forward<00:03:13.629> a

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
well worth doing let's jump forward a

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.050 
well worth doing let's jump forward a
bit<00:03:13.810> more<00:03:14.189> I've<00:03:15.189> had<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> good<00:03:15.549> place<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.879> mix

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
bit more I've had a good place to mix

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.959 
bit more I've had a good place to mix
out<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.450> here<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:18.340> looks<00:03:18.579> like<00:03:18.700> it's<00:03:18.909> gonna

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:18.969 
out of here this looks like it's gonna

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.780
