this way no one takes it off backs in it

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.809 
this way no one takes it off backs in it
a<00:01:10.659> lot<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.289> times<00:01:11.499> people<00:01:12.100> think<00:01:12.130> this<00:01:12.459> isn't

00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:12.819 
a lot of times people think this isn't

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:14.309 
a lot of times people think this isn't
supposed<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:13.179> be<00:01:13.270> there<00:01:13.600> or<00:01:13.899> it's<00:01:14.109> hindering

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:14.319 
supposed to be there or it's hindering

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.770 
supposed to be there or it's hindering
their<00:01:14.770> hose<00:01:14.920> pressure<00:01:15.249> or<00:01:16.090> whatnot<00:01:16.299> but<00:01:16.689> this

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
their hose pressure or whatnot but this

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.260 
their hose pressure or whatnot but this
is<00:01:16.929> a<00:01:16.959> vacuum<00:01:17.469> breaker<00:01:17.709> what<00:01:18.639> it<00:01:18.759> does<00:01:18.939> is<00:01:19.149> when

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
is a vacuum breaker what it does is when

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.679 
is a vacuum breaker what it does is when
you<00:01:19.389> turn<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:20.170> water<00:01:20.409> off<00:01:20.789> it<00:01:21.789> prevents<00:01:22.539> the

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
you turn the water off it prevents the

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.260 
you turn the water off it prevents the
water<00:01:22.929> that's<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.439> hose<00:01:23.829> from<00:01:24.729> going<00:01:25.060> back

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
water that's in the hose from going back

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.510 
water that's in the hose from going back
into<00:01:25.569> your<00:01:26.049> drinking<00:01:26.469> water<00:01:26.499> supply<00:01:27.069> or<00:01:27.249> going

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
into your drinking water supply or going

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.219 
into your drinking water supply or going
back<00:01:27.700> into<00:01:27.969> the<00:01:28.090> water<00:01:28.359> supply<00:01:28.719> so<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:28.929> water

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
back into the water supply so the water

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.620 
back into the water supply so the water
when<00:01:29.469> it<00:01:29.590> flows<00:01:29.829> back<00:01:30.100> out<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.880> come<00:01:31.600> out

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
when it flows back out it can come out

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.139 
when it flows back out it can come out
of<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.020> little<00:01:32.289> holes<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:33.579> repair<00:01:33.939> will

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
of the little holes this repair will

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.120 
of the little holes this repair will
need<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.359> turn<00:01:34.569> off<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.869> water<00:01:34.899> supply<00:01:35.170> and

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
need to turn off the water supply and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.800 
need to turn off the water supply and
it's<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.399> good<00:01:36.520> idea<00:01:36.639> to<00:01:36.849> turn<00:01:37.090> off<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.389> hot<00:01:37.599> and

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
it's a good idea to turn off the hot and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.019 
it's a good idea to turn off the hot and
the<00:01:37.929> cold<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:39.009> way<00:01:39.130> if<00:01:39.249> someone<00:01:39.429> was<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.849> turn

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.029 
the cold that way if someone was to turn

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:42.269 
the cold that way if someone was to turn
on<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.749> hot<00:01:40.929> side<00:01:41.139> they<00:01:41.380> don't<00:01:41.590> get<00:01:41.740> scalded

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:42.279 
on the hot side they don't get scalded

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:45.170 
on the hot side they don't get scalded
or<00:01:42.369> anything<00:01:42.579> like<00:01:42.819> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:02:01.660 

here

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.100 

these<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.909> good<00:02:03.150> kind<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> shut<00:02:03.720> off<00:02:03.870> in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
these are a good kind of shut off in

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.380 
these are a good kind of shut off in
that<00:02:04.260> these<00:02:04.650> are<00:02:04.710> ball<00:02:05.190> valves<00:02:05.610> better<00:02:06.030> than<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that these are ball valves better than a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.930 
that these are ball valves better than a
gate<00:02:06.600> valve<00:02:06.810> out<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.039> waters<00:02:08.399> off<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.789> these

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
gate valve out the waters off or these

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.120 
gate valve out the waters off or these
things<00:02:09.119> water<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:09.750> checked<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> line

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.560 

this<00:02:14.130> repair<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.610> only<00:02:14.760> use<00:02:14.970> two<00:02:15.240> pairs<00:02:15.420> of
