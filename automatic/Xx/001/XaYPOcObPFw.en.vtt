00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.290

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.369

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.980

 finally a day where you do what I can 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.460
 decide what will happen to me 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.190
 what do you have the risk is 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.190
 a lot less if I had to believe me 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:30.780
