happening<00:01:20.190> it's<00:01:21.190> almost<00:01:21.369> dull<00:01:21.820> with<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.479> with

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
happening it's almost dull with it with

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.780 
happening it's almost dull with it with
not<00:01:22.960> things<00:01:23.290> happening<00:01:23.830> so<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.280> think<00:01:24.460> that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
not things happening so I think that

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.690 
not things happening so I think that
combination<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.660> frustration<00:01:26.440> and<00:01:26.700> rejection

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
combination of frustration and rejection

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.060 
combination of frustration and rejection
are<00:01:28.119> going<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.360> class<00:01:28.630> today<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.740> think<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
are going to class today and I think the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.859 
are going to class today and I think the
heat<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.910> rhetoric<00:01:31.119> today's<00:01:31.540> could<00:01:31.780> be

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
heat of the rhetoric today's could be

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.050 
heat of the rhetoric today's could be
much<00:01:32.080> sharper<00:01:32.500> even<00:01:33.310> than<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.520> was<00:01:33.670> 50<00:01:34.030> years

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
much sharper even than it was 50 years

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.290 
much sharper even than it was 50 years
ago<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:35.350> do<00:01:35.530> have<00:01:35.740> an<00:01:36.340> interesting<00:01:37.149> statement
