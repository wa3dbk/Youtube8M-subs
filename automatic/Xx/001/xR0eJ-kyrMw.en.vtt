00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
when you learn this pace it's a really

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.990

good<00:00:40.590> idea<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.980> learn<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.280> kind<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.670> stop

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
good idea to learn it kind of with stop

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.049 
good idea to learn it kind of with stop
bows<00:00:46.070> yeah<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.340> you're<00:00:47.640> learning<00:00:47.760> your

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
bows yeah because you're learning your

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.729
