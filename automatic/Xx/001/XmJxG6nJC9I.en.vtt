00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
let's try there's a lot of potential not

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.490 
let's try there's a lot of potential not
even<00:01:24.370> potential<00:01:24.790> it's<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.000> good<00:01:25.180> track<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
even potential it's a good track that

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
little too much but it's probably faster

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.470

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
how that is it's sometimes it's hard to

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.550 
how that is it's sometimes it's hard to
fit<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.060> video<00:03:04.540> games<00:03:04.840> when<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.320> like<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
fit in video games when you have like a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.490 
fit in video games when you have like a
real<00:03:05.890> life<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.459> live<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.230> I'm<00:03:08.230> kind<00:03:08.440> of

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
real life to live so I'm kind of

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.990 
real life to live so I'm kind of
butchering<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.010> section<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.549> jump<00:03:09.790> in

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
butchering that section you can jump in

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.699 
butchering that section you can jump in
you<00:03:10.120> can<00:03:10.239> actually<00:03:10.480> scrub<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:10.989> then<00:03:11.200> get<00:03:11.650> a

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
you can actually scrub it and then get a

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.890 
you can actually scrub it and then get a
nice<00:03:11.860> rhythm<00:03:12.100> through<00:03:12.430> there<00:03:12.579> as<00:03:12.700> well<00:03:12.910> but

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
nice rhythm through there as well but

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.449 
nice rhythm through there as well but

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.780 

kind<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.320> got<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.470> Revit<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.920> little<00:03:41.160> much<00:03:41.460> in<00:03:41.670> the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
kind of got a Revit a little much in the

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.360 
kind of got a Revit a little much in the
air<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.360> lot<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.780> these<00:03:42.840> sections

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.410 

that's<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.489> only<00:03:49.580> way<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.819> can<00:03:50.060> keep<00:03:50.209> those

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
that's the only way I can keep those

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.860 
that's the only way I can keep those
going<00:03:51.069> pretty<00:03:52.069> ugly<00:03:52.220> whips<00:03:52.580> it's<00:03:53.420> hard<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.690> get

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
going pretty ugly whips it's hard to get

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.930 
going pretty ugly whips it's hard to get
one<00:03:54.019> that's<00:03:54.440> just<00:03:54.769> almost<00:03:54.980> too<00:03:55.280> floaty<00:03:55.610> where

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
one that's just almost too floaty where

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.000 
one that's just almost too floaty where
it's<00:03:56.060> really<00:03:56.420> hard<00:03:56.629> to<00:03:56.780> get<00:03:56.959> what<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.680> want

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
it's really hard to get what you want

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.949 
it's really hard to get what you want
through<00:03:58.220> there<00:03:58.400> but<00:03:58.700> just<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.239> so<00:03:59.599> much<00:03:59.720> fun

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
through there but just so so much fun

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.839 
through there but just so so much fun
and<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.739> know<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.190> background<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.730> pretty

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
and you know the background is pretty

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.110 
and you know the background is pretty
cool<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:02.420> can<00:04:03.140> see<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:04.220> might<00:04:04.670> have<00:04:04.790> missed<00:04:04.970> it

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
cool you can see I might have missed it

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.880 
cool you can see I might have missed it
but<00:04:05.150> hopefully<00:04:05.450> we<00:04:05.510> went<00:04:05.660> back<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.110> you<00:04:06.620> can

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
but hopefully we went back and you can

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.500 
but hopefully we went back and you can
see<00:04:06.920> like<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.250> almost<00:04:07.430> look<00:04:07.640> like<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.910> like

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
see like I almost look like a like

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.990 
see like I almost look like a like
Scotland<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.709> sidelines<00:04:10.190> there<00:04:10.430> something

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
Scotland the sidelines there something

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.580 
Scotland the sidelines there something
but<00:04:11.209> then<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.989> see<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.380> some<00:04:12.470> like

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
but then you see just some like

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.080 
but then you see just some like
graphical<00:04:13.040> errors<00:04:13.310> past<00:04:13.610> those<00:04:13.790> bleachers

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
graphical errors past those bleachers

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.409 
graphical errors past those bleachers
the<00:04:14.810> ambulance<00:04:15.799> is<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.910> river<00:04:17.090> which<00:04:17.299> is

the ambulance is in the river which is

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.479 
the ambulance is in the river which is
kind<00:04:17.630> of<00:04:17.690> a<00:04:17.750> cool<00:04:17.930> touch<00:04:18.109> but<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:19.040> know<00:04:19.160> it's

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
kind of a cool touch but you know it's

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.949 
kind of a cool touch but you know it's
not<00:04:19.639> perfect<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.359> don't<00:04:20.389> think<00:04:20.570> he<00:04:20.810> meant

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
not perfect and I don't think he meant

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.840 
not perfect and I don't think he meant
it<00:04:21.139> to<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.290> perfect<00:04:21.799> so<00:04:21.889> it<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.430> what<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.700> is

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
it to be perfect so it is what it is

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.580 
it to be perfect so it is what it is
