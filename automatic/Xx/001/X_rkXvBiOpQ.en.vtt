00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.780
 and we have a super idea to make mini ideas 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.299
 as I say to do for these 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.330
 parties with calcium marta and they really are 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.160
 very nice marten because they have nothing 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.560
 quick things you can do at home 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.359
 for when we are there close to 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.759
 set the table two easy quick ideas 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.320
 I love that always good at the table 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.499
 we want to have some shine 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.849
 clear and we have a candlestick 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.949
 we understand the candles with those glasses 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.320
 that we have circling from the 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.820
 Cups I think it's great they came up with it and 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.710
 the little angels too so let's go 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.870
 I start the things that we sure have 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.910
 everything we have delicate we have at home 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.640
 so good the idea of these screens 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.379
 which is for buÃ©no with the glasses that we 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.260
 they are loose and assemble these candlesticks 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.870
 use this tracing paper that we can 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.719
 have this that we have stayed and 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.770
 cold plasticized which are these 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.390
 plates that are bought in bookstores 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.510
 so what we are going to do is what 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.400
 next we are going to paste we have the mold 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.860
 from the little screen that we took the measure 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.630
 of the cup that we have we are going to make 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.320
 here a little eyelash because this is what 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.450
 will allow us to close it there and 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.660
 we are going to stick it on the little plate like this 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.340
 we press small and we have 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.300
 reprogramming the aaa and see what 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.369
 softly we will be doing it 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.770
 perfect this here on this side what 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.000
 let's do next is let's cut 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 we are going to reserve it with the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.160
 same plasticized this bit that 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.020
 then it will be the closing and here 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.580
 just what are we going to do this 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.990
 As it is very simple I will leave it for 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.399
 here is to cut by the contour if here 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.110
 we were left with this afterwards when 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.360
 let's take out the crossing and we can 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.070
 close the little screen what we are going to 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.410
 do to decorate it is directly 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.080
 work with transparent glue 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.690
 let's go draw those little stars 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.390
 with the glue well 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.940
 it's easy here the guys can work 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.910
 Do the details you want we draw 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.790
 with the glue we can give it a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.770
 little bit more shape with a toothpick and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.600
 I'm shaping the little star there 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.600
 I'm putting it together like those little tips 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.040
 there 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.340
 and what I do is throw the news to me 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.550
 table and they're going to get some fired 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.540
 but it does not matter, of course, he joined us here 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.390
 I have a little dish we put together this is 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.410
 it's easy to adhere right away because 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.220
 the glue is very transparent 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.720
 then it will remain attached nothing more 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.260
 We are going to throw a surplus here 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.020
 of course you can do all kinds of and everything 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.820
 what you want here for example if 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.190
 there are some I'm accommodating a 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.190
 little looks so easy is 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.410
 and I let it dry and once this is 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.910
 dry what is also convenient for 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.060
 that does not skip any later is 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.090
 to give him a little hand of this 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.280
 on top you can give him the glue and 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.970
 we are left in this way that I already have 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.710
 a list and it puts you social over it 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.180
 you can put back a little bit but 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.610
 the truth that fits perfectly 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.980
 adhered then what do we do any 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.230
 drink that we have left at home can be a 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.380
 little bit of salt a little bit to the coarse 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.680
 sand a candle and what we do open 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.430
 here 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.280
 on this side and we close the screen and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.540
 shows us if they know how the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.730
 let's put together to close it there 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.700
 we crossed this good they take the time 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.739
 to cross it they light the little candle and 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.290
 they have candlesticks to decorate the look 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.060
 how beautiful the candlesticks and the second 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.569
 proposal we are going to put it there is 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.190
 make those little angels that I tell you 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:14.230
 they make very good flashes very fast 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.109
 where I see a disposable plate I can see 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.680
 an angel then that says let's go 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.480
 try this to make these little angels the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.070
 idea that looks at them I already brought one a 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.750
 little marked so they see more or 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.050
 least what is this simple way that they are going 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.700
 to mark on a disposable plate and 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.400
 let's mark here I make a mold 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.740
 He cited this no matter what is marked 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.820
 because I'm going to use it as a mold 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.880
 way is this the wings the head and 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.520
 I return to close the wing and on this side 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.580
 this is important to make a line 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.370
 because this is going to be that we can do 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.729
 the armed double angel as well as what 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.820
 see how they're going to cut back they 're going to open that 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.280
 mosquita and I'm going to decorate the little dish 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.250
 also with glue very easy see us 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.000
 it looks like this and we 're going to make the eyes 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.550
 nothing but black marker 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.660
 and here that I have blondes 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.630
 all the detailed paper to paste 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.640
 what I did here, for example, with this 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:25.660
 I'm going to take it from the heart 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:28.730
 like a little bone and I'm going to stick the dress 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.790
 very important this is I am 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.430
 working on the back of the plate if 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:40.610
 I 'm not going to be able to arm it here there's a 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:44.030
 little trick that if there is no stick 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.159
 the dress I like not only for the 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.319
 diet can also be for communion 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:51.530
 healthy baptism 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:54.439
 it can be very nice idea I'm going to paste the 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.319
 all the details are glued 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:59.330
 so this is super super easy 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.009
 we stick a cute little star of 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.740
 this with our table this I'm going to 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.780
 leave here because I already have one already dry what 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.030
 let's let it dry a little bit and I want 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.400
 show you here comes the magic of the armed 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.340
 that just as we have the details 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.750
 stuck that we put a little sign for 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:21.169
 customize it let's do this 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:24.889
 movement so twist so it crossed the wings and 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:29.289
 is formed I feel what I'm going to turn like that and 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:32.509
 I'm going to put a brooch here 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.909
 awesome there we have armadito and 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:38.229
 we must cut them in the wings 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:41.509
 Make it like fringes to give it more 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:43.489
 I hope you have left that you can use it in 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:46.159
 you can use the little tree as a souvenir 

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:48.529
 for everything for the whole apparatus of 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:51.829
 words and baptisms you can change the 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:54.049
 colors because then add other things 

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:56.989
 look there are several models we had also 

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:59.929
 an environment we have several models is 

00:06:56.989 --> 00:07:01.699
 easy to assemble this we liked these models 

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:04.309
 and we put them everywhere so that 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.069
 really cheer up and can do it in 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:09.229
 home so thanks to marti is 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:11.329
 terrific alicante el dorado was very 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.539
 the golden one the golden one the golden one 

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:13.539
 all right 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.520
 the universal aggressive ipax is 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:23.190
 Transparent clean and easy to use 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:27.050
 on all types of surfaces you have 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.050
 an idea you have a box 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.800
 in the box
