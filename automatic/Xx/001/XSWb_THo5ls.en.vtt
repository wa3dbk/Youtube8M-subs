00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello everyone and welcome back a new one 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.680
 episode of the computer museum today vi 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.469
 I will learn how to put videos on 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:17.190
 psp needed to do all this 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.920
 then need three things first 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.199
 quite powerful computer according to the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.630
 usb cable that will connect with the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.560
 psp and third a conversion program 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.679
 and obviously the videos to be converted 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.430
 we are going to open the program for the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.340
 conversion 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.760
 I for example use the team cup cup 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 that at least I think we say so 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.579
 however now we wait for it to load the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.309
 second and I'll show you how it works 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.510
 then this is the program 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.280
 here there are many many sections but 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.980
 the one that interests us most is video 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.809
 converter once we're in here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 we choose the video to start from and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.970
 so let's take our initials 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.770
 computer months and once it was 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:15.270
 inserted that you will notice here the line where 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:18.600
 we are going to set our code 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.549
 format so here there are various sim 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.810
 formats of all types of all 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.610
 dimensions between the xbox 360 mou video or 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:34.979
 mvvm a wave svf that is the format for i 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.850
 mpg mp4 sites and everything we will go to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.299
 click psp so easier to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.600
 find and spip list sony portable 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.420
 you first look where it is to be saved 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.530
 then you will press paintings here for 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.060
 choose the output conversion file e 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.280
 obviously it will avoid a folder 2 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.280
 put them where you decide where 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.549
 put them and once done do convert 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.430
 ok 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.569
 he is now converting with notes 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.180
 network the file 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.940
 ok the file that is right now 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.629
 converted let's get it in the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.830
 folder in fact now we will notice 22 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:28.830
 types this here mp4 will be the one from 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:32.420
 put in the psp ok now we have 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.800
 practically finished it just lacks 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:42.950
 connect the usb cable to the psp e 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.900
 Download the video files above 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.440
 then we connect the usb cable to the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.340
 our playstation would go automatically 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.019
 usually in usb connection 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.960
 now the usb connection will appear here 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:06.020
 here it is, you gave it a thousand 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.020
 let's go on video 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.209
 obviously if you ever have a video it will be 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.600
 a fight over the folder we'll go into 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.569
 video documents 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.110
 ok and let's put our signature on 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.920
 mp4 At this point we are done 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.950
 we can disconnect the psp and now 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.140
 let's see the final result 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.280
 just go to video folder and if everything 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.209
 network done right will appear a video that 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.050
 our acronym just let it go 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.580
 and of course if everything is converted right 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.640
 it works properly 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:55.110
 thank you all for this vision of 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.540
 our video of how to put videos 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.709
 on the psp thanks everyone for this 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.709
