00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.280 
couple of days after baking and
sometimes<00:03:31.239> with<00:03:31.359> muffins<00:03:31.689> they<00:03:31.900> get<00:03:32.049> stale

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
sometimes with muffins they get stale

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.689 
sometimes with muffins they get stale
pretty<00:03:32.560> quick<00:03:32.799> these<00:03:32.979> weren't<00:03:33.159> too<00:03:33.340> bad<00:03:33.519> at

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
pretty quick these weren't too bad at

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.699 
pretty quick these weren't too bad at
all<00:03:33.759> I<00:03:33.939> guess<00:03:34.329> because<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.689> that<00:03:34.900> nice<00:03:35.290> Greek

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
all I guess because of that nice Greek

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.979 
all I guess because of that nice Greek
yogurt<00:03:36.099> that<00:03:36.129> you<00:03:36.340> added<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:36.909> there<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.870> only

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
yogurt that you added in there the only

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.719 
yogurt that you added in there the only
thing<00:03:38.079> I<00:03:38.229> would<00:03:38.290> do<00:03:38.470> differently<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:39.129> I<00:03:39.159> would

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:39.729 
thing I would do differently is I would

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.509 
thing I would do differently is I would
make<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.659> Nutella<00:03:41.229> dollop<00:03:41.650> larger<00:03:42.220> maybe<00:03:42.400> a

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
make that Nutella dollop larger maybe a

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.550 
make that Nutella dollop larger maybe a
tablespoon<00:03:42.939> instead<00:03:43.419> of<00:03:43.509> a<00:03:43.569> teaspoon<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.290> I

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
tablespoon instead of a teaspoon and I

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.860 
tablespoon instead of a teaspoon and I
would<00:03:44.799> push<00:03:45.099> it<00:03:45.129> down<00:03:45.939> all<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.329> way<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.689> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
would push it down all the way to the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.390 
would push it down all the way to the
bottom<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.229> the<00:03:47.290> cupcake<00:03:47.680> because<00:03:48.009> it<00:03:48.250> has<00:03:48.370> a

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
bottom of the cupcake because it has a

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.949 
bottom of the cupcake because it has a
tendency<00:03:48.879> to<00:03:49.000> want<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.269> float<00:03:49.509> up<00:03:49.659> during

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
tendency to want to float up during
