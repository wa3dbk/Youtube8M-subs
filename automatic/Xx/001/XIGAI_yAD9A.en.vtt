00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
can clean it and maintain it so they

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.170 
can clean it and maintain it so they
work<00:00:42.350> just<00:00:42.650> as<00:00:42.800> good<00:00:42.830> as<00:00:43.040> they<00:00:43.160> did<00:00:43.220> coming<00:00:44.060> out

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
work just as good as they did coming out

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.820 
work just as good as they did coming out
of<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.300> box<00:00:44.510> this<00:00:45.050> is<00:00:45.230> usually<00:00:45.350> recommended

of the box this is usually recommended

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.500 
of the box this is usually recommended
for<00:00:46.220> any<00:00:46.310> speed<00:00:46.610> skaters<00:00:47.030> or<00:00:47.210> marathon

high-end bearings sealed bearings are

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.190 
high-end bearings sealed bearings are
just<00:00:52.310> that<00:00:52.490> they're<00:00:52.970> sealed<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.020> actually

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
just that they're sealed so you actually

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.290 
just that they're sealed so you actually
shouldn't<00:00:54.710> be<00:00:54.800> removing<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.310> shield<00:00:55.580> on<00:00:55.910> them

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
shouldn't be removing the shield on them

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.270 
shouldn't be removing the shield on them
so<00:00:56.780> they<00:00:56.900> maintain<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.500> sealed<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.070> they're

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
so they maintain the sealed and they're

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.550 
so they maintain the sealed and they're
generally<00:00:58.850> going<00:00:59.060> to<00:00:59.120> be<00:00:59.210> best<00:00:59.600> for<00:01:00.260> any<00:01:00.320> type

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560

they're going to be lighter weight
they're<00:01:22.549> actually<00:01:22.880> going<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.090> build<00:01:23.329> less

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
they're actually going to build less

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.929 
they're actually going to build less
friction<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.409> hence<00:01:24.770> spin<00:01:25.159> more<00:01:25.399> efficiently

with steel bearings they're going to be

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.340 
with steel bearings they're going to be
more<00:01:28.640> durable<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.210> when<00:01:29.569> you<00:01:29.659> do<00:01:29.899> build<00:01:30.200> up

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
more durable so when you do build up

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.289 
more durable so when you do build up

now the most common rating system that's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.980 
now the most common rating system that's
used<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.189> ABEC<00:01:49.670> scale<00:01:50.060> which<00:01:50.569> generally

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
used is the ABEC scale which generally

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.550 
used is the ABEC scale which generally
runs<00:01:51.170> from<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.560> BEC<00:01:51.740> 3<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.789> BEC<00:01:53.119> 9<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.780> have<00:01:54.409> some

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
runs from a BEC 3 to a BEC 9 I have some

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.120 
runs from a BEC 3 to a BEC 9 I have some
a<00:01:54.649> back<00:01:54.829> 5s<00:01:55.429> some<00:01:56.060> 7s<00:01:56.539> and<00:01:56.719> some<00:01:57.439> nines<00:01:57.649> here

a back 5s some 7s and some nines here

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.249 
a back 5s some 7s and some nines here
and<00:01:58.280> many<00:01:58.819> times<00:01:59.090> as<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.359> go<00:01:59.450> up<00:01:59.659> in<00:01:59.929> the<00:01:59.959> scale

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
and many times as you go up in the scale

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.719 
and many times as you go up in the scale
what's<00:02:00.770> really<00:02:01.039> happening<00:02:01.429> is<00:02:01.579> you're

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
what's really happening is you're

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.190 
what's really happening is you're
getting<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:01.999> more<00:02:02.149> efficient<00:02:02.600> bearing<00:02:02.869> that

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
getting a more efficient bearing that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.440 
getting a more efficient bearing that
has<00:02:03.380> better<00:02:03.560> durability<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.459> also<00:02:05.060> spins

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
has better durability and also spins

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.410 
has better durability and also spins
much<00:02:05.990> faster<00:02:06.130> other<00:02:07.149> manufacturers<00:02:08.149> such<00:02:08.390> as

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
much faster other manufacturers such as

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.010 
much faster other manufacturers such as
k2<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.289> twin<00:02:09.800> cam<00:02:10.069> have<00:02:10.459> ilq<00:02:11.240> bearing<00:02:11.750> rating

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
k2 and twin cam have ilq bearing rating

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.580 
k2 and twin cam have ilq bearing rating
systems<00:02:12.439> and<00:02:12.790> rollerblade<00:02:13.790> has<00:02:14.000> SG<00:02:14.629> these<00:02:15.439> are

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
systems and rollerblade has SG these are

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.229 
systems and rollerblade has SG these are
actually<00:02:15.890> equivalent<00:02:16.159> to<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.760> same<00:02:16.970> number

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
actually equivalent to the same number

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:17.740 
actually equivalent to the same number
that<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.450> would

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
that you would

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.990 
that you would
it<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.320> if<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.500> have<00:02:18.530> an<00:02:18.710> eye<00:02:18.860> lq5<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.790> would<00:02:19.910> be

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
it so if you have an eye lq5 it would be

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.300 
it so if you have an eye lq5 it would be
equivalent<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.450> an<00:02:20.630> ABEC<00:02:21.020> five<00:02:21.650> or<00:02:21.980> if<00:02:22.220> you

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
equivalent to an ABEC five or if you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.950 
equivalent to an ABEC five or if you
have<00:02:22.430> an<00:02:22.580> SG<00:02:22.850> seven<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.420> would<00:02:23.570> be<00:02:23.660> equivalent

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
have an SG seven it would be equivalent

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.010 
have an SG seven it would be equivalent
to<00:02:24.200> an<00:02:24.620> ABEC<00:02:24.860> seven<00:02:25.220> there<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.150> one<00:02:26.450> really<00:02:26.750> big

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
to an ABEC seven there is one really big

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.050 
to an ABEC seven there is one really big
different<00:02:27.620> rating<00:02:28.070> which<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.730> going<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.940> be

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
different rating which is going to be

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.480 
different rating which is going to be
the<00:02:29.210> swiss<00:02:29.540> rating<00:02:29.960> now<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.070> actually

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
the swiss rating now this is actually

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.820 
the swiss rating now this is actually
developed<00:02:32.030> originally<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.810> switzerland<00:02:33.380> but

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
developed originally in switzerland but

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.680 
developed originally in switzerland but
not<00:02:33.980> all<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.520> these<00:02:34.670> bearings<00:02:35.120> are<00:02:35.270> now<00:02:35.390> made

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
not all of these bearings are now made

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.840 
not all of these bearings are now made
by<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.959> swiss<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:37.100> biggest<00:02:37.400> thing<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.700> these

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
by the swiss the biggest thing is these

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.610 
by the swiss the biggest thing is these
are<00:02:37.910> extremely<00:02:38.480> efficient<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.290> way<00:02:39.440> that

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
are extremely efficient in the way that

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.290 
are extremely efficient in the way that
they<00:02:39.740> spin<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.280> have<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> much<00:02:40.970> higher

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
they spin and have a much higher

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.449 
they spin and have a much higher
durability<00:02:41.750> tolerance<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.130> these<00:02:43.280> are

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
durability tolerance so these are

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.340 
durability tolerance so these are
actually<00:02:43.760> recommended<00:02:44.300> for<00:02:44.480> anybody<00:02:44.990> that's

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
actually recommended for anybody that's

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.690 
actually recommended for anybody that's
going<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.770> doing<00:02:45.920> cross-training

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
going to be doing cross-training

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.990 
going to be doing cross-training
speed<00:02:47.300> skating<00:02:47.630> or<00:02:47.900> marathon<00:02:48.380> skating<00:02:48.980> one<00:02:49.910> of

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
speed skating or marathon skating one of

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.400 
speed skating or marathon skating one of
the<00:02:50.090> last<00:02:50.300> factors<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:50.989> play<00:02:51.140> into<00:02:51.170> what

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
the last factors that can play into what

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.600 
the last factors that can play into what
bearing<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.739> choose<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.220> type<00:02:52.430> of

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
bearing you choose is the type of

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.520 
bearing you choose is the type of
lubricant<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.150> comes<00:02:53.330> with<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.600> we<00:02:54.140> have<00:02:54.260> oil

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
lubricant that comes with it we have oil

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.380 
lubricant that comes with it we have oil
style<00:02:54.920> lubricant<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.550> we<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.060> cream

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
style lubricant and we have a cream

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.270 
style lubricant and we have a cream
style<00:02:56.630> lubricant<00:02:57.140> biggest<00:02:57.890> thing<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.160> that

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
style lubricant biggest thing is that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.770 
style lubricant biggest thing is that
the<00:02:58.370> oil<00:02:58.400> style<00:02:59.030> will<00:02:59.209> actually<00:02:59.510> break<00:02:59.720> down

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
the oil style will actually break down

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.780 
the oil style will actually break down
faster<00:03:00.320> than<00:03:00.650> your<00:03:00.770> cream<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:01.670> you're

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
faster than your cream so if you're

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.460 
faster than your cream so if you're
going<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.090> doing<00:03:02.300> marathon<00:03:02.750> skating<00:03:03.200> speed

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
going to be doing marathon skating speed

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.380 
going to be doing marathon skating speed
skating<00:03:03.800> or<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.370> lot<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.730> Fitness<00:03:05.030> skating

cream<00:03:05.930> style<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.230> generally<00:03:06.530> going<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.709> be

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
cream style is generally going to be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.620 
cream style is generally going to be
better<00:03:07.070> for<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.940> better<00:03:08.000> for<00:03:08.360> your
