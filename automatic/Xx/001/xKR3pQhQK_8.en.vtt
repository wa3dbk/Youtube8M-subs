00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.360
 today we are going to make a recipe a lot 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.070
 very very appetizing 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.520
 what very little because we go to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.039
 use what is normally the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.289
 less palatable piece of chicken than us 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.240
 we bought simple fins 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.009
 see they are paul lines 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.130
 let's start from the potatoes we have 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.599
 of water and we begin to peel the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.220
 potatoes 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.140
 as you can see I have put in the meantime 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.870
 of the water to boil which will serve for 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.570
 burn the potatoes I put it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 in the water because in the meantime I am 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 going to peel other potatoes there is the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.180
 risk that it may become all black 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
 therefore not particularly aesthetically 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.720
 beautiful 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:01:02.660
 we continue at this point we go to 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.660
 divide our potatoes into large cubes 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.310
 still in the middle 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.159
 so here is this we say that it is the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.270
 size that can fit to do 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.270
 these potatoes so-so 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.310
 what we do we go to touch 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.310
 in the water we salt it like this 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.840
 perfect let's go for a quarter 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.450
 now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.450
 we begin to take care of ours 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.729
 read this is read as you buy 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.950
 normal to put in trays in the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.079
 supermarket and so the first thing to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.409
 do which is to go to breed 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.729
 you see all the hairs that we still have 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.319
 so many can do it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.130
 ways of use normally gas 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.990
 then I mention the gas and then passed the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.530
 slightly need to do these 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.879
 crackles are the hairs they are 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.909
 left many times you can't 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.909
 to see 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.020
 perfect we have to separate you see are 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.020
 practically three pieces this piece 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.720
 here we will eliminate it because it is 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.680
 the piece that has the least flesh ever and 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.300
 so what can happen rather than that 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.959
 what will happen does not emit that tends to 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.239
 burn 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.610
 this is a joint you can't feel 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.110
 place your finger here see one 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.420
 joint just place the knife 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.880
 so without even doing too much then 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.290
 force the knife will slip right 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.050
 in the part of the head good of the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.400
 joint and you can separate but us 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.739
 we also want to separate these two 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.989
 small pieces are two small pieces here too 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.180
 it's about having a joint between us 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.989
 we'll put the knife right in the middle 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.269
 the joint then we cut so without 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.860
 do even then not that much perhaps not 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.680
 you need to do so much strength you see 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.989
 supporting the knife but it is normal yes 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.660
 he can easily cut it done 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.840
 and we continue with the cleaning of ours 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.840
 pieces 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.160
 here we put our pieces here 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:23.600
 inside first a little bit of oil e 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.950
 then lemon for commands and pour 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.230
 over the chicken the lemon juice then 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.030
 let's add a tablespoon of 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:39.370
 so good 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:43.130
 this here we leave covered we need a 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.900
 salt and pepper mortar in this 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.020
 in case I 'm using two variants of 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.540
 two and three different chilli peppers in the 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.250
 of the green pledge that is 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.010
 extremely fragrant in chilli 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.800
 of the classic spicy chili seeds 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.740
 of coriander paprika is a little bit of 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.990
 mixed pepper then we take the garlic 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.080
 at least let's say a couple of wedges of 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.290
 garlic that we're going to clean 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.140
 let's say a teaspoon of chili pepper 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:18.260
 half hot red pepper 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:23.990
 spoon a spoon full of seeds of 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:27.590
 coriander 2 teaspoons of abundant of 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.450
 paprika two nice pinches of salt a little 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.180
 of pepper 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.180
 we begin to crush 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.840
 when practically the pasta will begin 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.010
 assume this consistency let's go 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.040
 add some liquid could 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.350
 be like we are using now 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.550
 a little bit of oil 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.990
 you can choose oil and olive oil 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:03.160
 was that I seed oil and you choose 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:05.200
 and we continue to knead we take one 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.180
 small ovenware we stables put on 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.340
 our pasta 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:16.960
 we begin to take our pieces of 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:22.630
 chicken and let's go and arrange them so we put 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.080
 the marinade so and let's add the 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.419
 our pasta 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.439
 meanwhile our potatoes are 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:41.409
 ready then they have already cooked 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:41.409
 sufficiently perfect so perfect 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.310
 we must put 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:53.300
 a little oil from the bottom we can put 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:57.919
 our potatoes so we try to 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:01.730
 distribute it evenly a tad bit 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.950
 of oil and let's lay down ours 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.210
 let's get our own pieces of chicken 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:15.810
 let's put your own on and 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:18.690
 so I would say that potatoes are perfect 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:25.860
 at this point we go to the oven at 180 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:27.710
 degrees 200 degrees for up to 25 minutes e 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.600
 this is the result 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.840
 after being the oven look at that 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.889
 the wonderful sauce he made 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.400
 this flat advice this must be 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.620
 eat so wonderful I do 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.919
 I will strive for you 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.919
 I take this 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.889
 Yup 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.180
 no
