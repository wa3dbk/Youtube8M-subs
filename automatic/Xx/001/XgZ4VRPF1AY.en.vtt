00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 good guys welcome no video in 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.070
 this end one thing that quite a lot 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.290
 you have asked for good 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.620
 not directly some promises to 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.360
 private by comment and also what 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.620
 seen enough forums good first thing 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.450
 The first thing you see I have two cameras and 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.750
 I told you with this rom with the camera 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.460
 normal then the option of external fire 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.490
 I was not so good I found 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.780
 a file that works with any 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.020
 rom 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.750
 and that allows us to have ftr photos in 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.540
 our galaxy note 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 I'm going to do a practical demonstration 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.320
 the cable no no 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 you see 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.810
 in the form of a moment 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.049
 well you see first that kilograms 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.049
 the mobile 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.720
 and we are generating what 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.250
 and is taking the pictures 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.450
 here I am doing it a little bad 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.040
 since I am doing it with the mobile 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.040
 while I look through the camera 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.440
 and when we give him stop 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.820
 then do not know 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.820
 here at the table 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.470
 because it generates the photograph 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.890
 of the water 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.630
 and when relativization is put on 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.909
 start generating others here also what 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.180
 we can see another mine because we can 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.180
 watch 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.229
 in the view of all 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.850
 this is a bit more so for 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.020
 example is presented this 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.020
 who is on the street 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.480
 and is much better see 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.660
 well then below 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.220
 I will explain how to put it on 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.830
 first we go to the recovery as 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.860
 always button up power button 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.300
 button home and on buttons 3 up 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.200
 to restart sagan the letters of 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.200
 samsung a l'aquila out 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.700
 now and this time it's much simpler 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.959
 crystal a rom 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.959
 we wait to insert the menu 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.200
 and the first thing you should do 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.739
 is to make a backup in backup the rest is 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.980
 a backup that I have already done it takes 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.200
 a few minutes and I finish it this is done 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.650
 so that if you have any kind of 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.510
 error with your rom or whatever power 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.700
 return to the original state ie 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.579
 you now follow the instructions 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.630
 and if it works for us in it in the 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.360
 same site 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.120
 below the list 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.660
 in that restore and you are again 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.940
 system as it was before putting the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.280
 picture efe and you tell me and looked for 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.890
 See me you can comment on whatever 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.069
 and I'm going to see what could be the good mistake 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.090
 we give it to be encrypt indicate 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.480
 and here we look for the file that left the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.480
 description 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.190
 what is 42 camera 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.380
 and we give if it takes anything I do 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.280
 because I have already done it 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.590
 you simply give rabat and you already have 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.390
 when they load the rice you have power 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.390
 in your galaxy note 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.160
 good to tell you that 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.720
 Let me go pretty well and leave me 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.300
 in the comments to see how you are doing 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.470
 working with you with your hope 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.080
