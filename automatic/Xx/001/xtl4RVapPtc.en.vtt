 Welcome to the second part of the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.100
 facial meego what or 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.560
 tutorials and in this part has again 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.090
 some stuff for you to guest it 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.700
 again our Chancellor 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.750
 But let 's take a look again 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.420
 Changes at first glance can 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.570
 you do not realize so much now 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 but there are very fine and important 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.719
 changes in her face resp 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.489
 structural eyes and all have only 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.899
 I started her eyes 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.079
 enlarge with you something friendly 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.909
 Then I look at her 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.819
 eye color tv a nice green 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:56.600
 and finally I have a very nice one 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:01:01.039
 smile on the face conjured up 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.039
 But let's just start 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.880
 I think we start with the eyes 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.290
 First of all , we seek 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:12.800
 little control with the mouse wheel 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.140
 choose to draw the lasso symbol 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.490
 now a ring around your eyes 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.490
 I'll do it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.280
 Now I press the shift key 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.950
 go to the next eye stop the shift 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.230
 button set to the first point that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:45.479
 get rid of them and come back in a circle 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:50.729
 I now press right click go on 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.350
 a new level, see everything here 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.940
 on transparency is set approximately 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:03.450
 press ok now choose the color 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.979
 extra splash of color and think 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.760
 me a nice color in this case 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:17.489
 a nice blue so ok for the eyes 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.760
 out now but there is no problem going 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.450
 go up this little arrow up here 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.340
 down to color and zack that the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.650
 We do not want huskies because they have to 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.820
 Of course we will see it 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.970
 Do not pick anything up and almost make it 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.640
 the eyes are not okay and ask 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.640
 above the covering power down a bit 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:57.219
 a little bit of beautiful blue eyes 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.489
 so now we want to look in our eyes and 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:03.609
 take care of the mouth as we filter 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:07.859
 again eat something part one canon 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:16.230
 cancel selected environmental damage 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:16.230
 the correct right-click filter count 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:25.569
 So let's start with that 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.189
 eyes deliver something with your mouth through 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.400
 on 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.389
 for that we have the radius 35 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.480
 we move 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:37.090
 the formation selected and sound 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.769
 now something in the surrounding of her mouth 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.489
 their mouth angle and pull to 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:50.760
 above , they leave a nice smile 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:50.760
 they are friendly 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.980
 Now we go on to enlarge 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.950
 and this we do not care much about 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.210
 choose because of the defamation of the Council 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.650
 We do not want clowns eyes bigger 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.080
 I easily click twice 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:14.860
 we are already rubbing our eyes very intuitively 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:17.530
 looks so rosy out is ok yes 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.120
