00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.410
 Hello, welcome to the picture today, let's talk. 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.260
 yellow fever is yellow. 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.049
 a disease indicates several regions and 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.240
 theirs means that even good 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.120
 an endemic disease is one that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.960
 presents a high number of cases that 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.450
 are constant throughout the year in a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.449
 region and what are the 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.129
 endemic areas of the fedra marina 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.129
 yellow fever is a very common disease 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:39.179
 of Central America in tropical regions 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.640
 of South America and Africa and when 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.429
 transmitted disease is what we are going to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.089
 see now yellow fever is transmitted 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:52.079
 by a vector and that vector in the 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.749
 is the aedes aegypti that is the same 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 dengue virus vector but a lot 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.969
 personal attention only in the areas 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.909
 that the aedes aegypti is the vector of the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.489
 Yellow fever in wild areas by 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.799
 example in forest regions 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.039
 there are other vectors that will 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.680
 transmit this disease and we have already seen 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.399
 about dengue that females of aedes 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.469
 aegypti has the habit and killed like them 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.380
 feed on blood 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.380
 so when that daughter becomes a man 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.829
 contaminated it ends up acquiring 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.649
 books and reminiscing about eating 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.869
 blood base is very important for the 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.159
 development of the eggs of these 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.079
 mosquitoes 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.950
 So this female is now 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.770
 contaminated material may sting another person and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.240
 When she does this she ends inoculating 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.450
 the rivers and that person will stay 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.880
 contaminated 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.310
 and if a person is contaminated it 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.859
 can serve as the focus of infection to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.890
 other mosquitoes only from here person has one 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.840
 small detail in the wild regions 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.229
 in the forest regions 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.259
 there are natural reservoirs that are 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.090
 monkeys but what is the importance of 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.020
 be natural notorious 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.770
 well, the reservoirs harbor the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.670
 disease 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.810
 they are not able to contaminate 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.270
 directly 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.050
 the man but they are important foci 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.870
 of contamination for mosquitoes when 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.270
 a daughter feeds on the blood of 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.750
 a contaminated monkey she will also 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.430
 contaminated and can transmit the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.739
 virus for man 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.670
 Now let's talk about the symptoms of fever 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.099
 in the arena 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.069
 what are the symptoms of two good 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.090
 first symptom that is the most classic is 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.120
 the fever 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.459
 in addition it can happen chills 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.450
 muscle aches 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.330
 they can attack lymph node cells 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.690
 heart and liver and when they 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.950
 they attack if an injury happens and then 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.440
 with this injury 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.799
 several billiard segments as per 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.049
 example the bilirubin will be released 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.110
 and fall into the bloodstream 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.610
 these pigments will be deposited in the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.190
 skin of the person 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.620
 and then she begins to acquire a 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.560
 yellowish tint that we 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.100
 we call it jaundice and it's because of 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.190
 of this symptom that the name of fever appeared 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.480
 Yellow and how we can avoid 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.989
 yellow fever 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.140
 good if there is a vector the first measure 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:39.590
 is the fight against this vector that can be 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.019
 made using insect repellents 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.600
 it is very important that the residents of 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.230
 wild regions to use in their 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.410
 houses 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.560
 curtains and also a great 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.900
 prophylactic measure to eliminate 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.910
 mosquito breeding grounds when we already 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.790
 we talk in the dengue class 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.150
 these viruses can be passed to the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.180
 offspring from the eggs in the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.670
 it is very important to eliminate 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.850
 breeding eggs and where even 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.639
 this thin and releases the eggs good the eggs 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.209
 are released in clean water and stand 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.400
 then it is very important to eliminate these 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.979
 mosquito breeding sites and how we 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.039
 we do good first is very important 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.830
 cover water box and also swimming pools 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.840
 with a tarp to prevent contact 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.800
 mosquito with water 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.030
 moreover do not let 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.310
 the accumulated tire plant pots 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.340
 When I already said we can put 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.310
 sand in these containers to avoid 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.280
 accumulation of water and also eliminate 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.800
 any kind of utensil that can 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.669
 accumulate water during periods of 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.550
 rain 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:57.870
 but beyond all these measures there is 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.629
 vaccination against 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.479
 yellow fever is very effective and she 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.940
 causes few adverse effects and is very 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.639
 It is important to vaccinate people who 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.400
 travel to these endemic areas as 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.090
 for example for the Amazon region to 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.990
 forests of africa before traveling 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.020
 all these people should be vaccinated 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.610
 Good guys, we finished here. I hope. 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.620
 that have understood 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.830
 Next class, let's talk about 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.870
 viral diseases associated with the 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.819
 respiratory 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.819
 I'll wait you there, see you later
