00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.309
 so that's why I argue that it is necessary 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.730
 work with generic energies 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:14.759
 I was convinced that in 99 cases the roots 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 problems lies precisely in the family 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.150
 inside the generic interactions judge 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.240
 behaviors themselves in various 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.849
 situations we mostly endure with you 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.430
 from the family let's say the absence of love to you 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.980
 not the ability to understand and accept loved ones 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.290
 it is passed on from generation to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.320
 generation and growing like a snowy 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.350
 com 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:48.090
 what do you think is the reason 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:53.550
 hereditary diseases write 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:01:01.020
 please look in chat to link 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:03.359
 send see girls questions i'm at the end 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.320
 good because you don't want too much 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.909
 I am afraid to tell you 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.189
 karmic debts are not working out debts here 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:20.240
 one thinking is correct very quickly 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:24.229
 chat runs uniquely of course a lot 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.909
 reasons but let's admit the science of psychosomatics 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.400
 claims that the reason is available 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.500
 certain patterns of behavior and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.240
 thinking that is passed on from generation 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.829
 in generations and in general condition 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.500
 the presence of so-called hereditary 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.229
 diseases for example if everything in the family 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.420
 suffer from hypertension this happens 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:52.860
 because it is passed from parents to children 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.799
 a habit of suppressing anger probably you 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.990
 wondered why some families 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.320
 thrive while others live worse and worse 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.680
 worse because templates work 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.600
 behavior and thinking 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:12.380
 which scientists say now 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.840
 really affect the structure of dna and 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.360
 inherited or in general 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.120
 very interesting that science confirms 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.690
 presence and indeed interconnection 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.300
 explaining it by genes and dna 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.730
 so if there is no sound please write 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.690
 girls if someone does not have sound write 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.810
 please chat over 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.180
 thank 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.910
 Please help me with and 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.520
 medicine also confirms availability 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.640
 hereditary relationships and psychology 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.220
 she calls it scripts to which 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.880
 we take over from parents and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.080
 esoteric currents call it 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.530
 energy kind of by the way have an opinion 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.830
 that our dead ancestors become 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.820
 by our guardian angels and this on 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.700
 in fact, a lot of witnesses 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.540
 ancient writings say how many names 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.920
 their ancestors as you know you 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.510
 there will be guardian angels so look what 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.680
 you write basically every field 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:35.310
 science and the unknown in their own way a little 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.220
 talks about this topic but it's great that everything 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.580
 converge in one this is objective 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.400
 existing force that affects us 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:50.310
 and actually determines everything that we 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:54.299
 we have lives and what fate we have here 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.890
 let's talk about this when we 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.080
 face in life with some 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.180
 a problem 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.820
 Agree that speed and efficiency 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.000
 solutions to this problem will depend on 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.870
 how suitable tool we are 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.849
 to solve it chosen or when we 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.520
 We are trying to solve the problem that we have 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:19.520
 only kind 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.510
 at the level of yourself as an individual it is you in 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.700
 mostly it turns out a little why yes 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.330
 because the power of one person is she 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.210
 always less collective power or if 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:38.360
 speak esoterically language game dora 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:41.240
 and here plays a very important role 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.910
 such a problem as loyalty problem 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.510
 kind of heard anyone put it 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.680
 plus signs if someone heard we mean 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.110
 always consciously or unconsciously here 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.470
 heard great want to be with 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.830
 kind of we want to belong to the kind 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.340
 this is a deep human need and 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.320
 when our race is unhappy we are poor 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.040
 subconsciously can not afford 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:15.320
 be happy and rich now I see 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.540
 someone heard someone not because on 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.160
 really yeah feel 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.590
 part of the kind if we sort of break away from 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.200
 kind of we stay alone and this is in fact 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:33.470
 Actually let's say the human tragedy 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.560
 remember there is such a word freak whom we 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:42.920
 so call write in chat please 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:48.970
 what is a freak becomes rootless 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.970
 Natalia writes, let 's see who else wants 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.650
 blissful here of course whom so mom 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.720
 we called today about it too 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:02.450
 let's talk yes there are physical freaks there 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.240
 moral i mean where does the word come from 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.760
 gone but that's kind of kicked out of all 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.360
 right that is now our understanding 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.940
 freak is something terrible monstrous then 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.460
 there is such a non-human yes and in 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:21.080
 antiquity so called people who 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:25.710
 expelled from the family that is, they have the kind they 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:30.540
 about the kind they are in it expelled from the kind to 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:32.880
 that is, these people were deprived of such 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.740
 human good so human 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.040
 needs how to be in the family 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.370
 to be with the genus and enjoy what gives 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.380
 we have this energy and this topic 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.060
 loyalty we will also work out 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.920
 very deep in the main part of the training 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.120
 we will clear the sort programs 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:57.900
 to stay away from them but remaining in the gens 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:00.110
 that is, not leaving the lineage but remaining in 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.110
 family
