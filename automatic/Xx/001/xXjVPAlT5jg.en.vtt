00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
a lot of years now and it works in lakes

a lot of years now and it works in lakes
rivers<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:01.990> rust<00:02:02.320> pores<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.799> keep<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.460> in

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
rivers and rust pores so keep that in

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.490 
rivers and rust pores so keep that in
