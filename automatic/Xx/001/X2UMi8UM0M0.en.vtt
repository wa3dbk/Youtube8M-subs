then we come back into an assembling
dive<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.240> whole<00:05:15.389> skate<00:05:15.630> beat<00:05:15.780> this

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
dive of the whole skate beat this

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.640 
dive of the whole skate beat this
watching<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.639> okay<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:18.630> we<00:05:18.960> did<00:05:19.139> the<00:05:19.320> grip

watching and okay so we did the grip
tape<00:05:19.830> off<00:05:20.099> camera<00:05:20.580> because<00:05:21.000> well<00:05:21.930> it's<00:05:22.050> kind

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
tape off camera because well it's kind

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.980 
tape off camera because well it's kind
of<00:05:22.260> hassle<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.650> do<00:05:22.770> on<00:05:22.919> camera<00:05:23.340> because<00:05:23.669> uh<00:05:23.990> it

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
of hassle to do on camera because uh it

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.960 
of hassle to do on camera because uh it
takes<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.229> little<00:05:25.349> while<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:25.919> we<00:05:26.580> decided<00:05:26.880> you

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
takes a little while so we decided you

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.460 
takes a little while so we decided you
don't<00:05:27.060> want<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.330> see<00:05:27.419> it<00:05:27.479> anyways<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:28.260> since

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
don't want to see it anyways but since

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.350 
don't want to see it anyways but since
last<00:05:28.620> time<00:05:28.860> we've<00:05:29.099> added<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.550> Grizzly<00:05:30.060> cutout

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
last time we've added the Grizzly cutout

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.089 
last time we've added the Grizzly cutout
sticker<00:05:30.659> right<00:05:30.750> by<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.080> truck<00:05:31.409> so<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.770> doesn't

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
sticker right by the truck so it doesn't

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.430 
sticker right by the truck so it doesn't
interfere<00:05:32.760> with<00:05:32.970> grinding<00:05:33.479> same<00:05:34.080> thing<00:05:34.289> with

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
interfere with grinding same thing with

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.629 
interfere with grinding same thing with
the<00:05:34.560> Shake<00:05:34.830> Junt<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:36.389> bone<00:05:36.750> sticker<00:05:37.139> so<00:05:37.860> I

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
the Shake Junt and the bone sticker so I

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.800 
the Shake Junt and the bone sticker so I
think<00:05:39.539> the<00:05:39.690> first<00:05:39.840> thing<00:05:40.080> we're<00:05:40.199> gonna<00:05:40.260> do<00:05:40.560> is

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
think the first thing we're gonna do is

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:49.500 
think the first thing we're gonna do is
Mount<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:44.630> trucks<00:05:45.630> on<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:46.500> deck<00:05:47.010> itself

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.260 

so<00:05:50.200> we<00:05:50.320> got<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.560> shakedown<00:05:50.950> Hardware<00:05:51.700> in<00:05:51.970> to

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
so we got the shakedown Hardware in to

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.840 
so we got the shakedown Hardware in to
support<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.170> trucks<00:05:53.800> we<00:05:54.460> got<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:54.700> two
