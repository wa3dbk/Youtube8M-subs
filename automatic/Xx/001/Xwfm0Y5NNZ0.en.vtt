00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.540
 who is minim Market the need is spacious 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.979
 Panini maximum 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:13.889
 sounds like contradiction but no one in the so-called mini-vans fits more 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.869
 purely as the external dimensions presumably also the reason why the 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.000
 Market share of dwarves carriages in the small car segment 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.409
 has risen to 20 percent 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.999
 Toyota recognized this trend, or rather recognized it 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.289
 because about ten years ago, the Japanese had the year so who ever 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.100
 such a small loadmaster 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.090
 the production was discontinued though 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.630
 Now, however, the time seems ripe for a new edition in the spring brings 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.320
 Toyota the verso-s in the market 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.340
 and who is something again OBA Minit the mini-vans 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.370
 with a length of only three meters 99 it is about 30 centimeters shorter than 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.790
 Competitors Opel Meriva 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.240
 short IAA but also good 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.920
 Thanks to the good space flight unit, the interior is by no means cramped 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.370
 the seating position is comfortable the chairs are comfortably upholstered and 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.380
 many storage compartments make the verso-s travel-ready 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.570
 the large panoramic roof is nice but costs 450 euros extra 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.110
 less beautiful the wild plastic material mix that the Toyota has despite 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.520
 Good workmanship looks cheaper than he is in the back seat 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 convinced that space offer the great legroom but then surprised 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.259
 Almost a miracle borders the trunk volume 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.529
 The Verso swallows 429 liters of a much longer Opel Meriva Nimke 30 

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:43.030
 Liters less 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 when folded back seat, the volume grows to a considerable 1000 388 liters 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.930
 driving also lies in the short spice of verso-s with his taut 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.719
 landing gear 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.510
 Sprit goes around the curves 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.690
 the steering is precise and the body so clearly makes 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.690
 Japanese also in narrow streets really fun 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.500
 We would like to say that this is only in the lettering for sports 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.790
 could stand but unfortunately this is not at least if under the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.310
 Hood 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.310
 a one-point, 3-liter displacement dwarfed 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.309
 the 99 hp gasoline is just tired 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:24.680
 Toyota has also recognized and offers against 1000 275 euros surcharge 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.779
 a continuously variable automatic 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.060
 that has the advantage 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.270
 that keeps them at the hardest speeding up the engine block 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.849
 and compensate for the torque distribution 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.660
 Nevertheless, we do not recommend the automatic 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.399
 the reason 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.399
 the verso-s is so from the Leisetreter 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.689
 really good d this standard consumption of only 5 liters 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:48.740
 only 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.279
 if you caress the gas pedal 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.429
 So the verso-s is a recommendation 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:55.489
 absolute 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.609
 but only if one orders the small Toyota with the 90-ps-diesel although one can 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.120
 the extra charge of 2350 euros barely out but the diesel thieves were clear 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.969
 better 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.180
 speak in the end 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.560
 for the verso-s the very good Mrs. MÃ¼hl colony the good suspension 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.939
 and the best-in-class consumption 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.499
 he likes her
