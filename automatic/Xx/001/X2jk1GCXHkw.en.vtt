okay okay I'm Brian and this is a little

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.639 
okay okay I'm Brian and this is a little
bit<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.910> CNC<00:00:06.390> machine<00:00:06.779> I'm<00:00:07.109> just<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.560> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
bit of the CNC machine I'm just going to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.730 
bit of the CNC machine I'm just going to
it'll<00:00:08.400> probably<00:00:08.580> be<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> few<00:00:09.150> videos<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:10.200> tell

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
it'll probably be a few videos to tell

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.180 
it'll probably be a few videos to tell
you<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.070> work<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.550> um<00:00:12.710> let's<00:00:13.710> see<00:00:13.920> here

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
you how to work it um let's see here

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.630 
you how to work it um let's see here
first<00:00:14.790> off<00:00:15.030> if<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.389> notice<00:00:15.830> we<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.070> piece

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
first off if you notice we have a piece

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
first off if you notice we have a piece
of<00:00:17.670> scrap<00:00:18.119> board<00:00:18.390> just<00:00:18.720> sort<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.990> clamped<00:00:19.529> to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
of scrap board just sort of clamped to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.890 
of scrap board just sort of clamped to
it<00:00:21.650> okay<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.910> we're<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.539> is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
it okay and what we're going to do is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080 
it okay and what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.890> if<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.340> mill

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
we're going to just see if we can mill

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.019 
we're going to just see if we can mill
out<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> name<00:00:27.660> or<00:00:27.990> something<00:00:28.289> simple<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.250> see

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
out a name or something simple and see

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.770 
out a name or something simple and see
what<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.390> all<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:31.219> okay<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:33.149> software

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
what we get all right okay the software

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.700 
what we get all right okay the software
that<00:00:33.809> we're<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> use<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.219> called<00:00:35.430> EMC

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
that we're going to use is called EMC

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.330 
that we're going to use is called EMC
your<00:00:37.710> e<00:00:38.010> mc2<00:00:38.750> this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.930> an<00:00:40.050> ubuntu<00:00:40.530> system<00:00:41.100> on

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
your e mc2 this is an ubuntu system on

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.420 
your e mc2 this is an ubuntu system on
an<00:00:41.910> old<00:00:42.149> laptop<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.110> GUI<00:00:46.620> interface<00:00:46.829> for

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
an old laptop and the GUI interface for

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.690 
an old laptop and the GUI interface for
emc<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.180> called<00:00:48.510> axis<00:00:49.170> okay<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.160> comes<00:00:50.190> up

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
emc is called axis okay so here comes up

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.330 
emc is called axis okay so here comes up
EMC<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.539> actual<00:00:51.809> controller<00:00:52.379> whereas

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
EMC is the actual controller whereas

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.670 
EMC is the actual controller whereas
access<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.829> is<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.940> software<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> runs

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
access is the is the software that runs

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.390 
access is the is the software that runs
it<00:00:58.980> okay<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> basically<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it okay and so basically we have the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.390 
it okay and so basically we have the
Machine<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.409> down<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.220> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
Machine and down here what you have is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.300 
Machine and down here what you have is
you<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:09.030> g<00:01:09.270> code<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.280> here

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you have your g code and then up here

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.140 
you have your g code and then up here
you<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.150> controls<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.080> machine

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
you have the controls for the machine

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
you have the controls for the machine
and<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.439> takes<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.040> bit<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and you know this takes a little bit of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
and you know this takes a little bit of
it's<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:18.150> worth<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> read<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's actually worth it to read the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.649 
it's actually worth it to read the
instructions<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.939> big<00:01:21.119> thing<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.450> need<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
instructions the big thing you need to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.859 
instructions the big thing you need to
know<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.200> f1<00:01:23.070> will<00:01:23.340> turn<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.479> if

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
know is f1 will turn it off so if you if

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.770 
know is f1 will turn it off so if you if
anything<00:01:25.140> goes<00:01:25.470> crazy<00:01:25.860> hit<00:01:26.220> f1<00:01:26.780> eventually

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
anything goes crazy hit f1 eventually

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.510 
anything goes crazy hit f1 eventually
I'll<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.610> better<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.710> stop<00:01:32.130> button

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
I'll have a better you know stop button

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.359 
I'll have a better you know stop button
but<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> yet<00:01:33.439> okay<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.159> what

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
but I don't have that yet okay so what

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.260 
but I don't have that yet okay so what
we're<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.850> we're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.150> turn

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
we're going to do is we're going to turn

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.719 
we're going to do is we're going to turn
on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.540> machine<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.409> guy<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.950> that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
on the machine that's this guy and that

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.580 
on the machine that's this guy and that
toggles<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> power<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.840> f<00:01:40.110> 2<00:01:40.729> i'ma<00:01:41.729> hit<00:01:41.909> f2

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
toggles the power that's f 2 i'ma hit f2

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.060 
toggles the power that's f 2 i'ma hit f2
make<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> focusing<00:01:44.280> no<00:01:45.210> focus<00:01:45.960> okay<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.439> i<00:01:46.950> have

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
make it focusing no focus okay so i have

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.980 
make it focusing no focus okay so i have
have<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.640> hit<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.530> if<00:01:49.530> i<00:01:49.860> use<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.579> arrow<00:01:50.880> keys

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
have to hit and if i use the arrow keys

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.399 
have to hit and if i use the arrow keys
you<00:01:51.990> will<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.439> better<00:01:52.920> watch<00:01:53.159> where<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.850> are

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
you will see better watch where you are

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.580 
you will see better watch where you are
you'll<00:01:55.409> see<00:01:55.680> they'll<00:01:55.890> start<00:01:56.219> moving

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you'll see they'll start moving

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.380 
you'll see they'll start moving
so<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.890> it<00:01:59.920> coming<00:02:00.280> towards<00:02:00.700> me<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.119> can't

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
so is it coming towards me you can't

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.820 
so is it coming towards me you can't
tell<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:02.340> should<00:02:03.340> be<00:02:03.930> okay<00:02:04.930> that's<00:02:05.500> actually

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
tell I should be okay that's actually

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.669 
tell I should be okay that's actually
going<00:02:06.009> kind<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.460> slow

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.500 

it's<00:02:09.679> going<00:02:09.979> forward<00:02:10.369> backwards<00:02:10.880> I'm

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
it's going forward backwards I'm

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.940 
it's going forward backwards I'm
actually<00:02:11.800> adjusting<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.150> x-axis<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.830> if<00:02:15.830> I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
actually adjusting the x-axis and if I

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.150 
actually adjusting the x-axis and if I
use<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.550> down<00:02:16.640> you'll<00:02:17.630> see<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.350> Y<00:02:18.680> is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
use the up and down you'll see the Y is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.250 
use the up and down you'll see the Y is
going<00:02:19.430> back<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.000> forth<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.569> case<00:02:23.870> if

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
going back and forth and in this case if

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.010 
going back and forth and in this case if
I<00:02:24.500> hit<00:02:24.770> page<00:02:25.040> up<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.340> page<00:02:25.490> down<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:27.320> is<00:02:27.800> my

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
I hit page up and page down that is my

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.000 
I hit page up and page down that is my
that<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.050> my<00:02:30.590> z<00:02:31.340> axis<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:32.060> page<00:02:32.270> up<00:02:32.510> page<00:02:32.540> down

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.039 

and<00:02:37.860> XY<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.189> that's<00:02:39.370> how<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:39.610> draw<00:02:39.879> and<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.840> lot

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
and XY and that's how you draw and a lot

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.869 
and XY and that's how you draw and a lot
of<00:02:41.079> it<00:02:41.290> kind<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.590> works<00:02:41.829> exactly<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.549> the

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
of it kind of works exactly like the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.319 
of it kind of works exactly like the
like<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:45.909> other<00:02:46.470> like<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.620> laser<00:02:47.799> cutter

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
like the other like the laser cutter

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.259 
like the other like the laser cutter
okay<00:02:49.329> um<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.590> jog<00:02:50.890> speed<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.459> can<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:51.970> crank

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
okay um the jog speed I can really crank

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.960 
okay um the jog speed I can really crank
this<00:02:52.510> up<00:02:52.569> to<00:02:52.959> about<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.470> know<00:02:53.500> 20<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.220> 25

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
this up to about you know 20 to 25

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.390 
this up to about you know 20 to 25
inches<00:02:55.390> per<00:02:56.200> minute<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.159> here<00:02:58.440> okay<00:02:59.440> so

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
inches per minute like in here okay so

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.160 
inches per minute like in here okay so
25<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.629> you'll<00:03:01.780> see<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.140> moves<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.040> lot<00:03:03.220> more

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
25 and you'll see it moves a lot more

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:14.370 
25 and you'll see it moves a lot more
there's<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.260> lot<00:03:05.439> faster

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.290 

see<00:03:15.160> that

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
see that

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.970 
see that
and<00:03:18.300> generally<00:03:18.780> speaking<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.770> to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
and generally speaking what you have to

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.340 
and generally speaking what you have to
do<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.400> have<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.760> home<00:03:20.970> your<00:03:21.240> machine<00:03:21.660> now

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
do is you have to home your machine now

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.160 
do is you have to home your machine now
since<00:03:22.770> i<00:03:22.920> don't<00:03:22.980> have<00:03:23.510> limit<00:03:24.510> switches<00:03:24.810> on

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
since i don't have limit switches on

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.990 
since i don't have limit switches on
this<00:03:25.440> i<00:03:25.620> can't<00:03:25.860> have<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.160> automatically<00:03:26.700> home

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
this i can't have it automatically home

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.190 
this i can't have it automatically home
but<00:03:27.930> at<00:03:28.050> some<00:03:28.260> point<00:03:28.290> i'll<00:03:28.620> do<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:29.690> ok<00:03:30.690> so

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
but at some point i'll do that ok so

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.900 
but at some point i'll do that ok so
let's<00:03:31.410> go<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> let's<00:03:31.920> say<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
let's go to let's say that that is the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
let's go to let's say that that is the
home<00:03:33.120> space<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.910> i'm<00:03:35.910> going<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.240> make<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.660> go

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
home space and i'm going to make that go

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.860 
home space and i'm going to make that go
just<00:03:37.320> about<00:03:37.590> there<00:03:38.240> and<00:03:39.240> i'm<00:03:39.510> going<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.690> bring

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
just about there and i'm going to bring

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.250 
just about there and i'm going to bring
that<00:03:39.900> z<00:03:40.440> axis<00:03:40.950> all<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.400> way<00:03:41.550> down<00:03:41.840> until<00:03:42.840> it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
that z axis all the way down until it

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.860 
that z axis all the way down until it
just<00:03:43.560> touches<00:03:44.000> okay<00:03:45.440> got<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:47.600> now<00:03:48.600> if<00:03:48.750> you

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
just touches okay got that now if you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.000 
just touches okay got that now if you
look<00:03:49.050> over<00:03:49.260> here<00:03:51.680> my<00:03:53.960> darn<00:03:54.960> thing<00:03:55.230> i<00:03:55.470> can<00:03:55.800> hit

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
look over here my darn thing i can hit

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.400 
look over here my darn thing i can hit
home<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.520> access<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.150> i<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.360> click<00:03:57.570> on<00:03:57.630> x<00:03:58.110> and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
home the access so i can click on x and

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.430 
home the access so i can click on x and
i<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.680> hit<00:03:58.830> home<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.460> then<00:04:00.390> y<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:01.020> hit<00:04:01.200> home

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
i can hit home and then y and hit home

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.080 
i can hit home and then y and hit home
and<00:04:02.160> then<00:04:02.460> Z<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.390> all<00:04:03.690> ok<00:04:04.440> now<00:04:05.280> if<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.850> look

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
and then Z and it all ok now if you look

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.690 
and then Z and it all ok now if you look
at<00:04:06.390> let's<00:04:07.350> see<00:04:07.470> if<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.650> sweep<00:04:07.980> this<00:04:08.190> thing<00:04:08.250> up<00:04:08.580> a

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
at let's see if I sweep this thing up a

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.530 
at let's see if I sweep this thing up a
little<00:04:08.940> bit<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:10.470> there<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.010> there<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:11.910> my<00:04:12.270> whole

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
little bit so there is there is my whole

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.950 
little bit so there is there is my whole
machine<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.580> it's<00:04:14.580> going<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.850> start<00:04:15.270> right

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
machine and it's going to start right

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.770 
machine and it's going to start right
there<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:17.010> then<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.820> will<00:04:18.000> start<00:04:18.330> cutting

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
there and then it will start cutting

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.910 
there and then it will start cutting
this<00:04:18.930> e<00:04:19.230> mc2<00:04:20.330> axis<00:04:21.330> okay<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.380> e<00:04:22.410> mc2

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
this e mc2 axis okay and that e mc2

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.660 
this e mc2 axis okay and that e mc2
access<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.880> basically<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.750> code<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:26.220> this

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
access is basically the code that this

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.700 
access is basically the code that this
thing<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.330> set<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.490> do<00:04:29.700> okay<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.780> if<00:04:31.620> you

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
thing is set to to do okay and if you

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.470 
thing is set to to do okay and if you
look<00:04:31.920> at<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.070> code<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.730> don't<00:04:33.120> know<00:04:33.180> if<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.330> can

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
look at the code I don't know if you can

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.780 
look at the code I don't know if you can
see<00:04:33.720> this<00:04:33.900> real<00:04:34.200> well<00:04:35.330> let's<00:04:36.330> see<00:04:36.480> here<00:04:37.790> this

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
see this real well let's see here this

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.960 
see this real well let's see here this
this<00:04:39.060> pound<00:04:39.960> one<00:04:40.440> these<00:04:40.920> are<00:04:41.100> variables<00:04:41.580> okay

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
this pound one these are variables okay

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.770 
this pound one these are variables okay
and<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.780> see<00:04:43.020> pound<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.760> cut<00:04:45.120> depth<00:04:45.480> is

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
and if you see pound to the cut depth is

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.190 
and if you see pound to the cut depth is
point<00:04:46.200> 0<00:04:46.380> 1<00:04:46.830> inches<00:04:47.400> okay<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.840> if<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.050> were<00:04:49.170> to

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
point 0 1 inches okay so so if I were to

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.360 
point 0 1 inches okay so so if I were to
start<00:04:49.560> this<00:04:49.800> thing<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:51.060> will<00:04:51.180> see<00:04:55.070> don't<00:04:56.070> want

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
start this thing you will see don't want

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.310 
start this thing you will see don't want
to<00:04:56.490> only<00:04:56.790> pull<00:04:57.180> that<00:04:57.390> back<00:04:57.600> up<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.960> little<00:04:58.110> bit

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
to only pull that back up a little bit

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.060 
to only pull that back up a little bit
okay<00:04:58.800> if<00:04:59.070> you<00:04:59.700> see<00:05:00.500> g20<00:05:01.500> I'm<00:05:01.620> not<00:05:01.770> sure<00:05:01.920> what

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
okay if you see g20 I'm not sure what

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.830 
okay if you see g20 I'm not sure what
that<00:05:02.100> one<00:05:02.370> does<00:05:02.780> but<00:05:03.780> then<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.890> says<00:05:05.190> go<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.880> z

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
that one does but then it says go to z

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.010 
that one does but then it says go to z
axis<00:05:07.590> be<00:05:07.860> g20<00:05:08.700> prime<00:05:08.940> means<00:05:09.150> go<00:05:09.390> back<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.810> home

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
axis be g20 prime means go back to home

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.290 
axis be g20 prime means go back to home
and<00:05:10.350> then<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.850> z<00:05:12.260> z-1<00:05:13.610> will<00:05:14.610> mean<00:05:14.850> drop<00:05:15.120> it

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
and then the z z-1 will mean drop it

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.120 
and then the z z-1 will mean drop it
down<00:05:15.450> point<00:05:15.930> 0<00:05:16.680> 1<00:05:17.010> inches<00:05:17.580> okay<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.920> and<00:05:19.920> then

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
down point 0 1 inches okay and and then

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.010 
down point 0 1 inches okay and and then
it<00:05:20.280> would<00:05:20.430> just<00:05:20.460> start<00:05:20.850> going<00:05:21.060> now<00:05:21.780> what<00:05:21.930> I'm

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
it would just start going now what I'm

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.320 
it would just start going now what I'm
going<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.170> do<00:05:22.380> here<00:05:22.410> I'm<00:05:22.950> going<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.250> pull<00:05:24.180> that

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
going to do here I'm going to pull that

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.150 
going to do here I'm going to pull that
z<00:05:24.630> axis

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
z axis

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.260 
z axis
up<00:05:25.340> a<00:05:25.490> little<00:05:25.760> bit<00:05:26.950> again<00:05:27.950> f1<00:05:28.550> will<00:05:28.760> stop<00:05:29.060> the

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
up a little bit again f1 will stop the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.510 
up a little bit again f1 will stop the
machine<00:05:29.630> ok<00:05:30.290> so<00:05:30.350> I'm<00:05:30.710> going<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:30.950> be<00:05:31.070> ready<00:05:31.280> with

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
machine ok so I'm going to be ready with

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.110 
machine ok so I'm going to be ready with
f1<00:05:31.940> in<00:05:32.120> case<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:32.510> screws<00:05:32.870> up<00:05:33.340> I'm<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:34.940> to<00:05:35.030> go

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
f1 in case it screws up I'm going to go

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.380 
f1 in case it screws up I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.390> and<00:05:35.660> home<00:05:36.350> home<00:05:37.130> that<00:05:37.430> z<00:05:37.730> axis<00:05:38.210> so

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
ahead and and home home that z axis so

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.120 
ahead and and home home that z axis so
I'm<00:05:38.450> going<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.660> tell<00:05:38.870> z<00:05:40.090> that<00:05:41.090> that<00:05:41.930> is<00:05:42.170> zero<00:05:42.530> ok

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
I'm going to tell z that that is zero ok

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.720 
I'm going to tell z that that is zero ok
so<00:05:43.190> it's<00:05:43.520> not<00:05:43.670> going<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:43.970> cut<00:05:44.240> anything<00:05:45.730> right

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
so it's not going to cut anything right

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.320 
so it's not going to cut anything right
now<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:48.080> and<00:05:48.440> what<00:05:49.190> i<00:05:49.220> can<00:05:49.460> do<00:05:49.640> is<00:05:49.670> i<00:05:49.880> can<00:05:49.910> test

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
now and and what i can do is i can test

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.350 
now and and what i can do is i can test
to<00:05:50.450> see<00:05:50.720> that<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.020> XY<00:05:51.470> is<00:05:51.500> going<00:05:52.160> and<00:05:52.340> then<00:05:53.000> and

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
to see that the XY is going and then and

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.820 
to see that the XY is going and then and
then<00:05:53.540> we'll<00:05:53.720> let<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:54.050> ziggo<00:05:56.530> i'm<00:05:57.530> going<00:05:57.710> to<00:05:57.770> go

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
then we'll let the ziggo i'm going to go

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.800 
then we'll let the ziggo i'm going to go
ahead<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.100> hit<00:05:58.280> run<00:05:58.580> there's<00:05:59.210> no<00:05:59.390> point<00:05:59.660> me

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
ahead and hit run there's no point me

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.730 
ahead and hit run there's no point me
turning<00:06:00.080> on<00:06:00.290> the<00:06:00.530> router<00:06:00.910> because<00:06:02.740> because

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
turning on the router because because

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.640 
turning on the router because because
the<00:06:03.950> z<00:06:04.160> is<00:06:04.280> where<00:06:04.550> it<00:06:04.670> is<00:06:04.820> ok<00:06:05.540> but<00:06:06.320> again<00:06:06.620> i

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
the z is where it is ok but again i

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:15.689 
the z is where it is ok but again i
would<00:06:06.770> be<00:06:06.980> ready<00:06:07.220> to<00:06:08.060> hit<00:06:08.510> f1<00:06:09.290> if<00:06:09.440> I<00:06:09.590> need<00:06:09.770> to

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.119 

so<00:06:16.699> it<00:06:17.060> would<00:06:17.240> actually<00:06:17.419> be<00:06:17.770> cutting<00:06:18.770> at<00:06:18.919> this

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:19.129 
so it would actually be cutting at this

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.680 
so it would actually be cutting at this
point

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.060 

see<00:06:23.690> how<00:06:23.780> that<00:06:23.840> works

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.930 

so<00:06:29.070> it's<00:06:29.250> cutting<00:06:29.610> the<00:06:29.760> M

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:59.080 

okay<00:06:34.940> and<00:06:35.330> we're<00:06:35.509> still<00:06:35.810> above

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.570 

likes<00:06:59.810> to<00:06:59.900> talk<00:07:00.230> to<00:07:00.470> you<00:07:02.889> okay<00:07:03.889> so<00:07:03.949> now<00:07:04.310> it's

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
likes to talk to you okay so now it's

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.510 
likes to talk to you okay so now it's
going<00:07:04.820> to<00:07:05.000> cut<00:07:05.300> the<00:07:05.600> a<00:07:07.840> now<00:07:09.070> oddly<00:07:10.070> enough<00:07:10.100> I

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
going to cut the a now oddly enough I

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.730 
going to cut the a now oddly enough I
wasn't<00:07:10.880> really<00:07:11.030> thinking<00:07:11.120> about<00:07:11.630> this<00:07:12.050> it

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
wasn't really thinking about this it

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.670 
wasn't really thinking about this it
turns<00:07:13.040> out<00:07:13.280> that<00:07:13.340> going<00:07:14.440> it's<00:07:15.440> actually

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
turns out that going it's actually

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.460 
turns out that going it's actually
cutting<00:07:16.250> this<00:07:16.729> is<00:07:16.970> my<00:07:17.180> x-axis<00:07:17.630> coming<00:07:18.320> this

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
cutting this is my x-axis coming this

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.430 
cutting this is my x-axis coming this
way<00:07:18.740> and<00:07:19.370> my<00:07:19.580> y-axis<00:07:19.850> is<00:07:20.389> like<00:07:20.750> that<00:07:20.990> so<00:07:21.229> it's

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
way and my y-axis is like that so it's

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.040 
way and my y-axis is like that so it's
actually<00:07:21.590> cutting<00:07:22.130> it<00:07:22.430> a<00:07:22.639> little<00:07:23.630> bit

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
actually cutting it a little bit

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.900 
actually cutting it a little bit
cattywampus<00:07:24.470> in<00:07:25.100> other<00:07:25.250> words<00:07:25.490> I<00:07:25.580> should<00:07:25.610> have

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 
cattywampus in other words I should have

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.390 
cattywampus in other words I should have
probably<00:07:26.090> clamped<00:07:26.750> that<00:07:27.650> thing<00:07:27.979> going<00:07:28.340> to

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
probably clamped that thing going to

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.210 
probably clamped that thing going to
cross<00:07:28.760> this<00:07:29.180> way<00:07:29.479> and<00:07:30.410> maybe<00:07:30.620> we'll<00:07:30.889> do<00:07:31.070> that

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:31.220 
cross this way and maybe we'll do that

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.500 
cross this way and maybe we'll do that
before<00:07:31.400> we<00:07:31.700> start<00:07:32.710> make<00:07:33.710> sense<00:07:33.919> I<00:07:34.419> was<00:07:35.419> like

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:35.510 
before we start make sense I was like

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.420 
before we start make sense I was like
why<00:07:35.720> in<00:07:35.870> this<00:07:35.990> thing<00:07:36.200> to<00:07:36.350> work<00:07:39.010> and<00:07:40.010> one<00:07:40.250> of<00:07:40.340> the

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.430 
why in this thing to work and one of the

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.030 
why in this thing to work and one of the
things<00:07:40.490> i<00:07:40.790> want<00:07:41.000> to<00:07:41.060> do<00:07:41.240> is<00:07:41.450> I<00:07:41.570> want<00:07:41.600> to<00:07:41.900> I<00:07:42.139> want

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.040 
things i want to do is I want to I want

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.719 
things i want to do is I want to I want
to<00:07:43.310> make<00:07:43.460> this<00:07:43.700> these<00:07:44.270> wires<00:07:45.160> go<00:07:46.160> here<00:07:46.520> so<00:07:46.669> I

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:46.729 
to make this these wires go here so I

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:49.150 
to make this these wires go here so I
can<00:07:46.790> move<00:07:47.000> this<00:07:47.240> thing<00:07:47.479> out<00:07:47.750> here<00:07:47.810> so<00:07:48.770> that<00:07:48.979> way

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.160 
can move this thing out here so that way

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.060 
can move this thing out here so that way
my<00:07:49.190> ex<00:07:49.580> really<00:07:50.060> is<00:07:50.240> where<00:07:50.750> X<00:07:51.020> should<00:07:51.289> be<00:07:51.500> as

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.070 
my ex really is where X should be as

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.770 
my ex really is where X should be as
opposed<00:07:52.430> to<00:07:52.669> where<00:07:52.880> why<00:07:53.060> were<00:07:53.360> you<00:07:53.510> needing<00:07:53.660> a

opposed to where why were you needing a

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:59.980 
opposed to where why were you needing a
mantle<00:07:54.169> mystery<00:07:54.560> yeah<00:07:55.160> um<00:07:58.240> so<00:07:59.240> let's<00:07:59.510> see<00:07:59.750> here

00:07:59.980 --> 00:07:59.990 
mantle mystery yeah um so let's see here

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.120 
mantle mystery yeah um so let's see here
go<00:08:00.500> ahead<00:08:00.710> and<00:08:00.830> go<00:08:01.100> ahead<00:08:01.250> and<00:08:01.370> hit<00:08:01.460> pause<00:08:01.729> and
