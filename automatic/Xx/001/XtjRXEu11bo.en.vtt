00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.130
 the text on this banner leaves nothing to be 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.400
 wish about this is passion this is struggle 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.320
 and now Sunday became the training of PSV 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.759
 attended by numerous fans a lot 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.080
 success and so everyone was happy to attend 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.309
 are on the re-walk 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.590
 the money for the supporters that applies 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.730
 also for the media but before we get over 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.420
 those peaks from next Sunday 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.890
 to talk 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.660
 first we want to know about phillip cocu 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.380
 what you think of heracles as 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.180
 opponent in the NFL cup final 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 yes have played excellent match 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.980
 raz 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.320
 me sure and from the site who they are 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.969
 have won so it can be one 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.660
 can be very nice final I think 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.800
 heracles also a yeast soccer team 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 find footballing solutions 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 so we look forward so far but not 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.399
 nice opponent for the final 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.860
 it is indeed not that far yet 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.260
 next Sunday ajax from a whole 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.969
 important competition in the battle for the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.860
 national title and under delicious 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.480
 prepare for spring-like conditions 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.010
 psv is ahead of the tops of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.390
 this Sunday 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.570
 yes i would of course it is one of them 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.750
 the tom competitions ajax wins last 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 turns well how the good series put down 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.420
 after the end of the competition after the so 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 the interests are very important 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.200
 match it is not that Sunday the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.490
 competition becomes all people 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.900
 everything but I think with good 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.750
 results that you have a whole 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.799
 good step every year I look 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.030
 there again to one 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.530
 like any other competition 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.950
 there are not that many matches 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.299
 more to play so what what do we want 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.299
 and how do we want to achieve that 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.950
 and that's what we're going to try to do 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.330
 Sunday against higher so that has been tried 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.350
 get three points 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.030
 how far have those past two 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.280
 victories against heerenveen your 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.590
 strengthened in the fact that you are already inside 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.479
 are on the right track for a short time 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.250
 well i have results that is none with you 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.770
 needed a few sentences difficult situation 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.210
 sit with one with the team we good 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.560
 results achieved have all been hard 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.149
 worked for 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.450
 naturally gives trust 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.860
 grows with results achieved 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.450
 that's why we deal with confidence 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.740
 Amsterdam 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.149
 in the matches last week 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.110
 against valencia and the double against 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.310
 heerenveen 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.590
 get the phillip cocu some already 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.179
 small nuances in the team 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.310
 And so it is the question of monthly 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.650
 plays hutchinson again and which one 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.810
 two from the labyad and trio vinaldalum 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.340
 lens start 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.010
 well on the setups let 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.180
 nothing about of course but to 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.569
 we will have to make choices 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.580
 to become 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.140
 well that is part of it and the more 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.660
 choices I have to make that means we 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.760
 many players are fit it is for 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.170
 team only draw well because you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.519
 competition then hold each other 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.930
 sharp was perhaps whole 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.590
 remarkable I have you in this phase of 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.750
 the competition 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.910
 everyone fit on board yes but that 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.670
 can also be important 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.560
 The final stage that you can all players 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.990
 use that he is fit 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.400
 Mary very happy with a nice one 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.050
 incidental Sunday at the top 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.970
 against ajax is of course that franc the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.860
 farmer and phillip cocu each other for a long time 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.630
 know very well they play together at 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.150
 Barcelona they played together in it 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.450
 Dutch team and were both too 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.700
 assistant trainer 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.470
 makes bert van marwijk under national coach 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.000
 that that match is even more special 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.370
 form 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.890
 your hard hair that respect is duel 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.760
 special competition especially now chose 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.160
 the one and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.810
 and he also that that gives a competition 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.010
 a special touch but it is not 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.870
 that it will make him go differently 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.730
 approach with all success alone 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.560
 not on Sunday afternoon and vice versa 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.470
 also things 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.940
 a realistic phillip cocu with him 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.400
 Hans Faber and Chris van der Weerden as 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.190
 now technical trio psv are preparing 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.810
