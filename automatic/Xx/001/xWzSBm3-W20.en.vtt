00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:11.180
 Yes, one of among is Hideyuki you Hello Amaha influence that is a question well 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:16.560
 Should I take the penalty first when turning a curve? 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:21.240
 We will talk about whether it is better to take out the winker first 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 When you say from the answer It is better to have you take out from this blinker 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.230
 Is it 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 While thinking about it, I tried to put out a little bit of meaning in various ways 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.430
 First of all 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.090
 Hear say and bend Well as here implications Yes I am 25 when masu blinker 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.470
 Tower 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:49.090
 After all , whether there is a meaning that the turn signal is issued because it stays in the park and stop there 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.490
 I think so lately because there are so many cars that everyone will respond with this hazard 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:56.180
 I want to be a blinker 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:59.540
 If you say so , I think it seems like it is only the intention to turn 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.510
 On the other hand, regarding the brakes 8 rounds 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.989
 Hey you 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:11.250
 Meaning that say stop because is intended to stop brake 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:15.090
 And then the principle for the next turn it is like stepping on the brake before turning 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.240
 If you step on the brake well to stop parking 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.409
 Or also the car of the case that it depresses the brake the principles from the bottom 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.490
 Well there are other things like cats coming out from the side 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:33.850
 Hey, I'm looking aside and I'm surprised that I stepped on the brake 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:39.230
 I think every situation is hidden behind the brakes . 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.820
 As a way of votive intention indication in the yeah Yeah I put him ahead, I am this 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.970
 Turn from 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:50.120
 I mean that I following brake Umuyo against it 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:55.760
 It is also a following vehicle and an in-car first brake you to twice that covers the order 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:00.840
 Two-lane by the in soon Well then principle begin Do not that that Akono who also I seen 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:08.810
 With its ne something behind the car Nehito one also lane change if 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:10.590
 As there is room to change lanes and avoid them before decelerating. 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.910
 By all means 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:21.000
 And you'll Netsuke a song that put the turn signal before 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:24.070
 No I think it can be said that the firm could spin without creating it even flow of action congestion 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.900
 Please remember by all means 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.890
 We talked about the timing to put out the turn signal above 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.890
 Kamoshita was Hideyuki
