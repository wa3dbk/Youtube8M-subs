driving here my temporary switch boxes
and<00:00:59.289> changed<00:00:59.769> out<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.129> little<00:01:00.850> more

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
and changed out to little more

00:01:01.120 --> 00:02:00.830 
and changed out to little more
contemporary<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:06.190> that's<00:01:06.850> pretty<00:01:07.119> much<00:01:07.240> it

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.410 

and<00:02:01.840> there<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.080> have<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.740> moved<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.420> little

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
and there you have it it moved a little

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.910 
and there you have it it moved a little
bit<00:02:04.690> cold<00:02:04.930> that's<00:02:05.230> why<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.440> died<00:02:05.710> out<00:02:05.890> over

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
bit cold that's why I died out over

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.010 
bit cold that's why I died out over
there<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.400> hill<00:02:06.690> or<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:07.750> could<00:02:07.870> be<00:02:07.960> the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
there on the hill or it could be the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.990 
there on the hill or it could be the
fact<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.320> my<00:02:08.890> fuel<00:02:09.460> system<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:09.850> not<00:02:09.970> very

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
fact that my fuel system is not very

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.940 
fact that my fuel system is not very
good<00:02:10.450> there's<00:02:11.260> not<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> whole<00:02:11.530> lot<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.680> fuel<00:02:11.890> in

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
good there's not a whole lot of fuel in

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.620 
good there's not a whole lot of fuel in
the<00:02:12.040> tank

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the tank

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.120 
the tank
we're<00:02:13.630> under<00:02:13.990> more<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.440> there's<00:02:14.560> no<00:02:14.680> radiator

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
we're under more but there's no radiator

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.090 
we're under more but there's no radiator
in<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:16.000> think<00:02:16.810> it's<00:02:17.020> really<00:02:17.230> hot<00:02:17.410> pretty

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
in it so I think it's really hot pretty

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:30.290 
in it so I think it's really hot pretty
quick

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.360
