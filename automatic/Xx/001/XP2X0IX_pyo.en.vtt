00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.160
 hello we will make a very recipe 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.709
 easy a salmon carpaccio from norway 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.390
 with passion fruit for that we have 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.500
 need Norwegian gelatin salmon 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.840
 of passion fruit that I'm going 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.090
 extract the salt flower juice from 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.890
 Passion Fruit Juice Guerra 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.500
 olive oil and vinegar 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.000
 white balsamic the first step of my 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.720
 recipe I'm going to make a jelly of 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.970
 passion fruit 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.970
 so I pour our juices into a saucepan 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.600
 to make my frozen I'm going to dive 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.290
 four sheets of gelatin in 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.900
 cold water 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.210
 once they are well softened I 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.940
 I'll be able to spin them out and we'll 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.810
 dips in the hot juices we will 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.180
 leave it out 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.620
 two minutes the shirt time and the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.000
 small square plate that will us 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.190
 serve as molds 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.810
 my trick is that I think myself fit 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.640
 a little bit my front plate with 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.630
 water like that the film hangs and the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.000
 hermetic goods 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.430
 now I pour the juice of 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.140
 the passion I put a food film 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.770
 to finish on the plate 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.700
 and I put in the fridge for a 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.990
 minimum hour 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.890
 I will now go to the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.810
 passion fruit vinaigrette 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.220
 for that I will have to recover the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.220
 pulp of each fruit 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.680
 I add a pinch of salt and pepper 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.680
 mix 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.330
 I will add olive oil 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.770
 white balsamic vinegar and for 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.409
 finish I have a thousand sione that of the Greek neo 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.580
 with a fork 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.330
 so now I cut my salmon in 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.200
 thin slices 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.409
 I will put on my parchment paper 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.460
 we will equalize libor I will 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.409
 keep cool until training 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.940
 so I recovered my frost so I 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.920
 will cut it into dice so now 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.960
 last step we will return the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 carpaccio on the dressing plate I 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.429
 go take off the parchment paper and I 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.370
 go because but my flower carpaccio 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.200
 salt and I'll pour the vinaigrette to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.489
 passion fruit 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.260
 then there to cook it in carpaccio 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.800
 but the second of thousand kitchen and 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
 a ways 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 so I end up helping me play the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.800
 two passions 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.710
 I will put a few small leaves 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.960
 to match a last little touch of 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.850
 pepper and that's this recipe you've been 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.880
 offered by seafood products 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.880
