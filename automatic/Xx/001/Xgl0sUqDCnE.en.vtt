these<00:00:06.600> days<00:00:06.960> nothing<00:00:07.920> interests<00:00:08.790> me<00:00:08.970> except

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
these days nothing interests me except

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.830 
these days nothing interests me except
something<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:11.100> from<00:00:11.580> time<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.030> time<00:00:12.060> comes

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
something that from time to time comes

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.770 
something that from time to time comes
to<00:00:13.050> my<00:00:13.170> mind<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.100> he<00:00:14.280> engages<00:00:14.580> me<00:00:14.970> and<00:00:15.210> one

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
to my mind and he engages me and one

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.040 
to my mind and he engages me and one
thing<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.619> excites<00:00:17.250> me<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.930> reaching<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
thing that excites me is reaching the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.519 
thing that excites me is reaching the
lightbody<00:00:19.529> program<00:00:19.820> it's<00:00:20.820> not<00:00:21.119> about<00:00:21.529> just

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
lightbody program it's not about just

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.400 
lightbody program it's not about just
turning<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.310> body<00:00:23.550> into<00:00:23.880> light<00:00:24.140> it<00:00:25.140> may

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
turning the body into light it may

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.970 
turning the body into light it may
appear<00:00:25.739> to<00:00:25.829> be<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.540> difficult<00:00:27.540> task<00:00:27.980> almost

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
appear to be a difficult task almost

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.540 
appear to be a difficult task almost
impossible<00:00:29.759> but<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> must<00:00:31.020> tell<00:00:31.290> you<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.550> the

you don't have to wait provided we begin
