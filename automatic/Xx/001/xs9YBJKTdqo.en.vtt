00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 and people who are still going to the news and today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.220
 show you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:18.810
 the twitter of the dissident and it brings 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:20.340
 true multitasking for the good s8 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.990
 and who already installed the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.789
 dissident, I'm going to open the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.949
 camera application and usually 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 when you put it to record a video and 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.210
 you close the application is to minimize 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.090
 so it does not continue to record 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.190
 but concludes that the camera is already installed 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.500
 and is already activated so that it stays in the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.570
 Forced background mode you can 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.680
 to see that he was recording still is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.829
 that I play 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.739
 You can see there that I have minimized. 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.379
 this time the application and even with 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 he minimized he closed it in 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.070
 attempt on the screen 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.539
 You can see that he continued recording 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.879
 all OK 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.920
 so something very interesting for those who 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.039
 want to use the camera application records 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 a video is hidden or doing 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.610
 another thing 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.560
 something very interesting and like another 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.950
 example I'm going to put a video here 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.010
 youtube right then you can see that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.860
 it's really running 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.470
 I'm going to close with the app I'm going 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.560
 use the music application and view the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.790
 that you have again remembering that the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.530
 youtube also keeps rolling 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.079
 so now I come back here to the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.430
 application and then opening the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.409
 youtube app 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.829
 You can see that the video is 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.619
 still running remembering again that 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.229
 the audio also with youtube closed the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 audio is still playing and now 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.030
 going to the configurations of the dissident 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.770
 you can see that you have three options or 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.810
 start with the first option that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 the ' cause you can be such a pattern for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.880
 all applications right then we 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.530
 have to turned it off the native and forced 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.049
 which is what was on my camera for 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.969
 example the forced and here individual is 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.640
 Of course you can hit individually. 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.009
 the applications are for example my 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.080
 youtube camera is in forced mode that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.849
 the rest in native mode and you too 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.750
 can add a new application is a 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.950
 exception 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.959
 so for example 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.790
 Oh I want it to always go into the mood 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.209
 forced and here we have two more 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.300
 power options automatically lounge 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.590
 or go far but recommends leaving 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.730
 disabled and here in other 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.260
 settings 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.390
 we have the icom beige it goes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.400
 add a small zin icon is in the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.959
 application that is being run in 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.989
 forced or native 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.510
 depending on your choice and here at 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.269
 state and with the same thing goes 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.489
 an icon appears in the barnett status of the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.950
 your device when an application was 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.080
 is in forced mode or in native mode 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.220
 depending on your choice I go 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.290
 show that an application is an example 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.310
 should I just leave history in the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.840
 forced 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.380
 You can see up there that he 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.180
 appears a f1 nÃ© of forced strong then 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.310
 is indicating that the application of the app 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.170
 store is in forced mode of the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.209
 multitask then even if you go 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.099
 close the application it will continue 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.840
 running as if it were active 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.970
 good people this the twitter of the dissident 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.310
 he meets and hears the big boss 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.349
 in the media or you want to open 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.870
 to be able to install it it is not much 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.579
 Cheap and costs 3 dollars however it met 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.370
 I think it's worth it and it works on 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.139
 any device that has s8 installed and 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.269
 now as always we go to the pros and 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.470
 cons in my opinion a very thing 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.470
 good because it works with any 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.670
 application whether youtube is made time 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.620
 even minimizing these 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.359
 applications you are still going to continue 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.769
 listening to their sound, right? 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.290
 I will continue for example convey a 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.579
 camera image whatever other 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.230
 thing I really liked is because it has 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.730
 very useful settings 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.380
 so you can for example if you are 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.359
 only some applications to use in the 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.280
 forced mode and the rest of native mode 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.810
 then this and thought cool 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.519
 my only against because it is a little 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.350
 expensive, it's 3 dollars 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.329
 however I use it mainly with 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.639
 the facetime I think it's worth to me 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.889
 Too bad I've done a similar review of a 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.120
 tweet called background - generate however 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.489
 unfortunately he stopped being 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.170
 compatible with s8 and himself 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.250
 developer said he would not 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.530
 more continue 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.930
 so I decided to update you there, I concluded 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.329
 of the dissident who is 100% compatible with 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.250
 s8 good staff but that's who 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.870
 liked the video of that ladybug who did not 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.310
 is enrolled at the click channel register 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.989
 be sure to also visit our 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.250
 facebook and do not follow twitter on the 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.720
 because these people help 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.760
 very much here with the disclosure of the 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.690
 channel the wish for you a great ending 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.610
