 beat there then not stung elisabeth 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:54.500
 I have a much better idea either 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.200
 that I should not be more varied what is it 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.700
 this is a straw I open is very 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.680
 often when I was in my turn it's 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.040
 what a fault 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.450

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.290
 see real wonders and I have them 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.010
 get out and that's amazing 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.070
 I guess that says hide not a 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.690
 dirigible I do not believe no but I 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.410
 see

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.310
 I do not understand very well what I 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.050
 just seen there but I'm ready to 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.170

 we will give a lesson to give rise 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:57.059
 would be useless because I like 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.360
