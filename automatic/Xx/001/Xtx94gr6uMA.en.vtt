00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
update on my Iron Man X ASIC innocence

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.020 
update on my Iron Man X ASIC innocence
tracking<00:00:12.799> system<00:00:13.190> and<00:00:13.370> we're<00:00:13.490> also<00:00:13.610> going<00:00:13.940> to

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
tracking system and we're also going to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.260 
tracking system and we're also going to
talk<00:00:14.240> about<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.719> legs<00:00:15.020> and<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:15.650> feet<00:00:15.939> so<00:00:16.939> a

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
talk about the legs and the feet so a

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.910 
talk about the legs and the feet so a
bit<00:00:17.540> of<00:00:17.599> an<00:00:17.689> update<00:00:17.960> from<00:00:18.050> last<00:00:18.170> time<00:00:18.590> on<00:00:18.800> so

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
bit of an update from last time on so

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.470 
bit of an update from last time on so
you<00:00:19.009> can<00:00:19.189> see<00:00:19.369> that<00:00:19.550> I've<00:00:19.670> got<00:00:19.700> the<00:00:19.939> arms<00:00:20.330> on

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
you can see that I've got the arms on

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.240 
you can see that I've got the arms on
although<00:00:21.259> they're<00:00:21.500> only<00:00:21.529> actually<00:00:22.009> attached

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
although they're only actually attached

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.670 
although they're only actually attached
with<00:00:22.430> elastic<00:00:22.880> bands<00:00:23.119> at<00:00:23.419> the<00:00:23.480> moment<00:00:23.900> but

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
with elastic bands at the moment but

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.200 
with elastic bands at the moment but
that's<00:00:24.859> basically<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.400> scaling<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:26.150> the

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
that's basically the scaling and the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.630 
that's basically the scaling and the
spacing<00:00:26.660> of<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.840> pieces<00:00:27.250> also<00:00:28.250> got<00:00:28.369> a<00:00:28.400> cup

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
spacing of the pieces also got a cup

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.359 
spacing of the pieces also got a cup
plate<00:00:28.910> on<00:00:29.150> on<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:29.359> ab<00:00:29.510> plates<00:00:29.949> at<00:00:30.949> the<00:00:31.039> moment

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
plate on on the ab plates at the moment

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.830 
plate on on the ab plates at the moment
it's<00:00:31.460> kind<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.820> temporarily<00:00:32.300> having<00:00:32.660> them<00:00:32.780> on

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
it's kind of temporarily having them on

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.200 
it's kind of temporarily having them on
the<00:00:32.900> sides<00:00:33.230> there<00:00:33.670> there's<00:00:34.670> some<00:00:34.790> clips

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
the sides there there's some clips

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.119 
the sides there there's some clips
because<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:35.809> haven't<00:00:35.989> put<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.320> bomb<00:00:36.530> plate<00:00:36.890> on

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
because I haven't put the bomb plate on

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.090 
because I haven't put the bomb plate on
yet<00:00:37.480> when<00:00:38.480> I<00:00:38.510> do<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.960> two<00:00:39.170> games<00:00:39.440> interlock<00:00:39.949> at

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
yet when I do the two games interlock at

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.000 
yet when I do the two games interlock at
the<00:00:40.190> sides<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.820> whole<00:00:40.970> blows<00:00:41.710> however<00:00:42.710> the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
the sides the whole blows however the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.250 
the sides the whole blows however the
front<00:00:43.280> is<00:00:44.120> actually<00:00:44.269> attached<00:00:44.750> with<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.049> same

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
front is actually attached with the same

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.880 
front is actually attached with the same
magnetics<00:00:45.860> tracking<00:00:46.190> system<00:00:47.650> this<00:00:48.650> does

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
magnetics tracking system this does

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.890 
magnetics tracking system this does
isn't<00:00:49.370> as<00:00:49.489> uncomfortable<00:00:50.269> as<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:50.690> looks

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
isn't as uncomfortable as it looks

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.570 
isn't as uncomfortable as it looks
obviously<00:00:51.409> needs<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.710> be<00:00:51.769> cut<00:00:51.979> down<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.250> it

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
obviously needs to be cut down and it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.119 
obviously needs to be cut down and it
also<00:00:52.699> needs<00:00:52.970> to<00:00:53.119> be<00:00:53.180> phone<00:00:53.479> backs<00:00:54.040> but<00:00:55.040> it

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
also needs to be phone backs but it

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.130 
also needs to be phone backs but it
basically<00:00:55.390> isn't<00:00:56.390> too<00:00:56.510> uncomfortable<00:00:56.869> to

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
basically isn't too uncomfortable to

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.079 
basically isn't too uncomfortable to
wear<00:00:57.379> it<00:00:57.769> was<00:00:57.890> really<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.339> only<00:00:58.460> place<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:58.940> put

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
wear it was really the only place to put

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.630 
wear it was really the only place to put
those<00:00:59.650> so<00:01:00.650> that<00:01:00.920> these<00:01:01.580> latches<00:01:01.820> on<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:04.610> a

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
those so that these latches on the a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.050 
those so that these latches on the a
plate<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.390> same<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.750> just<00:01:05.780> got<00:01:06.140> one

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
plate is the same you just got one

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.240 
plate is the same you just got one
socket<00:01:08.060> in<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:11.290> plate<00:01:12.290> which<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.740> still<00:01:12.980> haven't

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
socket in it plate which I still haven't

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.280 
socket in it plate which I still haven't
learned<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.610> added<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.030> third<00:01:14.690> additional

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
learned it added the third additional

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.280 
learned it added the third additional
socket<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:16.540> basically<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:17.690> all<00:01:17.720> seems<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.080> fit

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
socket to basically it all seems to fit

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.720 
socket to basically it all seems to fit
together<00:01:18.710> quite<00:01:19.010> well<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:22.190> belt<00:01:22.430> strap

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
together quite well the belt strap

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.340 
together quite well the belt strap
doesn't<00:01:23.000> do<00:01:23.300> here<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:23.960> for<00:01:24.830> convenience<00:01:25.460> and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
doesn't do here so for convenience and

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:47.569 
doesn't do here so for convenience and
that's<00:01:27.350> not<00:01:27.620> as<00:01:27.950> inconvenient<00:01:28.400> as<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.270> seems

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.620 

all<00:01:48.579> right<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.729> just<00:01:48.820> wanted<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.299> do<00:01:49.420> some

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
all right I just wanted to do some

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.929 
all right I just wanted to do some
close-ups<00:01:50.140> on<00:01:50.380> some<00:01:50.619> features<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.490> suit

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
close-ups on some features of the suit

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.749 
close-ups on some features of the suit
with<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.270> exoskeleton<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:54.130> obviously<00:01:54.399> as

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
with the exoskeleton on so obviously as

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.990 
with the exoskeleton on so obviously as
I've<00:01:54.909> already<00:01:55.180> shown<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.600> chest<00:01:55.840> plate<00:01:55.960> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
I've already shown the chest plate and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.639 
I've already shown the chest plate and
if<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.090> look<00:01:58.210> in<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.390> previous<00:01:58.810> three<00:01:59.200> parts

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
if you look in the previous three parts

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.889 
if you look in the previous three parts
to<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.159> exoskeleton<00:02:01.030> strapping<00:02:01.450> system<00:02:01.630> you

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
to the exoskeleton strapping system you

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.419 
to the exoskeleton strapping system you
can<00:02:02.049> see<00:02:02.200> how<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.409> is<00:02:02.470> made<00:02:02.710> but<00:02:03.039> basically

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
can see how this is made but basically

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.859 
can see how this is made but basically
obviously<00:02:03.670> everything's<00:02:04.240> mounted<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.750> these

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
obviously everything's mounted on these

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.339 
obviously everything's mounted on these
magnetic<00:02:05.409> plugs<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:05.799> sockets<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:07.390> metal<00:02:08.170> on

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
magnetic plugs and sockets on a metal on

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.120 
magnetic plugs and sockets on a metal on
the<00:02:08.470> suit

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
the suit

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.339 
the suit
so<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:10.030> quite<00:02:10.840> like<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.019> look<00:02:11.050> at<00:02:11.319> that

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
so I quite like the look at that

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.720 
so I quite like the look at that
actually<00:02:11.830> having<00:02:12.130> those<00:02:12.250> bits<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.670> aluminium

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
actually having those bits of aluminium

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.000 
actually having those bits of aluminium
there<00:02:13.360> obviously<00:02:14.290> it's<00:02:14.410> not<00:02:14.530> movie<00:02:14.860> accurate

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
there obviously it's not movie accurate

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.640 
there obviously it's not movie accurate
so<00:02:15.489> what<00:02:15.670> needs<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.030> happen<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.750> another<00:02:17.380> gold

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
so what needs to happen is another gold

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.020 
so what needs to happen is another gold
piece<00:02:17.980> will<00:02:18.130> be<00:02:18.190> fitted<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:18.610> there<00:02:18.760> which<00:02:18.880> I'm

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
piece will be fitted in there which I'm

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.190 
piece will be fitted in there which I'm
going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.209> make<00:02:19.269> out<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.660> piece<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.989> sheet

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
going to make out of a piece of sheet

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.320 
going to make out of a piece of sheet
material<00:02:20.349> I'm<00:02:21.280> probably<00:02:21.580> gonna<00:02:21.910> leave<00:02:22.120> these

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
material I'm probably gonna leave these

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.210 
material I'm probably gonna leave these
pieces<00:02:22.780> showing<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.680> when<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.920> look<00:02:24.040> at<00:02:24.099> it

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
pieces showing so when you look at it

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.180 
pieces showing so when you look at it
from<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.459> front<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.880> looks<00:02:24.910> like<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.450> actual

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
from the front it looks like the actual

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.800 
from the front it looks like the actual
under<00:02:27.190> suit<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.670> can<00:02:27.849> see<00:02:28.060> when<00:02:28.269> the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
under suit that you can see when the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.130 
under suit that you can see when the
Iron<00:02:29.019> Man<00:02:29.170> suit<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.530> assembled<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.220> movie

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
Iron Man suit is assembled in the movie

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.500 
Iron Man suit is assembled in the movie
similarly<00:02:32.140> looking<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.760> side<00:02:33.970> seared<00:02:34.360> and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
similarly looking in the side seared and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.970 
similarly looking in the side seared and
if<00:02:34.599> you<00:02:34.690> can<00:02:34.810> just<00:02:34.840> see<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.319> piece<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.650> metal

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
if you can just see the piece of metal

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.949 
if you can just see the piece of metal
running<00:02:36.190> under<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.579> arm<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.540> quite<00:02:37.780> like

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
running under the arm so I quite like

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.620 
running under the arm so I quite like
having<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.349> exposed<00:02:39.239> they<00:02:40.239> have<00:02:40.360> some<00:02:40.510> other

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
having that exposed they have some other

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.130 
having that exposed they have some other
pieces<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.110> make<00:02:41.260> basically<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.010> sides<00:02:43.140> how

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
pieces to make basically the sides how

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.870 
pieces to make basically the sides how
can<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.410> be<00:02:44.500> made<00:02:44.680> have<00:02:44.890> sheet<00:02:45.160> material<00:02:45.730> which

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
can it be made have sheet material which

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.240 
can it be made have sheet material which
will<00:02:46.030> come<00:02:46.209> up<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.450> meet<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.720> ad<00:02:46.870> plate<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:48.190> all

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
will come up to meet the ad plate so all

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.440 
will come up to meet the ad plate so all
the<00:02:48.370> pieces<00:02:48.519> are<00:02:48.730> going<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:48.910> be<00:02:48.970> there<00:02:49.269> that

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
the pieces are going to be there that

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.340 
the pieces are going to be there that
you'd<00:02:49.600> expect<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.140> see<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.920> suit<00:02:52.319> if<00:02:53.319> you

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
you'd expect to see in the suit if you

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.870 
you'd expect to see in the suit if you
remember<00:02:53.709> from<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.920> previous<00:02:53.950> parts<00:02:54.670> while<00:02:54.850> I

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
remember from the previous parts while I

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.849 
remember from the previous parts while I
what<00:02:55.390> I'm<00:02:55.510> left<00:02:55.660> with<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:55.930> some<00:02:56.230> straps<00:02:56.590> at

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
what I'm left with is some straps at

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.349 
what I'm left with is some straps at
each<00:02:56.980> side<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.519> legs<00:02:57.730> here<00:02:57.850> these<00:02:58.150> are

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
each side of the legs here these are

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.259 
each side of the legs here these are
actually<00:02:58.799> there<00:02:59.799> dog<00:02:59.980> leads<00:03:00.280> from<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.730> one

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
actually there dog leads from the one

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.080 
actually there dog leads from the one
pound<00:03:01.569> store<00:03:01.950> which<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.130> basically<00:03:03.700> there<00:03:03.940> to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
pound store which is basically there to

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.940 
pound store which is basically there to
hang<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.510> thighs<00:03:04.720> on<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.530> rest<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.859> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
hang the thighs on and the rest of the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.699 
hang the thighs on and the rest of the
legs<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.870> we're<00:03:07.870> now<00:03:08.019> going<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.260> talk<00:03:08.410> about

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
legs so we're now going to talk about

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.530 
legs so we're now going to talk about
what<00:03:09.190> I'm<00:03:09.310> gonna<00:03:09.489> do<00:03:09.670> about<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.060> legs<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.450> the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
what I'm gonna do about the legs and the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.270 
what I'm gonna do about the legs and the
feet<00:03:10.569> I'm<00:03:10.989> actually<00:03:11.139> gonna<00:03:11.410> start<00:03:11.769> right<00:03:12.069> at

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
feet I'm actually gonna start right at

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.629 
feet I'm actually gonna start right at
the<00:03:12.310> bottom<00:03:12.730> here<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:14.340> basically<00:03:15.340> building

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
the bottom here and basically building

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.520 
the bottom here and basically building
the<00:03:15.760> exoskeleton<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.720> fitting<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.109> pieces

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
the exoskeleton and fitting the pieces

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.470 
the exoskeleton and fitting the pieces
and<00:03:17.709> work<00:03:17.859> my<00:03:18.190> way<00:03:18.220> up<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.579> meet<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.120> thighs

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.970 

right<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:22.720> my<00:03:22.870> original<00:03:22.959> plan<00:03:23.440> for<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.769> shoes

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
right so my original plan for the shoes

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.009 
right so my original plan for the shoes
was<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.549> use<00:03:24.700> these<00:03:24.970> shoes<00:03:25.329> which<00:03:25.690> are<00:03:25.900> like

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
was to use these shoes which are like

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.559 
was to use these shoes which are like
wetsuit<00:03:26.500> shoes<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.700> client<00:03:28.030> surfing<00:03:28.450> or

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
wetsuit shoes and for client surfing or

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.870 
wetsuit shoes and for client surfing or
something<00:03:28.959> which<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.620> prophesied<00:03:30.010> glued<00:03:30.670> some

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
something which I prophesied glued some

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.270 
something which I prophesied glued some
foam<00:03:31.180> all<00:03:31.420> over<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:32.350> original<00:03:32.739> plan<00:03:32.920> with<00:03:33.190> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
foam all over the original plan with the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.940 
foam all over the original plan with the
foam<00:03:33.489> suit<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.239> made<00:03:34.450> um<00:03:34.780> nearly<00:03:35.769> two

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
foam suit that I made um nearly two

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.879 
foam suit that I made um nearly two
years<00:03:35.980> ago<00:03:36.340> now<00:03:36.900> here's<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.959> foam<00:03:38.230> shoe<00:03:38.560> it's

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
years ago now here's a foam shoe it's

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.220 
years ago now here's a foam shoe it's
not<00:03:39.040> particularly<00:03:39.430> great<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.810> plan<00:03:41.019> was

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
not particularly great and the plan was

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.319 
not particularly great and the plan was
to<00:03:41.260> basically<00:03:41.769> sort<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.519> glue<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.910> onto<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
to basically sort of glue that onto the

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.539 
to basically sort of glue that onto the
foam<00:03:43.540> shoe<00:03:43.930> or<00:03:44.260> cut<00:03:44.620> pieces<00:03:44.889> out<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.190> glued

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
foam shoe or cut pieces out and glued

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.000 
foam shoe or cut pieces out and glued
one<00:03:45.760> all<00:03:45.910> over<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.470> was<00:03:47.560> gonna<00:03:47.650> be<00:03:47.739> it

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
one all over and that was gonna be it

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.949 
one all over and that was gonna be it
but<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:48.910> actually<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.389> to<00:03:49.569> do<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.810> build

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
but I actually like to do is build

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.750 
but I actually like to do is build
something<00:03:50.560> that's<00:03:50.829> more<00:03:51.400> like<00:03:51.609> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
something that's more like the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.550 
something that's more like the
exoskeleton<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:53.019> it's<00:03:53.139> actually<00:03:53.410> got<00:03:53.530> a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
exoskeleton so it's actually got a

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.330 
exoskeleton so it's actually got a
proper<00:03:53.829> sole<00:03:54.130> on<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:54.639> proper

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
proper sole on it and proper

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.020 
proper sole on it and proper
the<00:03:55.580> angle<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:57.069> sort<00:03:58.069> of<00:03:58.129> straps<00:03:58.519> onto<00:03:58.760> your

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
the angle and sort of straps onto your

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.350 
the angle and sort of straps onto your
feet<00:03:59.269> and<00:03:59.480> lower<00:03:59.780> leg<00:04:00.080> a<00:04:00.319> bit<00:04:00.560> like<00:04:00.830> a

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
feet and lower leg a bit like a

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.479 
feet and lower leg a bit like a
snowboard<00:04:02.360> binding<00:04:03.050> so<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.069> actually<00:04:04.340> goes

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
snowboard binding so it actually goes

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.550 
snowboard binding so it actually goes
some<00:04:04.760> way<00:04:04.940> towards<00:04:05.000> supporting<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.050> shins<00:04:06.290> of

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
some way towards supporting the shins of

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.890 
some way towards supporting the shins of
these<00:04:06.769> so<00:04:07.160> I've<00:04:08.000> got<00:04:08.150> one<00:04:08.239> of<00:04:08.330> my<00:04:08.390> plastic

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
these so I've got one of my plastic

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.060 
these so I've got one of my plastic
shins<00:04:09.260> here<00:04:10.840> we'll<00:04:11.840> see<00:04:11.989> that<00:04:12.019> this<00:04:14.890> fits<00:04:15.890> the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
shins here we'll see that this fits the

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.939 
shins here we'll see that this fits the
boot<00:04:16.250> quite<00:04:16.639> well<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:18.199> plan<00:04:18.380> is<00:04:18.410> obviously<00:04:18.799> to

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
boot quite well the plan is obviously to

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.370 
boot quite well the plan is obviously to
mate<00:04:19.359> I'll<00:04:20.359> see<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.630> is<00:04:20.720> molded<00:04:21.079> off<00:04:21.199> the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
mate I'll see this is molded off the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.800 
mate I'll see this is molded off the
foam<00:04:22.100> suit<00:04:22.430> as<00:04:22.699> all<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:23.000> other<00:04:23.120> pieces<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:23.720> if

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
foam suit as all the other pieces and if

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.120 
foam suit as all the other pieces and if
you<00:04:23.900> have<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.020> look<00:04:24.139> on<00:04:24.260> my<00:04:24.290> website<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.040> you

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
you have a look on my website and you

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.950 
you have a look on my website and you
have<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.310> look<00:04:25.490> early<00:04:25.729> of<00:04:26.060> youtube<00:04:26.570> videos<00:04:26.930> you

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
have a look early of youtube videos you

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.020 
have a look early of youtube videos you
can<00:04:27.320> see<00:04:27.530> these<00:04:27.680> plastic<00:04:28.190> pieces<00:04:28.430> being<00:04:28.760> made

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
can see these plastic pieces being made

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.120 
can see these plastic pieces being made
by<00:04:29.840> molding<00:04:30.260> from<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.620> foam<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.040> then

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
by molding from the foam and then

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.000 
by molding from the foam and then
casting<00:04:31.639> in<00:04:31.760> polyurethane<00:04:32.510> so<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.590> plan<00:04:33.800> is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
casting in polyurethane so the plan is

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.129 
casting in polyurethane so the plan is
to<00:04:34.040> make<00:04:34.760> do<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.510> same<00:04:35.690> with<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:35.960> shoes

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
to make do the same with the shoes

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.070 
to make do the same with the shoes
basically<00:04:36.580> so<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.790> top<00:04:38.240> section<00:04:38.630> here<00:04:38.660> the

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
basically so the top section here the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.600 
basically so the top section here the
front<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.830> back<00:04:39.979> are<00:04:40.220> all<00:04:40.310> going<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.490> have

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
front and the back are all going to have

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.820 
front and the back are all going to have
molds<00:04:41.030> made<00:04:41.210> I've<00:04:41.570> only<00:04:41.780> done<00:04:41.960> one<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.500> far

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
molds made I've only done one so far

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.100 
molds made I've only done one so far
which<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.790> for<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.150> bridge<00:04:44.630> of<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.840> foot

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
which is for the bridge of the foot

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.260 
which is for the bridge of the foot
there<00:04:45.350> so<00:04:46.010> that'll<00:04:46.130> be<00:04:46.250> cast<00:04:46.490> in<00:04:46.729> plastic<00:04:47.180> or

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
there so that'll be cast in plastic or

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.790 
there so that'll be cast in plastic or
fiberglass<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:48.110> then<00:04:48.229> I'll<00:04:48.320> end<00:04:48.470> up<00:04:48.590> with<00:04:48.650> a

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
fiberglass and then I'll end up with a

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.159 
fiberglass and then I'll end up with a
finished<00:04:49.070> shell<00:04:49.430> that<00:04:49.729> I<00:04:49.850> can<00:04:50.030> detail<00:04:50.510> in<00:04:50.750> a

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
finished shell that I can detail in a

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.170 
finished shell that I can detail in a
rigid<00:04:51.530> cast<00:04:51.919> much<00:04:52.310> like<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.669> shins<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.090> the

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
rigid cast much like the shins and the

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.840 
rigid cast much like the shins and the
other<00:04:53.360> rigid<00:04:53.600> pieces<00:04:54.050> from<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.320> suit<00:04:54.850> so

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
other rigid pieces from the suit so

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.370 
other rigid pieces from the suit so
obviously<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:56.360> could<00:04:56.570> still<00:04:56.840> go<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.110> stick

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
obviously I could still go and stick

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.279 
obviously I could still go and stick
those<00:04:57.590> on<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.860> shoes<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:59.720> fact<00:04:59.960> what<00:05:00.169> I'm

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
those on the shoes in fact what I'm

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.010 
those on the shoes in fact what I'm
planning<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.680> do<00:05:00.950> is<00:05:01.539> take<00:05:02.539> this<00:05:02.720> piece<00:05:02.780> of

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
planning to do is take this piece of

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.190 
planning to do is take this piece of
HDPE<00:05:03.860> which<00:05:04.400> is<00:05:04.669> basically<00:05:05.660> what<00:05:05.900> they<00:05:06.020> make

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
HDPE which is basically what they make

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.529 
HDPE which is basically what they make
plastic<00:05:06.650> chopping<00:05:07.010> boards<00:05:07.340> off<00:05:07.490> that's<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.330> 10

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
plastic chopping boards off that's a 10

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.200 
plastic chopping boards off that's a 10
mil<00:05:08.750> thick<00:05:10.660> basically<00:05:11.770> high-density<00:05:12.770> plastic

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
mil thick basically high-density plastic

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.339 
mil thick basically high-density plastic
uses<00:05:14.210> in<00:05:14.330> other<00:05:14.419> projects<00:05:14.930> if<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.200> have<00:05:15.320> a

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
uses in other projects if you have a

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.339 
uses in other projects if you have a
look<00:05:15.470> at<00:05:15.560> my<00:05:15.710> Android<00:05:16.160> 11<00:05:16.610> project<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:18.200> can

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
look at my Android 11 project you can

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.080 
look at my Android 11 project you can
see<00:05:18.380> pieces<00:05:18.889> of<00:05:19.130> this<00:05:19.220> being<00:05:19.490> used<00:05:19.729> this<00:05:19.940> is

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
see pieces of this being used this is

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.560 
see pieces of this being used this is
basically<00:05:20.360> an<00:05:20.539> off<00:05:20.630> cut<00:05:20.930> from<00:05:21.200> that<00:05:21.320> project

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
basically an off cut from that project

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.879 
basically an off cut from that project
so<00:05:23.570> it's<00:05:23.750> quite<00:05:23.930> good<00:05:23.960> material<00:05:24.590> because<00:05:24.860> you

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
so it's quite good material because you

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.980 
so it's quite good material because you
can<00:05:25.160> screw<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.460> machine<00:05:25.820> screw<00:05:26.090> straight<00:05:26.630> into

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
can screw a machine screw straight into

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.500 
can screw a machine screw straight into
it<00:05:27.139> without<00:05:27.410> having<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.800> tap<00:05:28.039> tap<00:05:28.669> a<00:05:28.700> hole<00:05:28.970> with

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
it without having to tap tap a hole with

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.570 
it without having to tap tap a hole with
a<00:05:29.539> thread<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.110> basically<00:05:31.039> it<00:05:31.099> will<00:05:31.160> just<00:05:31.370> stay

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
a thread and basically it will just stay

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.060 
a thread and basically it will just stay
there<00:05:31.849> so<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.479> think<00:05:32.960> I've<00:05:33.169> got<00:05:33.200> them<00:05:33.560> in<00:05:33.770> four

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
there so I think I've got them in four

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.300 
there so I think I've got them in four
bolts<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.639> if<00:05:34.729> you<00:05:34.820> drill<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.169> m3<00:05:36.169> or<00:05:36.200> 3.5<00:05:36.950> ml

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
bolts and if you drill a m3 or 3.5 ml

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.219 
bolts and if you drill a m3 or 3.5 ml
hold<00:05:37.610> then<00:05:38.090> you<00:05:38.210> can<00:05:38.360> just<00:05:38.539> screw<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.840> bolt<00:05:39.050> in

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
hold then you can just screw the bolt in

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.529 
hold then you can just screw the bolt in
and<00:05:39.380> it<00:05:39.470> will<00:05:39.530> stay<00:05:39.770> there<00:05:39.800> so<00:05:40.340> makes<00:05:41.210> it<00:05:41.360> quite

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
and it will stay there so makes it quite

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.000 
and it will stay there so makes it quite
easy<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.930> attach<00:05:42.200> bits<00:05:42.440> of<00:05:42.560> metal<00:05:42.770> and

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
easy to attach bits of metal and

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.750 
easy to attach bits of metal and
brackets<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:43.580> so<00:05:43.789> on<00:05:45.160> plan<00:05:46.160> is<00:05:46.370> going<00:05:46.580> to<00:05:46.639> be

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
brackets and so on plan is going to be

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.909 
brackets and so on plan is going to be
to<00:05:47.080> obviously<00:05:48.080> have<00:05:48.229> a<00:05:48.289> piece<00:05:48.530> that's<00:05:48.800> the

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
to obviously have a piece that's the

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.740 
to obviously have a piece that's the
right<00:05:49.099> size<00:05:49.400> for<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.729> shoe<00:05:50.000> that's<00:05:50.450> sort<00:05:50.720> of

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
right size for the shoe that's sort of

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.750 
right size for the shoe that's sort of
cut<00:05:51.110> to<00:05:51.410> the<00:05:52.010> right<00:05:52.160> contours<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:54.729> have<00:05:55.729> a

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
cut to the right contours and have a

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.940 
cut to the right contours and have a
hinge<00:05:56.000> in<00:05:56.240> it<00:05:56.389> so<00:05:57.169> that<00:05:57.470> I'm<00:05:57.590> actually<00:05:57.740> going

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
hinge in it so that I'm actually going

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.339 
hinge in it so that I'm actually going
to<00:05:58.039> use<00:05:58.220> one<00:05:58.400> of<00:05:58.430> these<00:05:58.639> door<00:05:58.940> hinges<00:05:59.510> it's

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
to use one of these door hinges it's

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.940 
to use one of these door hinges it's
just<00:06:00.669> domestic<00:06:01.669> hinges<00:06:02.090> from<00:06:02.180> a<00:06:02.300> DIY<00:06:02.630> shop<00:06:03.110> so

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
just domestic hinges from a DIY shop so

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.290 
just domestic hinges from a DIY shop so
that'll<00:06:04.159> be<00:06:04.250> roughly<00:06:04.550> on<00:06:04.700> the<00:06:04.729> ball<00:06:04.969> of<00:06:05.180> the

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
that'll be roughly on the ball of the

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.350 
that'll be roughly on the ball of the
foot<00:06:06.070> where<00:06:07.070> your<00:06:07.219> foot<00:06:07.430> bends

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
foot where your foot bends

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.580 
foot where your foot bends
be<00:06:08.509> divided<00:06:08.960> into<00:06:09.110> two<00:06:09.439> and<00:06:10.219> then<00:06:10.729> around<00:06:11.000> the

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
be divided into two and then around the

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.110 
be divided into two and then around the
around<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:12.710> ankle<00:06:13.250> obviously<00:06:13.819> we<00:06:13.969> need<00:06:14.090> a

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
around the ankle obviously we need a

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.499 
around the ankle obviously we need a
hinge<00:06:14.419> so<00:06:14.870> that<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.909> Soviet<00:06:16.909> your<00:06:17.090> foot<00:06:17.360> can

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
hinge so that the Soviet your foot can

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.709 
hinge so that the Soviet your foot can
move<00:06:17.689> around<00:06:18.460> so<00:06:19.460> I'm<00:06:19.969> gonna<00:06:20.120> hinge<00:06:20.449> either

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
move around so I'm gonna hinge either

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:22.779 
move around so I'm gonna hinge either
side<00:06:21.080> we<00:06:21.680> also<00:06:21.830> need<00:06:22.189> to<00:06:22.310> be<00:06:22.400> able<00:06:22.490> to<00:06:22.610> have

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
side we also need to be able to have

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.570 
side we also need to be able to have
side<00:06:23.030> to<00:06:23.210> side<00:06:23.389> movements<00:06:23.960> slightly<00:06:24.469> so<00:06:25.460> I'm

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
side to side movements slightly so I'm

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.709 
side to side movements slightly so I'm
probably<00:06:25.759> going<00:06:25.969> to<00:06:26.030> make<00:06:26.180> those<00:06:26.449> hinges

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
probably going to make those hinges

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.559 
probably going to make those hinges
floating<00:06:27.909> then<00:06:28.909> the<00:06:29.000> whole<00:06:29.150> thing<00:06:29.330> is<00:06:29.449> going

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569 
floating then the whole thing is going

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.179 
floating then the whole thing is going
to<00:06:29.629> be<00:06:29.750> strapped<00:06:30.050> on<00:06:30.289> with<00:06:30.500> lots<00:06:30.650> of<00:06:30.770> foam<00:06:31.039> in

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
to be strapped on with lots of foam in

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.779 
to be strapped on with lots of foam in
the<00:06:31.280> velcro<00:06:31.629> so<00:06:32.629> basically<00:06:33.080> the<00:06:33.349> lower<00:06:33.789> shin

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789 
the velcro so basically the lower shin

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.860 
the velcro so basically the lower shin
and<00:06:35.180> the<00:06:35.449> foot<00:06:36.370> exoskeleton<00:06:37.370> pieces<00:06:37.870> are

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
and the foot exoskeleton pieces are

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.519 
and the foot exoskeleton pieces are
strapped<00:06:39.650> on<00:06:40.370> to<00:06:40.550> the<00:06:40.639> person<00:06:40.849> and<00:06:41.389> then<00:06:42.259> the

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:42.529 
strapped on to the person and then the

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:46.330 
strapped on to the person and then the
actual<00:06:42.860> shins<00:06:43.370> are<00:06:43.729> going<00:06:43.939> to<00:06:44.120> be<00:06:45.340> divided

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
actual shins are going to be divided

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.499 
actual shins are going to be divided
into<00:06:46.490> two<00:06:47.560> that<00:06:48.560> each<00:06:48.710> side<00:06:48.979> somewhere<00:06:49.550> and

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
into two that each side somewhere and

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.240 
into two that each side somewhere and
then<00:06:50.689> again<00:06:50.930> I'm<00:06:51.050> going<00:06:51.229> to<00:06:51.289> use<00:06:51.500> the<00:06:51.830> magnetic

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
then again I'm going to use the magnetic

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.610 
then again I'm going to use the magnetic
plugs<00:06:52.699> and<00:06:52.879> sockets<00:06:53.270> which<00:06:53.659> I've<00:06:54.409> mentioned

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
plugs and sockets which I've mentioned

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.519 
plugs and sockets which I've mentioned
in<00:06:54.949> the<00:06:55.009> last<00:06:55.189> three<00:06:55.520> parts<00:06:56.199> which<00:06:57.199> are<00:06:57.379> going

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:57.529 
in the last three parts which are going

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.490 
in the last three parts which are going
to<00:06:57.620> hold<00:06:57.860> all<00:06:58.009> of<00:06:58.039> the<00:06:58.219> pieces<00:06:58.430> on<00:06:58.719> so<00:06:59.719> see

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
to hold all of the pieces on so see

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.110 
to hold all of the pieces on so see
they'll<00:07:00.680> put<00:07:00.860> in<00:07:00.979> v1<00:07:01.370> whoops

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
they'll put in v1 whoops

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.999 
they'll put in v1 whoops
v1<00:07:03.050> on<00:07:03.199> the<00:07:03.289> toe<00:07:04.150> and<00:07:05.150> in<00:07:05.990> other<00:07:06.139> places<00:07:06.469> or

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:07.009 
v1 on the toe and in other places or

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.070 
v1 on the toe and in other places or
some<00:07:07.310> other<00:07:07.460> form<00:07:07.819> of<00:07:07.939> latching<00:07:08.449> mechanism<00:07:08.479> to

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
some other form of latching mechanism to

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.230 
some other form of latching mechanism to
attach<00:07:09.319> the<00:07:09.500> pieces<00:07:09.830> of<00:07:09.949> the<00:07:10.009> shoe<00:07:10.250> and<00:07:11.090> then

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
attach the pieces of the shoe and then

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.730 
attach the pieces of the shoe and then
there'll<00:07:11.419> be<00:07:11.449> a<00:07:11.539> rigid<00:07:11.930> piece<00:07:12.139> of<00:07:12.259> metal<00:07:12.620> that

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
there'll be a rigid piece of metal that

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.010 
there'll be a rigid piece of metal that
runs<00:07:12.949> up<00:07:13.219> the<00:07:14.089> leg<00:07:14.300> or<00:07:14.569> the<00:07:14.599> Front's<00:07:14.900> in<00:07:14.960> the

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
runs up the leg or the Front's in the

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.709 
runs up the leg or the Front's in the
back<00:07:15.259> for<00:07:16.009> the<00:07:16.159> Shuman<00:07:16.969> pieces<00:07:17.240> to<00:07:17.360> fit<00:07:17.539> too

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:17.719 
back for the Shuman pieces to fit too

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:20.769 
back for the Shuman pieces to fit too
and<00:07:18.560> also<00:07:18.800> quite<00:07:19.069> like<00:07:19.250> some<00:07:19.550> kind<00:07:20.449> of<00:07:20.509> happen

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:20.779 
and also quite like some kind of happen

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:22.360 
and also quite like some kind of happen
permanently<00:07:21.259> attached<00:07:21.589> with<00:07:21.800> some<00:07:22.009> form<00:07:22.279> of

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
permanently attached with some form of

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.420 
permanently attached with some form of
hinge<00:07:23.289> or<00:07:24.289> an<00:07:24.469> opening<00:07:24.800> and<00:07:24.979> closing

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
hinge or an opening and closing

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.100 
hinge or an opening and closing
mechanism<00:07:25.610> that<00:07:26.120> comes<00:07:26.300> together<00:07:26.479> a<00:07:26.750> bit<00:07:26.930> like

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
mechanism that comes together a bit like

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.450 
mechanism that comes together a bit like
in<00:07:27.259> the<00:07:27.349> movie<00:07:27.680> but<00:07:27.949> we'll<00:07:28.099> see<00:07:28.279> how<00:07:28.400> that

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
in the movie but we'll see how that

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.640 
in the movie but we'll see how that
works<00:07:28.699> out<00:07:28.940> once<00:07:29.180> I've<00:07:29.330> actually<00:07:29.509> made<00:07:29.779> the

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.650 
works out once I've actually made the

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.800 
works out once I've actually made the
exoskeleton<00:07:31.580> and<00:07:31.759> the<00:07:31.819> rigid<00:07:32.089> sole<00:07:32.360> which

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.810 
exoskeleton and the rigid sole which

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.600 
exoskeleton and the rigid sole which
have<00:07:33.050> actually<00:07:33.560> comfortable<00:07:33.800> then<00:07:34.279> you<00:07:34.310> can

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610 
have actually comfortable then you can

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.550 
have actually comfortable then you can
walk<00:07:34.849> in<00:07:35.120> then<00:07:35.779> I'll<00:07:35.900> fit<00:07:36.110> the<00:07:36.199> pieces<00:07:36.469> of

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 
walk in then I'll fit the pieces of

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.550 
walk in then I'll fit the pieces of
armor<00:07:36.889> that<00:07:37.270> probably<00:07:38.270> be<00:07:38.419> a<00:07:38.449> rigid<00:07:38.900> hinge<00:07:39.319> at

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 
armor that probably be a rigid hinge at

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.369 
armor that probably be a rigid hinge at
the<00:07:39.589> knee<00:07:40.120> so<00:07:41.120> we'll<00:07:41.839> continue<00:07:42.050> the

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:42.379 
the knee so we'll continue the

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.260 
the knee so we'll continue the
exoskeleton<00:07:43.129> up<00:07:43.250> the<00:07:43.370> leg<00:07:43.580> and<00:07:43.879> then<00:07:44.060> it'll<00:07:44.150> be

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270 
exoskeleton up the leg and then it'll be

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.879 
exoskeleton up the leg and then it'll be
hooked<00:07:44.479> onto<00:07:44.750> the<00:07:44.990> straps<00:07:45.319> of<00:07:45.529> the<00:07:45.620> thumb

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:45.889 
hooked onto the straps of the thumb

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:49.849 
piece of video but we'll see how that

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:52.689 
piece of video but we'll see how that
works<00:07:50.029> out<00:07:50.270> once<00:07:50.719> we<00:07:50.930> get<00:07:51.080> there<00:07:51.460> and<00:07:52.460> we<00:07:52.580> can

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:52.699 
works out once we get there and we can

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:54.459 
works out once we get there and we can
also<00:07:52.819> sort<00:07:53.180> out<00:07:53.360> the<00:07:53.479> spacing<00:07:53.930> of<00:07:53.990> the<00:07:54.080> pieces

00:07:54.469 --> 00:08:04.470 
also sort out the spacing of the pieces
at<00:07:54.680> that<00:07:54.800> point

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:04.480
