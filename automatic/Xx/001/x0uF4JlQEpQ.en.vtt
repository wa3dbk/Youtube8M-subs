us back in 2011 he had just won the X
Factor<00:00:36.450> show<00:00:36.960> television<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.399> was<00:00:39.059> concerned

Factor show television and was concerned

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.660 
Factor show television and was concerned
about<00:00:39.750> his<00:00:39.899> hair<00:00:40.079> also<00:00:40.290> at<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.559> time<00:00:40.739> let's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
about his hair also at that time let's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.340 
about his hair also at that time let's
just<00:00:41.940> learn<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.270> rough<00:00:42.420> calculation<00:00:43.140> there

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
just learn the rough calculation there

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
just learn the rough calculation there
he<00:00:43.649> goes<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.489> should<00:00:44.670> get<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:44.969> two<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
he goes we should get about two and a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.900 
he goes we should get about two and a
half<00:00:45.450> thousand<00:00:45.840> grams<00:00:46.079> okay<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.340> hopefully

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
half thousand grams okay so hopefully

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.600 
half thousand grams okay so hopefully
and<00:00:48.780> had<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> surgery<00:00:49.410> goes<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.460> would

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and had the surgery goes but that would

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.220 
and had the surgery goes but that would
be<00:00:50.730> our<00:00:50.820> expectation<00:00:51.539> i<00:00:51.660> right

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
be our expectation i right

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
be our expectation i right
so<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.590> enough<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.129> strengthen<00:00:53.640> f1<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so that's enough to strengthen f1 to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.330 
so that's enough to strengthen f1 to
Porlock<00:00:54.480> region<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:56.160> some<00:00:56.370> work<00:00:56.550> okay<00:00:58.340> I'm

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
Porlock region and do some work okay I'm

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.819 
Porlock region and do some work okay I'm

and it's a confidence thing at the end
of<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> day<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> feel<00:01:15.060> confident

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
of the day you know you feel confident

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.850 
of the day you know you feel confident
with<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.869> know<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> full<00:01:16.290> head<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> hair<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
with it you know a full head of hair and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.289 
with it you know a full head of hair and
if<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.189> security<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.119> maintain

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
if there's security to kind of maintain

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
if there's security to kind of maintain
that<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.990> hold<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.950> little

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that and hold on to that for a little

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
that and hold on to that for a little
longer<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.580> least<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.360> don't

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
longer at least you know then I don't

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.370 
longer at least you know then I don't
see<00:01:21.960> why<00:01:21.990> not

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
see why not

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.340 
see why not
so<00:01:22.860> our<00:01:23.009> plan<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> reinforce<00:01:24.180> an<00:01:24.630> existing

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
so our plan is to reinforce an existing

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
so our plan is to reinforce an existing
hair<00:01:25.530> line<00:01:25.770> densely<00:01:26.490> packed<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.880> transition

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
hair line densely packed the transition

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.780 
hair line densely packed the transition
zone<00:01:27.829> identity<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> forelock<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
zone identity to the forelock and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.480 
zone identity to the forelock and
rebuild<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.750> bridge<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.680> shrink<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> crown

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
rebuild the bridge to shrink the crown

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.249 
rebuild the bridge to shrink the crown
but<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.090> filling<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> crack<00:01:33.840> in

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
but what I was filling in the crack in

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.440 
but what I was filling in the crack in
the<00:01:34.439> ground<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.009> 4:15<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> 2000

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the ground so it's 4:15 to 2000

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.280 
the ground so it's 4:15 to 2000
Philippians<00:01:37.250> today<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.729> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> consisting
