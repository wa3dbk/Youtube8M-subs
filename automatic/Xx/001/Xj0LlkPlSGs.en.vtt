00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.070
 yesterday was fire Wednesday and I can not wait to arrive Wednesday from 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.470
 ashes is not that I am the enemy of the carnival 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.780
 I even played a lot of common blocks in the previous fiat and the holding company in 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.310
 Full Tuesday of Carnival 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.669
 so I'll speak with the knowledge 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.300
 and reveal some truths that I found behind the was up in the 

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:32.579
 carnival 'the first of them the carnival' is a genuinely Brazilian party 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.490
 the 'talc' carnival we know it arose in europe during the Victorian era 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.950
 and spread throughout the world adapting to other cultures according to 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.950
 false truth is a popular party 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.710
 the 'carnival turned circus business 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.100
 let the vip cabins tell you the private parties excitedly excited 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.690
 passport of joy and who does not have the money to hire the colored rupee 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.950
 they also have no right to be happy 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.700
 and here in the Paraíba where the previous ones are celebrated is not very different in 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.360
 most of the blocks live at the expense of public power and not an attraction 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.850
 an electric trio will amuse the people just because it's carnival 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.620
 a party 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.970
 democratic 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.079
 millions of reais are for artists on and off the land 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.600
 to secure the circus 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.719
 there is a miserable population who does not even have it at the table 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 many things today revolt me ​​in the carnival 'one of them I saw good music 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.109
 be shut up afonso senna 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.679
 customers of the moment as the wonder woman's melody 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.190
 and the like I can not even name 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.229
 I get outraged when I see the amount of ambulances 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.610
 available at a carnival parade 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.960
 is to meet the drunks on duty and are worth towers that get into fights and 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.370
 break-break 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.189
 Where are these same ambulances? 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.170
 when the mother needs to help the sick child 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.100
 when a worker is on the expensive side when the endorsement inside ' 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.120
 city ​​crowded prisons 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.429
 submitting the omission and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.029
 I rebelled to see 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:14.529
 three policemen are trying at parties to ensure order during the 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:15.360
 carnival 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.400
 and in the day to day it lacks security for the citizen of well to exercise the simple 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.829
 right to come and go 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.020
 but the carnival ' 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.930
 It's a wonderful feast they say until it spins the economy that little ones 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.360
 merchants manage to sell their cans their thousand barbecues 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.940
 if these parents and dependency of the carnival wants to sell between live 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.979
 bird the rest of the year the mutual 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:46.539
 carnavalsaiba profit for brewery owner is the owner of trio 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:47.390
 electric 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.140
 for a few Bahian artists 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.539
 it's no longer just losses 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.579
 Someone has already stopped to calculate how much the state spends until it succeeds victims 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.619
 of accidents caused by drunken revelers 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:03.220
 how many millions are paid in death benefits 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.019
 or disability resulting from such accidents 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.629
 how much the public power disburses body 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.370
 curettage procedures that many young women undergo 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.860
 after an unprotected carnival that generated an unwanted pregnancy 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:22.579
 not to mention the amount of cites that are transmitted during the party 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.409
 everything is permitted 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.129
 I even think the carnival was good already. 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.259
 but only this 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:30.389
 it was in the days of old
