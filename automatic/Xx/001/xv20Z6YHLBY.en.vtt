 you asked it again and then asked 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.639

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.439
 venture may so we go a new one 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.789
 game of course start with the flow 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.890
 and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.449
 and the world i go a little smaller 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 put what is median I think something is possible 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.570
 you than volts but can I have 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.410
 is just going to see 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.090
 lamp rens it will be it 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.980
 I didn't get into it that way 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.980
 photo custom yes 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.320
 medium and then we start well 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.090
 what I already told in the death penalty 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.559
 your video of van plays in the grapes 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.750
 that you say two different ones 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.059
 game mode it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.800
 you just start a sandbox mode then 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.719
 you can play in as long as you want and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.059
 for example, try to be very long 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.770
 but there is also just phantom 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.940
 mountain then you need the door of this 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.829
 pipoos in the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.379
 if you have found then go to the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.180
 edventure moteur may initially 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.770
 you take nothing with you and you have to take it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.060
 start again and then start with 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 survive in one of the I believe 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.780
 7 wild and thumbs determined chance of that 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.140
 that this world comes 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.299
 and all of those wanted to have real ones 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.680
 challenges so with a world it is 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.439
 always winter and then you have to take care of that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.040
 you why remains another world 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.810
 always dark you never have daylight and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.290
 do you have other worlds where whole 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 a lot of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.210
 I believe monsters are pans and so on 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 I always believe there is a lot of rain 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.930
 too old yet 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.850
 there are always different challenges 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.560
 to find 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.149
 so we are going to do and then at the end of 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.340
 those five levels will come if all goes well 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.170
 Maxwell against the large beds 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.110
 ideologies in this world 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.430
 drawn and you have to beat that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.960
 well first a punch of course 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.079
 just remember the basics she sees that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.180
 I'm working with grass and picking 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.490
 pieces set to the left of which 2x collect and 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.640
 with 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.050
 picking up a little flint of course 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.050
 the fungus has some carrots 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.450
 go pick some berries and just go 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.420
 just make a normal start 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.300
 because it can take a while 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.980
 before we have been our first so 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.239
 actually our first quest have ge 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.550
 complete and that is finding that the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.800
 because the worlds that can be quite big 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.599
 and I have now converted to medium 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.370
 they are just a bit smaller than the ones 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.830
 god or about the same and i will take a moment 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.750
 press tab look here I am now 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.600
 and it can become very small and it can 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.680
 grow very big so I was allowed to 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.930
 want to find the door 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.450
 then it becomes a whole lot of walking around and 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.799
 I just want a kind of thing 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.540
 from base we have where i 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.850
 can fall back on where I can eat 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.530
 collect and so on 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.549
 zoom in home because I always find it 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.870
 most convenient to just follow the coast 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.769
 I go first instance of tasty them 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.150
 movies keep walking around for this day 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.829
 sometimes medics 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.540
 i am always when i eat you have to make it 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.480
 then I always think a farce build 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.329
 and 2018 so handy in this game boat 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.250
 because we don't stay here but I think 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.079
 farms construction and I always very chill and 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.840
 then collect green and then cor pot 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.970
 a cor pot would make it all further 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.350
 it's going to see trade and then there 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.220
 you so good quality food from 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.450
 get it 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.100
 you have to get in the boat for a while 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.230
 open friesian spiders 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.150
 do not like and we will get one 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.060
 dibs will be at your home 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.359
 if we have a fat really such a fat fat 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.680
 Spider is then many I earn I love 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.150
 not like this in the spinners in the 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.799
 Larger his head and she will inform you 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.690
 so you say that is still alive 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.640
 Only when I have a spear do I go a spin 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.220
 attacks on becoming flint or tackle 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.709
 Ron back viewers The night has since come 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.550
 and I am a fishman here 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.170
 see if my fish is eating Muslims 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.610
 I happened to see massages with green 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.950
 Mushrooms are a good pastor, the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.410
 coincidence that they are good or one 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.739
 have a good function and here in your and 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.049
 by man with that more I will go later 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.269
 look again because there is also something 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.040
 some spider in the neighborhood and there they went 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.060
 fight along so it is possible at night 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.690
 villages but first look here for 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.490
 the trees because we just need some trees 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.680
 go get it because it will be night 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.990
 we have to build a fire 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.890
 I'm not going to make any people you still do 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.230
 but did n't have enough either 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.350
 snow I did not properly imagine it 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.510
 chopping the trees it goes so body 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.160
 lately i can do that from the past 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.810
 when I first played the game 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.300
 Hairdresser don't remember that we made it through you 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.680
 I want him every time I continue 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.669
 click then he always wants somewhere else 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.669
 standing is quite annoying 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.510
 watch this every i have to shop then 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.240
 click and then it goes well 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.080
 fortunately no no not no not 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.990
 rat or something 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.550
 harkema ordinary things i'll be right here 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.780
 now it already has some more wood 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.400
 collect 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.200
 but just back side I just said that 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.900
 so wall that drop fish and the 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.380
 spiders that job spider 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.620
 plants that you will bring with them and them 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.680
 on it and which is also very handy 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.270
 silk so you say spider web you can 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.930
 I also use it well for example 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.880
 a tent where I can sleep in my 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.490
 sanity you disturb it does cost your own we 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.490
 eat sleep so does not always go outside 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.210
 she gives these things air 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.039
 picking up 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.410
 while it still can it goes almost night 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.610
 I want to be with the blue 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.710
 motion neighborhood because then I can 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.780
 what do five beautiful here at night 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.080
 spend the night 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.150
 a turkey grasshopper above so so it 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.280
 is going to be night now and what do I see you 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.550
 tips show 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:09.210
 I quickly activate that one quickly 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.639
 crazy that touchdown succeeded ' that is one 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.320
 and stone but those are the ones that take care of it 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.910
 that I am the night that stone that night 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.980
 takes care of it when I die 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.660
 this doll like things god thinks hello 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.639
 with bulle 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.639
 that stone that takes care of myself 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.230
 that if I die that I am a who 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.090
 tension gets say is so say 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.730
 do your jump platform 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.950
 one time and then but he is really over 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.919
 it is one of the few more relaxed 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.080
 in one in a playthrough 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.990
 the other way is shea horny effect 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.380
 to make that is a kind of pop but none 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.210
 puppet of yourself and therefore 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.280
 rhetorical pans 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.260
 You can now see that I am telling you pay 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.000
 it feels because the belly is on 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.760
 life so I'm going to make food fast 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.870
 and then you eat it 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.820
 this was all for this first 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.770
 Delivery Next episode will be you 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.350
 it goes beyond we go the rest of it 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.540
 explore the map a lot further from you 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.950
 delivery fun and have that sense in 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.750
