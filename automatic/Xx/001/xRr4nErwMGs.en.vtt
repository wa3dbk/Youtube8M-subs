00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.329
 ah 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.190
 ah 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.830
 because this room is the laboratory of 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.690
 bq mechanical tests 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.670
 this is where we try the different 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.320
 prototypes that are obtained until 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 that you reach the final product and you are 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.880
 undergo physical tests then it's worth 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 well, temperatures are approved 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 they steal humidity, they test resistances 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.180
 mechanical resistance to falls break the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.650
 wear but this machine is a 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.360
 climatic machine on this machine it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.520
 they can 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.650
 and fix temperature conditions and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 humidity inside of this space 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.430
 we have here here what we do is 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.890
 age the devices submit to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.650
 tests like for example so warm it up 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 cool it and put moisture generally 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.860
 to simulate what would happen by 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.059
 example then when you leave the device 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 in the bathroom while you are giving 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.180
 shower with hot water is 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 running a test cycle that's why 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 we can not open the machine 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 and this test cycle , you can see where 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 we have the humidity and the temperature 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.440
 right now for example the device 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.940
 is at 60 degrees we could simulate by 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.259
 example what happens when we leave a 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.880
 device in the car in the 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.759
 dashboard on a summer day during 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.780
 6 hours in the sun here we have the machine 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.580
 of dust is worth this machine what for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 what is used is to see how it enters 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.840
 dust inside the device clear no 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.700
 we can simulate the time of we can not 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.229
 have a device five years before 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 launch it to the market to see how it enters 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.590
 the dust we have to be faster 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 in some way you have to force 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.890
 that between dust as we force to 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.440
 between pole then for this machine here 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.729
 we put a couple of kilos of talcum vale 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.180
 it has a few fans down very 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.560
 big 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 and this is like a desert storm 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.170
 with sand you can adjust the level of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.330
 empty so that we extract air from 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.470
 inside and the pressure conditions are 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.170
 less than those in the environment 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.240
 then how good is the dust of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.220
 talc is that it is very very finite very very 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
 finite gets through any loophole 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.630
 of the device but as it is white we 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.340
 helps to see where the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.290
 where is it entering with which 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.630
 we can adjust and here on this side already 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.610
 We have mechanical testing machines 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.459
 is worth this machine that appears as a 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.600
 centrifuge of the astronauts 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.200
 here what we do is we put a 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.200
 device 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.140
 notice that this machine has a 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.550
 special geometry that makes the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.380
 device fall from up here 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.819
 down here we drag it like the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.819
 slide let's see 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.329
 the sound that is heard is the cobayu 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.329
 tumbling 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.989
 they are tested in the two they are placed in the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.430
 Two heights are tested at height 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.780
 big and small height here what 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.030
 simulate is is by our how many times 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.680
 Holds a drop of one meter one meter 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.000
 fifty in a meter twenty the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.840
 device this machine what test 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.840
 they are micro falls 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.060
 here what we have is a small claw 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.170
 pneumatic that grabs the device and what 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.409
 will drop from a height 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.409
 determined 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.990
 in this machine in addition to testing the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.640
 mechanical strength what is tested is 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.860
 that inwardly none of the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.390
 small collectors that join the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.490
 parts of the motherboard with other 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.490
 components disconnect 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.540
 this machine is used to simulate what 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.310
 what happens when you sit down for the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.110
 phone in the pocket with the machine 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.080
 of bending then a cowboy 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.210
 with a pocket the device is inserted 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.520
 it closes the pocket turns on the 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.740
 machine and the machine presses the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.180
 device trying to bend 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.310
 equally well here you can make a 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.560
 1000 testing 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.840
 of thousand compressions and see what happens 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.860
 with the device if you have suffered 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.860
 type of damage or not 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.080
 This machine is a machine that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.730
 used to test how the 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.940
 device between the drive and the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.310
 pressure we put the device here 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.830
 in these claws we close it and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.630
 we compress or stretch what happens 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.680
 is that this essay is good because it's a bit 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.690
 destructive then you have to be 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.510
 prepared with glasses gown and that because 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.570
 can jump and here we have another series 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.459
 of another series of machines is worth 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.410
 we use to test the buttons 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.780
 in this case we are testing how many 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.610
 sometimes this button is pressed the button 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.410
 power of the device imagine that 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.900
 we give this button 10 times 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.090
 per day for example 20 times a day 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.950
 would be 7 thousand times a year because if 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.480
 we test 70 thousand times we are sure 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.890
 that this button is not going to spoil in 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.530
 the first 10 years of life of the 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.320
 device and here we have another machine 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.220
 What is the vibration machine? 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.139
 machine what it does is that the 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.819
 device vibrates on all three axes 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.560
 that is achieved by vibrating the 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:54.259
 device so what you get to see 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.610
 is if any of the micro components of 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.729
 the micro connectors inside are 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.199
 release the process of the process 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.879
 development of a mobile phone is a 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.319
 iterative process in which one goes 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.029
 going through several states from the 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.460
 first prototype until the first 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.289
 manufacturing tests in each of 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.090
 those states are passed to all is des 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.550
 complete and the hardware test for 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.169
 verify that everything is correct and take 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.759
 the relevant decisions that sometimes 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.620
 they get to change part of the 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.569
 device for the next for the 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.560
 next state and that's how we tested 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.560
 the devices the record
