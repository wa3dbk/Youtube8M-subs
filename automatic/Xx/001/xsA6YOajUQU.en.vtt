00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.690

either<00:01:43.049> loved<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> shampoo<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.189> hated

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
either loved the shampoo or they hated

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
either loved the shampoo or they hated
it<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:45.990> shampoo<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it and I really think it's the shampoo I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.630 
it and I really think it's the shampoo I
don't<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.040> conditioner<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
don't think it's the conditioner that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.289 
don't think it's the conditioner that
does<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.030> texturization<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:50.060> really<00:01:51.060> think

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
does that texturization I really think

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.260 
does that texturization I really think
it's<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> shampoo<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.729> ever<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.180> know

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it's the shampoo and ever you know

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.730 
it's the shampoo and ever you know

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.980 
people that already had really damaged
hair

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
hair

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.170 
hair
and<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.650> people<00:02:02.890> with<00:02:03.010> no<00:02:03.580> who<00:02:03.700> had<00:02:03.820> good<00:02:03.970> hair

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
and the people with no who had good hair

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.330 
and the people with no who had good hair
just<00:02:04.420> said<00:02:05.110> like<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.530> messed<00:02:05.890> up<00:02:06.010> their<00:02:06.159> hair

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
just said like it messed up their hair

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.570 
just said like it messed up their hair
it<00:02:06.940> really<00:02:06.970> did<00:02:07.360> like<00:02:07.510> okay<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:09.399> actually

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
it really did like okay so it actually

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.840 
it really did like okay so it actually
comes<00:02:09.940> in<00:02:10.090> two<00:02:10.179> sizes<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:12.190> smaller<00:02:12.459> size

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
comes in two sizes to the smaller size

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.150 
comes in two sizes to the smaller size
is<00:02:13.150> about<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.390> think<00:02:13.510> seven<00:02:13.990> eight<00:02:14.470> dollars<00:02:14.860> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
is about I think seven eight dollars and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.340 
is about I think seven eight dollars and
then<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.910> bigger<00:02:16.150> pump<00:02:16.450> size<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.170> believe

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
then this bigger pump size is I believe

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.930 
then this bigger pump size is I believe
seventeen<00:02:18.010> dollars<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:18.489> it's<00:02:18.610> really<00:02:18.760> cool

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
seventeen dollars but it's really cool

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.930 
seventeen dollars but it's really cool
what<00:02:19.060> they<00:02:19.180> do<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:20.130> they<00:02:21.130> sell<00:02:21.340> refills<00:02:21.790> of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
what they do is they sell refills of

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.250 
what they do is they sell refills of
this<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.780> put<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.080> pump

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
this so you do is you put the pump

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.809 
this so you do is you put the pump
bottle<00:02:23.500> once<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.890> then<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.069> buy<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.280> refill

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
bottle once and then you buy the refill

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.970 
bottle once and then you buy the refill
and<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.170> refill<00:02:26.470> ends<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.709> being<00:02:26.830> like

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
and so it the refill ends up being like

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.590 
and so it the refill ends up being like
five<00:02:27.220> bucks<00:02:27.400> cheaper<00:02:27.670> than<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.060> pump<00:02:28.239> also

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
five bucks cheaper than the pump also

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.900 
five bucks cheaper than the pump also
it's<00:02:29.530> pretty<00:02:29.709> cool<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.250> refill<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:30.790> this

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
it's pretty cool like a refill for this

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.940 
it's pretty cool like a refill for this
whole<00:02:31.030> try<00:02:31.180> things<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.690> twelve<00:02:32.530> dollars<00:02:32.800> I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
whole try things like twelve dollars I

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.490 
whole try things like twelve dollars I
think<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.180> economical<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.260> sense

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
think so it is economical in that sense

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.570 
think so it is economical in that sense
I<00:02:35.620> think<00:02:35.769> that's<00:02:35.920> really<00:02:36.070> cool<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.430> they<00:02:36.519> do

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
I think that's really cool that they do

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
I think that's really cool that they do
that

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.460 
that

the<00:03:38.200> same<00:03:38.350> just<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.680> little<00:03:38.860> bit<00:03:38.980> more<00:03:39.100> light

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
the same just a little bit more light

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.370 
the same just a little bit more light

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
and the formula is little more life I

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.620 
and the formula is little more life I
still<00:03:47.500> notice<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.730> kind<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.060> like<00:03:49.209> different

conditioners and she had scanned them

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.220 
conditioners and she had scanned them
and<00:04:36.550> Pantene<00:04:37.030> pro-v<00:04:37.240> got<00:04:37.540> first<00:04:37.810> place<00:04:38.020> and

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
and Pantene pro-v got first place and

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.560 
and Pantene pro-v got first place and
Tsubaki<00:04:38.800> got<00:04:38.950> third<00:04:39.220> which<00:04:39.790> is<00:04:39.940> just<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:40.330> weird

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
Tsubaki got third which is just so weird

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.120 
Tsubaki got third which is just so weird
because<00:04:40.690> Pantene<00:04:41.230> pro-v<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:41.770> much<00:04:41.919> cheaper

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
because Pantene pro-v is so much cheaper

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
because Pantene pro-v is so much cheaper
