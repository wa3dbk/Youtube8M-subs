00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.589
 what happened to people that happened I am 6 already 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.910
 Some people know me and those who do not 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.269
 they know they are getting to know him now 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.929
 this video 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.699
 great game I was going to say but I do not know 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.279
 exactly if they add up to a game so 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.780
 let's see the points and we take out 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.620
 conclusions 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.870
 this is called dragon ball but it is not born 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.330
 that was based on the first saga of 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.230
 dragon ball for the nes is this game 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.230
 it came out 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.989
 the shit as time passes good only 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.850
 that's like two out of seven games for 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.040
 the month that is quite simple 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.440
 and paste 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.920
 technically it is based on the first 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.720
 stage of dragonball but more or less 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.550
 equal certain detail of the graphics I 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.670
 I like I like that he has certain 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.730
 details that are pretty 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.230
 really quite well accomplished as per 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.350
 example I think it is well achieved 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:11.600
 then the screens themselves seem to me 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.950
 quite mediocre the level of fighting is 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.860
 very mean that I can not do anything else 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.880
 than hit them and receive their punches in the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.649
 I try so it seems a bit like if I see 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.149
 that has other details of a game that 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.979
 I do not remember the name to see if someone 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.700
 I support myself in the comments because I 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.700
 remember a game 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.210
 face of good yes the truth that the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.159
 system was pretty similar everything was 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.390
 very similar the same reminded me just 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.930
 when he jumped when he beat the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.990
 enemy 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.060
 but 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.909
 I can not remember do not give me a game if I 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 He also dislikes that the same thing has to be 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.170
 see one of the systems that I just 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.810
 to receive 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.210
 the character if he received certain items and 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.380
 could run and different shelves if 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.060
 It bothers me a lot, for example, 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.060
 that every time someone is killed 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.960
 -there's a hurry here says bulman yes 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.450
 although you do not believe it 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.160
 What does bother me a little is that in 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.750
 the extent that one kills an enemy of 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.800
 these and it gives you an item it takes to appear 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.940
 then you just have to wait 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.980
 and on the other hand it also bothers me that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.420
 I'm hitting someone goku 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.069
 turn the other way I do not understand very 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.999
 well the why is there 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.340
 He came out and he goes very fast I find it hard to read 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:39.390
 quick boots like me 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.710
 good going very fast good 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.710
 how important it is to kill 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.490
 we can not die 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.980
 your mother's shell we go back to see 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.849
 God willing 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.470
 continue that we will continue the start 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.950
 obviously because we did not pass or the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.950
 first level 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:14.790
 tonight david I'm afraid and I'll school 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.790
 Golden 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.850
 you will have at first to spend a 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.590
 shit stuck on a stick but not what 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.200
 we could achieve because the game has 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.180
 certain weird things in your young age 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.290
 like being that I can not kill certain 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.240
 enemies without being hit at 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.299
 same time or at least I did not understand 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.340
 how 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.090
 and without counting that it turns around when 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.870
 I'm hitting an enemy 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:50.280
 Fucking red I say little because 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.470
 remember that I came from Spain between 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:59.209
 you django because they are Mexican 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:01.860
 some latinos like the truth 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.110
 but not what to say for a long time 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.350
 because already 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.940
 now 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.940
 or if it goes very fast 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.090
 ah 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.100
 little by little with the strongest man to see 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.540
 his dam shit 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.750
 after certain items that do not pass 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.140
 nothing like it 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.140
 these enemies that can not touch like this 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.990
 and then it will make you leave the items for 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.720
 back clearly in the average that it takes 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.060
 in leaving a pantyhose very well a sign 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.639
 of questions 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:08.310
 I can also escape because of what I have 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:10.080
 that kill and kill all 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.420
 the most difficult thing is to play and talk to the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.500
 time that I 5 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.500
 the vulgar 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.380
 I like s 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.840
 I can not kill him without him killing me 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.840
 there is no way 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.270
 be born 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.950
 I do not like this game the truth 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.480
 had great action the gameplays 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.300
 interesting for this little game the truth 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:46.050
 that I give my thumb down because 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.180
 while 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.520
 some of the graphic things I like 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.470
 the game itself seems a bit shit 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.759
 so I do not recommend much to play this 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.520
 game there are other better ones that I'll be 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.750
 showing at other times so 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.800
 goku this was not 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.810
 your chance to shine 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.330
 anything people we will see in another 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.280
 video I am 6 I do many things music 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.919
 but I'm also a human being so 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.960
 as such I enjoyed some good 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.259
 games that has not been the case until the 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.259
 next
