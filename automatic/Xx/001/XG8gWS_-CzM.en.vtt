all<00:00:01.199> right<00:00:01.589> electrical<00:00:02.129> hardcamp<00:00:02.659> I've<00:00:03.659> got

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
all right electrical hardcamp I've got

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.589 
all right electrical hardcamp I've got
the<00:00:03.929> lights<00:00:04.140> which<00:00:04.700> runs<00:00:05.700> aligned<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:08.599> all

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
the lights which runs aligned and all

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.140 
the lights which runs aligned and all
three<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.260> row<00:00:10.769> max<00:00:10.980> wires<00:00:11.309> soldered

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
three of the row max wires soldered

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.129 
three of the row max wires soldered
together<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.730> charge<00:00:14.730> said<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.210> 14

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
together here so charge said that 14

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.859

gauge<00:00:16.350> canal<00:00:16.650> 30<00:00:16.859> amps<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.449> low<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.480> there's

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
gauge canal 30 amps so low that there's

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.510 
gauge canal 30 amps so low that there's
three<00:00:19.080> wires<00:00:19.260> there<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:19.740> about<00:00:19.830> 120<00:00:20.340> amps

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
three wires there so it's about 120 amps

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.120 
three wires there so it's about 120 amps
