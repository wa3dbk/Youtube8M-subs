00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.100
 the bric maya and a long time ago 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.950
 I feel video but good today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.860
 I'm going to show you how to make the happen 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.690
 to the beta one of them is 8 remember 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.610
 that's good before starting this video 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 I would like to clarify a few things 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.340
 that first in this process is under your 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.740
 responsibility when updating 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 your iphone is under your responsibility and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.029
 this has not me this is a video of 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.880
 show to also take into account 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.470
 that ios 8 has many errors this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.079
 because for the same thing that is a beta 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.570
 So if you have any errors do not hesitate 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.730
 in restore but as I say it is 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.430
 under your responsibility this video is 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.079
 demonstration to which I had told you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.539
 but good that we will need to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.520
 this video we are going to go to the link that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.520
 I said below in the description where they go 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.559
 to be able to find this the betas of 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 instruction for any device 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.950
 except those that are no longer compatible 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.980
 like the iphone 4 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.620
 the first generation ipad was treated 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.900
 less devices are supported 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.940
 Older you could say but good 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.180
 there is the list you are going to see 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.250
 at the time of downloading and good 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.460
 you are going to download the software 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.710
 correct for the device they have 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.920
 It often happens that they get confused by 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.690
 example that have ipad mini wifi and for 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.320
 exists in low in which say ipad mini 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.479
 more cellular wifi if you do that the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.260
 software is not going to grab you should be the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.910
 make it for your device 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.740
 Well, it's not that they have lowered the 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.870
 software will open them in the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.380
 files and delete the only thing they do is 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.020
 unzip it and they will leave the ips w 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.450
 corresponding to ios 8 what what 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.240
 we are going to do in itunes we are going to 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.310
 update on our iphone ipod touch 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.860
 or ipad or the device that we want 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.340
 put me I am I going to update it 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.530
 but not in the conventional way that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.910
 nothing else is to click and already this one that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.940
 update apart from not finding 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.260
 no update if they are in 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.010
 7.1 point one what you are going to do 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.040
 is in the case of windows is going to put 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.710
 the shift key will press it while 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.000
 they are going to click on this in update and 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.790
 they will open a window and in mac 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.800
 is alt + update the same is going to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.990
 open the same window or where that 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.030
 window you are going to look for what 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.180
 it would be the ipc w 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.550
 they have downloaded the corresponding internet 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.660
 ios 8 am action in the beta of the 8 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.120
 let's select what we were going to open it 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.440
 here there are two will send us this message of 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.050
 that the update of the team the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.030
 version 8.0 of ios and will verify the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.920
 update with apple do not worry 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.560
 none of that this method is totally 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.380
 free and without having registered rain 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.210
 it's totally normal then we're going to 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.220
 update and will start to extract the 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.830
 software as we can see up to our 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.300
 ipod touch is normal what is going to happen 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.300
 then do not worry 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.500
 on YouTube you will see that you are 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.450
 updating the iphone software 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.610
 then it's fine let's let that 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.079
 continue with that as I will accelerate this 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.909
 process so this video is not so 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.819
 heavy anyway I will be able to 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.709
 indicate how many times the 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.230
 time in this video then I do not know 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.890
 worry about that let's continue while 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.890
 with the video 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.450
 in our device will start to 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.219
 appear this little bar that indicates 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.379
 that is loading the new software but 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:52.090
 let's just leave it as if nothing 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.090
 let's let him load 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.110
 friends our ipod will be finished 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.379
 update and you would be fasting 8 the same 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.120
 as you can see here it is already 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.489
 is restarting then let it be 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.810
 Restart will start the screen of 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.810
 configuration is totally 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.680
 we get this is there breiner what 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.960
 let's put our password in the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.940
 If we have one, it will continue 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.889
 with this process you have to leave it 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.979
 connected you have to disconnect it 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.080
 while you have to leave it here remember 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.030
 this process is totally free without 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.490
 I have it already registered or is di 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.870
 developer another important thing if it is 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.479
 that have jailbreak 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.780
 and they want to do this process they're going to 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.330
 lose that have it for sure that 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.699
 maybe they can accept and they can do 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.520
 another series of break they will lose 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.280
 anyway because at 17.1 point 1 and 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.440
 to the break and less in ios 8 then take 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.449
 in mind that if he has in his 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.919
 device with everton is let's leave 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.919
 I loaded this line 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.120
 no friends and once you have finished the 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.580
 process we are going to be able to slide 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.310
 to unlock our ipod touch we 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.480
 this update message will appear 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.390
 completed your ipod has been updated 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.480
 correctly and good let's continue 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.940
 let's activate location 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.490
 and we are going to measure this step what it proves 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:39.380
 that we do not need any account 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.250
 is to use ios 8 special 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.340
 developers like you can see 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.819
 here is my purpose of generation in 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.289
 ios 8 the sale 1 but this video is going to 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:51.990
 serve for all betas since the 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.430
 process is the same but good those 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.470
 everyone liked the video please

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.840
