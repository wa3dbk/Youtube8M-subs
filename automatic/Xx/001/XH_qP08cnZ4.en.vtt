hello this is Ken from the CC here today
to<00:00:19.610> continue<00:00:20.210> our<00:00:20.390> little<00:00:20.660> series<00:00:21.110> on

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
to continue our little series on

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.830 
to continue our little series on
crashing<00:00:21.950> computers<00:00:22.490> now<00:00:23.450> we've<00:00:23.630> done<00:00:23.810> a

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
crashing computers now we've done a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.390 
crashing computers now we've done a
couple<00:00:24.080> of<00:00:24.200> videos<00:00:24.290> like<00:00:24.800> this<00:00:25.009> before<00:00:25.160> in<00:00:25.369> the

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
couple of videos like this before in the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.190 
couple of videos like this before in the
past<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:25.939> we<00:00:26.029> have<00:00:26.060> had<00:00:26.330> tons<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.750> people<00:00:26.930> who

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
past and we have had tons of people who

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.409 
past and we have had tons of people who
really<00:00:27.500> liked<00:00:27.890> it<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:28.220> they<00:00:28.820> wanted<00:00:29.090> us<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.240> do

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
really liked it and they wanted us to do

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.269 
really liked it and they wanted us to do
some<00:00:29.599> more<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:29.990> we<00:00:30.650> have<00:00:30.740> some<00:00:30.860> other<00:00:30.950> plans

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
some more and we have some other plans

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.950 
some more and we have some other plans
for<00:00:31.400> other<00:00:31.550> ones<00:00:31.759> in<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:31.970> future<00:00:32.269> but<00:00:32.809> right

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
for other ones in the future but right

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.390 
for other ones in the future but right
now<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:33.140> want<00:00:33.379> to<00:00:33.530> demonstrate<00:00:33.739> a<00:00:34.070> simple

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
now I want to demonstrate a simple

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.460 
now I want to demonstrate a simple
little<00:00:35.360> trick<00:00:35.750> that<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:36.080> can<00:00:36.230> use<00:00:36.350> the

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
little trick that you can use the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.680 
little trick that you can use the
terminal<00:00:36.830> for<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:37.699> completely<00:00:38.059> crash<00:00:38.449> your

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
terminal for to completely crash your

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.670 
terminal for to completely crash your
Mac<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:39.230> believe<00:00:40.129> this<00:00:40.280> trick<00:00:40.550> needs<00:00:41.150> OS<00:00:41.870> 10.5

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
Mac I believe this trick needs OS 10.5

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.320 
Mac I believe this trick needs OS 10.5
and<00:00:42.710> higher<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.489> work<00:00:43.640> properly

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
and higher to work properly

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.060 
and higher to work properly
there<00:00:44.930> are<00:00:45.050> other<00:00:45.170> ways<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.530> do<00:00:45.620> it<00:00:45.710> on<00:00:45.800> older

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
there are other ways to do it on older

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.710 
there are other ways to do it on older
systems<00:00:46.430> but<00:00:46.640> those<00:00:46.820> involve<00:00:47.180> developer

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
systems but those involve developer

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.410 
systems but those involve developer
techs<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.320> do<00:00:48.379> not<00:00:48.620> have<00:00:48.950> those<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:49.579> nor

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
techs and I do not have those and nor

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.060 
techs and I do not have those and nor
will<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.690> be<00:00:50.809> trying<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.440> get<00:00:51.590> one<00:00:51.710> right<00:00:51.920> now

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
will I be trying to get one right now

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.010 
will I be trying to get one right now
but<00:00:52.879> for<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.120> demo<00:00:53.360> I<00:00:53.540> will<00:00:53.600> show<00:00:53.780> you

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
but for this demo I will show you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.279 
but for this demo I will show you
Leopard<00:00:54.860> running<00:00:55.190> on<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:55.399> eMac<00:00:55.820> here<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.289> we

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
Leopard running on this eMac here and we

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.040 
Leopard running on this eMac here and we
will<00:00:57.410> use<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.530> terminal<00:00:58.239> so<00:00:59.239> there<00:00:59.899> is<00:01:00.020> a

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
will use a terminal so there is a

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.869 
will use a terminal so there is a
terminal<00:01:00.710> command<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.309> can<00:01:01.399> enter<00:01:01.670> in<00:01:01.789> your

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
terminal command you can enter in your

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.570 
terminal command you can enter in your
system<00:01:02.270> using<00:01:02.539> sudo<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:04.039> is<00:01:04.160> useful<00:01:04.460> for

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
system using sudo and it is useful for

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.980 
system using sudo and it is useful for
developers<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.149> test<00:01:05.270> their<00:01:05.449> applications

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
developers to test their applications

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.359 
developers to test their applications
and<00:01:06.080> how<00:01:06.229> they<00:01:06.350> function<00:01:06.530> during<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.039> system

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
and how they function during a system

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.609 
and how they function during a system
crash<00:01:07.610> now<00:01:08.600> normally<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.050> system<00:01:09.320> doesn't

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
crash now normally the system doesn't

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.290 
crash now normally the system doesn't
crash<00:01:09.800> that<00:01:10.070> often<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.520> don't<00:01:10.880> experience

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
crash that often I don't experience

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.690 
crash that often I don't experience
those<00:01:11.600> issues<00:01:12.050> usually<00:01:12.320> but<00:01:12.950> today<00:01:13.580> we're

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
those issues usually but today we're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.070 
those issues usually but today we're
going<00:01:13.789> to<00:01:13.880> force<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.270> system<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.840> crash

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
going to force the system to crash

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.160 
going to force the system to crash
itself<00:01:15.830> just<00:01:16.430> using<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.789> terminal<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:17.930> there

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
itself just using the terminal so there

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.660 
itself just using the terminal so there
is<00:01:18.259> a<00:01:18.289> command<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:18.890> am<00:01:18.979> displaying<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.580> you

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
is a command that I am displaying to you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.609 
is a command that I am displaying to you
right<00:01:20.000> here<00:01:20.240> right<00:01:20.569> now<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.020> this<00:01:21.110> will<00:01:21.289> force

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
right here right now and this will force

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.210 
right here right now and this will force
the<00:01:21.709> system<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.310> enter<00:01:22.459> a<00:01:22.729> state<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:24.220> unstable

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
the system to enter a state of unstable

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.219 
the system to enter a state of unstable
activity<00:01:26.030> where<00:01:26.179> the<00:01:26.300> system<00:01:26.599> needs<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.929> crash

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
activity where the system needs to crash

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.919 
activity where the system needs to crash
so<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.280> doesn't<00:01:28.700> cause<00:01:29.179> more<00:01:29.390> damage<00:01:29.599> to

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
so it doesn't cause more damage to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.270 
so it doesn't cause more damage to
itself<00:01:30.229> alright<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:30.800> now<00:01:30.920> we're<00:01:31.009> going<00:01:31.039> to<00:01:31.160> use

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
itself alright so now we're going to use

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.059 
itself alright so now we're going to use
sudo<00:01:31.550> to<00:01:31.729> do<00:01:31.910> some<00:01:32.720> special<00:01:32.959> admin<00:01:33.560> commands

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
sudo to do some special admin commands

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:35.620 
sudo to do some special admin commands
without<00:01:34.399> it<00:01:34.580> you<00:01:34.849> couldn't<00:01:35.060> do<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.569> the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
without it you couldn't do this in the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.620 
without it you couldn't do this in the
terminal<00:01:35.929> so<00:01:36.440> type<00:01:36.619> sudo<00:01:36.979> space<00:01:39.940> D<00:01:40.940> trace<00:01:41.300> all

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
I'm going to pull this up here and we're

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.580 
I'm going to pull this up here and we're
going<00:02:52.659> to<00:02:52.689> pull<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.049> terminal<00:02:53.530> here<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.700> side

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.869 

okay<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:02.650> we<00:03:02.889> have<00:03:03.010> our<00:03:03.040> game<00:03:03.340> here<00:03:03.609> you<00:03:03.790> know

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
okay so we have our game here you know

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.550 
okay so we have our game here you know
everything's<00:03:04.269> great<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:05.230> know<00:03:05.319> we're<00:03:05.469> doing

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
everything's great you know we're doing

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.110 
everything's great you know we're doing
stuff<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.219> let's<00:03:06.459> go<00:03:06.549> back<00:03:06.669> to<00:03:06.790> our<00:03:06.819> terminal

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
stuff so let's go back to our terminal

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.640 
stuff so let's go back to our terminal
and<00:03:07.419> when<00:03:08.109> you<00:03:08.199> enter<00:03:08.439> in<00:03:08.500> your<00:03:08.560> password

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
and when you enter in your password

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.229 
and when you enter in your password
nothing<00:03:09.219> is<00:03:09.280> going<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.430> show<00:03:09.669> up<00:03:09.790> because<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
nothing is going to show up because it

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.729 
nothing is going to show up because it
purposely<00:03:10.569> does<00:03:10.810> not<00:03:10.989> show<00:03:11.169> the<00:03:11.199> dots<00:03:11.530> when

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
purposely does not show the dots when

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.470 
purposely does not show the dots when
you<00:03:11.799> type<00:03:11.949> in<00:03:12.069> a<00:03:12.129> password<00:03:12.250> for<00:03:12.579> security<00:03:13.030> so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
you type in a password for security so

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.759 
you type in a password for security so
we're<00:03:13.569> going<00:03:13.659> to<00:03:13.719> enter<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:14.019> our<00:03:14.109> password<00:03:14.169> and

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
we're going to enter in our password and

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.520 
we're going to enter in our password and
strike<00:03:15.340> return<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.989> then<00:03:17.139> let's<00:03:17.290> say<00:03:17.409> we're

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
strike return so then let's say we're

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.490 
strike return so then let's say we're
trying<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.769> do<00:03:17.889> something<00:03:18.159> and<00:03:19.079> there<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.169> go

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
trying to do something and there you go

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.249 
trying to do something and there you go
so<00:03:21.159> the<00:03:21.489> audio<00:03:21.819> begins<00:03:22.000> looping<00:03:22.629> the<00:03:22.900> system

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:23.259 
so the audio begins looping the system

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:25.469 
so the audio begins looping the system
freezes<00:03:23.650> up<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.220> curtain<00:03:24.579> comes<00:03:24.819> down<00:03:24.939> and<00:03:25.389> it

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
freezes up the curtain comes down and it

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.589 
freezes up the curtain comes down and it
says<00:03:25.689> you<00:03:26.319> need<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.500> restart<00:03:26.919> your<00:03:27.040> computer

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
says you need to restart your computer

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.240 
says you need to restart your computer
so<00:03:28.599> this<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.079> what<00:03:29.259> the<00:03:29.409> Mac<00:03:29.590> does<00:03:29.829> when<00:03:30.099> it

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
so this is what the Mac does when it

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.920 
so this is what the Mac does when it
crashes<00:03:30.459> at<00:03:30.759> least<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.120> older<00:03:31.359> systems<00:03:31.750> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
crashes at least the older systems the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.509 
crashes at least the older systems the
newer<00:03:32.079> systems<00:03:32.560> do<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.829> quite<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.340> bit

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
newer systems do it quite a bit

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.189 
newer systems do it quite a bit
differently<00:03:33.819> so<00:03:34.449> now<00:03:34.540> we're<00:03:34.629> gonna<00:03:34.750> do<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.930> hard

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
differently so now we're gonna do a hard

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.629 
differently so now we're gonna do a hard
shutdown<00:03:35.709> here<00:03:35.949> we're<00:03:36.159> just<00:03:36.189> gonna<00:03:36.370> hold<00:03:36.549> down

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
shutdown here we're just gonna hold down

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.399 
shutdown here we're just gonna hold down
the<00:03:36.790> power<00:03:36.819> button<00:03:37.030> but<00:03:37.750> I'm<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.049> gonna<00:03:38.169> show

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
the power button but I'm just gonna show

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.379 
the power button but I'm just gonna show
you<00:03:38.439> that<00:03:38.769> this<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.549> real<00:03:39.759> kernel<00:03:40.120> panic

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
you that this is a real kernel panic

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.520 
you that this is a real kernel panic
it's<00:03:40.509> not<00:03:40.629> some<00:03:40.810> fake<00:03:41.049> thing<00:03:41.290> we're<00:03:41.439> gonna

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
it's not some fake thing we're gonna

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.349 
it's not some fake thing we're gonna
actually<00:03:41.889> boot<00:03:42.099> OS<00:03:42.430> 10<00:03:42.639> without<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:42.939> shell

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
actually boot OS 10 without a shell

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.300 
actually boot OS 10 without a shell
which<00:03:44.169> is<00:03:44.319> pretty<00:03:44.470> interesting<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.949> look<00:03:45.159> at

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
which is pretty interesting to look at

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.439 
which is pretty interesting to look at
if<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.549> haven't<00:03:45.759> seen<00:03:45.909> it<00:03:46.030> before<00:03:46.120> it's<00:03:46.329> quite

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
if you haven't seen it before it's quite

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.390 
if you haven't seen it before it's quite
awesome<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:46.989> we're<00:03:47.680> gonna<00:03:47.769> crash<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.250> from

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
awesome and we're gonna crash it from

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.939 
awesome and we're gonna crash it from
there<00:03:48.609> so<00:03:49.449> this<00:03:50.079> is<00:03:50.229> always<00:03:50.439> 10<00:03:50.650> booting

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
there so this is always 10 booting

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.460 
there so this is always 10 booting
without<00:03:51.159> a<00:03:51.189> shell<00:03:51.459> essentially<00:03:52.269> no<00:03:53.049> interface

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
without a shell essentially no interface

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.379 
without a shell essentially no interface
and<00:03:53.769> we're<00:03:54.370> gonna<00:03:54.459> use<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.699> same<00:03:54.729> command<00:03:55.209> and

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
and we're gonna use the same command and

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.920 
and we're gonna use the same command and
the<00:03:56.290> way<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.889> system<00:03:57.159> crashes<00:03:57.430> in<00:03:57.930> single

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
the way the system crashes in single

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.899 
the way the system crashes in single
user<00:03:59.169> mode<00:03:59.199> is<00:03:59.530> quite<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.769> bit<00:03:59.919> different<00:03:59.949> then

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
user mode is quite a bit different then

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.580 
user mode is quite a bit different then
when<00:04:01.209> we<00:04:01.359> actually<00:04:01.449> use<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.259> desktop

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
when we actually use the desktop

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.240 
when we actually use the desktop
environment<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.359> then<00:04:04.359> our<00:04:04.829> curly<00:04:05.829> braces

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.740 

panic<00:04:09.250> or<00:04:09.969> parentheses<00:04:11.370> semi-colon<00:04:12.750> curly

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
panic or parentheses semi-colon curly

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.370 
panic or parentheses semi-colon curly
bracket<00:04:14.169> unquote<00:04:15.479> so<00:04:16.479> I<00:04:16.509> press<00:04:16.810> return<00:04:16.959> and

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
bracket unquote so I press return and

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.399 
bracket unquote so I press return and
then<00:04:18.009> let's<00:04:18.579> observe<00:04:18.820> what<00:04:19.209> happens<00:04:19.539> here<00:04:19.750> oh

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.570 

the<00:04:23.409> keyboard<00:04:23.800> did<00:04:23.889> not<00:04:24.009> get<00:04:24.159> something<00:04:24.460> there

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
the keyboard did not get something there

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.909 
the keyboard did not get something there
it<00:04:24.639> looks<00:04:24.820> like<00:04:25.020> come<00:04:26.020> on

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.600 

yeah<00:04:30.919> it's<00:04:31.129> a<00:04:31.250> keyboard<00:04:31.669> adversary's<00:04:32.800> well<00:04:33.800> um

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
there okay so we have our command

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.369 
there okay so we have our command
entered<00:04:55.669> in<00:04:55.789> again<00:04:56.090> with<00:04:56.599> all<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:57.050> arguments

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:57.379 
entered in again with all the arguments

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.320 
entered in again with all the arguments
this<00:04:57.710> time<00:04:57.979> yeah<00:04:58.819> when<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.030> do<00:04:59.120> this<00:04:59.270> I

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
this time yeah when you do this I

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.879 
this time yeah when you do this I
recommend<00:04:59.449> you<00:04:59.810> keep<00:04:59.990> what<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.199> works<00:05:00.409> so

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
recommend you keep what that works so

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.059 
recommend you keep what that works so
let's<00:05:00.949> strike<00:05:01.190> return<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:02.530> there<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.710> go

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
let's strike return and there you go

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.909 
let's strike return and there you go
I<00:05:04.330> actually<00:05:05.330> don't<00:05:05.659> remember<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.169> showing<00:05:06.800> the

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
I actually don't remember it showing the

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.260 
I actually don't remember it showing the
uptime<00:05:07.250> in<00:05:07.370> nanoseconds<00:05:07.909> I<00:05:07.970> forgot<00:05:08.180> about

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
uptime in nanoseconds I forgot about

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.379 
uptime in nanoseconds I forgot about
that<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:09.740> yep<00:05:09.919> it<00:05:10.099> shows<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.819> shows<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.270> that

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
that so yep it shows it shows you that

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.790 
that so yep it shows it shows you that
the<00:05:11.539> system<00:05:11.690> is<00:05:11.930> crashed<00:05:12.289> it<00:05:12.440> tells<00:05:12.620> you<00:05:12.710> the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
the system is crashed it tells you the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.920 
the system is crashed it tells you the
bsd<00:05:13.220> process<00:05:13.669> name<00:05:13.880> that<00:05:14.180> caused<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.750> issue

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
bsd process name that caused the issue

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.390 
bsd process name that caused the issue
and<00:05:15.319> that<00:05:15.380> would<00:05:15.530> be<00:05:15.620> DTrace<00:05:16.069> since<00:05:16.280> the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
and that would be DTrace since the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.339 
and that would be DTrace since the
command<00:05:16.699> we<00:05:16.849> used<00:05:17.120> there's<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:17.930> lot<00:05:18.050> of<00:05:18.169> hex

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
command we used there's a lot of hex

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.959 
command we used there's a lot of hex
code<00:05:18.650> up<00:05:18.830> here<00:05:19.039> I<00:05:19.069> don't<00:05:19.580> even<00:05:19.669> know<00:05:19.819> what<00:05:19.940> a

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
code up here I don't even know what a

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.559 
code up here I don't even know what a
lot<00:05:20.150> of<00:05:20.240> that<00:05:20.360> means<00:05:20.569> um<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:22.430> it<00:05:23.300> tells<00:05:23.479> you

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
lot of that means um and it tells you

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.219 
lot of that means um and it tells you
the<00:05:23.659> system<00:05:23.930> uptime<00:05:24.080> in<00:05:24.409> nanoseconds<00:05:25.159> and

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
the system uptime in nanoseconds and

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.959 
the system uptime in nanoseconds and
let's<00:05:27.229> see<00:05:27.319> it<00:05:27.560> tells<00:05:27.710> us<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:27.949> OS<00:05:28.190> 10<00:05:28.490> version

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
let's see it tells us the OS 10 version

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.100 
let's see it tells us the OS 10 version
sometimes<00:05:31.969> it<00:05:32.120> says<00:05:32.300> we<00:05:32.509> are<00:05:32.539> hanging<00:05:33.080> here

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
sometimes it says we are hanging here

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.240 
sometimes it says we are hanging here
but<00:05:33.409> I<00:05:33.469> guess<00:05:33.620> in<00:05:33.770> this<00:05:33.889> version<00:05:34.039> of<00:05:34.159> the

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
but I guess in this version of the

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.800 
but I guess in this version of the
system<00:05:34.400> it's<00:05:34.610> not<00:05:34.759> showing<00:05:35.060> that<00:05:35.180> but<00:05:35.389> yeah<00:05:35.509> so

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
system it's not showing that but yeah so

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.990 
system it's not showing that but yeah so
there<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.020> go<00:05:36.110> that<00:05:36.289> is<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.530> system<00:05:37.400> crashing

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
there you go that is the system crashing

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.270 
there you go that is the system crashing
without<00:05:38.900> a<00:05:38.930> shell<00:05:39.319> this<00:05:39.560> is<00:05:39.620> what<00:05:39.830> it<00:05:39.919> displays

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
without a shell this is what it displays

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.920 
without a shell this is what it displays
when<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.909> don't<00:05:41.090> actually<00:05:41.270> have<00:05:41.509> the<00:05:41.630> system

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
when you don't actually have the system

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.120 
when you don't actually have the system
booted<00:05:42.199> up<00:05:42.289> into<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:43.099> regular<00:05:44.440> mode<00:05:45.440> this<00:05:45.889> is

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
booted up into a regular mode this is

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.920 
booted up into a regular mode this is
single<00:05:46.460> user<00:05:46.639> mode<00:05:46.699> so<00:05:47.210> I<00:05:47.240> hope<00:05:47.569> you<00:05:47.659> enjoyed

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
single user mode so I hope you enjoyed

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.600 
single user mode so I hope you enjoyed
that<00:05:47.960> it's<00:05:48.289> pretty<00:05:48.440> interesting<00:05:48.740> look<00:05:49.460> out
