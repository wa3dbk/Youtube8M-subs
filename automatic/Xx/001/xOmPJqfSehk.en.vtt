in the early twentieth this is almost
exactly<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:41.270> way<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:41.840> came<00:00:42.200> from<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.560> factory

except for the color has your problem as
you<00:00:46.280> probably<00:00:46.550> know<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:47.210> would<00:00:47.450> have<00:00:47.540> been

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
you probably know this would have been

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.960 
you probably know this would have been
black<00:00:47.899> and<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.200> reason<00:00:48.500> for<00:00:48.530> that<00:00:48.710> is<00:00:49.040> henry

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
black and the reason for that is henry

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.380 
black and the reason for that is henry
ford<00:00:50.239> introduced<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.989> assembly<00:00:51.590> line<00:00:51.800> in

ford introduced the assembly line in

ford introduced the assembly line in
1913<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.410> he<00:00:54.590> needed<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.040> speed<00:00:55.399> up

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
1913 and so he needed to speed up

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.660 
1913 and so he needed to speed up
production<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.570> make<00:00:57.200> cars<00:00:57.559> as<00:00:57.800> cheaply<00:00:58.579> as

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
production to make cars as cheaply as

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.110 
production to make cars as cheaply as
possible<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.380> black<00:01:00.590> paint<00:01:00.950> tried<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
possible and the black paint tried the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.569 
possible and the black paint tried the
quickest<00:01:02.510> but<00:01:02.870> by<00:01:03.020> 1925<00:01:03.770> they<00:01:04.250> had<00:01:04.399> other

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
quickest but by 1925 they had other

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.730 
quickest but by 1925 they had other
colors<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.210> dried<00:01:05.720> fast<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.409> could<00:01:06.620> get

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
colors that dried fast so you could get

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.370 
colors that dried fast so you could get
them<00:01:06.860> in<00:01:06.979> reds<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.909> blues<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.720> greens<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.200> so
