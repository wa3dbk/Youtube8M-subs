00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello again to everyone today topic 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.189
 of our video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.740
 work on bugs number two has been reported 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.590
 a lot of calls and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.570
 send a photo about young saplings 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.820
 don't get stuck in delay 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.380
 kidneys are kind of swollen 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.189
 open but very weak growth 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.400
 I could not understand what the deal was about 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 various options and padma births and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.630
 vyvrevaniya but not because . 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.620
 alive and the path conducting system is also alive 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.870
 began to look for a way out and here as well as 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 turned out invited me to visit 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.030
 Kremenchuk Valentin and young winegrowers 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.890
 with his permission 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.610
 spend this little such 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.640
 consultation work on the bugs 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 the main mistake of beginners 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.079
 is among the data path 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.460
 was that the bushes are planted on 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.490
 depth from 70 to 80 centimeters over 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.510
 ground level that is what happens what 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.450
 happened in this case since we 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.000
 this year and pamper us earlier 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.580
 spring did not work low temperatures 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.830
 ground level ground warmed but can 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.439
 be centimeters on then 30 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.430
 Attacks and seedlings planted to a depth of 70 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.530
 centimeters 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.310
 respectively, the roots simply 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.070
 sleeps arriving at the vineyard we are with him 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.720
 passed checked all vines vines are alive 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.820
 the buds are alive and made so sad 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.610
 the conclusion that the bushes are still like 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.729
 suspended animation to their cause for horrors 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.180
 reacted to heat and that kidney 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.079
 barely advanced to her very hard 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.860
 so we had to not us 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.280
 specifically 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.010
 young grower remove land from 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.570
 bushes and we cleaned the ground to the depth from 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.140
 20 to 35 centimeters after 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.670
 we have cleaned the land has passed for three days 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.220
 even four days and have me today 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.900
 called and says yes indeed on 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.630
 those varieties which are generally not visible 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.090
 It was a kidney and not fluffed. 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.650
 and fluffed swelled and on some varieties 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.620
 already went to go well, we hope that 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.790
 they will grow more intensively 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.550
 Now here is the temperature already 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.690
 reached 25 degrees literally 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.190
 two or three days and the roots of the earth warms up 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.610
 get to the roots 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.730
 come active sap flow these 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.370
 seedlings start to grow intensively and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.170
 catching up I hope well not too late 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.390
 catching up 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.450
 rostov even but this is already perennial 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.000
 bushes 1 pour on annual saplings 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.120
 There is to such a gain we teach 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.700
 I want to return a little bit weak 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.700
 alone but it is nevertheless my personal again 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.239
 opinion personally my beliefs you can with 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.910
 agree to disagree but sense 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.480
 digging pits meter by meter fall asleep and 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.650
 rubble put drainage I do not see it well 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.320
 that is vain labor which to take away 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.260
 a lot of time and effort but there is one 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.049
 but if you have loam 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.019
 hard loam if you are fertile 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.799
 layer less than 40 centimeters then yes 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.290
 then we dig a hole meter by meter replace 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.470
 the ground that is we fall asleep black soil we lay 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.900
 fertilizer layer application of rubble and 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.390
 drainage i see only in that case 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.480
 warranted if absolutely absent 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.570
 water that is water scarcity and so 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.209
 the way the water shortage we overlap 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.180
 that feed water specifically to the roots but it 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.990
 again this is my personal opinion and how are you 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.310
 see all the bushes there 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.110
 I posted video bushes I sit heel 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.890
 seedling heel if you understand what I mean 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.890
 I say this place on the cuttings from which 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.440
 go branching roots of the main must 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.410
 be no deeper than 35 centimeters from 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.380
 the surface of the earth is believe it is my 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.040
 personal experience up to 2 baby can be there 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.920
 north of 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.380
 it does not fit but in my personal experience 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.900
 no bush ever grew there 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.030
 over a ten year time period the main 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.000
 we dug up the root mass apparently not 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.640
 it lies on the interval 25-45 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.300
 centimeters club roots don't go it goes 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.370
 one root 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.410
 maybe the main one for that 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.000
 just to take all the nutritional moisture 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.190
 substances 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.700
 bush collects from the surface here these 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.070
 that's 25 30 centimeters in winter even when 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.780
 freezing of land there even with 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.390
 freezing at 40 centimeters 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.280
 nothing will happen to your bushes 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.250
 more if we harbor young bushes 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.830
 mail your way to land up to 25 centimeters 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.970
 we get 25 plus 35 now half a meter 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.820
 Well if you've still planted bushes 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.640
 your fisherman and wait you do not have vegetation 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.370
 they start turn away the earth from the roots 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.850
 that is, you remove from the trunk from the trunk 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.370
 bush 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.650
 unroll the ground there 30 centimeters 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.320
 forty-five world clean and if so 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.890
 the situation is so pitiful cold on 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.770
 on the street, cover it with cellophane black 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.700
 garbage bag and you will see how three 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.200
 four five days 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.730
 your bush will start working and go up 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.330
 there was one such grape but it is 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.370
 now he will not call him we will not 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.780
 do advertising he spring 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.360
 in order to stimulate the fastest 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.720
 disclosure of the kidneys he watered a slick with this 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:58.150
 water temperature 40 to 50 degrees 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:00.700
 the roots immediately got warm and gave 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.400
 they know that it is already spring and the buds are swelling 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.830
 but in our situation there is no 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.760
 sense 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.590
 earlier discovery of the kidneys because May 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.860
 recurrent frosts just that kidney 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.570
 they will kill immediately 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.300
 grapes of the Dnipropetrovsk region 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:22.650
 you can start no earlier than April 1 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.260
 even if the street will be plus 18 there 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.550
 plus 15 of course if you will be 10-15 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.370
 days need to open 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.660
 and so on April 1, you are free until April 1 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:36.510
 your bushes and that young lie what 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.120
 perennial they lie to the earth till when you 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.350
 open will be a feeling 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.440
 diaper rash for the charm and but trust me 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.440
 it will be much safer save so 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.630
 way if you unscrew April 1 there 1 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.510
 there on April 5 you will not fall under the first 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:55.500
 a wave of frosts this is usually ours 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.180
 years markedly somewhere from 5 to 15 April the 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.960
 there is no kidney yet and push it 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.220
 frost didn't kill how we 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.130
 detract if these growing in 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.010
 a greenhouse is necessary for a school rather to him 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.410
 accelerate the opening of the bud vegetation we her 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.010
 the ocean as far as possible to get away from 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.110
 these here 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.150
 April frosts to our kidney 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.220
 not damaged well and accordingly when 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.350
 May frosts have nothing on them 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.020
 you will not be saved 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:24.650
 but that's another story yet on 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.650
 today everything
