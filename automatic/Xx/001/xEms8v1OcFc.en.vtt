in<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:10.170> nick<00:00:10.440> training<00:00:10.860> video<00:00:11.070> we'll<00:00:11.520> take<00:00:11.760> a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
in this nick training video we'll take a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.250 
in this nick training video we'll take a
look<00:00:12.000> at<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.180> global<00:00:12.330> adjustments<00:00:13.080> and

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
look at the global adjustments and

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.680 
look at the global adjustments and
levels<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.100> curves<00:00:14.490> adjustments<00:00:15.210> within

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
levels and curves adjustments within

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.680 
levels and curves adjustments within
vevey<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.139> -<00:00:16.700> now<00:00:17.700> on<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> right<00:00:18.119> hand<00:00:18.150> side<00:00:18.540> of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
vevey so - now on the right hand side of

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.370 
vevey so - now on the right hand side of
the<00:00:18.779> interface

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
the interface

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.710 
the interface
you've<00:00:19.740> got<00:00:19.950> brightness<00:00:20.580> contrast<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
you've got brightness contrast and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.600 
you've got brightness contrast and
saturation<00:00:21.960> which<00:00:22.710> are<00:00:22.920> relatively

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
saturation which are relatively

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.429 
saturation which are relatively
self-explanatory<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.900> digital<00:00:25.230> workflow

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
self-explanatory in a digital workflow

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.589 
self-explanatory in a digital workflow
but<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.520> adjust<00:00:26.669> these<00:00:27.090> different

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
but as you adjust these different

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.540 
but as you adjust these different
sliders<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> upper<00:00:29.220> left<00:00:29.460> hand

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
sliders when in the upper left hand

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.749 
sliders when in the upper left hand
corner<00:00:29.759> this<00:00:30.360> says<00:00:30.960> global<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:32.340> sliders

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
corner this says global these sliders

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.850 
corner this says global these sliders
will<00:00:33.180> actually<00:00:33.510> adjust<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.960> entire<00:00:34.230> image

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
will actually adjust the entire image

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.800 
will actually adjust the entire image
so<00:00:35.130> basically<00:00:35.430> global<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.450> means<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:36.780> be

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
so basically global just means will be

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.020 
so basically global just means will be
adjusting<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> entire<00:00:37.620> photograph<00:00:38.190> compared

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
adjusting the entire photograph compared

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
adjusting the entire photograph compared
to<00:00:39.210> selective<00:00:39.960> adjustments<00:00:40.530> where<00:00:40.980> we're

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to selective adjustments where we're

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.099 
to selective adjustments where we're
controlling<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.789> certain<00:00:42.149> section<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
controlling a certain section of the

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.750 
controlling a certain section of the
image<00:00:43.230> or<00:00:43.559> maybe<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> particular<00:00:44.370> object

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
image or maybe a particular object

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
image or maybe a particular object
within<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> photo<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.500> again<00:00:46.680> brightness<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
within the photo so again brightness and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.240 
within the photo so again brightness and
contrast<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:48.149> well<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.420> saturation

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
contrast as well as saturation

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.770 
contrast as well as saturation
relatively<00:00:50.250> self-explanatory<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.539> digital

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
relatively self-explanatory in a digital

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.349 
relatively self-explanatory in a digital
workflow<00:00:52.579> structure<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> other<00:00:54.059> hand

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
workflow structure on the other hand

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.840 
workflow structure on the other hand
isn't<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.050> self-explanatory<00:00:55.850> structures

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
isn't so self-explanatory structures

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.509 
isn't so self-explanatory structures
basically<00:00:57.149> texture<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.620> slide<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.100> slider

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
basically texture if I slide this slider

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.340 
basically texture if I slide this slider
to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.089> we're<00:01:00.480> adding<00:01:01.019> in<00:01:01.140> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350

brought out with in all the details

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.940 
brought out with in all the details
within<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> image<00:01:06.870> if<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.680> bring<00:01:07.830> the

create more of a painterly like effect

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.730 
create more of a painterly like effect
and<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.670> removing<00:01:15.030> those<00:01:15.840> fine<00:01:16.470> details

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740

and we are removing those fine details
those<00:01:17.220> textures<00:01:17.850> were<00:01:18.060> sort<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.630> smoothing

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
those textures were sort of smoothing

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.740 
those textures were sort of smoothing
them<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.430> now<00:01:20.430> underneath<00:01:20.909> structure<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
them out now underneath structure you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
them out now underneath structure you
have<00:01:21.780> shadow<00:01:22.200> adjustments<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.790> slider

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
have shadow adjustments and this slider

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.420 
have shadow adjustments and this slider
if<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:25.140> bring<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.829> it's<00:01:26.369> going

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
if you bring it to the right it's going

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
if you bring it to the right it's going
to<00:01:26.549> take<00:01:26.759> anything<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> shadow<00:01:27.990> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to take anything that is a shadow that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.899 
to take anything that is a shadow that
is<00:01:28.470> anything<00:01:28.799> basically<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.399> left-hand

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
is anything basically on the left-hand

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.240 
is anything basically on the left-hand
side<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.899> histogram<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
side of your histogram and it's going to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
side of your histogram and it's going to
brighten<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.750> you'll<00:01:33.930> notice<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
brighten it up but what you'll notice is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.690 
brighten it up but what you'll notice is
that<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.530> doesn't<00:01:34.860> affect<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.430> brighter

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that it doesn't affect the brighter

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.289 
that it doesn't affect the brighter
tones<00:01:36.060> within<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> image<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> highlights

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
tones within the image so the highlights

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.399 
tones within the image so the highlights
even<00:01:39.299> though<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> brighter<00:01:39.899> mid-tones

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
even though the brighter mid-tones

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.859 
even though the brighter mid-tones
they're<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.009> really<00:01:41.310> being<00:01:41.640> adjusted<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
they're not really being adjusted the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.660 
they're not really being adjusted the
shadow<00:01:43.140> adjustments<00:01:43.710> only<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
shadow adjustments only going to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.920 
shadow adjustments only going to
brighten<00:01:44.939> up<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.390> bring<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.719> right

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
brighten up if you bring it to the right

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.080 
brighten up if you bring it to the right
the<00:01:46.320> shadow<00:01:46.590> tones<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.700> bring<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the shadow tones if you bring it to the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.240 
the shadow tones if you bring it to the
left<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> opposite<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.950> starts

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
left it's the opposite right it starts

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580 
left it's the opposite right it starts
to<00:01:50.399> darken<00:01:50.640> down<00:01:51.060> only<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.960> shadow<00:01:52.229> tones

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
to darken down only the shadow tones

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109 
to darken down only the shadow tones
which<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.979> nice<00:01:53.219> because<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.909> give<00:01:54.090> us

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
which is nice because it can give us

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.969 
which is nice because it can give us
this<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:55.170> wonderful<00:01:55.820> kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.979> darkened

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979

beneficial because if you have an image

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.170 
beneficial because if you have an image

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
that is high high contrast and maybe

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.609 
that is high high contrast and maybe

color<00:03:41.790> channels<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.360> can<00:03:42.480> adjust<00:03:42.600> with<00:03:43.410> a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
color channels that we can adjust with a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.199 
color channels that we can adjust with a
level<00:03:43.739> or<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.860> curve<00:03:44.040> adjustment<00:03:44.190> as<00:03:44.640> well<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.180> a

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209

red the green and the blue independent
color<00:03:47.700> channels<00:03:48.150> which<00:03:48.420> basically<00:03:49.290> allow<00:03:49.620> us

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
color channels which basically allow us

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.610 
color channels which basically allow us
to<00:03:50.040> create<00:03:50.400> maybe<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.760> skewed<00:03:51.299> color<00:03:51.600> or<00:03:51.900> clean

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
to create maybe a skewed color or clean

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.199 
to create maybe a skewed color or clean
up<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.829> color<00:03:53.040> cast<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.579> might<00:03:53.760> be<00:03:53.910> occurring

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
up a color cast that might be occurring

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.830 
up a color cast that might be occurring
if<00:03:54.480> we<00:03:54.570> wanted<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.900> do<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.290> within<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.840> level

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840

ahead<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:00.930> create<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> little<00:04:01.500> bit<00:04:01.680> more

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
ahead and just create a little bit more

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.500 
ahead and just create a little bit more

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
bit more contrast overall but these are

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.650
