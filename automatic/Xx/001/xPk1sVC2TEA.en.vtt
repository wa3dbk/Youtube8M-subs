to make an iron golem and a snowman in
Minecraft<00:00:20.539> and<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.840> see<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.020> got<00:00:22.230> my

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
Minecraft and as you can see I got my

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.429 
Minecraft and as you can see I got my
Doku<00:00:23.100> craft<00:00:23.400> texture<00:00:23.820> pack<00:00:24.000> thing<00:00:24.269> back<00:00:24.480> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
Doku craft texture pack thing back so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.089 
Doku craft texture pack thing back so
that<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.740> good

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
that was good

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.089 
that was good
anyways<00:00:27.349> we'll<00:00:28.349> start<00:00:28.560> off<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.710> an<00:00:28.890> iron

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
anyways we'll start off with an iron

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.200 
anyways we'll start off with an iron
golem<00:00:29.810> what<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.380> him<00:00:31.700> is<00:00:32.700> make<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
golem what you do for him is make a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.930 
golem what you do for him is make a
little<00:00:33.450> tea<00:00:36.440> just<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.129> use<00:00:38.670> blocks

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
little tea just like that and use blocks

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.229 
little tea just like that and use blocks
of<00:00:39.120> iron<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.250> takes<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.670> four<00:00:41.969> blocks

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
of iron so it's it takes a four blocks

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.150 
of iron so it's it takes a four blocks
of<00:00:42.390> iron<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> make<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> tea<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
of iron and you make a tea like that and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.090 
of iron and you make a tea like that and
you<00:00:44.219> take<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> pumpkin<00:00:44.940> or<00:00:45.090> jackal<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
you take a pumpkin or jackal in it and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.580 
you take a pumpkin or jackal in it and
pop<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.280> his<00:00:47.399> head<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.480> there's<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.469> hang

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
pop it on his head and there's your hang

00:00:49.590 --> 00:01:02.630

they're<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.580> good<00:01:05.790> guards<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
they're really good guards so if you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.410 
they're really good guards so if you
have<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> fenced-in<00:01:07.979> area<00:01:08.400> around<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:09.240> house

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
have a fenced-in area around your house

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.130 
have a fenced-in area around your house
they<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:10.670> walk<00:01:11.670> around<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.360> attack<00:01:12.930> any

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
they will walk around and attack any

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.660 
they will walk around and attack any
mobs<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.560> go<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.310> will<00:01:14.460> kill

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
mobs that go in there and they will kill

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.850 
mobs that go in there and they will kill
them<00:01:14.850> rather<00:01:15.150> quickly<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.080> they're<00:01:16.650> fun

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
them rather quickly so they're fun

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.280 
them rather quickly so they're fun
although<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> costs<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> pheromone

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
although you know that costs a pheromone

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.440 
although you know that costs a pheromone
iron<00:01:19.530> which<00:01:19.920> isn't<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.280> hard<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
iron which isn't that hard to get and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.929 
iron which isn't that hard to get and
then<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.470> way<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.619> make<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> snowman<00:01:23.189> but

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
then the way to make a snowman but

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.440 
then the way to make a snowman but
you're<00:01:24.119> also<00:01:24.240> pretty<00:01:24.509> fun<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.240> take

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you're also pretty fun is you take

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289 
you're also pretty fun is you take
blocks<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.990> snow<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.579> blocks

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
blocks of snow and you just get blocks

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
blocks of snow and you just get blocks
of<00:01:30.450> snow<00:01:30.630> by<00:01:30.840> taking<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> shovel<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.280> going

if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.780> put<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.990> jacqueline<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.860> will<00:01:47.130> not

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
if you put a jacqueline on it will not

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.679 
if you put a jacqueline on it will not
show<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.700> with<00:01:48.119> eyes

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.190 
show up with eyes
it<00:01:48.899> never<00:01:49.140> does<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.560> tried<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.450> but<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.079> know

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it never does I tried that but you know

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600 
it never does I tried that but you know
they<00:01:52.320> walk<00:01:52.530> around<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:52.979> make<00:01:53.250> snow

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
they walk around and they make snow

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.730 
they walk around and they make snow
wherever<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.689> after<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> while<00:01:55.470> they

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
wherever they go and after a while they

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.749 
wherever they go and after a while they
melt<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.950> how<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.219> make<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> snowman

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
melt so that's how you make a snowman

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.640 
melt so that's how you make a snowman
