00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 what's happening alive today we're on the day 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.180
 52 that day in order at home I was 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.680
 motivated but had many pains for 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.630
 the whole body for lack of physical form 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.430
 so my goal was to upload the form 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.330
 physical and continue with yesterday's sets like that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.289
 that I started to warm up 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.520
 I did the strength exercises then I 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.630
 everything hurt and I did not have the strength to 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.890
 dance but also to follow 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:46.679
 doing it I started with the set of the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:48.059
 tangle of the flow rock and then I remembered a 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:56.459
 little the butterfly set is the east 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:59.839
 shoulder then I started playing around a bit with 

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:59.839
 the two to see what I could get out of there 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650
 good 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.760
 interesting the tan fu pink that this 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.509
 but because I wanted to complicate life more 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.710
 already with the comeback it was very easy 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.710
 I started playing more with that set 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.570
 after many ideas it was already coming out 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.799
 what I wanted so I got to 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.799
 practice the whole whole set 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:31.660
 with the life of those who are partners that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:42.730
 emits and then the butterfly set in 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:44.410
 shoulder light but it got me better 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.060
 the pisa dolls that was the freezer 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.140
 I know he was walking on my hand but as I have 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.250
 Done enough wounds on the wrist 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.250
 so he steps on dolls 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.159
 and then he put me to put it with music 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.159
 doing freestyle 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.480
 and to finish measures 236 today 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.480
 doing freestyle with music 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.420
 i 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.080
 all right 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:13.599
 and then I remembered a football that I 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:14.799
 leave half and review it a bit but 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.269
 I did not want that involving work of 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.919
 cervical so stop and I got to 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.720
 stretch this training had been brutal 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.310
 my knees were healing 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.930
 sad I was going pain 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.150
 cervical pain also the abductor 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.229
 I barely noticed he is super motivated and 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.610
 have done a preparatory work 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.590
 physical also made me feel 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.990
 better and I think that nothing more here 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.310
 I train day 52 so see you 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.310
 tomorrow to take care of my voice
