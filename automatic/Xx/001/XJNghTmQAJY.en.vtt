root ball can come out and that's what I

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.639 
root ball can come out and that's what I
find<00:01:44.590> easiest<00:01:45.159> but<00:01:45.939> there's<00:01:46.840> no<00:01:46.990> reason<00:01:47.380> why

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
find easiest but there's no reason why

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.499 
find easiest but there's no reason why
you<00:01:48.369> shouldn't<00:01:48.640> be<00:01:48.729> able<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:49.000> just<00:01:49.240> use

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.949 
the pot a tap and water it as easy as
that<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.380> all<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.040> do<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:25.510> stand<00:02:25.780> that

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
that and all you do is you stand that

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.199 
that and all you do is you stand that
either<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.799> heated<00:02:27.130> propagator<00:02:27.640> or<00:02:27.940> on<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
either in a heated propagator or on the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.770 
either in a heated propagator or on the
wind<00:02:28.390> still<00:02:28.599> weather<00:02:28.810> some<00:02:29.079> warm<00:02:29.670> until<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
wind still weather some warm until the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.680 
wind still weather some warm until the
seeds<00:02:32.079> just<00:02:32.799> start<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.370> germinate<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.540> can

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
seeds just start to germinate so you can

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.000 
seeds just start to germinate so you can
just<00:02:34.840> start<00:02:35.109> to<00:02:35.230> see<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.470> green<00:02:35.709> shoots

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
just start to see the green shoots

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.390 
just start to see the green shoots
showing<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.109> point<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:39.010> take<00:02:39.190> them

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
showing it's at that point you take them

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.580 
showing it's at that point you take them
out<00:02:39.549> of<00:02:39.760> heat<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.389> stand<00:02:41.139> them<00:02:41.290> somewhere

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
out of heat and stand them somewhere

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.770 
out of heat and stand them somewhere
cool<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:43.030> lots<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.450> lights<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.220> easy

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.850 

as<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.840> said<00:02:49.230> water<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.220> seeds<00:02:50.600> once<00:02:51.860> don't

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
as I said water the seeds once don't

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.400 
as I said water the seeds once don't
keep<00:02:53.100> water<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.580> seeds<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.780> they'll<00:02:55.170> soon

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
keep water in the seeds but they'll soon

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.470 
keep water in the seeds but they'll soon
germinate<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.430> what<00:02:56.730> you'll<00:02:56.850> get<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.270> you'll

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
germinate and what you'll get is you'll

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.950 
germinate and what you'll get is you'll
get<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.870> pot<00:02:58.680> full<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.340> roots<00:02:59.550> like<00:02:59.940> like<00:03:00.630> this

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960
