00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it was last season and then of course

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
it was last season and then of course
there's<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.540> Whiteside<00:01:22.049> which<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.979> guy

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
Miami while I understand the offense was

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.070 
Miami while I understand the offense was
not<00:02:15.100> completely<00:02:15.490> catered<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.060> him<00:02:16.210> he<00:02:16.840> didn't

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
in his time in Miami but we assume that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.250 
in his time in Miami but we assume that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
very good mid-range shooter for what

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.970

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
interesting with the Miami Heat there

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.700 
interesting with the Miami Heat there
there's<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.600> lot<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.870> questions<00:02:59.410> with<00:02:59.560> this

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
there's a lot of questions with this

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.620 
there's a lot of questions with this
team<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.190> think<00:03:00.670> they<00:03:00.790> could<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> two<00:03:01.300> seed

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
team I think they could be a two seed

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.120 
team I think they could be a two seed
they<00:03:01.870> could<00:03:02.080> be<00:03:02.200> as<00:03:02.320> low<00:03:02.470> as<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.680> seven<00:03:02.980> see

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
they could be as low as a seven see

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.610 
they could be as low as a seven see
there's<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.430> lot<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.670> ifs<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.510> if<00:03:05.050> every<00:03:05.320> single

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
there's a lot of ifs and if every single

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.250 
there's a lot of ifs and if every single
one<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.800> them<00:03:06.040> comes<00:03:06.670> out<00:03:06.820> as<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:06.970> check<00:03:07.330> they

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
one of them comes out as a check they

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.050 
one of them comes out as a check they
could<00:03:08.440> be<00:03:08.560> very<00:03:08.890> good<00:03:09.190> next<00:03:09.520> season<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.030> I

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
could be very good next season so I

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.110 
could be very good next season so I
guess<00:03:10.830> leave<00:03:11.830> me<00:03:11.980> your<00:03:12.010> opinion<00:03:12.489> on<00:03:12.670> how<00:03:13.060> you

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
guess leave me your opinion on how you

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the middle can you not figure them out

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.270 
the middle can you not figure them out
because<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.080> genuinely<00:03:20.320> can't<00:03:20.890> figure<00:03:21.100> them

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
because I genuinely can't figure them

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.790

and that's it like I said this was a bit

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.530 
and that's it like I said this was a bit
rushed<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:25.160> have<00:03:25.520> to<00:03:25.700> go<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.900> class<00:03:27.680> now<00:03:28.540> shout
