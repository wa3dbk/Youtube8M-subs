00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
after a while and it doesn't react very

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.830 
after a while and it doesn't react very
well<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.760> works<00:03:02.090> really<00:03:02.180> good<00:03:02.480> for<00:03:02.750> those

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840

well but it works really good for those
every<00:03:03.200> once<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.560> while<00:03:03.680> like<00:03:03.920> really<00:03:04.400> really

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
every once in a while like really really

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.759
