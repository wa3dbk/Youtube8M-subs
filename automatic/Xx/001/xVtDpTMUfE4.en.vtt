of damage that I wrote him I thought I

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.120 
of damage that I wrote him I thought I
was<00:02:11.480> gonna<00:02:11.630> kill<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:12.049> cuz<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.620> see<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.980> hell

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
was gonna kill it cuz I see the hell

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.250 
was gonna kill it cuz I see the hell
part<00:02:13.370> was<00:02:13.519> going<00:02:13.790> down<00:02:13.970> down<00:02:14.180> down<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.900> do

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
part was going down down down but I do

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.020 
part was going down down down but I do
not<00:02:15.440> take<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.799> out<00:02:15.890> which<00:02:16.070> is<00:02:16.100> not<00:02:16.549> good<00:02:16.580> for<00:02:16.940> me

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
not take it out which is not good for me

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.810 
not take it out which is not good for me
but<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.540> whatever<00:02:18.440> sorry<00:02:19.130> brain<00:02:19.280> allowed<00:02:19.579> us

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
but and whatever sorry brain allowed us

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.420 
but and whatever sorry brain allowed us
and<00:02:20.120> he<00:02:20.720> switches<00:02:20.989> he<00:02:21.260> goes<00:02:21.410> into<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:21.860> bronze

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and he switches he goes into this bronze

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.310 
and he switches he goes into this bronze
on<00:02:22.670> um<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.840> don't<00:02:24.530> care<00:02:25.269> about<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.840> bronze<00:02:27.110> on

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
on um I don't care about this bronze on

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.110 
on um I don't care about this bronze on
because<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.739> do<00:02:27.799> have<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.250> hidden<00:02:28.400> power<00:02:28.700> fire

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
because I do have the hidden power fire

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.500 
because I do have the hidden power fire
and<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:30.830> do<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:31.489> quite<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.819> good<00:02:32.150> amount<00:02:32.360> of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
and I do like quite a good amount of

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.330 
and I do like quite a good amount of
damage<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.959> this<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.140> bronze<00:02:33.560> on<00:02:33.770> so

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
damage to this a bronze on so

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.790 
damage to this a bronze on so
he<00:02:35.180> sets<00:02:35.420> up<00:02:35.480> rocks<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.319> predict<00:02:36.709> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
he sets up rocks and I predict the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.460 
he sets up rocks and I predict the
explosion<00:02:37.370> here<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.150> go<00:02:38.300> into<00:02:38.450> my<00:02:38.780> own<00:02:38.989> Rotom

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
explosion here so I go into my own Rotom

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.770 
explosion here so I go into my own Rotom
and<00:02:40.280> he<00:02:40.430> does<00:02:40.640> go<00:02:40.819> for<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.060> explosion<00:02:41.599> which

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
and he does go for the explosion which

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.490 
and he does go for the explosion which
is<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> very<00:02:42.349> good<00:02:42.530> prediction<00:02:43.069> on<00:02:43.129> my<00:02:43.280> part<00:02:43.550> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
is a very good prediction on my part and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.490 
is a very good prediction on my part and
Down<00:02:45.500> Goes<00:02:45.530> brown<00:02:45.739> song<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.550> yeah<00:02:46.819> uh<00:02:47.440> now<00:02:48.440> he

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
Down Goes brown song so yeah uh now he

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.119 
Down Goes brown song so yeah uh now he
goes<00:02:48.800> into<00:02:48.860> his<00:02:49.220> on<00:02:49.670> his<00:02:50.660> own<00:02:50.870> Rotom<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.500> guess

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
goes into his on his own Rotom I guess

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.100 
goes into his on his own Rotom I guess
it<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.430> dead<00:02:52.580> father<00:02:52.849> just<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.239> see<00:02:53.510> if<00:02:53.870> I'm

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
i'm thinking i can take the extreme

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.150 
i'm thinking i can take the extreme
speed<00:03:10.010> from<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:10.459> thing<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.030> yeah<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.620> stayed

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
speed from this thing so yeah I stayed

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.460 
speed from this thing so yeah I stayed

into his own latias which is not good
for<00:03:18.410> me<00:03:18.560> because<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:20.060> latias<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.810> max<00:03:21.140> speed

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
for me because this latias is max speed

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
dies so yeah um sub call mining a lot es

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.850 
dies so yeah um sub call mining a lot es
is<00:06:08.860> very<00:06:09.220> good<00:06:09.520> but<00:06:09.849> uh<00:06:10.289> that<00:06:11.289> only<00:06:11.470> gives<00:06:11.680> you

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
is very good but uh that only gives you

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.270 
is very good but uh that only gives you
like<00:06:12.070> only<00:06:12.460> one<00:06:12.699> attacking<00:06:13.180> move<00:06:13.570> so<00:06:14.099> this<00:06:15.099> is

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
like only one attacking move so this is

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.279 
like only one attacking move so this is
why<00:06:15.430> most<00:06:15.729> people<00:06:16.090> don't<00:06:16.300> run<00:06:16.479> some<00:06:16.900> combining

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
why most people don't run some combining

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.649 
why most people don't run some combining
