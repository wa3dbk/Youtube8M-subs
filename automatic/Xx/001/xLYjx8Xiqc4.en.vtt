00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
in games you know where there's a futile

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.510 
in games you know where there's a futile
exiting<00:01:27.500> after<00:01:27.829> that<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.130> last<00:01:28.250> couple<00:01:28.429> of

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
exiting after that the last couple of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.219

these positive three games Jordan or

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.809 
these positive three games Jordan or
equal<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.250> now<00:01:31.310> we<00:01:31.369> probably<00:01:31.579> got<00:01:31.759> our

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
equal and now we probably got our

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.580 
equal and now we probably got our
journey<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.270> usually<00:01:33.020> when<00:01:33.079> a<00:01:33.140> team<00:01:33.289> doesn't

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
journey and usually when a team doesn't

the<00:01:35.179> referee<00:01:35.569> but<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:35.810> think<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.439> referee<00:01:36.740> came

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
the referee but I think the referee came

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.350 
the referee but I think the referee came
in<00:01:37.069> from<00:01:37.250> viola<00:01:37.460> criticism<00:01:37.819> what<00:01:38.240> do<00:01:38.299> you

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
I think the first half second wasn't

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.559 
I think the first half second wasn't
born<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.369> know<00:01:43.459> I<00:01:43.490> gotta<00:01:43.789> blame<00:01:43.939> referees<00:01:44.330> and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.050 
points ago at home obviously that wasn't
the<00:03:44.360> case<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:46.040> know<00:03:46.160> Kevin<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.820> wasn't

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
the case but you know Kevin that wasn't

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.970 
the case but you know Kevin that wasn't
worth<00:03:47.150> risking<00:03:47.360> cabin<00:03:47.870> for<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.470> game<00:03:48.740> when<00:03:48.950> I

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
worth risking cabin for a game when I

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.590

this Football Club and you know he's not

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.230 
this Football Club and you know he's not
even<00:04:24.860> when<00:04:25.040> they're<00:04:25.190> much<00:04:25.370> stretch<00:04:25.580> yet<00:04:25.730> so

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
even when they're much stretch yet so

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.910 
even when they're much stretch yet so
when<00:04:26.390> we<00:04:26.480> get<00:04:26.630> them<00:04:26.720> up<00:04:26.840> much<00:04:26.990> better<00:04:27.200> with<00:04:27.740> him

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
when we get them up much better with him

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.320 
when we get them up much better with him
and<00:04:28.070> one<00:04:28.160> wing<00:04:28.340> in<00:04:28.460> Cana<00:04:28.700> in<00:04:28.880> their<00:04:29.030> living<00:04:29.210> I

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
and one wing in Cana in their living I

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.790 
and one wing in Cana in their living I
think<00:04:29.540> we'd<00:04:29.630> be<00:04:29.780> very<00:04:30.020> very<00:04:30.140> exciting<00:04:30.680> to

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
think we'd be very very exciting to

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.670 
think we'd be very very exciting to
watch<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.610> know<00:04:31.730> what<00:04:32.080> we<00:04:33.080> couldn't<00:04:33.530> all<00:04:33.620> be

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
watch you know what we couldn't all be

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.190 
watch you know what we couldn't all be
negative<00:04:34.340> we<00:04:34.490> can<00:04:34.610> go<00:04:34.730> on<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:34.940> be<00:04:35.060> be<00:04:35.870> more<00:04:36.050> now

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
negative we can go on and be be more now

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.130 
negative we can go on and be be more now
look<00:04:36.380> but<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.490> reality<00:04:37.970> is<00:04:38.000> we<00:04:38.420> fought<00:04:38.930> back

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
look but the reality is we fought back

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.320 
look but the reality is we fought back
from<00:04:39.170> behind<00:04:39.590> again<00:04:40.070> we've<00:04:40.640> came<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.090> point

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
from behind again we've came the point

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.030 
from behind again we've came the point
and<00:04:41.810> i<00:04:41.960> would<00:04:42.140> venture<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.530> say<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.770> maybe

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
and i would venture to say that maybe

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.860 
and i would venture to say that maybe
this<00:04:43.130> time<00:04:43.310> last<00:04:43.550> year<00:04:43.700> movie<00:04:44.360> Bohemians<00:04:44.780> what

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
this time last year movie Bohemians what

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.390 
this time last year movie Bohemians what
they<00:04:44.960> got<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.140> point<00:04:45.320> out<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.590> this<00:04:45.650> game<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.280> we

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
they got a point out of this game so we

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.710 
they got a point out of this game so we
certainly<00:04:46.760> added<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.090> better<00:04:47.270> state<00:04:47.510> of<00:04:47.540> the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
certainly added a better state of the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.810 
certainly added a better state of the
wii<00:04:47.840> but<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.110> got<00:04:48.290> what<00:04:48.890> we<00:04:49.010> now<00:04:49.190> have<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.430> do<00:04:49.670> is

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
wii but it got what we now have to do is

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.180 
wii but it got what we now have to do is
this<00:04:50.210> start<00:04:50.570> games<00:04:50.840> better<00:04:51.050> yeah<00:04:51.740> there<00:04:52.040> is<00:04:52.160> a

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
this start games better yeah there is a

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.340 
this start games better yeah there is a
massive<00:04:52.460> game<00:04:52.820> but<00:04:53.030> i<00:04:53.630> think<00:04:54.020> it's<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.200> case

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
massive game but i think it's a case

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.300 
massive game but i think it's a case
where<00:04:54.530> we<00:04:54.590> have<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.740> go<00:04:54.860> up<00:04:54.980> there<00:04:55.130> make<00:04:55.280> sure

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
where we have to go up there make sure

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.310 
where we have to go up there make sure
we<00:04:55.520> don't<00:04:55.550> get<00:04:55.820> beat<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.570> probably<00:04:56.960> was

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
we don't get beat and probably was

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.110 
we don't get beat and probably was
tonight's<00:04:57.650> result<00:04:57.980> in<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.550> movie<00:04:58.760> need<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.000> look

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
tonight's result in a movie need to look

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:09.770 
tonight's result in a movie need to look
to<00:04:59.150> see<00:04:59.240> if<00:04:59.360> we<00:04:59.450> can<00:04:59.570> get<00:04:59.630> three<00:04:59.840> points

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780
