looking<00:00:26.430> from<00:00:26.640> near<00:00:26.849> all<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.090> time<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.840> what

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
looking from near all the time and what

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.200 
looking from near all the time and what
that's<00:00:28.260> doing<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.039> forcing<00:00:29.730> other<00:00:30.029> than

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
that's doing is it's forcing other than

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.340 
that's doing is it's forcing other than
number<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:32.450> British<00:00:33.450> Bulldog<00:00:33.870> always<00:00:34.170> good

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
number one British Bulldog always good

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.470 
number one British Bulldog always good
to<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:35.190> means<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.670> he's<00:00:35.790> always<00:00:36.059> from

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
to see it means that he's always from

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.119 
to see it means that he's always from
near<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.840> he's<00:00:36.930> forcing<00:00:37.260> his<00:00:37.469> muscles<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
near and he's forcing his muscles to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.670 
near and he's forcing his muscles to
work<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.579> his<00:00:38.700> lens<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.600> thicken<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.440> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
work and his lens to thicken so what we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.369 
work and his lens to thicken so what we
want<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.399> elongate<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.480> lens<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.140> do

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
want to do is elongate the lens so we do

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.619 
want to do is elongate the lens so we do
that<00:00:43.620> by<00:00:44.100> doing<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.520> opposite<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.450> we're

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that by doing the opposite of what we're

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
that by doing the opposite of what we're
doing<00:00:45.750> which<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.590> look<00:00:46.770> into<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.520> distance

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
doing which is to look into the distance

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.650 
doing which is to look into the distance
now<00:00:48.440> people<00:00:49.440> sometimes<00:00:49.950> ask<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.730> how<00:00:51.059> far<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
now people sometimes ask on how far the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.319 
now people sometimes ask on how far the
distance<00:00:51.809> should<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.370> theory<00:00:53.910> something

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
distance should be in theory something

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.020 
distance should be in theory something
over<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.500> about<00:00:55.800> fifty<00:00:56.460> feet<00:00:56.699> because

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
over you know about fifty feet because

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.779 
over you know about fifty feet because
accommodation<00:00:57.690> resumed<00:00:58.020> within<00:00:58.530> 20<00:00:58.920> feet<00:00:58.949> but

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
accommodation resumed within 20 feet but

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.160 
accommodation resumed within 20 feet but
over<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.660> we've<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> nice

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
over here you can see we've got a nice

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.130 
over here you can see we've got a nice
far<00:01:01.500> distance<00:01:01.980> some<00:01:02.160> trees<00:01:02.550> nice<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.780> here

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
far distance some trees nice out here

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.100 
far distance some trees nice out here
into<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.460> distance<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
into the distance now what I'm going to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.710 
into the distance now what I'm going to
ask<00:01:07.290> Richard<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.090> look<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.570> into

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
ask Richard to do is to look out into

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.830 
ask Richard to do is to look out into
the<00:01:09.900> distance<00:01:09.950> my<00:01:10.950> iPhone<00:01:11.790> away<00:01:12.060> put<00:01:12.720> his

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the distance my iPhone away put his

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.300 
the distance my iPhone away put his
iPhone<00:01:13.290> away<00:01:13.530> put<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.010> away

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
iPhone away put that thing away

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.179 
iPhone away put that thing away
and<00:01:14.939> he's<00:01:15.240> looking<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:16.080> far<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.799> he<00:01:16.920> can

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and he's looking out as far as he can

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.690 
and he's looking out as far as he can
now<00:01:17.549> you've<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:19.220> horizon<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.430> there

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
now you've got a horizon down there

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
now you've got a horizon down there
above<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> trees<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.990> what<00:01:22.170> we're<00:01:22.380> going

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
above the trees but for what we're going

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.969 
above the trees but for what we're going
to<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.909> look<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.930> leaf<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.619> some

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
to do is actually look at a leaf or some

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.710 
to do is actually look at a leaf or some
leaves<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.640> top<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> trees<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.570> I'm

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
leaves on top of the trees which I'm

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.039 
leaves on top of the trees which I'm
sure<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> idea<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
sure you can see but the idea is to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.219 
sure you can see but the idea is to
shift<00:01:31.320> from<00:01:31.829> leaf<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.460> leaf<00:01:32.509> or<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.930> any

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
shift from leaf to leaf or in any

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.010 
shift from leaf to leaf or in any
distance<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.450> whatever<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.810> actually

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
distance or whatever you can actually

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.649 
distance or whatever you can actually
see<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.799> can't<00:01:38.400> actually<00:01:38.610> believe<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.479> going

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
see I can't actually believe I'm going

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
see I can't actually believe I'm going
to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.840> from<00:01:40.020> branch<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.439> branch<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.700> rich<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
to go from branch to branch so rich is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.639 
to go from branch to branch so rich is
going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.360> from<00:01:42.600> branch<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> branch<00:01:43.140> or

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
going to go from branch to branch or

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.649 
going to go from branch to branch or
maybe<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.340> might<00:01:44.520> even<00:01:44.670> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.210> from

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
maybe you might even want to go from

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.990 
maybe you might even want to go from
tree<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> tree<00:01:46.350> whatever<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.820> can

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
tree to tree whatever it is that you can

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.899 
tree to tree whatever it is that you can
see<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.530> idea<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.340> maximum

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
see and the idea is to have maximum

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
see and the idea is to have maximum
relaxation<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> eyes<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.920> look<00:01:53.100> out

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
relaxation in the eyes as you look out

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.359 
relaxation in the eyes as you look out
forward<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> distance<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> that's<00:01:55.950> one

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
forward to the distance so that's one

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.270 
forward to the distance so that's one
way<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.610> doing<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.060> another<00:01:57.390> thing<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.280> scan

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
way of doing it another thing is to scan

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.660 
way of doing it another thing is to scan
and<00:01:59.790> maybe<00:02:00.630> even<00:02:01.020> draw<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> picture<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and maybe even draw a picture with the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.060 
and maybe even draw a picture with the
top<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.149> those<00:02:03.659> tree<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.799> all<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
top of those tree so you can see all the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.850 
top of those tree so you can see all the
way<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.430> around<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.960> sort<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.649> draw

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
way up around here you can sort of draw

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.580 
way up around here you can sort of draw
an<00:02:08.160> outline<00:02:08.750> coming<00:02:09.750> around<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.110> top<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
an outline coming around the top of the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.730 
an outline coming around the top of the
trees

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
trees

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.100 
trees
you<00:02:12.190> can<00:02:12.460> use<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:12.880> nose<00:02:13.240> as<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> sort<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.020> a

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
you can use your nose as a sort of a

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.570 
you can use your nose as a sort of a
pencil<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.920> draw<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.250> outline<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:18.010> what

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
pencil to draw the outline so what

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.370 
pencil to draw the outline so what
that's<00:02:18.730> doing<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.330> its<00:02:19.570> allowing<00:02:19.750> your<00:02:20.350> eyes

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
that's doing is its allowing your eyes

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.030 
that's doing is its allowing your eyes
to<00:02:20.590> relax<00:02:21.520> into<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> horizon<00:02:22.810> into<00:02:23.560> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
to relax into the horizon into the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.820 
to relax into the horizon into the
distance<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:25.420> also<00:02:25.750> engaging<00:02:26.200> your

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
distance and it's also engaging your

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.890 
distance and it's also engaging your
macula<00:02:27.340> you're<00:02:27.550> getting<00:02:27.850> more<00:02:28.150> detail<00:02:28.660> on

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
macula you're getting more detail on

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.500 
macula you're getting more detail on
those<00:02:29.080> pictures<00:02:29.580> waking<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.670> macula<00:02:31.090> up<00:02:31.300> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
those pictures waking the macula up and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.590 
those pictures waking the macula up and
relaxing<00:02:32.470> their<00:02:32.620> eye<00:02:32.830> muscles<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.670> also<00:02:34.390> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
relaxing their eye muscles and also the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.310 
relaxing their eye muscles and also the
lens<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.500> very<00:02:36.190> important<00:02:36.730> exercise<00:02:37.320> six
