this<00:01:09.759> aspect<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.450> unique<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:11.050> version<00:01:11.470> so

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
this aspect is unique to this version so

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.889 
this aspect is unique to this version so
I'm<00:01:12.280> thinking<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.759> ways<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:12.970> use<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.780> the

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
I'm thinking of ways to use that to the

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.160 
I'm thinking of ways to use that to the
game's<00:01:14.080> advantage<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.570> total<00:01:16.930> number<00:01:17.140> of

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
game's advantage the total number of

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.020 
game's advantage the total number of
characters<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.100> same<00:01:18.369> as<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.640> wii<00:01:18.849> u
