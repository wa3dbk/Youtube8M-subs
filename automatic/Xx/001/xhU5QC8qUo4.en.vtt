00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.150
 to do 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.610
 he stands there as brand new 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.040
 space wonder in the c segment 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.780
 it's one of the most important if not 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.680
 skoda's main car from this 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.090
 moment 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.070
 doc language via has always been more spacious and 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.690
 cheaper than its opponents 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.050
 and in that, in the third generation non 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.050
 different 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.480
 the octavia once again has the appearance 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.520
 from the sedan and it looks very chic 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.930
 from this but if you look closely you see 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.610
 actually a modern interpretation of 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.239
 the audi a4 from generations ago 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.550
 but also elements of bmw 3 series he 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.810
 Also they want but then again is 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.890
 it's actually a hatchback 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.220
 because has the practical big 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.380
 tailgate to the game and below that 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.440
 flap goes for a garage spaces applies 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.420
 590 liters and that is 30 liters more than the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.490
 previous octavia 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.470
 and with that this octavia is touching 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.880
 luggage compartment again the most spacious 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.110
 class 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.700
 the skoda has not only grown in the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.830
 trunk but actually to all 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.840
 and the wheelbase is also larger 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.850
 and that means more 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.680
 space in the back seat 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.890
 and in the back and octavia it wasn't 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.890
 assist with 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.009
 but of course not only for one 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.270
 space in octavia is also from all sides 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.850
 become more beautiful 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.229
 it also applies to the interior 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 used materials of this is ie 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.969
 not only more beautiful, you also have to 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.770
 softer and moreover delivers 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.630
 skoda now you for t my system with 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.250
 a touchscreen 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.869
 only thing that looks less beautiful is 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.069
 this start / stop button that is in place 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.319
 where the ignition key actually belongs 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.319
 That is also a bit cheap 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.049
 if you want you can this one octavia 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.459
 very richly equipped car you can 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.769
 namely provided with a lane assist 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.480
 and the system that the emergency brake intervention 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.459
 lives like an accident range 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.200
 one that detects if you 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.970
 exhausted there by the has one 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.379
 extensive engine package available for 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.870
 this car that exists in at least 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.329
 eight engines or all 8 and the Netherlands 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.010
 we don't know yet 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.299
 there will be three versions of the acer 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.370
 cities the largest variant with 110 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.660
 pk emits just too much co2 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.549
 to be eligible for 14 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.850
 percent addition now about twenty 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.500
 percent but pon is said to be heart 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.940
 in negotiation with the factory to 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.220
 see if it is the last gram 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.480
 one gram that last gram still the van 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.389
 can be abolished 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.250
 and then we have a 14% octavia we 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.450
 namely lead you a ram below with 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.880
 one there two cities 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.720
 105hp remains the same anyway 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.720
 to be in the farmer 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.330
 105 hp variant is actually enough 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.620
 in this car 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.780
 you have enough pulling power in every 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.520
 acceleration the only thing is that he what 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.980
 especially if you hear low humming 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.680
 is going to drive 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.300
 so 110 hp that of course will be 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.140
 car it certainly if at 14% 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.360
 driven aggregation 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.630
 is that you have your octavia for business 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.630
 driver 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.940
 for the leftovers also this third generation 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.250
 known from octavia 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.020
 the steering is direct enough but would 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.060
 may inform more about what below 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.580
 the front wheels happen 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.950
 bake turns nice and smooth but not the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.209
 not the week 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.159
 and that money about the suspension is also that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.260
 not the week at all 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.239
 stronger even on short bumps 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.250
 even dribbling the car a little 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.989
 the chassis would be a little more finesse 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.709
 may tell then you have a normal 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.709
 comfortable car 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.759
 skoda has this third generation of 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.190
 the octavia the strengths 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.600
 pretty tightened this is the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.880
 largest car based on 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.789
 volkswagen mqb platform 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.199
 then the wave are the Leon and a3 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.789
 this octavia combines the unusual 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.930
 handling of his even their and 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.669
 headroom and legroom in the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.690
 trunk that is not yet matched 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.150
 in this class 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.530
 it stays that way and then go to the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.599
 starting price is expected to be 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.580
 between 20 and 21 new and then you ask 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.820
 you wonder why you should look for one 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.820
 golf 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.819
 not
