00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
isolation and my hoop is rotating

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.990 
isolation and my hoop is rotating
counterclockwise<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> start<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.760> cat<00:00:29.970> eye

illusion is that the hoop is dropping
down<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.329> coming<00:00:42.750> straight<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.410> without

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
down and then coming straight up without

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.319 
down and then coming straight up without
moving<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.170> plane<00:00:46.620> our<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:48.059> side

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
moving out of this plane our going side

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.299 
moving out of this plane our going side
to<00:00:48.360> side<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.989> want<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.950> hoop<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
make a vertical column so to speak so we

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.270 
make a vertical column so to speak so we
start<00:00:54.629> serving<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.410> position<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.129> the

part from this position my hand is going
to<00:01:30.180> go<00:01:30.420> straight<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> start<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.780> move

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to go straight up so I start here I move

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.550 
to go straight up so I start here I move
to<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.560> right<00:01:34.590> allow<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.340> hoop<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> drop<00:01:36.560> grab

to my right allow the hoop to drop grab
bring<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.040> straight<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.659> visit<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.590> path

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
bring it straight up so visit the path

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
bring it straight up so visit the path
of<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.850> hand<00:01:42.150> goes<00:01:42.619> left<00:01:44.000> down<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.390> straight

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
of my hand goes left down up straight

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.179 
of my hand goes left down up straight
over<00:01:46.500> my<00:01:46.619> head<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:46.860> I'm<00:01:47.159> basically<00:01:47.369> making<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
over my head so I'm basically making a

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.899 
over my head so I'm basically making a
big<00:01:50.189> arc<00:01:50.520> there

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
big arc there

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.370 
big arc there
I'm<00:01:52.540> going<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.869> make<00:01:53.020> oh<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:54.130> entire<00:01:54.520> step

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
I'm going to make oh the entire step

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.749 
I'm going to make oh the entire step
involves<00:01:56.380> making<00:01:56.649> a<00:01:56.890> box<00:01:57.130> with<00:01:57.520> your<00:01:57.700> hand

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
involves making a box with your hand

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.940 
involves making a box with your hand
okay<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.119> from<00:02:01.659> here<00:02:01.990> move<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.799> right

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
okay so from here move to the right

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.830 
okay so from here move to the right
allow<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.369> hoop<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.759> drop<00:02:03.970> grab<00:02:04.299> bring<00:02:04.720> it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
allow the hoop to drop grab bring it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.440 
allow the hoop to drop grab bring it
straight<00:02:05.110> up<00:02:05.619> overhead<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.399> then<00:02:07.119> I've<00:02:07.270> got

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
straight up overhead and then I've got

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.719 
straight up overhead and then I've got
the<00:02:07.570> hoop<00:02:07.750> straight<00:02:08.259> above<00:02:08.560> me<00:02:08.830> my<00:02:09.069> hand<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.519> at

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
the hoop straight above me my hand is at

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.589 
the hoop straight above me my hand is at
12<00:02:10.179> o'clock<00:02:10.599> as<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:12.310> continue<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.420> hoop

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
12 o'clock as I continue the hoop

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.710 
12 o'clock as I continue the hoop
rotation<00:02:14.260> over<00:02:14.560> I'm<00:02:15.519> going<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.910> move<00:02:16.120> back<00:02:16.390> out

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
rotation over I'm going to move back out

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.979 
rotation over I'm going to move back out
to<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> left<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:18.010> allow<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.519> hoop<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.450> come

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
to the left to allow the hoop to come

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.350 
to the left to allow the hoop to come
back<00:02:20.260> into<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.590> center<00:02:21.040> position<00:02:21.360> now

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
back into that center position now

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.690 
back into that center position now
ideally<00:02:22.810> my<00:02:23.140> hand<00:02:23.380> would<00:02:23.590> end<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:24.519> that<00:02:24.670> I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
ideally my hand would end here so that I

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.580 
ideally my hand would end here so that I
could<00:02:24.940> just<00:02:25.090> continue<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.630> do<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.019> again<00:02:26.260> over

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
could just continue to do it again over

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.180 
could just continue to do it again over
and<00:02:26.709> over<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:28.840> practice<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.590> will<00:02:29.769> happen

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
and over with practice that will happen

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.330 
and over with practice that will happen
