use<00:01:15.400> this<00:01:15.580> one<00:01:15.790> which<00:01:16.119> will<00:01:16.299> go<00:01:16.479> into<00:01:16.630> USB<00:01:17.020> so

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
use this one which will go into USB so

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.039 
use this one which will go into USB so
you<00:01:17.619> just<00:01:18.010> need<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.400> put<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.090> FT<00:01:19.570> card<00:01:19.840> over

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
you just need to put the FT card over

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.419 
you just need to put the FT card over
here<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.409> then<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:20.619> can<00:01:20.890> put<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:21.280> thing

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
here and then you can put this thing

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.910 
here and then you can put this thing
like<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.820> USB<00:01:22.270> Drive<00:01:22.479> and<00:01:22.509> then<00:01:22.750> your<00:01:23.469> laptop

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
will read the card with the help of this

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.410 
will read the card with the help of this
card<00:01:26.590> reader<00:01:26.799> which<00:01:26.890> comes<00:01:27.609> and<00:01:27.850> this<00:01:28.060> is<00:01:28.210> the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
card reader which comes and this is the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.020 
card reader which comes and this is the
micro<00:01:28.810> SD<00:01:29.079> card<00:01:29.289> adapter<00:01:29.439> and<00:01:30.039> here<00:01:30.729> we<00:01:30.880> have

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
micro SD card adapter and here we have

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.179 
micro SD card adapter and here we have
the<00:01:31.149> card

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.429 

and<00:01:34.610> again<00:01:34.969> if<00:01:35.210> we<00:01:35.240> take<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.630> look<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.380> is

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
and again if we take a look this is

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.279 
and again if we take a look this is
golden<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.189> color<00:01:37.460> we're<00:01:38.360> looking<00:01:38.899> very<00:01:39.079> good

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
golden in color we're looking very good

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.260 
golden in color we're looking very good
I<00:01:39.320> would<00:01:39.560> say<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.490> read<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:40.850> write<00:01:41.000> speed

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
I would say and the read and write speed

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.420 
I would say and the read and write speed
is<00:01:41.420> something<00:01:41.780> which<00:01:41.930> is<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.200> key<00:01:42.439> feature<00:01:43.130> of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
is something which is the key feature of

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.460 
is something which is the key feature of
this<00:01:44.000> particular<00:01:44.210> card<00:01:44.659> because<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.289> is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
this particular card because this is

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.330 
this particular card because this is
based<00:01:45.829> on<00:01:46.100> micro<00:01:46.729> ft<00:01:47.659> XC<00:01:48.140> standard<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.039> it<00:01:49.159> will

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
based on micro ft XC standard so it will

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.789 
based on micro ft XC standard so it will
support<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.880> read<00:01:50.240> speed<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.600> atme<00:01:51.229> per<00:01:51.439> second

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
support a read speed of atme per second

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.380 
support a read speed of atme per second
whereas<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.399> write<00:01:52.549> speed<00:01:52.789> is<00:01:52.939> going<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.270> be

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
whereas the write speed is going to be

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.969 
whereas the write speed is going to be
60<00:01:53.780> MB<00:01:54.020> per<00:01:54.140> second<00:01:54.439> which<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.619> good<00:01:54.950> enough

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
60 MB per second which is good enough

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.100 
60 MB per second which is good enough
and<00:01:55.369> much<00:01:55.819> higher<00:01:56.060> than<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.450> other<00:01:56.659> cards

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
and much higher than the other cards

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.870 
and much higher than the other cards
which<00:01:57.259> we<00:01:57.409> have<00:01:57.560> in<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.740> market<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.220> do<00:01:58.490> have<00:01:58.850> a

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
which we have in the market I do have a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.490 
which we have in the market I do have a
similar<00:01:59.270> card<00:01:59.569> with<00:01:59.750> me<00:01:59.899> right<00:02:00.110> now

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
similar card with me right now

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.899
