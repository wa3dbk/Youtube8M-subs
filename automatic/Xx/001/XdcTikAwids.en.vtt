with<00:04:00.280> any<00:04:00.370> movie<00:04:00.909> but<00:04:01.150> if<00:04:01.359> this<00:04:01.569> comedy<00:04:02.109> works

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
with any movie but if this comedy works

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.550 
with any movie but if this comedy works
this<00:04:03.760> looks<00:04:04.450> like<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.599> family<00:04:04.959> comedy<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.500> if

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
this looks like a family comedy and if

this looks like a family comedy and if
it<00:04:05.680> works

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
it works

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.670

this<00:04:06.549> could<00:04:06.970> get<00:04:07.269> Adam<00:04:07.659> Sandler<00:04:08.049> some<00:04:08.290> respect

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
this could get Adam Sandler some respect

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.619 
this could get Adam Sandler some respect
again<00:04:08.829> he's<00:04:09.189> lost<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.579> lot<00:04:09.609> of<00:04:09.790> respect<00:04:09.909> because
