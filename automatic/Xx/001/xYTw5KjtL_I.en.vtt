00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello, I have not gone anywhere 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.960
 I had problems that thank God 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.490
 decided now trying to return 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.170
 lost by stress 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.240
 form and then much thinner and today 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.029
 share with you my shell for 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.070
 horizontal bar which expands 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.710
 horizontal bar and allows you to work 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.710
 extra muscle group when its 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.900
 I did focus on the elaboration 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.890
 back muscles but as it turned out 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.040
 then work on a lot more muscle this 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.770
 projectile weighing horizontal bar with horizontal bar 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.260
 it touches these two places 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.210
 grasp two handles and pull up a 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.250
 the most effective result 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.199
 is achieved if you are 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 this parallel enough pulling up 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.580
 as if breast to the crossbar 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.799
 at first it is difficult and it turns out only 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.610
 upright and pulling up but after 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.490
 several classes are getting better 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:20.509
 get important not to score on it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.549
 exercise in general work here 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.680
 latissimus dorsi muscles especially lower 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.750
 sections of rhomboid and round muscles of the back 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.299
 works perfectly biceps exercises 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.070
 on this projectile it seems to be a circle of biceps and 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.860
 has the same effect on biceps 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.860
 what rises dumbbell biceps with a hammer 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.479
 still in addition work deltoid and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.049
 the jagged muscles and end up using this 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.850
 simple projectile we replace at least 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.070
 two exercises 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.850
 This is the lower unit of the simulator and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:10.590
 lifting dumbbells for biceps pier there 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.390
 In general, the projectile bombs now and the very 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.360
 construction and as you can see here everything 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.800
 quite primitive two pipes 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:24.800
 parallel to each other 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:31.640
 bent here are two bars which I had 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.640
 here are three cooked them who you these places and 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:41.220
 stiffness top welded reinforcement more 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.640
 All detailed dimensions are the distance between 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.220
 pipes one atom height I will indicate further 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.209
 video that is in the drawing 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.510
 but I have everything to everyone, subscribe 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.730
 put the likes on the channel 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.150
 the main thing is to do sports and be 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.150
 are healthy
