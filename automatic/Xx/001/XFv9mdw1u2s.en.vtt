00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.560
 good good to all 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.460
 today we are going to do 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.460
 small boxes 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.180
 they are very simple but above all this 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.270
 I've done this video thinking about a friend 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.280
 of the channel a friend who follows the channel 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.300
 what are you doing rosaries if 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.520
 you want to give them away 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.160
 in boxes that look transparent 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.650
 so that you can appreciate the rosary 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.630
 since 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.730
 inside the box without needing to 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.780
 open it and at the same time be a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.989
 box that can be reused 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.840
 and I do not have that material I do not have 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.089
 acetate sheets for more than sought 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.360
 I could not find but I'm going to do 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:08.060
 the video using something similar that is 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.399
 a plastic folder 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.690
 you see from the typical folders of the 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.280
 who carry 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.670
 or more 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.610
 it's the closest thing I've been able to do 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.049
 find and well I'm going to do it to see 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.680
 if it can somehow help 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.680
 our mine 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.950
 the next thing you have to do is 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.630
 apart from getting the acetate if what 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.700
 you want transparent 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.259
 if you want it on cardboard simply 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.020
 you have to use the pattern in 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.300
 Cardboard and if you have cardboard 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.120
 plasticized are much better 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.830
 you go to the blog link and there 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.470
 you will find the pattern that is this 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.970
 once you have it downloaded what 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.970
 let's do is going to be cut it 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.350
 as you see he has already cut the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.920
 template if you give accounts have here 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 some notches that with a scissors are 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.580
 difficult to cut then what I 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.580
 I use is a wooden board 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.450
 with a cutter 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.350
 and then it 's the way I use to 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.350
 I can remember him 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.180
 I have already cut a piece of plastic you see 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.510
 hard is the rigid 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.720
 and then what I would do would be 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.890
 put the template on top and we're going to 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.890
 stick with a little fix 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.820
 you do not need to put much on it 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.540
 just to keep the template 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.540
 punch 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.749
 to the plastic and that does not move us 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.850
 then once we have it so 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:16.550
 what we are going to do 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.550
 what we are going to do is to cut it 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.130
 the notches do the same we cut them 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.530
 with 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.780
 with the help of the cutter and supporting us in 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.780
 the wood worth girls let's do it 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.700
 well as you can see I have already cut what 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.700
 it's the template 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:44.100
 I made the notches with the cutter 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.180
 and now it would only be necessary to mount it to what 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.770
 is the box as you see to do it in 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.710
 this type of material in plastic or in 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.690
 acetate 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.510
 I have chosen a box that simply 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.540
 have these folds because if it would not be 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.260
 much more complicated 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.040
 it would simply be 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.040
 mark 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.939
 you do not need to mark it or anything because 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.319
 obviously it is in each of the 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.209
 samples that make the languages 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.659
 you have to work it carefully that you 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.659
 look good 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.810
 marc we would do 4 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.850
 to the last 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:43.540
 and as you see has taken the form 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.260
 and this box is very simple to open and 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.639
 close 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.389
 you do not need a fix or you do not need the 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.690
 glue would simply bring the 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.690
 tongues 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.120
 make them match 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.090
 with the openings we've made 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.990
 if you do it with transparent acetate 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.990
 and he would stay 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.500
 Well that seeing what's inside 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.850
 and for such a detail of the style that 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.300
 I wanted our friend the truth is that 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.300
 it's great 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.580
 you see 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.900
 if you want you can open the tabs 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.730
 can be separated to give a little 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.730
 so 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.450
 and if I do not go to leave them as they are 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.860
 I hope you liked it and good that 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.140
 serve you to make a gift 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.169
 special if you want it in transparent 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.379
 remember 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.659
 you look for the acetate and if not then you see 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.280
 than with a folder of these plastic 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.610
 Can be done 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.350
 These are made of cardboard 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.530
 plasticized and they are also very 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.700
 pretty as you see on the page you are going to 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.840
 find the 4 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.840
 and that I hope you have loved 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.840
 bye
