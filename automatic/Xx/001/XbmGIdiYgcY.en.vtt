00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
where Julian de Guzman fits into this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.900 
where Julian de Guzman fits into this
midfield<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.129> well<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
midfield as well but I think the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
midfield as well but I think the
Dunfield<00:00:45.360> does<00:00:45.930> give<00:00:46.230> them<00:00:46.410> another<00:00:46.649> option

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
Dunfield does give them another option

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.100 
Dunfield does give them another option
there<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.550> obviously<00:00:48.030> showed<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.539> Vancouver

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
there it obviously showed with Vancouver

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
there it obviously showed with Vancouver
that<00:00:49.260> he<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> leader<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.430> he<00:00:50.730> was

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that he can be a leader in there he was

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.400 
that he can be a leader in there he was
captain<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.510> several<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> games<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.379> there

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
captain for several the games out there

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
captain for several the games out there
for<00:00:52.739> Vancouver<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.610> also<00:00:53.760> think<00:00:53.969> he<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
for Vancouver and I also think he has a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.840 
for Vancouver and I also think he has a
lot<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.690> lot<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.379> energy<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.890> forward<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
lot of a lot of energy going forward and

a decorah our guys were going to come

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
a decorah our guys were going to come
off<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> bench<00:01:07.979> add<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.460> depth<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> team

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
off the bench add some depth to the team

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.780 
off the bench add some depth to the team
but<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.659> Jacob<00:01:10.020> Pedersen<00:01:10.229> finally<00:01:11.070> gets

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
but that Jacob Pedersen finally gets

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.859 
but that Jacob Pedersen finally gets
them<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> answer<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.600> they've<00:01:12.720> been

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
them the answer that they've been

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.480 
them the answer that they've been
looking<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.710> midfield<00:01:14.100> well<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
looking for at right midfield well I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.590 
looking for at right midfield well I
think<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.790> Peterson<00:01:15.240> gives<00:01:15.420> them<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
think that Peterson gives them that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.090 
think that Peterson gives them that
speed<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> work<00:01:16.530> rate<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.950> they've

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
speed in the work rate that they've

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.590 
speed in the work rate that they've
needed<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.700> especially<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.479> they're

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
needed out there especially if they're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
needed out there especially if they're
going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> start<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.560> service<00:01:20.430> into

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
going to start to get more service into

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
going to start to get more service into
the<00:01:20.729> box<00:01:20.970> where<00:01:21.330> Wondolowski<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.229> finish<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the box where Wondolowski can finish a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
the box where Wondolowski can finish a
little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.240> they're<00:01:24.420> going

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
little bit more I do think they're going

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
little bit more I do think they're going
to<00:01:24.600> miss<00:01:24.810> ryan<00:01:25.080> Johnson<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.979> really

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
to miss ryan Johnson because I really

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.429 
to miss ryan Johnson because I really
like<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.970> ryan<00:01:27.270> Johnson<00:01:27.689> did<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.049> Jamaica

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
like what ryan Johnson did for Jamaica

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.350 
like what ryan Johnson did for Jamaica
in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.680> Gold<00:01:29.040> Cup<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.790> he<00:01:29.939> improves

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
in the Gold Cup I think he improves

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
in the Gold Cup I think he improves
Toronto<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.079> attack<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.740> sure<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.280> do

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
Toronto in the attack for sure I do

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
Toronto in the attack for sure I do
wonder<00:01:32.970> whether<00:01:33.240> San<00:01:33.540> Jose<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
wonder whether San Jose might have a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.780 
wonder whether San Jose might have a
move<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> back<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.310> their<00:01:35.369> minds

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
move in the back of their minds
