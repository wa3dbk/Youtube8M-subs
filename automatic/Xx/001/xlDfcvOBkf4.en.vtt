00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.140 
because I think that with the social
media<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.040> today<00:01:14.070> there's<00:01:14.970> just

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
media the way it is today there's just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
media the way it is today there's just
too<00:01:15.330> many<00:01:15.450> people<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:16.110> online<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.009> it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
too many people that are online and it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
too many people that are online and it's
really<00:01:17.640> hard<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.259> software<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> pick<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
really hard for the software to pick a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
really hard for the software to pick a
host<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> game<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> run<00:01:21.600> smoothly

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
host and for the game to run smoothly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.109 
host and for the game to run smoothly
it's<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.100> consisting<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:23.909> worse

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it's going to be consisting to get worse

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
it's going to be consisting to get worse
in<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.350> hoses<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.070> keep

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
in the hoses you're going to just keep

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
in the hoses you're going to just keep
switching<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> turn<00:01:27.930> into<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
switching and it's going to turn into a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.420 
switching and it's going to turn into a
nightmare<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.930> with<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.079> being<00:01:31.229> said<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.950> hope
