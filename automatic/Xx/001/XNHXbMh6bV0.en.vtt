00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.039
 gameplay which is that 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 the whole world is drawn right on your

 only 15 megabytes 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.340
 game place the game will take around a hundred 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.559

 is a slightly simplified version 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 asphalt 8 of course she is inferior to her but with 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 this is less demanding and takes 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.399
 10 times less space on your 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.129

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 decided to make such a parody of 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.409
 modern games about zombies and pro 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.659

 which you can unlock 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.019

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.269

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.940
 the truth is there is one nuance the game is 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.010
 exclusive for the nvidia shield in the game we 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.379
 We play for the panda who is called Juju 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.230
 the main goal is to save his 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.150
 whose father was kidnapped by a local villain 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.370
 the gameplay is standard platformer 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.799
 which we have to run jump and 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.049

 very attentive not a platformer 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.269
 liked and hopefully sometime game 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.430
 will be available for other android 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.349

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.120
 him in the sixth place of my top 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.280
 settled down another platformer under 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.319
 the name is not hill umbro the way the games are on 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.049
 android was very long but I will say right away 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.600
 these expectations were worth it we play for 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.910
 a creation that was spawned by emptiness 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.010
 and darkness once this creature is given 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.989
 question and what if suddenly there is 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.030
 another world beyond the abyss 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.310
 getting out of a poor being 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.739
 turns into another world and takes 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.319
 scarecrow shape to 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.930
 disguise but without feeling 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.609
 child and sent him the mechanics of the game 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.340
 based on the use of different 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.560
 colors with them you can change 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.530
 surface properties and thanks to this 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.900
 overcome obstacles and monsters game 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.880
 filled with lots of pop-up phrases 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.340
 which makes you think about 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.560
 frailty of its existence the top five 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.720
 May's best games opens tactical 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.730
 fantasy rpg sang crafter 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.190
 you have to learn the world to fight 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.049
 the forces of evil and help other people 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.780
 battle system in the game are of themselves 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.030
 turn-based strategy in the spirit of the heroes of the sword and 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.709
 magic warriors your squad you can 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.760
 hire for the money you will 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.919
 find in chests 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.320
 or get for doing side 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.120

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.979
 battlefield he can cast spells 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.330
 and for this you will need not 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.460
 just push a button 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.919
 and draw a specific character on 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.260
 screen on until this game won 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.540
 particular popularity but also mobile 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.760
 I think the port will definitely be in demand 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.610
 because this kind of product is not so much 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.040
 on android 4 game is the port of one of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.590
 most famous quests before it comes to 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.780
 the game grim fandango even more precisely 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.120
 then the redesigned version with the best 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.850
 graphics shadows and adapted to 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.220
 high resolutions we play as agent 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.169
 for the sale of vouchers for the next world exactly 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.389
 this is where the gloomy entourage is justified 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.550
 This game is very atmospheric from 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.680
 sets of various tasks that immediately 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.419
 not everyone can decide that 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.699
 how old the game is even better to say 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.490
 classic so forget about everyone 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.260

 go to youtube and search 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.900
 passing a certain stage in the game 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.150
 there is a large number of jokes 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.340
 because of which a smile will appear more than once on 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.650
 your face third place may top 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.780

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.950
 not willingly got into the old 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.410
 damn mansion and seemingly nothing 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.479
 scary until it turned the spirit 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.039
 This house did not say that if she did not 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.289
 get out before dawn then forever 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.479
 will stay in this terrible place 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.060
 lest you be bored 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.310
 various puzzles and solve quests 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.830
 various ghosts have been added to the game and 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.410
 monsters with which you can join in 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.300
 battle combat system is very arcade total 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.190
 just need to tap on the points in the right 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.289
 the moment you either snap in right 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.270
 direction the only downside of the game 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.160
 is the lack of Russian language 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.840
 but if you have at least basic 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.330
 English, you can easily 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.039
 figured out in second place long-awaited 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.900
 game port and hotline miami 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.520
 you have to play the role of the killer in 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.810
 a mask that kills people by 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.699
 phone call 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.070
 mostly your sacrifices will be 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.840
 representatives of the Russian mafia that I 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.340
 telling most and so know what 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.139
 is hotline miami 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.330
 control in the game is carried out only 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.280
 with the help of a gamepad that to be honest 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.860
 complicates an already complicated gaming 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.900
 the process is very difficult to run at the same time 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.430
 shoot and dodge what will 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.330
 cause and have a large number 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.400
 gamers creepy bathert 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.080
 the port itself is not bad but a couple of times the game 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.419
 hung in the middle of a mission 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.819
 I hope the next updates will be 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.580
 fixed and here it is the best game of may 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.590
 my opinion is talos principle 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.569
 let it be tigers exclusive but the way out 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.939
 the port and this game on android is big 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.039
 breakthrough for the platform game represents 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:51.349
 from yourself a philosophical puzzle from 1 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.719
 the faces that you will play for the robot 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:56.210
 your task is to go through the world full 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.430
 puzzles and riddles along the way 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.479
 the plot you follow the command 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.310
 voice over 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.080
 plot features learn from 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.240
 scattered around the game computers 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.580
 your main tool with 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.650
 whom you will avoid patrol 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.379
 robots and energetically open the doors 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.300
 there will be a deactivator the only thing that costs 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.789
 note this is just incredible zhor 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.659
 batteries due to maximum load 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:20.060
 processor 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:21.979
 but it is such games that show us on 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.940
 what are modern mobiles capable of 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.740
 devices 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.509
 that's all the games that in my opinion 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.430
 May I remember in summer 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.919
 developers will continue to delight us 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.849
