anything<00:01:49.179> in<00:01:50.009> fact<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:51.130> need<00:01:51.189> probably<00:01:51.609> should

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
anything in fact I need probably should

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:52.919 
anything in fact I need probably should
count<00:01:51.969> this<00:01:52.090> because<00:01:52.299> this<00:01:52.450> is<00:01:52.509> a<00:01:52.539> car<00:01:52.719> dome

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
count this because this is a car dome

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.069 
count this because this is a car dome
box<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.729> anyway<00:01:54.729> these<00:01:54.939> balls<00:01:55.240> are<00:01:55.600> like<00:01:56.049> a

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
box so anyway these balls are like a

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.109 
box so anyway these balls are like a
thousands<00:01:56.679> in<00:01:56.799> diameter<00:01:57.069> difference<00:01:57.819> and

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
thousands in diameter difference and

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.620 
thousands in diameter difference and
what<00:01:59.020> we're<00:01:59.139> going<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.289> do<00:01:59.499> is<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.450> to

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
what we're going to do is I'm going to

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.410 
what we're going to do is I'm going to
put<00:02:01.810> them<00:02:01.899> back<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.319> and<00:02:03.069> then<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:03.880> put<00:02:04.119> this

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
put them back in and then we put this

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.080 
put them back in and then we put this
piece<00:02:04.899> on<00:02:05.159> when<00:02:06.159> we're<00:02:06.310> done<00:02:06.459> so<00:02:06.729> you've<00:02:06.939> got

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
piece on when we're done so you've got

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.760 
piece on when we're done so you've got
like<00:02:07.209> a<00:02:07.270> spiral<00:02:07.689> that<00:02:07.869> goes<00:02:08.140> all<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.350> way<00:02:08.440> down

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
like a spiral that goes all the way down

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.100 
like a spiral that goes all the way down
and<00:02:09.040> then<00:02:09.820> it<00:02:10.000> comes<00:02:10.210> back<00:02:10.390> around<00:02:10.570> through

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
and then it comes back around through

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.630 
and then it comes back around through
this<00:02:11.230> little<00:02:11.440> tube

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
this little tube

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.280 
this little tube
to<00:02:13.180> recirculate<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.140> called

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
to recirculate so it's called

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.200 
to recirculate so it's called
recirculating<00:02:14.920> ball<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.190> tube<00:02:15.460> goes<00:02:15.730> here

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
recirculating ball the tube goes here

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.059 
recirculating ball the tube goes here
like<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:20.230> holds<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.500> balls<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:20.950> and

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
like so and it holds the balls in and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.160 
like so and it holds the balls in and
what<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.280> do<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:22.330> easiest<00:02:22.780> way<00:02:22.990> I've<00:02:23.140> found

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
what you do the easiest way I've found

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.960 
what you do the easiest way I've found
to<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.770> just<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.130> rotate<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.580> piston

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
to do this is just to rotate the piston

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.210 
to do this is just to rotate the piston
inside<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.480> cylinder<00:02:25.900> or<00:02:26.230> inside<00:02:26.590> inside<00:02:27.100> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
inside the cylinder or inside inside the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.040 
inside the cylinder or inside inside the
housing<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.480> said<00:02:28.630> line<00:02:28.840> work<00:02:29.020> looks

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
housing so just said line work looks

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.180 
housing so just said line work looks
like<00:02:29.320> that<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.520> can<00:02:30.670> see<00:02:31.920> I'm<00:02:32.920> probably

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
like that and you can see I'm probably

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.410 
like that and you can see I'm probably
I'm<00:02:33.340> not<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.670> film<00:02:33.940> putting<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.270> balls

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
I'm not going to film putting the balls

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.840 
I'm not going to film putting the balls
in<00:02:34.600> because<00:02:34.840> I'll<00:02:34.959> lose<00:02:35.230> track<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.760> have

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
in because I'll lose track and you have

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.699 
in because I'll lose track and you have
to<00:02:36.940> do<00:02:37.060> an<00:02:37.150> alternate<00:02:37.540> ball<00:02:37.720> but<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.530> just

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
to do an alternate ball but you can just

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.830 
to do an alternate ball but you can just
basically<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.190> could<00:02:39.310> take<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> magnet<00:02:39.850> what<00:02:40.750> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
basically you could take a magnet what I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.500 
basically you could take a magnet what I
do<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.080> just<00:02:41.320> take<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> magnet<00:02:42.150> one<00:02:43.150> ball<00:02:43.360> at<00:02:43.450> a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
do is just take a magnet one ball at a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.350 
do is just take a magnet one ball at a
time<00:02:43.780> going<00:02:44.260> okay<00:02:44.500> that's<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:45.180> that's<00:02:46.180> a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
time going okay that's a that's a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.020 
time going okay that's a that's a
several<00:02:46.720> then<00:02:46.900> or<00:02:47.230> wait<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:48.010> that's<00:02:48.790> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
several then or wait and that's it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.380 
several then or wait and that's it
that's<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.660> black<00:02:49.870> one<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:51.310> I'd<00:02:51.700> put<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.180> in

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
that's a black one so I'd put that in

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.560 
that's a black one so I'd put that in
here<00:02:53.010> put<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.160> in<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.310> hole<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:57.570> continue

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
here put that in the hole and continue

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.750 
here put that in the hole and continue
on<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.440> just<00:02:59.709> alternate<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.340> then<00:03:00.459> once<00:03:00.670> you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
on so just alternate and then once you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.610 
on so just alternate and then once you
get<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.540> where<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.810> have<00:03:01.959> here<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.470> here

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
get to where you have here and here

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.470 
get to where you have here and here
filled<00:03:02.920> up<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.580> last<00:03:03.790> six<00:03:04.120> balls<00:03:04.360> you

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
filled up the last six balls you

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.110 
filled up the last six balls you
alternate<00:03:04.870> in<00:03:05.019> here<00:03:05.640> again<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.730> got<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.940> keep

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
alternate in here again you got to keep

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.120 
alternate in here again you got to keep
them<00:03:07.269> alternating<00:03:07.810> well<00:03:08.470> do<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.709> alternate

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
them alternating well do is alternate

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.530 
them alternating well do is alternate
them<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.459> here<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.910> they'll<00:03:10.090> put<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.300> on

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
them in here and they'll put that on

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.940 
them in here and they'll put that on
I'll<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:10.780> apply<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.440> little<00:03:11.530> bit<00:03:11.680> site

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
I'll just apply a little bit site

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.620 
I'll just apply a little bit site
pressure<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.820> will<00:03:12.940> hold<00:03:13.090> them<00:03:13.209> in<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.570> you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
pressure that will hold them in and you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.780 
pressure that will hold them in and you
can<00:03:13.780> just<00:03:13.930> drop<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.440> there<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.860> then

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
can just drop that in there and then

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.170 
can just drop that in there and then
this<00:03:15.940> clamp<00:03:16.570> goes<00:03:17.130> all<00:03:18.130> over<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.880> hold<00:03:19.060> it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
this clamp goes all over it to hold it

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.150 
this clamp goes all over it to hold it
down<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:19.690> that's<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.290> easiest<00:03:20.680> way<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.890> put

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
down so that's the easiest way to put

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.220 
down so that's the easiest way to put
these<00:03:21.280> things<00:03:21.430> back<00:03:21.670> together<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.420> if<00:03:23.079> you've

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
these things back together so if you've

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.130 
these things back together so if you've
ever<00:03:23.380> had<00:03:23.590> fear<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.600> turning<00:03:25.600> your<00:03:25.810> steering

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
ever had fear of turning your steering

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.490 
ever had fear of turning your steering
gearbox<00:03:26.290> apart<00:03:26.860> or<00:03:27.160> whatever<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:29.110> not<00:03:29.140> that

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
gearbox apart or whatever it's not that

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.350 
gearbox apart or whatever it's not that
big<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.709> deal<00:03:29.920> everybody<00:03:30.430> thinks<00:03:30.880> oh<00:03:31.030> I'm<00:03:31.209> gonna

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
big a deal everybody thinks oh I'm gonna

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.840 
big a deal everybody thinks oh I'm gonna
have<00:03:31.450> ball<00:03:31.660> bearings<00:03:32.019> everywhere<00:03:32.380> those<00:03:33.280> are

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
have ball bearings everywhere those are

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.050 
have ball bearings everywhere those are
all<00:03:34.000> that's<00:03:34.329> it<00:03:35.400> but<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:36.519> when<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.790> turn<00:03:36.970> it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
all that's it but just when you turn it

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.960 
all that's it but just when you turn it
apart<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:37.690> back<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.070> you'll

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
apart you just back this out and you'll

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.759 
apart you just back this out and you'll
hear<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.299> balls<00:03:40.510> fall<00:03:40.780> out<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.260> then<00:03:41.620> you

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
hear the balls fall out and then you

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.199 
hear the balls fall out and then you
pull<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.070> piston<00:03:42.430> out<00:03:42.549> dump<00:03:42.910> from<00:03:43.030> out<00:03:43.150> in

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
pull the piston out dump from out in

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.000 
pull the piston out dump from out in
your<00:03:43.269> hand<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.500> don't<00:03:44.709> let<00:03:44.799> them<00:03:44.920> get

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
your hand and just don't let them get

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.420 
your hand and just don't let them get
away

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
away

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.660 
away
so<00:03:46.560> anyway<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.620> just<00:03:47.860> wanted<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.190> cover<00:03:48.340> that

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
so anyway I just wanted to cover that

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.460 
so anyway I just wanted to cover that
how<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.690> put<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:49.989> these<00:03:50.049> things<00:03:50.230> back

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
how to put one of these things back

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.750 
how to put one of these things back
together<00:03:50.650> because<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.250> know<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.400> lot<00:03:51.549> of<00:03:51.579> guys

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
together because I know a lot of guys

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.270 
together because I know a lot of guys
are<00:03:51.970> scared<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.390> them<00:03:52.540> but<00:03:52.930> again<00:03:53.769> it's<00:03:54.130> pretty

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
are scared of them but again it's pretty

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.340 
are scared of them but again it's pretty
easy<00:03:54.519> just<00:03:54.970> rotate<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.660> got<00:03:56.110> this<00:03:56.200> thing

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
easy just rotate the I got this thing

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.560 
easy just rotate the I got this thing
rotated<00:03:56.769> about<00:03:56.920> 45<00:03:57.400> degrees<00:03:57.730> normally<00:03:58.269> these

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
rotated about 45 degrees normally these

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.190 
rotated about 45 degrees normally these
t4b

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
t4b

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.660 
t4b
at<00:04:00.130> this<00:04:00.310> angle<00:04:00.850> so<00:04:01.480> there'll<00:04:01.660> be<00:04:02.670> parallel

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
at this angle so there'll be parallel

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.520 
at this angle so there'll be parallel
and<00:04:03.850> then<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.120> sector<00:04:04.480> shaft<00:04:04.660> key<00:04:05.260> from<00:04:05.440> the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
and then the sector shaft key from the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.920 
and then the sector shaft key from the
sector<00:04:05.799> shaft<00:04:05.950> engage<00:04:06.459> engage<00:04:07.269> these<00:04:07.660> teeth

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
sector shaft engage engage these teeth

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.410 
sector shaft engage engage these teeth
here<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.920> rotate<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.459> this<00:04:10.239> way

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
here so you can rotate this this way

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.000 
here so you can rotate this this way
inside<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.930> housing<00:04:11.290> so<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.500> can<00:04:11.620> get<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.859> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
inside the housing so you can get to the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.449 
inside the housing so you can get to the
to<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.579> opening<00:04:12.940> here<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.269> put<00:04:13.959> your<00:04:14.079> balls<00:04:14.230> in

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
to the opening here to put your balls in

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.640 
to the opening here to put your balls in
that's<00:04:15.459> it
