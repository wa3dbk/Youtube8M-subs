opinion it's a great game guys it will
last<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.520> while<00:01:17.700> it'll<00:01:18.000> last<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.390> YouTube

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
last a while it'll last on YouTube

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
last a while it'll last on YouTube
forever<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.380> thought<00:01:19.920> whether<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
forever I thought whether it's going to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280 
forever I thought whether it's going to
end<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.119> YouTube<00:01:21.509> community<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.200> it's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
end the YouTube community or if it's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.690 
end the YouTube community or if it's
going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> keep<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.799> alive<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
going to keep it alive and now that I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
going to keep it alive and now that I
played<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> game<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.990> people<00:01:25.140> are

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
played the game now that people are

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
played the game now that people are
uploading<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.890> every<00:01:26.159> day<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
uploading it every day I think it's

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.609 
uploading it every day I think it's
gonna<00:01:27.000> keep<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> YouTube<00:01:27.840> alive<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.500> going

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
gonna keep the YouTube alive it's going

to keep YouTube quality alive a lot it's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.300

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
people who really rely on gameplays now

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.160 
people who really rely on gameplays now

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.600 
in modern warfare 3 I guess I sort of
relied<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.380> gameplays<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> still<00:01:41.400> put<00:01:41.549> a

the hundred plus I probably could have

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.690 
the hundred plus I probably could have
gotten<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.890> was<00:01:56.009> running<00:01:56.159> higher<00:01:56.430> kill

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
gotten if I was running higher kill

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520

streaks I was running the UAV lightning
strike<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> lodestar<00:01:59.490> now<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> lodestar<00:02:00.540> is

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
strike and lodestar now the lodestar is

it's<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> 1400<00:02:03.659> scorestreak<00:02:04.469> maybe<00:02:04.680> 1500<00:02:05.310> i'll

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
it's a 1400 scorestreak maybe 1500 i'll

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.620 
it's a 1400 scorestreak maybe 1500 i'll
have<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> look<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.479> bit

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
have to look up that in a little bit

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.380 
have to look up that in a little bit
later<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.439> really<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> lodestar<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.179> like

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
later but really the lodestar is like

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.570 
later but really the lodestar is like
the<00:02:09.539> modern<00:02:09.810> warfare<00:02:09.989> 3<00:02:10.200> reaper<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.160> way

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the modern warfare 3 reaper but way

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.520 
the modern warfare 3 reaper but way
amped<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.030> way<00:02:12.450> better<00:02:12.720> way<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.110> an<00:02:13.200> overall

like<00:02:16.710> 20<00:02:16.950> kills<00:02:17.370> per<00:02:17.700> lodestar<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.510> I'm<00:02:18.660> not

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
like 20 kills per lodestar like I'm not

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.660 
like 20 kills per lodestar like I'm not
even<00:02:18.990> exaggerating<00:02:19.080> guys<00:02:19.800> 20<00:02:20.220> kills<00:02:20.460> per

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
even exaggerating guys 20 kills per

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.790 
even exaggerating guys 20 kills per
lodestar<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.720> good<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.960> think<00:02:22.470> it's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
lodestar it's so good I think it's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.640 
lodestar it's so good I think it's
better<00:02:22.950> than<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.160> k-9<00:02:23.670> unit<00:02:24.090> or<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.600> swarm<00:02:25.260> or

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
better than the k-9 unit or the swarm or

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.010 
better than the k-9 unit or the swarm or
the<00:02:26.010> orbital<00:02:26.550> vsat<00:02:26.730> now<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.180> orbital<00:02:27.600> vsat<00:02:27.720> is

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the orbital vsat now the orbital vsat is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.780 
the orbital vsat now the orbital vsat is
basically<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.890> Blackbird<00:02:29.370> from<00:02:29.580> black

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
basically just the Blackbird from black

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.460 
basically just the Blackbird from black
ops<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:30.660> still<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:31.050> good<00:02:31.290> kill

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470
