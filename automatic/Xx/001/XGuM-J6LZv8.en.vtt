who<00:01:55.380> would<00:01:55.679> win<00:01:56.179> but<00:01:57.179> the<00:01:57.420> real<00:01:57.630> question<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
who would win but the real question is

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.290 
who would win but the real question is
when<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.890> morning<00:01:59.280> comes<00:01:59.460> everybody's

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
when the morning comes everybody's

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.450 
when the morning comes everybody's
wondering<00:02:00.690> who<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.289> still<00:02:01.500> alive<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:02.160> what

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
wondering who is still alive but what

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.999 
wondering who is still alive but what
happens<00:02:02.940> if<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.390> walked<00:02:03.660> out<00:02:03.899> together<00:02:04.140> what

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
happens if they walked out together what

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.190 
happens if they walked out together what
happens<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.670> became<00:02:06.060> buddies<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.170> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
happens if they became buddies so I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.290 
happens if they became buddies so I
think<00:02:07.350> recreated<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.850> compelling

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
think recreated a really compelling

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.990 
think recreated a really compelling
character<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.200> think<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:10.979> chase<00:02:11.250> ampio<00:02:11.820> an

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
character I think we chase ampio an

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.180 
character I think we chase ampio an
amazing<00:02:12.540> performance<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.260> well<00:02:13.590> we

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
amazing performance as well we

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.250 
amazing performance as well we
discovered<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.819> as<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.210> went<00:02:15.360> along<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.990> some

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
discovered it as we went along like some

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.680 
discovered it as we went along like some
of<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> other<00:02:16.710> characters<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.520> we<00:02:17.730> make<00:02:18.000> now

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
of the other characters but we make now

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.600 
of the other characters but we make now
that<00:02:18.990> wasn't<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.440> only<00:02:19.530> thing<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.040> dancer

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
that wasn't the only thing that dancer

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.610 
that wasn't the only thing that dancer
because<00:02:20.790> he<00:02:21.060> continued<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.630> say<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.290> then

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
because he continued to say that then

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.100 
because he continued to say that then
for<00:02:22.890> trick<00:02:23.220> now<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.550> being<00:02:24.060> able<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.660> turn<00:02:24.870> it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
for trick now is being able to turn it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.890 
for trick now is being able to turn it
into<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.500> chorus<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.490> not<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.660> be

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
into a chorus it's not just going to be

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.380 
into a chorus it's not just going to be
peg<00:02:28.170> am<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:29.400> are<00:02:29.520> characters<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.060> we

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
peg am in there are characters that we

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.090 
peg am in there are characters that we
are<00:02:30.510> not<00:02:30.690> telling<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.290> about<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.860> they<00:02:32.069> are

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
are not telling you about and they are

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.309 
are not telling you about and they are
going<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.550> be<00:02:32.700> chilling<00:02:33.150> Griffin<00:02:33.660> unique<00:02:34.050> and

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
going to be chilling Griffin unique and

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.530 
going to be chilling Griffin unique and
definitely<00:02:34.890> interesting<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.510> think

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
definitely interesting and I think

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.530 
definitely interesting and I think
people<00:02:36.930> are<00:02:37.319> going<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.800> love<00:02:38.010> burn<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:39.330> he

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
people are going to love burn so he

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.120 
people are going to love burn so he
pretty<00:02:39.810> much<00:02:39.930> left<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.530> speech<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.069> a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
pretty much left that speech and a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.800 
pretty much left that speech and a
cliffhanger<00:02:41.430> rakish<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.150> could<00:02:42.300> say<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:42.540> I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
cliffhanger rakish you could say but I

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.240 
cliffhanger rakish you could say but I
actually<00:02:42.990> think<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.530> was<00:02:43.770> pretty<00:02:43.980> cool

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
actually think that was pretty cool

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.949 
actually think that was pretty cool
because<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.760> leaves<00:02:45.000> us<00:02:45.180> kind<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.660> really

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
because it leaves us kind of really

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.420 
because it leaves us kind of really
excited<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.530> find<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.100> who<00:02:47.250> these

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
excited to find that on who these

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.820 
excited to find that on who these
characters<00:02:47.700> are<00:02:48.180> now<00:02:49.050> going<00:02:49.350> back<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.709> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
characters are now going back to the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.620 
characters are now going back to the
main<00:02:49.980> villain<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:50.640> game<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> really<00:02:51.480> do

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
main villain in this game I really do

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.480 
main villain in this game I really do
think<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.020> unique<00:02:52.470> person<00:02:53.010> because<00:02:53.340> he's

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
think is a unique person because he's

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.490 
think is a unique person because he's
strange<00:02:53.940> weird<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.570> really<00:02:55.200> cool<00:02:55.380> at<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
strange weird and really cool at the

same time

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.540 
same time
cuz<00:02:56.510> he<00:02:57.050> also<00:02:57.290> has<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:57.710> his<00:02:57.830> own<00:02:57.950> style<00:02:58.280> two
