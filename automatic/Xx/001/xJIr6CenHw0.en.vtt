 set things up quietly and 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.580
 well here we see the environment of the 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.920

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.010
 here until the ravine can see so much 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.090

 here the first things do not appear anymore and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.090
 we go the net closely to look for them 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.400

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.310
 we install 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.320
 to install ok and let's start what 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.060
 is normally the installation of this 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.590
 very well application is already done as 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.710
 I said first you have to have 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.450

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.000
 also in the folder here ok 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.680
 very well once they have that taken 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.680
 to execute what also exists baku 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.970
 will ask us for permits we put that 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.840
 allow 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.100
 although although we were talking he says 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.100
 patrick bach 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.040
 existing installed where it says rector 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.270
 okay 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.330
 and here we stretch nothing leaves just like 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.819
 it is and we go up 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.430
 and that's where you start the one that is 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.289
 the installation of these files the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.360
 titanium so that to be able to solve 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.610
 all the problems and have everything to 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.990
 public ok ok 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.290
 we wait for it to be installed 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.540
 the phone a little bit and we have there 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.960
 we just started our 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.960
 terminal 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.409
 and I'll be back when I'm already 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.050

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.479
 and well in our terminal already started 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.089
 and as you can see and here it appears 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.830
 this with this wallpaper background that 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.599
 place in what is the archives of 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.919
 titanium 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.050
 and as you can see we already have what it is 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:23.080
 our notification bar now 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.639
 all will position us all right ok 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.039

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.419
 excellent and you already configure what 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.419
 it is quietly already your wifi 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:37.090
 everything already already 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.760

 google pay 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.620

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.620
 I want to teach this also from the player 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.229

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.940
 Oscar for this job I like what I 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:02.890
 this is this east of the product 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.890
 for example I'm going to put a music 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.669
 and now we see 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.039
 let's what is the configuration and 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.540
 we are going to put what is in the 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:18.080
 lock screen 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.560
 I'm going to put a widget that looks super 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.560
 Super good 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.979
 and we block it 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:43.460
 is very striking I was super bacano yes and 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:46.420
 if we give here fast that the music is 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.120
 change without needing 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:52.090
 no need to be returning another 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.680
 time to change it like that just with still 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:58.910
 a quick slide 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.910
 that change of music like that 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.870
 here 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.870
 eating changes the music fast 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.460
 a good environment and is doing something super 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.460
 maximum like this 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.610
