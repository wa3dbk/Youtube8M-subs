of January 2009 almost 11 a.m.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.580 
of January 2009 almost 11 a.m.
and<00:00:15.770> approximately<00:00:17.090> 27<00:00:18.090> degrees<00:00:18.420> outside<00:00:18.779> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
and approximately 27 degrees outside and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.310 
and approximately 27 degrees outside and
we're<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> take<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.150> little<00:00:21.779> look<00:00:22.140> at

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
we're going to take a little look at

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.750 
we're going to take a little look at
Edgewater<00:00:23.330> Chicago<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:26.250> snow<00:00:26.519> that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
Edgewater Chicago and the snow that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.609 
Edgewater Chicago and the snow that
happens<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.330> falling<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.900> morning<00:00:27.960> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
happens to be falling this morning so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.000 
happens to be falling this morning so
off<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.760> go<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.840> snow<00:00:34.260> boots<00:00:34.469> will<00:00:34.770> be

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
off we go the snow boots will be

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.370 
off we go the snow boots will be
unnecessary<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.630> has<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:36.989> turned

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
unnecessary because it has not turned

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.950 
unnecessary because it has not turned
into<00:00:37.680> ice<00:00:38.690> yet<00:00:40.969> it<00:00:41.969> hasn't<00:00:42.180> gotten<00:00:42.540> warm

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
into ice yet it hasn't gotten warm

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.040 
into ice yet it hasn't gotten warm
enough<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.469> anything<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.340> melt<00:00:45.050> which

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
enough for anything to really melt which

00:00:46.050 --> 00:01:17.170 
enough for anything to really melt which
means<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.890> hasn't<00:00:47.129> gotten

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:31.340 

hey<00:01:20.659> morning<00:01:28.610> here<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:30.090> Kenmore<00:01:30.869> Street

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
hey morning here we have Kenmore Street

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
hey morning here we have Kenmore Street
I<00:01:36.500> don't<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.740> snowfall<00:01:38.220> itself<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I don't think the snowfall itself is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.529 
I don't think the snowfall itself is
terribly<00:01:39.450> happy<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.490> there's<00:01:41.490> definitely<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
terribly happy but there's definitely a

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.710 
terribly happy but there's definitely a
lot<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> wind<00:01:46.580> enough<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.789> cause<00:01:48.000> drifting<00:01:48.569> of

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
lot of wind enough to cause drifting of

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.679 
lot of wind enough to cause drifting of
snow<00:01:49.399> this<00:01:50.399> looks<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.819> it's<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.330> foot

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
snow this looks like it's about a foot

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.059 
snow this looks like it's about a foot
high<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:53.990> shovel<00:01:54.990> path<00:01:55.259> will<00:01:55.590> soon<00:01:55.860> be

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
high here the shovel path will soon be

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:40.729 
high here the shovel path will soon be
buried<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.479> distant<00:01:58.020> future

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:05:27.830 

next<00:02:46.439> morning<00:02:52.769> let's<00:02:53.769> go<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.340> lake

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.730 

how<00:05:28.830> do<00:05:28.889> you<00:05:28.980> like<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.280> snow<00:05:30.380> are<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:31.530> from

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
how do you like the snow are you from

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.520 
how do you like the snow are you from
here<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:35.550> terrible<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.389> you<00:05:37.200> think<00:05:37.410> it's

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
here so terrible that you think it's

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.780 
here so terrible that you think it's
gonna<00:05:37.650> be<00:05:37.830> bad<00:05:38.040> enough<00:05:38.280> that<00:05:38.490> there<00:05:38.669> will<00:05:38.760> be

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
gonna be bad enough that there will be

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:46.220 
gonna be bad enough that there will be
no<00:05:39.000> school<00:05:39.060> my<00:05:44.450> Chicago<00:05:45.450> moves<00:05:45.690> that's<00:05:45.990> for

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
no school my Chicago moves that's for

00:05:46.230 --> 00:06:26.330 
no school my Chicago moves that's for
sure<00:06:23.750> there's<00:06:24.750> a<00:06:24.900> little<00:06:25.410> can<00:06:26.010> you<00:06:26.100> see

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
sure there's a little can you see

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:37.880 
sure there's a little can you see
anything<00:06:26.610> I<00:06:29.780> guess<00:06:30.780> this<00:06:30.990> is<00:06:31.139> it<00:06:36.800> going<00:06:37.800> to

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
anything I guess this is it going to

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.110 
anything I guess this is it going to
stop<00:06:38.160> here<00:06:38.400> get<00:06:38.610> ready<00:06:38.850> for<00:06:39.150> the<00:06:39.570> second<00:06:39.900> half
