00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.140 
right now we get the rest filled in with
the<00:00:53.699> map<00:00:54.420> itself<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.110> follow<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:56.070> here

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
do is I attach the plane to the front of

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.210 
do is I attach the plane to the front of
the<00:01:06.540> device<00:01:06.690> this<00:01:07.080> works<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> Pope<00:01:07.620> on<00:01:07.800> iOS

the device this works the Pope on iOS
Android<00:01:08.610> systems<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:10.290> once<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.800> do<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
Android systems and once I do that I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
Android systems and once I do that I
take<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.270> plane<00:01:12.869> marker<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.770> scan<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.130> in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
take the plane marker and I scan it in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.800 
take the plane marker and I scan it in
front<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> plane<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> unlocks<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
front of the plane it unlocks and it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.940 
front of the plane it unlocks and it
knows<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:15.990> I've<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> show<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.830> to

knows that I've got the show going to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.100 
knows that I've got the show going to
the<00:01:17.070> zero<00:01:17.280> plane<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.360> once<00:01:18.600> I'm<00:01:18.780> happy<00:01:18.960> with

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the zero plane and once I'm happy with

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.640 
the zero plane and once I'm happy with
that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.430 
that
I<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.640> mounted<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> front<00:01:21.440> it'll

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
I get that mounted to the front it'll

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.550 
I get that mounted to the front it'll

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
line up the plane that's where I'm happy

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.920 
line up the plane that's where I'm happy
with<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
with it

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.540

and once I'm happy with it doesn't have

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.090 
and once I'm happy with it doesn't have
to<00:01:31.640> be<00:01:31.730> exactly<00:01:32.090> just<00:01:32.300> get<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.510> close<00:01:32.690> okay<00:01:33.500> now

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.120 
to be exactly just get it close okay now
I'm<00:01:34.250> flying<00:01:34.520> around<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:36.020> showroom<00:01:36.260> care

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.340 

and<00:01:40.580> what<00:01:41.000> we've<00:01:41.150> done<00:01:41.299> is<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:41.750> we<00:01:41.869> created<00:01:42.170> a

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and what we've done is that we created a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.170 
and what we've done is that we created a
an<00:01:43.009> environment<00:01:43.549> that<00:01:43.580> bridges<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.150> gap

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
an environment that bridges the gap

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.270 
an environment that bridges the gap
between<00:01:44.330> our<00:01:44.900> world<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.920> gaming<00:01:46.250> world

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
between our world and the gaming world

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.249 
between our world and the gaming world
so<00:01:46.759> I<00:01:46.820> say<00:01:46.970> put<00:01:47.180> some<00:01:47.210> clouds<00:01:47.540> in<00:01:47.750> there<00:01:47.900> yeah
