00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
replacement for my moisturizer at the

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.860 
replacement for my moisturizer at the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
not repurchase this product I think it's

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.250 
not repurchase this product I think it's
not<00:04:34.090> really<00:04:34.720> worth<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:36.100> price<00:04:36.340> even<00:04:36.820> if<00:04:36.910> it's

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
not really worth the price even if it's

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.570 
not really worth the price even if it's
affordable<00:04:38.260> it's<00:04:38.530> really<00:04:38.950> not<00:04:39.070> worth<00:04:39.280> buying

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
affordable it's really not worth buying

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.340 
affordable it's really not worth buying
because<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:39.910> doesn't<00:04:40.390> really<00:04:40.540> offer<00:04:40.780> anything
