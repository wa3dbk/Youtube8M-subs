00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
now for a size comparison here's next to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.949 
now for a size comparison here's next to
moberly<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.150> I'd<00:02:12.239> say<00:02:12.510> that's<00:02:12.690> about

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
moberly and I'd say that's about

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.030 
moberly and I'd say that's about
accurate

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
accurate

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.100 
accurate
yeah<00:02:14.189> from<00:02:14.459> what<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.640> saw<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.329> mean<00:02:15.629> they're<00:02:15.930> not

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
yeah from what I saw I mean they're not

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.949 
yeah from what I saw I mean they're not
much<00:02:16.290> bigger<00:02:16.560> than<00:02:16.739> cars<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.269> that's<00:02:18.599> assume

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
much bigger than cars so that's assume

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.929 
much bigger than cars so that's assume
that's<00:02:19.170> about<00:02:19.439> accurate<00:02:19.859> scale<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.370> mean<00:02:20.909> just

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
that's about accurate scale I mean just

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.280 
that's about accurate scale I mean just
for<00:02:21.209> fun<00:02:22.189> here<00:02:23.189> is<00:02:23.310> next<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:24.140> revenge<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.230> the

the most poseable figure

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.310 
the most poseable figure
still<00:06:40.330> just<00:06:41.050> a<00:06:41.200> really<00:06:41.680> really<00:06:41.950> really<00:06:42.220> cool

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320

representation<00:06:44.320> of<00:06:44.440> long-haul<00:06:44.950> I<00:06:45.010> would<00:06:45.490> have

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
representation of long-haul I would have

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.170

preferred<00:06:45.730> a<00:06:46.530> leader<00:06:47.530> class<00:06:47.860> figure<00:06:48.150> like<00:06:49.150> a

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
preferred a leader class figure like a

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.960 
preferred a leader class figure like a
lot<00:06:49.450> of<00:06:49.480> people<00:06:49.750> I<00:06:49.990> think<00:06:50.050> JT<00:06:50.440> Mitchell<00:06:51.070> said

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
lot of people I think JT Mitchell said

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.380 
lot of people I think JT Mitchell said
that<00:06:52.240> he<00:06:52.480> wanted<00:06:53.080> a<00:06:53.730> leader<00:06:54.730> class<00:06:54.940> figure<00:06:55.000> but

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
that he wanted a leader class figure but

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.180 
that he wanted a leader class figure but
I'm<00:06:55.720> happy<00:06:55.990> with<00:06:56.260> the<00:06:56.380> Voyager<00:06:56.560> I'm<00:06:56.980> it's<00:06:57.130> a

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
I'm happy with the Voyager I'm it's a

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.640 
I'm happy with the Voyager I'm it's a
fairly<00:06:57.460> decent<00:06:57.900> figure<00:06:58.900> it<00:06:59.320> does<00:06:59.440> have<00:06:59.590> a

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
fairly decent figure it does have a

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.590 
fairly decent figure it does have a

little clear plastic swords up about

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.280

looks better black or orange um I

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.240 
looks better black or orange um I
usually<00:07:19.720> don't<00:07:19.870> leave<00:07:20.140> the<00:07:20.410> panel's<00:07:21.070> like

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
usually don't leave the panel's like

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.300 
usually don't leave the panel's like
that<00:07:21.430> I<00:07:21.460> usually<00:07:21.850> flip<00:07:22.120> them<00:07:22.360> so<00:07:23.140> they're<00:07:23.380> kind

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
that I usually flip them so they're kind

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.409 
that I usually flip them so they're kind
of<00:07:24.640> showing<00:07:25.919> the<00:07:26.919> panels<00:07:27.400> on<00:07:27.520> the<00:07:27.640> inside<00:07:28.060> but

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:28.419 
of showing the panels on the inside but

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.060 
of showing the panels on the inside but
kind<00:07:28.690> of<00:07:28.810> not<00:07:28.870> um<00:07:29.320> I<00:07:29.440> think<00:07:29.470> it<00:07:29.710> looks<00:07:29.890> really

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.070 
kind of not um I think it looks really

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.950 
kind of not um I think it looks really
neat<00:07:30.840> again<00:07:31.840> for<00:07:32.050> a<00:07:32.110> size<00:07:32.320> comparison<00:07:33.960> there

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
neat again for a size comparison there

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.080 
neat again for a size comparison there
is<00:07:35.080> next<00:07:35.380> to<00:07:35.440> bumble<00:07:35.770> see<00:07:35.980> so<00:07:36.340> he<00:07:36.520> he's<00:07:37.060> a

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
is next to bumble see so he he's a

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.720 
is next to bumble see so he he's a
really<00:07:37.720> tall<00:07:37.930> figure<00:07:38.350> on<00:07:38.680> he<00:07:38.860> really<00:07:39.130> compacts

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:39.730 
really tall figure on he really compacts

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.560 
really tall figure on he really compacts
really<00:07:40.330> well<00:07:40.540> I'm<00:07:40.810> really<00:07:41.550> really<00:07:42.550> happy<00:07:43.210> that

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:43.570 
really well I'm really really happy that

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.880 
really well I'm really really happy that
that<00:07:43.690> happens<00:07:44.169> because<00:07:44.350> you<00:07:44.560> really<00:07:44.830> can't

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:44.890 
that happens because you really can't

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.100 
that happens because you really can't
tell<00:07:45.130> what<00:07:45.820> size<00:07:46.060> he's<00:07:46.270> going<00:07:46.419> to<00:07:46.479> be<00:07:46.660> from<00:07:46.930> his

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.110 
tell what size he's going to be from his

fellow<00:07:49.990> Constructicons<00:07:50.710> mixmaster<00:07:52.770> so<00:07:53.770> um<00:07:54.040> I

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 
fellow Constructicons mixmaster so um I

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.070 
fellow Constructicons mixmaster so um I
I<00:07:54.400> think<00:07:54.850> that'd<00:07:54.970> be<00:07:55.150> about<00:07:55.540> accurate<00:07:56.470> scale

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 
I think that'd be about accurate scale

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.840 
I think that'd be about accurate scale
mixmaster<00:07:59.080> is<00:07:59.830> supposedly<00:08:00.340> as<00:08:00.580> tall's

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:00.850

about<00:08:04.060> as<00:08:04.210> tall<00:08:04.450> as<00:08:04.600> mixmaster<00:08:05.229> I<00:08:05.260> think<00:08:05.740> I

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 
about as tall as mixmaster I think I

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.230 
about as tall as mixmaster I think I
