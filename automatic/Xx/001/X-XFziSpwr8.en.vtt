Spyro<00:02:28.790> had<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> bunch<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.200> games<00:02:30.380> his<00:02:30.740> e<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.250> a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
Spyro had a bunch of games his e is a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.250 
Spyro had a bunch of games his e is a
little<00:02:31.580> holographic<00:02:32.210> cover<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.960> for<00:02:33.170> I

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
little holographic cover this is for I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.810 
little holographic cover this is for I
think<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.980> year<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.340> dragon<00:02:34.700> yeah

think this is this year the dragon yeah
I<00:02:35.060> think<00:02:35.210> this<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.540> third<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.960> fourth
