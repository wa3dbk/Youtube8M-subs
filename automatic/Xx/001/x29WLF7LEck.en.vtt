out<00:05:40.420> in<00:05:40.600> America<00:05:40.930> so<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:41.170> makes<00:05:41.380> more<00:05:41.530> sense

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
out in America so that makes more sense

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.280 
out in America so that makes more sense
I<00:05:41.980> suppose<00:05:42.250> but<00:05:42.910> yeah<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.330> seems<00:05:43.570> to<00:05:43.780> just<00:05:43.990> kind

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
I suppose but yeah it seems to just kind

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.440 
I suppose but yeah it seems to just kind
of<00:05:44.350> speak<00:05:45.250> to<00:05:45.400> everyone<00:05:45.760> in<00:05:45.850> some<00:05:46.060> way<00:05:46.210> no

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
of speak to everyone in some way no

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.900 
of speak to everyone in some way no
matter<00:05:46.600> what<00:05:46.810> country<00:05:47.020> no<00:05:47.350> matter<00:05:47.500> what<00:05:47.650> place

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
matter what country no matter what place

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.090 
matter what country no matter what place
so<00:05:48.910> yeah<00:05:49.120> I<00:05:49.390> think<00:05:50.260> it's<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.620> balance<00:05:50.800> between

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
so yeah I think it's a balance between

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.800 
so yeah I think it's a balance between
both<00:05:51.430> I<00:05:51.670> mean<00:05:51.820> it's<00:05:51.970> definitely<00:05:52.390> an<00:05:52.510> art<00:05:52.630> form

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
both I mean it's definitely an art form

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.420 
both I mean it's definitely an art form
