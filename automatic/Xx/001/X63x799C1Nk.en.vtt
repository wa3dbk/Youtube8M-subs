go for this gameplay and the subsequent
games<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.790> rushing<00:00:42.030> around

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
games to this I was rushing around

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.170 
games to this I was rushing around
getting<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.010> lot<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> kills<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.760> getting<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> lot

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
getting a lot of kills but getting a lot

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.400 
getting a lot of kills but getting a lot
of<00:00:45.210> hit<00:00:45.450> markers<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> lot<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.140> death

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
of hit markers and a lot of death

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
of hit markers and a lot of death
because<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.010> run<00:00:47.250> straight<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
because if you run straight up so on I

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.090 
because if you run straight up so on I
mean<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.780> distance<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.440> safe<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.950> get<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
mean at this distance is safe you get a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
mean at this distance is safe you get a
hitmarker<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.149> end<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> world

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
hitmarker it's not the end of the world

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.750 
hitmarker it's not the end of the world
at<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.440> distance<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> bit<00:00:53.610> risky

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
at this distance here it's a bit risky

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
at this distance here it's a bit risky
if<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> hitmarker<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.960> ring<00:00:55.170> you're

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
if you get a hitmarker that ring you're

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.130 
if you get a hitmarker that ring you're
probably<00:00:55.620> gonna<00:00:55.980> die<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.840> lucky<00:00:57.960> that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
probably gonna die so I was lucky that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.660 
probably gonna die so I was lucky that
hitting<00:00:58.469> before<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> could<00:00:59.100> kill<00:00:59.280> him<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.489> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
hitting before I could kill him on that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
hitting before I could kill him on that
shot<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.420> hadn't<00:01:01.050> actually<00:01:01.199> killed<00:01:01.559> him

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
shot but if I hadn't actually killed him

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.549 
shot but if I hadn't actually killed him
on<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.890> shot<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.219> would<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.489> me<00:01:02.670> dead<00:01:03.559> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
on that shot that would be me dead so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.719 
on that shot that would be me dead so
basically<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.400> playing<00:01:05.610> really

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
basically I was playing really

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.429 
basically I was playing really
aggressively<00:01:05.880> getting<00:01:06.720> stressed<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.170> rage

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
aggressively getting stressed out rage

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.440 
aggressively getting stressed out rage
quitting<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.490> stream<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:09.000> said<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.180> me

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
quitting and the stream just said to me

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.810 
quitting and the stream just said to me
they<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.500> put<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> chart<00:01:11.100> Vic<00:01:11.400> slow<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
they just put in the chart Vic slow it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.580 
they just put in the chart Vic slow it
down<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.450> play<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> little<00:01:12.900> less<00:01:13.110> aggressively

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
down and play a little less aggressively

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.170 
down and play a little less aggressively
and<00:01:14.010> you'll<00:01:14.280> probably<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.760> better<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.119> be

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and you'll probably do better and be

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.630 
and you'll probably do better and be
less<00:01:15.450> likely<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> rage<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:17.009> first<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.520> was

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
less likely to rage and at first I was

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
less likely to rage and at first I was
like<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.540> entertaining<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
like but would that be entertaining to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.719 
like but would that be entertaining to
play<00:01:19.500> would<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.040> entertaining<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> watch

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
play would that be entertaining to watch

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.660 
play would that be entertaining to watch
and<00:01:21.240> actually<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.950> mean<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and actually I think it is I mean you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.980 
and actually I think it is I mean you
guys<00:01:23.820> will<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.240> let<00:01:24.330> me<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.900> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
guys will have to let me know what you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
guys will have to let me know what you
think<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> me<00:01:25.770> being<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.189> lot

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
think because this is me being a lot

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
think because this is me being a lot
less<00:01:26.729> aggressive<00:01:27.360> than<00:01:27.390> usual<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.350> actually

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
less aggressive than usual and actually

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.870 
less aggressive than usual and actually
I<00:01:28.680> did<00:01:28.799> quite<00:01:29.040> enjoy<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.759> was

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
I did quite enjoy it because I was

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
I did quite enjoy it because I was
trying<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.270> play<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> bit<00:01:30.659> more<00:01:30.840> strategically

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
trying to play a bit more strategically

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.530 
trying to play a bit more strategically
and<00:01:31.710> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.070> work<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.820> where<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.060> enemy

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and kind of work out where the enemy

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.200 
and kind of work out where the enemy
were<00:01:33.689> before<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.290> charging<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.280> blindly<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
were before just charging in blindly and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.749 
were before just charging in blindly and
I'm<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.380> sure<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.890> tactics<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.640> be

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
I'm not sure the tactics are gonna be

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.249 
I'm not sure the tactics are gonna be
apparent<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:39.960> what

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
apparent but that's not actually what
