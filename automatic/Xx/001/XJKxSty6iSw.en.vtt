00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.680
 we share a few minutes of your time 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.290
 with a mariano me marÃ­n pupil of the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.030
 last course that returns to oviedo to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.710
 collect the excellence award 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 academic and personal growth of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.570
 2014 course with the Ferris wheel how is it now 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.789
 very well very happy to be here the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.699
 first time 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.399
 you came to imagine your departure from a 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.989
 average record of approving a scheme 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:31.429
 that you could reach 82 never ever 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.010
 I would have imagined that I could have 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.949
 get to get this number done in 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.780
 the preparation was not going the way of 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.750
 get this number was the day of 1000 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.140
 I did a very good exam and nothing very 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.030
 happy to have gotten it from 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.240
 be here that I've spent all 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.610
 story later and it's already 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.030
 what advice would you give to colleagues who 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 conditions start similar to you and that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 they think it's superior and I want to reach 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 the eyes then do not worry because 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.850
 I also thought about it and if you can 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.540
 be that if you work hard if you are 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 constant and if also that day you have a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.210
 bit of luck the classes go like 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.170
 they have to go to the end the results 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.659
 come out 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.440
 that they always think that it is possible 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.300
 what 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.460
 they will not get anything thinking that they do not 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.320
 they're going to get to that for sure at least if 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.290
 they think they can have a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.910
 opportunity to ask 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.830
 which do you think is the most 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.210
 distinctive 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.210
 in asturias the diademas 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.670
 to me the classes about everything is me is a 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.220
 of the things with which the scientology 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.130
 this course because I needed classes 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.900
 every day because I am a little person 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 constant in that sense and then 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.740
 I needed a follow-up guideline 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.390
 much more active than in other academies 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.630
 and I have been helped a lot by the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.940
 teachers every day that every day 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.490
 learn things that you notice that make you 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.560
 laugh you have a good time with people this 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.260
 for me it has been basic because I for 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.630
 example at half past six or so 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.990
 when we all stopped to go to 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.720
 class that was the worst moment of the day since 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.960
 I was already tired and just many hours and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.240
 for me going to class was to disconnect another 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.400
 new thing leave the book apart from 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.740
 being with people was great 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.080
 I loved going to class I think that in the 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.540
 career had not done much but 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.820
 you have done the course in the series of 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.850
 barcelona and it has been good experience 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.360

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.660
 I think I've been here in oviedo for 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.120
 compare but I do not think there are big 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.660
 differences between 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:09.270
 - with the audiovisual visual theme , let's say 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.270
 perfect finish so they do not 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.099
 took me to start the square that has 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.170
 It was a hard time and I wanted to have 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.700
 been great then the people that I have 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.129

 you thought you were impossible 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.280
