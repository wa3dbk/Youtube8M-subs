00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.619
 world- famous dishes and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.049
 plus one of my favorite foods I 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.000
 I will teach how I do it based on 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.359
 an authentic recipe for a standard 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.810

 salt and pepper pepper 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.240
 let's start with the filling and to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.030
 we start preparing the vegetables 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.850
 peel the onion and chop it well 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.880
 we peel the carrots and the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.340
 cut into small dice and remove 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.910
 the strands of the celery branches and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.030
 we cut also very finite we put a 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.979
 pot big on fire add a little 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.440
 of olive oil and when 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.630
 hot and we toss the chopped onion 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.790
 We're going to sautÃ© it for a few minutes 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.250
 until it's really soft 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.160
 then we incorporate the carrot and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.010
 chopped celery and we're going to sautÃ© everything 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.390
 together for about 15 minutes 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.340
 we incorporate the 100 grams of bacon 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.250
 that will give a great touch to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.910
 our fill we raise the fire and what 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.190
 let's fry for a minute 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.370
 add the minced meat and start 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.410
 stir until it changes color 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.360
 then add the glass of milk and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.670
 let's let it boil 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.950
 until all the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.930
 liquid we can remove a little bit to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.380
 that all the meat is soaked 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.740
 we add a glass of white wine 800 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.890
 grams of natural tomato crushed 400 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 grams of fried tomato mix well 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.700
 everything and we throw a little salt and a little 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.530
 of black pepper to our liking 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.260
 we lower the fire to the minimum and we are going to 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.020
 let cook for 2 hours so that it 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.030
 intensify the flavors if during the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.260
 cooking will stay a little dry 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.840
 we can add 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.659
 a little water look what look more 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.440
 rich in homemade salsa once we have it 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.690
 done away from the fire and reserve 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.280
 and now we go with the bechamel and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.620
 I told in a video how I do a 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.150
 easy bechamel quick and without lumps but 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.610
 in case you have not seen it, we are going to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.790
 go over it, put it in a pot over the fire 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.560
 half onion we add a sheet of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.290
 laurel that we left a little bit so that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.090
 give more flavor and a clove the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.870
 You can also click on the nail 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.490
 onion we add a liter of milk and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.710
 let's leave the fire until 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.300
 start to boil at that time 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.900
 remove from the heat and let stand 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.150
 for 15 minutes we put a casserole 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.400
 to the fire we add 80 grams of 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.640
 butter and let's stir until 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.890
 it melts we incorporate 80 grams of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.810
 flour and for a couple of minutes 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.720
 we will be stirring so that the flour 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.960
 lose the raw flavor we separate from the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.970
 fire we incorporate hot milk 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.640
 straining it and we're going to stir until 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.650
 is well dissolved we take back to the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.330
 fire and we will catch it non-stop 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.030
 stir for 3 minutes 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.060
 and we have our delicious bechamel 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.580
 that always comes out perfect we add a 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.990
 little salt black pepper and walnut 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.340
 Moscada to our liking and we reserve 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.990
 we prepare the lasagna plates as 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.360
 indicates the manufacturer in the package 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.070
 boiling them in boiling water or 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.820
 putting them in water for a few minutes 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.440
 hot if you use pre-cooked pasta 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.600
 Once cooked, we take them out on the 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.630
 absorbent paper to remove the excess 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.210
 of water and we only have to mount the 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.840
 lasagna let's use a good source 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.930
 big 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.640
 We started by putting a little filling 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.920
 we do this because if we started with 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.980
 the pasta could stick to the source 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.160
 we place a layer of plates of 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.280
 lasagna another layer of filling another of 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.970
 lasagna plates another filling and so on 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.590
 until ending with a filling layer 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.200
 pour all the bechamel sauce 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.110
 on top and sprinkle with cheese 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.140
 freshly grated parmesan and we're going to 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.740
 put in the preheated oven at 180 degrees 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.979
 with heat 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.080
 up and down for 30 minutes or 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.410
 until we see that the bechamel begins 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.840
 to bubble if it seems necessary in the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.580
 last moment you can put it a little bit 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.400
 gratin so that it browns in the 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.460
 surface and we already have our 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.160
 delicious homemade lasagna is a little 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.990
 laborious but it has been very easy to 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.610
 do and I assure you that you will love it 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.009
 to the whole world 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.470
 is an authentic lasagna from hunan 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.349
 I hope you try it because I do not 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.599
 you will do another one, nothing else 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.830
 I hope he prepares it and if you succeed with it 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.830
 a little kiss
