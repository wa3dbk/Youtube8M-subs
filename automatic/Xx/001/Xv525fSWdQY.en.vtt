00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
gives you a picture of how to put it on
in<00:00:51.420> some<00:00:51.600> instructions<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.520> only

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
in some instructions it's the only

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.779 
in some instructions it's the only
downfall<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.719> packaging<00:00:55.379> itself<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
downfall of the packaging itself is the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.160 
downfall of the packaging itself is the
instructions<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.510> came<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.109> very

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
instructions that came with it's very

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.840 
instructions that came with it's very
dim<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.949> actually<00:00:59.070> did<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> use

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
dim so if you actually did have to use

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.799 
dim so if you actually did have to use
the<00:00:59.969> instructions<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.660> very

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the instructions it's very

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.380 
the instructions it's very
self-explanatory<00:01:01.370> personally<00:01:02.370> i<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:02.489> but

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
self-explanatory personally i think but

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.840 
self-explanatory personally i think but
um<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.530> did<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.250> wouldn't<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.549> able<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
um if you did you wouldn't be able to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.080 
um if you did you wouldn't be able to
read<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.119> very<00:01:06.360> well<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.520> let's<00:01:08.760> open

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
read them very well and so let's open

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.390 
read them very well and so let's open
this<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> basically<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:13.890> comes<00:01:14.220> in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
this up so basically it just comes in

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.080 
this up so basically it just comes in
two<00:01:14.610> pieces<00:01:15.740> top<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> bottom<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.759> comes<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
two pieces top a bottom and it comes to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.990 
two pieces top a bottom and it comes to
the<00:01:18.180> keyboard<00:01:18.600> cover<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.430> i'll<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the keyboard cover and i'll get back to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
the keyboard cover and i'll get back to
the<00:01:21.060> keyboard<00:01:21.240> cover<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> bottom<00:01:22.560> it's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the keyboard cover so the bottom it's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
the keyboard cover so the bottom it's
pretty<00:01:23.640> smooth<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.049> plastic

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
pretty smooth it's just plastic

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.140 
pretty smooth it's just plastic
basically<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.920> frosted<00:01:28.920> paint<00:01:29.610> cover<00:01:29.909> on

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
basically with a frosted paint cover on

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
basically with a frosted paint cover on
the<00:01:30.329> outside<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.920> lot<00:01:32.070> more

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the outside so that it's a lot more

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
the outside so that it's a lot more
smoother<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> inside<00:01:34.380> it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
smoother there as to on the inside it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.060 
smoother there as to on the inside it's
just<00:01:34.740> regular<00:01:34.950> hard<00:01:35.369> plastic<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.920> same<00:01:37.920> as

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
just regular hard plastic and same as

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.789 
just regular hard plastic and same as
the<00:01:38.220> top<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:42.180> frosted<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.409> apple<00:01:43.770> logo

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the top it is frosted so the apple logo

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.639 
the top it is frosted so the apple logo
will<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.579> able<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.149> shine<00:01:45.869> through<00:01:45.930> like

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
will be able to shine through like

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.120 
will be able to shine through like
you'll<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.820> little<00:01:47.939> bit<00:01:48.619> but<00:01:49.619> it's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you'll see in a little bit but it's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.700 
you'll see in a little bit but it's
pretty<00:01:50.280> smooth<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:51.030> i<00:01:51.439> would<00:01:52.439> suggest

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
pretty smooth it's i would suggest

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.880 
pretty smooth it's i would suggest
cleaning<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.899> frosted

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
cleaning it but so there it is frosted

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.980 
cleaning it but so there it is frosted
and<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.189> apple<00:01:56.790> logo<00:01:56.880> seems<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:57.750> through

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
and all apple logo seems right through

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.590 
and all apple logo seems right through
it<00:01:58.310> no<00:01:59.310> sticker<00:01:59.610> dated<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.850> went<00:02:03.450> on

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it no sticker dated and it it went on

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.100 
it no sticker dated and it it went on
quite<00:02:04.079> easily<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:05.310> staying<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.540> well<00:02:06.630> i

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
quite easily it's staying on very well i

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.729 
quite easily it's staying on very well i
like<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> lot<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.509> for<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> keyboard<00:02:10.379> cover

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
like it a lot as for the keyboard cover

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.680 
like it a lot as for the keyboard cover
i<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:11.940> it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
i do not like it

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.230 
i do not like it
a<00:02:12.720> really<00:02:13.200> strong<00:02:14.150> latex<00:02:15.150> feel<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:17.400> is

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
a really strong latex feel and it is

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.110 
a really strong latex feel and it is
just<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:19.520> doesn't<00:02:20.520> stick<00:02:21.060> well<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.560> keys

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
just it doesn't stick well on the keys

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.720 
just it doesn't stick well on the keys
it<00:02:24.120> moves<00:02:24.510> around<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.190> doesn't<00:02:26.550> feel

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
it moves around and it just doesn't feel

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.080 
it moves around and it just doesn't feel
right<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.420> ended<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:27.960> going<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.590> buying<00:02:28.770> a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
right so I ended up going and buying a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.320 
right so I ended up going and buying a
silicone<00:02:30.090> version<00:02:30.630> instead<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.940> fits<00:02:33.180> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
silicone version instead and it fits a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.390 
silicone version instead and it fits a
silicone<00:02:34.140> version<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.710> went<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.220> bought

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
silicone version that I went and bought

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.150 
silicone version that I went and bought
