00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 this is a shock absorber we are 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.290
 inside the speed up box of los e 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.200
 we have a gentleman beside us who 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.260
 will explain exactly how it works 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.720
 this contraption we call a gadget is not 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.369
 ugly the suspension which is a part 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.080
 very important for setting it up 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.420
 rio to show at home how it works 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.359
 and how I built I did it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 made the spring make a transparent one 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.570
 obviously there is no more here 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.040
 see these two tanks that of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.930
 they are obviously made of metal 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.559
 then here we have the grommet for the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.079
 rod and inside mechanical pad 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.670
 of the cylinder there is the piston this eagle 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.350
 counter spring that serves when 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 practically detached you see 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.110
 raise their per position 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.309
 the braking action to try to hold 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.329
 pressed as far as possible to the wheel 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.059
 to the ground 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.860
 here is the oil when we go to do 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.090
 work the suspension then the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.010
 let's get down 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.620
 the oil compressed by this area passes 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.449
 through the valves these valves of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.870
 regulation and comes into the tank of the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.760
 gas 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.369
 what happens now you do it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.799
 you see how pushing you see it 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.689
 practically shifts the oil that arrives 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.189
 here this cylinder moves and behind it 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.820
 the gas that impression serves as not 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.350
 make him dine this movement here decides 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.479
 the extension speed of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.450
 compression then closing these 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.650
 valves plus the hole is small plus time 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.119
 it takes to go to one side 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.500
 the other plus the suspension of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.689
 will be hard 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.430
 an advice when this movement is 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.409
 slow means that the suspension has 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.060
 a controlled extension and you have more 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.369
 grip, however, the bike becomes more difficult 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.350
 in variants this may perhaps use it 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.119
 even a home when this one 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 movement is faster 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.810
 the bike becomes much more manageable 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.430
 in the variants of follow more however the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.380
 barriers on the rear tire of a bar 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.119
 to decrease then you will have less grip 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.770
 these are the adjustments that then in 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.259
 practice go and look for even the most 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.780
 this is because the suspension ie 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.119
 this is essentially a suspension from 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.880
 race but in fact the suspension is 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.860
 almost the same is true of almost all motorcycles 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.130
 including even those of the motogp will have 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.750
 a minimal difference you are maybe 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.789
 however, the concept of the different dials 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.920
 in his season they are all identical 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.140
 indeed almost all the bikes 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.180
 especially the sports ones at home are 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.280
 almost practically so 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.959
 have the possibility of adjustments 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.560
 manuals then you too with a 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.930
 screwdriver 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.569
 you can have fun closing them open 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.690
 these valves and you will still see some 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.430
 I repeat especially enormous differences 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.049
 in stability and speed 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.660
 that the bike has in following yours 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.709
 movements, however, have been dyed above all 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.299
 maybe there is another possibility 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.150
 feel someone qualified to meet you 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:44.099
 can give the cousins ​​good enough 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.099
