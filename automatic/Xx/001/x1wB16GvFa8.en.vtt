00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.040
 Yes everyone is hello or thank courtesy effect is to talk about the vehicle sense 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.820
 You will receive 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.269
 Everyone on whether you are able to run in the middle of the road on a daily basis 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:20.940
 Aren't you running in the middle of your own lane? 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:25.420
 I think I'm driving while being conscious, but the vehicle sense is friend 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:29.440
 I would like you to be aware of something different 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.110
 It is when you start say that running in the middle of the road 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:38.510
 For example, to the opposite lane 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.320
 If the car comes from the other side, the road is quite barely 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.130
 At this time what about 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:51.489
 I want you to be aware of the vehicle feeling 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:55.530
 As soon as you notice when you say the car comes from over there, as soon as possible 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:01:01.240
 Or movable his opponent and the operative value falls 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:05.100
 I think that you want to make a judgment here 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:09.509
 Is the person who is not accustomed operation that is not accustomed to rough it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.360
 I was embarrassed that the car came from the other side 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.920
 I wonder if it's because I can pass through, but the time gets shorter and shorter, but I'm passing away to another place 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.900
 Will come 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.600
 I think that there are a lot of things, but in the moment I realize that 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.659
 Can you decide if you can pass each other? 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:38.750
 It is said whether it can be done at the position of the cheek 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:39.860
 You have a sense of whether you can go home from here from a distance 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.070
 I think 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:50.950
 When you get used to driving, you will be able to do this naturally 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.060
 Before I get used to it, I think there are a lot of things going on while getting lost 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.900
 Though 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:03.330
 Consciousness with that quickly to determine whether the hand is the stomach and 3 with're for roads 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.330
 You and I this is the We 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.330
 When each other is approaching 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:18.880
 You will be able to pass each other safely in this position 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 I will also make a decision at the moment of awareness as a way of holding consciousness at this point- 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.260
 If you decide that you should pass each other 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:34.520
 And devoted to the fact that it all kinds of spirits and goblins sale is in the next 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.450
 If consciousness that Do not know if Do not be hitting stores in the case of while lost is the other side 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.920
 It is more of 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.790
 Although I think that consciousness on the right side of the car had gone 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:49.109
 Already at this point 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:50.660
 If you think that you can pass at the point where you notice , this distance will 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.170
 It can be used 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.650
 So make decisions on an individual basis rather than being lost 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:04.730
 I wonder also whether the Yongzheng Emperor 1 last hit 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:06.540
 As it is each other if you another really go in only the last of the harvest pass each other the moment is to say is 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.120
 I can do it 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.909
 Of consciousness that went so I though we are doing with nature out in this kind of thing Eemaa head 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.280
 If you can refer to it by all means 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.280
 It was day delivery day of the day more than I think
