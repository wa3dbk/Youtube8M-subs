about<00:00:07.590> MSV<00:00:08.099> 23<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.629> a<00:00:09.860> european-style

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
about MSV 23 this is a european-style

about MSV 23 this is a european-style
low<00:00:11.730> POC<00:00:12.120> clear<00:00:12.419> for<00:00:12.929> use<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.169> areas<00:00:13.410> that

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:13.499 
low POC clear for use in areas that

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.420 
low POC clear for use in areas that
require<00:00:13.650> less<00:00:14.099> than<00:00:14.339> 2.1<00:00:14.879> pounds<00:00:15.480> vo<00:00:15.629> see<00:00:16.430> but

require less than 2.1 pounds vo see but

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.620 
require less than 2.1 pounds vo see but
the<00:00:17.550> two-two-one<00:00:17.820> makes<00:00:18.120> room<00:00:18.240> ratio<00:00:18.510> of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the two-two-one makes room ratio of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.360 
the two-two-one makes room ratio of
course<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.990> mean<00:00:19.110> two<00:00:19.350> parts<00:00:19.680> clear<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.190> one

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
course we mean two parts clear to one

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.430 
course we mean two parts clear to one
part<00:00:20.610> harder<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.750> case<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.110> got<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> big

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
part harder so in this case we got a big

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.990 
part harder so in this case we got a big
can<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.620> clear<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.280> a<00:00:23.310> smaller<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.850> of

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
can of clear we got a smaller can of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.610 
can of clear we got a smaller can of
activator<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.840> we're<00:00:25.290> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> use<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.620 
activator and we're going to use a

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.040 
activator and we're going to use a
mixing<00:00:26.100> can<00:00:26.430> not<00:00:27.030> the<00:00:27.210> mixing<00:00:27.570> Cup<00:00:27.780> that<00:00:27.900> has

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
mixing can not the mixing Cup that has

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.180 
mixing can not the mixing Cup that has
the<00:00:28.170> numbers<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.530> the<00:00:28.620> side<00:00:28.770> like<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.100> do

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
the numbers on the side like we do

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.830 
the numbers on the side like we do
sometimes<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.910> whether<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.540> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.690> use

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
sometimes but whether we're going to use

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.079 
sometimes but whether we're going to use
a<00:00:30.870> can<00:00:31.200> it's<00:00:31.800> had<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:31.980> cop<00:00:32.250> cut<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:33.089 
a can it's had a cop cut out and the

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:34.520 
a can it's had a cop cut out and the
sides<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.480> straight<00:00:33.839> and<00:00:34.019> we're<00:00:34.230> also<00:00:34.350> going

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
sides are straight and we're also going

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.770 
sides are straight and we're also going
to<00:00:34.589> use<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> mixing<00:00:35.160> stick<00:00:35.399> from<00:00:35.850> matrix<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
to use the mixing stick from matrix that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
to use the mixing stick from matrix that
has<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.109> proper<00:00:37.440> ratios<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.550> we're

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
has the proper ratios on it so we're

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.709 
has the proper ratios on it so we're
going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> look<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.089> at<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> top<00:00:39.480> we're<00:00:39.629> going

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
going to look up at the top we're going

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.299 
going to look up at the top we're going
to<00:00:39.780> pick<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.109> two<00:00:40.289> to<00:00:40.409> one<00:00:40.589> part<00:00:40.829> right<00:00:41.010> here

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to pick the two to one part right here

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.189 
to pick the two to one part right here
we're<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.909> do<00:00:41.999> two<00:00:42.179> parts<00:00:42.539> clear<00:00:42.780> one

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
we're going to do two parts clear one

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.290 
we're going to do two parts clear one
part<00:00:43.440> activator<00:00:43.859> so<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.909> balance<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
part activator so if I can balance that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.889 
part activator so if I can balance that
thing<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.600> there

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
thing in there

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
thing in there
I<00:00:45.929> grab<00:00:46.319> the<00:00:46.350> clear<00:00:46.679> and<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.339> I'm<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.519> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I grab the clear and then I'm going to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.919 
I grab the clear and then I'm going to
pick<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> number<00:00:47.969> depending<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:48.809> much

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
pick a number depending on how much

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.809 
pick a number depending on how much
clear<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.429> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> pick<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:50.819 
clear that I want I'm going to pick a

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:53.119 
clear that I want I'm going to pick a
number<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> first<00:00:51.480> column<00:00:51.659> now<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.829> want<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
number in the first column now I want to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.189 
number in the first column now I want to
stop<00:00:53.339> as<00:00:53.819> close<00:00:54.089> to<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> number<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.629> practical

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
stop as close to the number is practical

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.559 
stop as close to the number is practical
but<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.769> I<00:00:55.859> go<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> column<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.179> on<00:00:57.359> the

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
but if I go with a column that is on the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.200 
but if I go with a column that is on the
far<00:00:57.960> left<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.460> case<00:00:59.699> I'm<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
far left like in this case I'm going to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.790 
far left like in this case I'm going to
pour<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.929> six<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.409> stop<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> little

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
pour it up to the six I stop a little

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.410 
pour it up to the six I stop a little
short<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.219> show<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.999> I'm<00:01:03.089> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.269> pour

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
short to show you but I'm going to pour

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.939 
short to show you but I'm going to pour
it<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> six<00:01:04.080> okay<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
it up to the six okay so I'm going to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.530 
it up to the six okay so I'm going to
stop<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.149> grab<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
stop then I'm going to grab the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
stop then I'm going to grab the
activator<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:07.860> looking<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
activator and then I'm looking for that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
activator and then I'm looking for that
six<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.149> second<00:01:09.630> column<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.469> going<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
six in the second column that's going to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.200 
six in the second column that's going to
give<00:01:10.920> me<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.130> right<00:01:11.310> two<00:01:11.579> to<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.850> mixing

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
give me the right two to one mixing

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.219 
give me the right two to one mixing
ratio<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:14.219> do<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.630> grab<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> hardener<00:01:15.990> camp

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
ratio so to do that grab a hardener camp

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.830 
ratio so to do that grab a hardener camp
put<00:01:17.039> it<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> pour<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.719> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
put it in there and pour it up to the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.060 
put it in there and pour it up to the
six<00:01:23.090> when<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.420> done<00:01:24.719> a<00:01:25.049> very<00:01:25.860> very

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
six when that is done a very very

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.469 
six when that is done a very very
important<00:01:26.460> thing<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.090> stressed

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
important thing and it's not stressed

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.670 
important thing and it's not stressed
enough<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.899> lot<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.170> instructional

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
enough and a lot of instructional

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.700

flowing coat and you notice I'm staying
within<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.440> range<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.010> fan<00:02:59.220> looks<00:02:59.460> good<00:02:59.670> as<00:02:59.820> I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
within the range the fan looks good as I

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.480 
within the range the fan looks good as I
did<00:03:00.000> my<00:03:00.210> test<00:03:00.480> pattern<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.770> single<00:03:02.100> flowing

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
did my test pattern so a single flowing

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.150 
did my test pattern so a single flowing
coat<00:03:02.670> will<00:03:03.360> yield<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.810> nice<00:03:03.990> flowing<00:03:04.290> coat<00:03:04.620> if

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
coat will yield a nice flowing coat if

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.080 
coat will yield a nice flowing coat if
it's<00:03:05.370> too<00:03:05.550> far<00:03:05.790> away

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
it's too far away

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.240 
it's too far away

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
too close the gun isn't operating well

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.970 
too close the gun isn't operating well
it's<00:03:08.490> going<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.880> behave<00:03:09.060> poorly<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:10.290> it

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
it's going to behave poorly but it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.800 
it's going to behave poorly but it
should<00:03:11.220> yield<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.880> nice<00:03:12.030> beautiful<00:03:12.330> coat<00:03:12.630> just

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
should yield a nice beautiful coat just

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.740 
should yield a nice beautiful coat just
like<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:17.570> okay
