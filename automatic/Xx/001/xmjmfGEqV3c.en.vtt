goaltender okay and I know he is look he
has<00:01:23.159> 19<00:01:23.850> wins<00:01:24.119> he's<00:01:24.509> 16<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> league<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.009> his

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
has 19 wins he's 16 in the league so his

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.660 
has 19 wins he's 16 in the league so his
wins<00:01:26.400> are<00:01:26.550> not<00:01:26.729> bad<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:28.159> then<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> look<00:01:29.580> at

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
wins are not bad but then if you look at

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.790 
wins are not bad but then if you look at
his<00:01:29.850> losses<00:01:30.470> he<00:01:31.470> has<00:01:31.590> 17<00:01:32.190> losses<00:01:33.050> that's<00:01:34.050> very

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
his losses he has 17 losses that's very

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.889 
his losses he has 17 losses that's very
bad<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:36.080> he<00:01:37.080> has<00:01:37.200> six<00:01:37.590> over<00:01:37.950> times<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.600> mean<00:01:39.600> he

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
bad and he has six over times I mean he

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.820 
bad and he has six over times I mean he
lost<00:01:40.080> in<00:01:40.440> overtime<00:01:41.009> or<00:01:42.000> shootout<00:01:42.530> six<00:01:43.530> times

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
lost in overtime or shootout six times

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.340 
lost in overtime or shootout six times
so<00:01:44.190> do<00:01:45.030> 17<00:01:45.660> plus<00:01:48.170> 6:23

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
so do 17 plus 6:23

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.730 
so do 17 plus 6:23
so<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.649> technically<00:01:50.220> 23<00:01:50.759> losses<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.740> he's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
so that's technically 23 losses so he's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.370 
so that's technically 23 losses so he's
19<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.340> 23<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.690> he<00:01:54.780> has<00:01:54.929> more<00:01:55.110> losses

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
19 and 23 you know so he has more losses

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.740 
19 and 23 you know so he has more losses
than<00:01:55.619> wins

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
than wins

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.540 
than wins
that's<00:01:58.369> horrible

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
that's horrible

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.230
