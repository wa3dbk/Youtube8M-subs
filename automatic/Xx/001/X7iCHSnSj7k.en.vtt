let's start off with Sonic he has
articulation<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.619> head<00:00:17.510> arms<00:00:18.510> move<00:00:19.230> all

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680

figures<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:40.379> fixed<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.040> problem<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
figures on they fixed a problem that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.020 
figures on they fixed a problem that
most<00:00:42.270> sonic<00:00:42.690> figures<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.489> had<00:00:44.520> for

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
most sonic figures have and have had for

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.060 
most sonic figures have and have had for
years<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.170> actually<00:00:46.320> bend<00:00:46.620> them<00:00:46.739> forward

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
years you can actually bend them forward

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.040 
years you can actually bend them forward
and<00:00:47.160> back<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> still<00:00:48.120> bend<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> knee<00:00:48.780> down

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and back and still bend the knee down

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380 
and back and still bend the knee down
instead<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.530> having<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.239> have

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
instead of having it like that you have

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.200 
instead of having it like that you have
to<00:00:51.420> bend<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:52.309> bend<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to bend it out bend it up like that and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.959 
to bend it out bend it up like that and
then<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> crooked<00:00:55.530> knee<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.760> fix

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
then you get a crooked knee so they fix

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.610 
then you get a crooked knee so they fix
that<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.300> these<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.870> also<00:00:57.989> twist<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> leg

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that on these you can also twist the leg

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.990 
that on these you can also twist the leg
like<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.570> bend<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> knee<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.550> twist<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
like that bend the knee and twist at the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.840 
like that bend the knee and twist at the
ankle<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.250> nice<00:01:05.489> amount<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
ankle so that's a really nice amount of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.490 
ankle so that's a really nice amount of
articulation<00:01:06.510> present<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.930> small<00:01:07.049> figure

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
articulation present a small figure

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950
