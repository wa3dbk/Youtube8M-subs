lonely situation I was thinking about

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.149 
lonely situation I was thinking about
how<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.840> people<00:01:16.320> who<00:01:16.409> follow<00:01:16.770> music

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
how you know people who follow music

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.590 
how you know people who follow music
these<00:01:17.250> days<00:01:17.310> say<00:01:17.640> how<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.970> music<00:01:18.030> isn't<00:01:18.509> like

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
these days say how can music isn't like

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.240 
these days say how can music isn't like
it<00:01:18.750> used<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.500> there's<00:01:20.100> lots

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it used to be and I think there's lots

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.289 
it used to be and I think there's lots
of<00:01:20.369> great<00:01:20.490> music<00:01:20.640> today<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.150> there's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
of great music today but there's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.550 
of great music today but there's
certainly<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> culture<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.140> seems<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> be

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
certainly a culture that seems to be

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.899 
certainly a culture that seems to be
missing<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.790> read

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
missing and the more and more I read

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.660 
missing and the more and more I read
about<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.210> childhood<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.689> more<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> thought

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
about your childhood the more I thought

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.300 
about your childhood the more I thought
the<00:01:26.670> 70s<00:01:27.210> don't<00:01:27.390> exist<00:01:27.720> anymore<00:01:27.960> now<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the 70s don't exist anymore now and that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.850 
the 70s don't exist anymore now and that
was<00:01:29.549> really<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.869> created<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> lot<00:01:31.829> of

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
was really what I think created a lot of

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.679 
was really what I think created a lot of
the<00:01:32.040> space<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.460> guys<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> develop<00:01:33.600> I
