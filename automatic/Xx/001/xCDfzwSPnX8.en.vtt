00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.400
 first crush the cookies with the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.420
 help of a mortar or a chopper until 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.420
 that are well finite 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.530
 then we will add the butter 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.530
 melted and we will mix it well 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.430
 here you see how the pasta is going 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.810
 and once done we will place about 4 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.450
 small teaspoons on the bottom of 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.960
 the steps taking well so that it is 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.960
 compact 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.650
 Now we will make the lemon cream for 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.799
 We put cream cheese on fire 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.140
 medium we add the nothing to assemble and 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.680
 let's mix until everything is done 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.680
 a homogeneous mass 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.770
 it is important that it is well founded and not 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.770
 there are granites 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.060
 Y 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.640
 Now we add the juice of three lemons and 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.640
 we keep stirring 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.900
 to not use it stereo jobs with a 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.900
 spoonful of fat is enough 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.119
 yes 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.930
 to express it and to take consistency 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.980
 of cream we will put 4 tablespoons 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.980
 cornstarch tureens 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.530
 when a homogeneous paste is already made 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.450
 we will take them out of the fire we will leave 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.590
 cool and we can see it 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.590
 our basic 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.060
 we will decorate with a little more 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.060
 cookie above 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.140
 and let it cool in the refrigerator 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.140
 now and it will be ready
