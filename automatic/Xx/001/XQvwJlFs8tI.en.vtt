00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.180
 I am Asturian raised in Barcelona 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.099
 for me the Barcelona team has been 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.570
 very important in my life since very 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.270
 small I stayed on Sundays 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.640
 stuck to the radio to listen to those 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.180
 parties that did not get on television 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.160
 and therefore 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 what has happened with Barcelona in 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.710
 the last years is very nice 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.490
 have seen this equipment through the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.989
 years under the baton of guardiola as 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.970
 has become a team where the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.700
 players are friends where you see it in the 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.950
 way they handle the ball and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.640
 where you have a person tito vilanova 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.010
 that you have to inherit one of the equipment 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.620
 if not the most successful team 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.830
 achieved in history I hope that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.559
 the sporting successes accompany but in 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.059
 the case that it was not like that to me already 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.460
 I really like what I'm seeing with 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.530
 title therefore said winston 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.030
 churchill that success was going from failure 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.090
 in failure without losing is of enthusiasm 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.100
 when things go well hey 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.520
 and we have a run if you're from 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.920
 barcelona and with a Spanish team 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.350
 is that I have a streak that I'm already 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.240
 tired of celebrating I consider that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.810
 Messi is a tremendous person is a 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.810
 worker born 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.460
 team player 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.910
 has helped a star being that the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.310
 wardrobe is not all created around 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.040
 of him but that he is one more even being 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.380
 of that great star that to me if I 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.720
 he likes a lot for much more in his gifts 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.120
 football players to me Mr. Mourinho that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.410
 person that what good to be a great 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.930
 coach has achieved many things 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.330
 but it is true that sometimes with 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.100
 more tension than we should think 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.380
 that in the Spanish league there was not that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.260
 tension until the Lord came 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.900
 mister mourinho and it's a pity we have 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.800
 in Spanish sections of the forest in the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.220
 Luis Aragones 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.570
 true gentlemen of what is the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.540
 football you can be from the team that 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.850
 want to be but you have to be sir in 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.730
 the defeat 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.380
 and you have to be honest to recognize 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.770
 when the other team does things so 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.720
 better better than you and that 's with that 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.930
 philosophy go to a soccer stadium myself 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.010
 I think it would be much nicer 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.010
 I have a 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.300
 a football that we call a truck 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:43.000
 Food in Washington is called pp 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.790
 and it's very popular and the truck goes by 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.670
 city ​​serving sandwiches and one of the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.470
 bocadillos is from the sandwich fc.barcelona 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.910
 a little bit since I was very young that I went to 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.490
 camp nou then I always ate some 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.080
 sandwiches of some hot dogs 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.690
 hot dogs some sandwiches 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.480
 honeycomb chicken and the sandwich made and a 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.040
 chicken sandwich packed with romesco 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.750
 and the truth that is perhaps the most 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.260
 success has therefore I have done 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.810
 my little contribution and I've made a 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.070
 sandwich that is very popular because what 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.030
 can anyone eat at the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.520
 street and good with that I 'm already 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.330
 I think he has fulfilled that homage 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.330
 to Barcelona
