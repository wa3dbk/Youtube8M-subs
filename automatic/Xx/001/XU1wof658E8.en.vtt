00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:12.289
 oven and for this we are going to need 200 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.320
 milliliters of cream 500 grams of cheese 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.570
 fresh quark 100 grams of sugar 15 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.180
 grams of cornstarch 1 teaspoon 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.100
 vanilla essence 3 eggs and 2 yolks 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:28.010
 of egg we already have it we all have the 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.380
 cream cheese quark eggs 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.499
 teaspoon of vanilla sugar and 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.510
 cornstarch let's start by taking the 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.870
 which cheese and what are we going to put in a 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.870
 bowl 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.880
 to which we will also add 3 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.880
 eggs 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.720
 now we separate the whites from the yolks 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.140
 and we are going to add the 2 yolks that we 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.140
 missing 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.030
 and with the help of a rod blender 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.030
 let's beat everything 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.740
 you should have a yellowish cream 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.799
 when you see it already well integrated what 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.530
 we will do is add the sugar 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.299
 essence of vanilla and cornstarch and what 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.439
 we will continue beating so that it is 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.439
 everything well integrated 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.799
 i 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.959
 and finally we add the cream and continue 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.959
 beating until well integrated 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.480
 for this recipe we are going to use a 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.750
 Lékué mold the silicone tube in 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.000
 ceramic as you see we have it ready 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.970
 here now what we are going to do is 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.880
 dump our mixture inside the mold 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.210
 We preheat the oven to 200 degrees and 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:53.560
 let's bake for 40 minutes at 175 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:55.630
 degrees after this time we take out 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.500
 already to our cheesecake and we're going 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.420
 to let cool out of the fridge 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.790
 this cake will look like it's bloated 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.130
 a lot but do not worry if you download them 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.800
 because it 's normal now let's unmold 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.170
 remove the clip and open the mold and 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.900
 As you can see, it comes out very easily and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.650
 we have our delicious cake ready 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.650
