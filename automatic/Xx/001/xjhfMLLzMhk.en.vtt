no<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:00.589> welcome<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.800> finding<00:00:02.310> pivot<00:00:02.639> points<00:00:02.939> I'm

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
no I welcome to finding pivot points I'm

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.480 
no I welcome to finding pivot points I'm
this<00:00:04.259> ones<00:00:04.500> in<00:00:04.620> Boston<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.160> I'm<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.430> to

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
this ones in Boston and I'm going to

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.220 
this ones in Boston and I'm going to
show<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:06.060> I<00:00:06.089> found<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.870> first<00:00:07.109> thing

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
show you how I found it the first thing

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.709 
show you how I found it the first thing
to<00:00:07.379> do<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.710> go<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.400> your<00:00:08.550> map<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.420> want<00:00:09.599> to

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
to do is go to your map and you want to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.140 
to do is go to your map and you want to
bisect<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.559> city<00:00:10.889> into<00:00:11.370> two<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.969> just

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
bisect a city into two and that just

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.610 
bisect a city into two and that just
means<00:00:12.240> draw<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> line<00:00:12.809> either<00:00:12.990> vertically<00:00:13.590> or

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
means draw a line either vertically or

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.930 
means draw a line either vertically or
horizontally<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:17.279> I'm<00:00:17.340> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.490> fast<00:00:17.730> travel

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
horizontally so I'm going to fast travel

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.609 
horizontally so I'm going to fast travel
to<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.210> area<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> West<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.260> left<00:00:19.500> of

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
to this area on the West on the left of

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.490 
to this area on the West on the left of
the<00:00:19.710> map<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.100> go<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.510> map<00:00:21.689> screen<00:00:21.930> which

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the map and go to the map screen which

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.960 
the map and go to the map screen which
takes<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.980> little<00:00:23.130> while<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> load<00:00:23.519> off<00:00:23.820> you

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
takes a little while to load off you

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.519 
takes a little while to load off you
just<00:00:24.119> fought<00:00:24.300> struggled<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:25.199> up<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
just fought struggled and then up to the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.800 
just fought struggled and then up to the
Animus<00:00:25.800> section<00:00:26.160> down<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.820> maps<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.269> then

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
Animus section down to maps and then

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.599 
Animus section down to maps and then
click<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.590> plant<00:00:28.800> pivot<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.460> can

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
click on me to plant pivot and you can

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.139 
click on me to plant pivot and you can
only<00:00:29.789> plant<00:00:30.090> pivots<00:00:30.539> where<00:00:30.840> you're<00:00:31.019> standing

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
only plant pivots where you're standing

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.459 
only plant pivots where you're standing
so<00:00:33.149> that's<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> first<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.840> now<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.290> know

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
so that's the first bit and now we know

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.340 
so that's the first bit and now we know
that<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.370> somewhere<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.180> half<00:00:36.719> somewhere

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that is somewhere in the half somewhere

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.750 
that is somewhere in the half somewhere
in<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> map<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:37.980> doesn't<00:00:38.370> really<00:00:38.489> help<00:00:38.610> us

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
in the map which doesn't really help us

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
in the map which doesn't really help us
so<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.570> got<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> fast<00:00:39.989> rattle<00:00:40.260> over<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> other

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
so I got a fast rattle over to the other

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
so I got a fast rattle over to the other
side<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.550> city<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.850> plant<00:00:42.360> another<00:00:42.809> pivot

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
side of the city and plant another pivot

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.520 
side of the city and plant another pivot
that's<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.710> basically<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> straight<00:00:44.789> line<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
that's in basically a straight line so

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.450 
that's in basically a straight line so
they<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.829> somewhere<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> north<00:00:47.370> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
they see it somewhere in the north of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.479 
they see it somewhere in the north of
Ireland<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.300> want<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.960> travel

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
Ireland and what we want to do is travel

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
Ireland and what we want to do is travel
to<00:00:50.489> somewhere<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.719> again<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> split

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to somewhere up here to again a split

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.930 
to somewhere up here to again a split
yawn<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.949> generally<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
yawn you generally want to go to the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.549 
yawn you generally want to go to the
middle<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> Green<00:00:54.629> Zone<00:00:54.660> each<00:00:55.050> time<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
middle of the Green Zone each time to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.860 
middle of the Green Zone each time to
plant<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.980> new<00:00:56.010> pennant<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.329> travel<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.750> this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
plant a new pennant and I travel to this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.299 
plant a new pennant and I travel to this
one<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.289> actually<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> one's<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
one but actually this one's where it is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.510 
one but actually this one's where it is
so<00:01:00.230> pretend<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.320> didn't<00:01:01.559> pretend<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.100> travel<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
so pretend I didn't pretend I travel to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.009 
so pretend I didn't pretend I travel to
this<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.300> show<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.629> how<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
this one just so I can show you how it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.770 
this one just so I can show you how it
actually<00:01:04.049> works<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.060> I'm<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.270> plant<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
actually works and I'm going to plant a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
actually works and I'm going to plant a
pivot<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.740> you'll<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.700> it's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
pivot there and you'll see now that it's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.929 
pivot there and you'll see now that it's
in<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> outside<00:01:09.600> section<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.549> want<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in the outside section here so I want to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.429 
in the outside section here so I want to
plot<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> pivot<00:01:12.570> somewhere<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> middle

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
plot a pivot somewhere in the middle

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.210 
plot a pivot somewhere in the middle
here<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.659> point<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.080> should<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.680> 4

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
here and at this point you should have 4

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
here and at this point you should have 4
or<00:01:20.549> more<00:01:20.820> pivots<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.380> keep

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
or more pivots so you can just keep

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.990 
or more pivots so you can just keep
planting<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.280> you'll<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.880> go

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
planting them but you'll see when we go

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.719 
planting them but you'll see when we go
to<00:01:24.060> frontier<00:01:24.710> we<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.860> start<00:01:26.100> removing<00:01:26.250> Dec

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to frontier we can start removing Dec

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.249 
to frontier we can start removing Dec
pivots<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> fast<00:01:27.689> travel<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
pivots so I'm going to fast travel to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.859 
pivots so I'm going to fast travel to
another<00:01:28.530> point<00:01:28.770> nearby<00:01:29.240> then<00:01:30.240> again<00:01:30.479> plant<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
another point nearby then again plant a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.859 
another point nearby then again plant a
pivot<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.170> me<00:01:32.119> here<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.509> were<00:01:33.600> three

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
pivot on me here we go there were three

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.600 
pivot on me here we go there were three
and<00:01:34.049> plot<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> fourth<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and plot a fourth one there and if you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.340 
and plot a fourth one there and if you
want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> remove<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.900> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
want to remove that one you can but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
want to remove that one you can but
there's<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.770> no<00:01:37.950> need<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.299> what

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
we're going to do is plant another pivot

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.569 
we're going to do is plant another pivot
in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> middle<00:01:42.420> section<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.579> now

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
in the middle section of this now

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
in the middle section of this now
there's<00:01:45.000> not<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> fast<00:01:45.509> travel<00:01:45.720> spot<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
there's not a fast travel spot and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.660 
there's not a fast travel spot and
advice<00:01:46.500> I'm<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> fast<00:01:47.220> travel<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.579> this

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
advice I'm just a fast travel to this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.550 
advice I'm just a fast travel to this
port<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:50.869> there<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.439> it's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
port and there we go we can see it's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.990 
port and there we go we can see it's
somewhere<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:52.979> section<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:53.850> going

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
somewhere in this section so I'm going

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580 
somewhere in this section so I'm going
to<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> custom<00:01:54.630> marker<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> middle<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
to put a custom marker in the middle of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
to put a custom marker in the middle of
the<00:01:55.680> map<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.939> run<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.630> custom

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the map and then just run to that custom

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.340 
the map and then just run to that custom
marker<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:59.540> if<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> way<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
marker and if on the way you see the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.719 
marker and if on the way you see the
pivot<00:02:01.500> point<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
pivot point you can see it here on the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.770 
pivot point you can see it here on the
mini-map<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.540> little<00:02:04.729> square<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> dot

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
mini-map it's a little square with a dot

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.619 
mini-map it's a little square with a dot
in<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> middle<00:02:07.429> you'll<00:02:08.429> see<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:09.030> I'm

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
in the middle you'll see it here I'm

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.790 
in the middle you'll see it here I'm
just<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.959> run<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> pick<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.619> up

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
just going to run to that and pick it up

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.650 
just going to run to that and pick it up
but<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> do<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.300> plant<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
but if it's not what you do is plant a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.890 
but if it's not what you do is plant a
pivot<00:02:12.930> point<00:02:12.959> at<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.470> center

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
pivot point at the center

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.009 
pivot point at the center
that<00:02:14.170> you've<00:02:14.290> got<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:15.750> it'll<00:02:16.750> further

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
that you've got to and it'll further

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.750 
that you've got to and it'll further
reduce<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.829> amount<00:02:18.099> of<00:02:18.129> space<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.610> got

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
reduce the amount of space that we got

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.890 
reduce the amount of space that we got
to<00:02:18.819> see<00:02:18.939> so<00:02:19.060> there<00:02:19.180> where<00:02:19.299> I've<00:02:19.420> picked<00:02:19.750> up

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
to see so there where I've picked up

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.080 
to see so there where I've picked up
pivot<00:02:20.470> Kappa<00:02:21.010> which<00:02:21.220> i<00:02:21.310> think<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.610> flesh<00:02:21.909> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
pivot Kappa which i think is flesh and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.030 
pivot Kappa which i think is flesh and
steel<00:02:22.329> or<00:02:22.689> mostly<00:02:23.079> steel<00:02:23.439> or<00:02:23.680> something<00:02:23.920> like

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
steel or mostly steel or something like

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.039 
steel or mostly steel or something like
that<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:27.040> now<00:02:27.159> go<00:02:27.400> back<00:02:27.579> to<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.030> map<00:02:28.689> and

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
that so now go back to the map and

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.720 
that so now go back to the map and
remove<00:02:29.590> all<00:02:29.860> your<00:02:29.920> pivots<00:02:30.370> because<00:02:30.609> you'll

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
remove all your pivots because you'll

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.670 
remove all your pivots because you'll
see<00:02:30.849> at<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:30.970> top<00:02:31.180> zero<00:02:31.720> pivots<00:02:32.109> to<00:02:32.170> find<00:02:32.409> and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
see at the top zero pivots to find and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.830 
see at the top zero pivots to find and
there's<00:02:33.099> three<00:02:33.609> left<00:02:33.760> plant<00:02:34.060> four<00:02:34.359> left<00:02:34.510> plant

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
there's three left plant four left plant

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.929 
there's three left plant four left plant
five<00:02:35.439> left<00:02:35.650> appliance<00:02:36.040> six<00:02:36.280> left<00:02:36.489> one<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:36.849> I've

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
five left appliance six left one so I've

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.929 
five left appliance six left one so I've
picked<00:02:37.060> up<00:02:37.239> seven<00:02:37.599> pivots<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.019> can<00:02:38.200> use<00:02:38.939> to

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
picked up seven pivots I can use to

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.449 
picked up seven pivots I can use to
track<00:02:40.180> other<00:02:40.329> pivots<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.709> I'm<00:02:41.769> good<00:02:42.010> frontier

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
track other pivots so I'm good frontier

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.009 
track other pivots so I'm good frontier
haven't<00:02:42.760> been<00:02:42.909> here<00:02:43.060> yet<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.569> big<00:02:43.840> area

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
haven't been here yet this is a big area

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.080 
haven't been here yet this is a big area
and<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.409> kind<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.620> tough<00:02:44.859> so<00:02:45.730> what<00:02:45.849> I<00:02:45.909> want<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
and it's kind of tough so what I want to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.300 
and it's kind of tough so what I want to
do<00:02:46.209> first<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.690> cut<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.200> map<00:02:47.379> in<00:02:47.530> half<00:02:47.709> again<00:02:48.099> so

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
do first is cut the map in half again so

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.800 
do first is cut the map in half again so
I'm<00:02:48.549> fast<00:02:48.790> traveling<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.239> bottom<00:02:49.540> I'm

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
I'm fast traveling to the bottom I'm

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.629 
I'm fast traveling to the bottom I'm
going<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.989> lay<00:02:50.139> down<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.349> pivot<00:02:50.680> here<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:54.190> then

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
going to lay down a pivot here and then

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.039 
going to lay down a pivot here and then
I<00:02:54.670> want<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:54.879> travel<00:02:55.120> up<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.269> Canaan<00:02:55.569> care<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
I want to travel up to Canaan care and

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.569 
I want to travel up to Canaan care and
just<00:02:56.319> plumb<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.739> there<00:02:56.920> because<00:02:57.069> that's<00:02:57.400> going

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
just plumb on there because that's going

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.039 
just plumb on there because that's going
to<00:02:57.639> cut<00:02:57.909> the<00:02:58.180> map<00:02:58.359> in<00:02:58.569> half

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
to cut the map in half

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.449 
to cut the map in half
top<00:02:59.349> to<00:02:59.500> bottom<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.010> now<00:03:00.129> we<00:03:00.189> know<00:03:00.340> where

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
top to bottom so now we know where

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.710 
top to bottom so now we know where
there's<00:03:00.670> one<00:03:00.760> on<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:00.939> left<00:03:01.120> somewhere<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
there's one on the left somewhere and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.780 
there's one on the left somewhere and
really<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.019> want<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.409> plant<00:03:02.950> one<00:03:03.099> around<00:03:03.459> there

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
really I want to plant one around there

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.339 
really I want to plant one around there
but<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> closest<00:03:04.450> point<00:03:04.659> is<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.900> fort

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
but the closest point is the fort

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.270 
but the closest point is the fort
and<00:03:05.470> I'm<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.709> just<00:03:05.799> going<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.010> run<00:03:06.189> across

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and I'm not just going to run across

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.559 
and I'm not just going to run across
there<00:03:06.609> so<00:03:06.730> I'm<00:03:06.790> going<00:03:06.879> to<00:03:06.939> fast<00:03:07.150> travel<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.480> the

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
there so I'm going to fast travel to the

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.339 
faster oh I'm going to have to run
manually<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.250> custom<00:03:18.639> marker<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.230> I'll

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
manually to that custom marker so I'll

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.539 
manually to that custom marker so I'll
speed<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.769> up<00:03:20.799> for<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.069> so<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.340> don't

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
speed that up for you so that you don't

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.789 
speed that up for you so that you don't
have<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.730> see<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.180> up<00:03:23.169> this<00:03:23.379> way<00:03:23.500> there's<00:03:23.739> a

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
have to see it and up this way there's a

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.319 
have to see it and up this way there's a
load<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.310> stuff<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.639> fight<00:03:24.819> it<00:03:24.970> got<00:03:25.090> really

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
load of stuff to fight it got really

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.059 
load of stuff to fight it got really
annoying<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.959> you'll<00:03:26.139> see<00:03:26.349> I<00:03:26.379> sort<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.680> give<00:03:26.919> up

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
annoying so you'll see I sort of give up

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.470 
annoying so you'll see I sort of give up
before<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.549> get<00:03:27.669> to<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:27.970> because<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.209> can't<00:03:28.389> be

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
before I get to it because I can't be

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.030 
before I get to it because I can't be
bothered<00:03:28.629> to<00:03:28.780> go<00:03:28.959> any<00:03:29.109> further<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.709> deal<00:03:29.919> with

bothered to go any further and deal with

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.189 
bothered to go any further and deal with
all<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.280> animal<00:03:30.730> start<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.239> kill<00:03:31.989> and

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
all the animal start and kill and

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.439 
all the animal start and kill and
QuickTime<00:03:32.560> events<00:03:32.859> in<00:03:32.980> Bluff<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.299> have<00:03:34.389> a

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
QuickTime events in Bluff so I have a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:35.640 
QuickTime events in Bluff so I have a
quick<00:03:34.569> look<00:03:34.720> at<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.870> map<00:03:35.019> now<00:03:35.169> and<00:03:35.349> I<00:03:35.379> forget

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
quick look at the map now and I forget

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.439 
quick look at the map now and I forget
me<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:35.919> close<00:03:36.129> enough<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.579> put<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.030> pivot<00:03:37.329> down

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
me and close enough and put a pivot down

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.689 
me and close enough and put a pivot down
where<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.720> am<00:03:37.900> here<00:03:38.290> like<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.889> and<00:03:39.069> now<00:03:39.489> that

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
where I am here like that and now that

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.059 
where I am here like that and now that
gives<00:03:39.819> me<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> much<00:03:40.209> smaller<00:03:40.480> section<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.199> I

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
gives me a much smaller section and I

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.649 
gives me a much smaller section and I
still<00:03:42.250> got<00:03:42.370> three<00:03:42.639> pivots<00:03:42.970> left<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.209> plant<00:03:43.449> so

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
still got three pivots left to plant so

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.330 
still got three pivots left to plant so
I'm<00:03:43.780> putting<00:03:43.989> another<00:03:44.169> custom<00:03:44.560> marker<00:03:44.949> in<00:03:45.159> the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
I'm putting another custom marker in the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.979 
I'm putting another custom marker in the
middle<00:03:45.609> of<00:03:45.699> the<00:03:45.790> zone<00:03:45.819> that<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.209> was<00:03:46.389> before<00:03:46.540> and

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
middle of the zone that I was before and

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.330 
middle of the zone that I was before and
heading<00:03:47.199> towards<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.590> custom<00:03:47.889> marker<00:03:48.159> and

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
heading towards that custom marker and

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.159 
heading towards that custom marker and
so<00:03:49.329> I<00:03:49.359> run<00:03:49.629> over<00:03:49.659> here

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
so I run over here

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.039 
so I run over here
Geir<00:03:51.159> to<00:03:51.340> custom<00:03:51.849> marker<00:03:52.120> location<00:03:52.569> and<00:03:52.720> as

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
Geir to custom marker location and as

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.149 
Geir to custom marker location and as
soon<00:03:53.199> as<00:03:53.290> you're<00:03:53.379> standing<00:03:53.560> on<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.889> or<00:03:54.040> when

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
soon as you're standing on it or when

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.500 
soon as you're standing on it or when
you<00:03:54.220> feel<00:03:54.370> you're<00:03:54.519> close<00:03:54.699> enough<00:03:54.940> put<00:03:55.329> down

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
you feel you're close enough put down

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.899 
you feel you're close enough put down
another<00:03:56.069> pivot<00:03:57.069> point<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.489> you'll<00:03:57.639> see<00:03:57.790> it's

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
another pivot point and you'll see it's

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.750 
another pivot point and you'll see it's
made<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.209> section<00:03:58.690> even<00:03:58.989> smaller<00:03:59.609> so<00:04:00.609> now<00:04:00.699> I

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
made the section even smaller so now I

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.189 
made the section even smaller so now I
can<00:04:00.940> remove<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.269> get<00:04:01.569> pivot<00:04:01.900> because<00:04:02.049> that

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
can remove the get pivot because that

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.050 
can remove the get pivot because that
was<00:04:02.319> not<00:04:02.470> connected<00:04:02.859> to<00:04:02.949> anything<00:04:03.159> and<00:04:03.940> I've

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
was not connected to anything and I've

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.339 
was not connected to anything and I've
still<00:04:04.239> got<00:04:04.359> three<00:04:04.569> two<00:04:04.690> plot<00:04:06.989> now<00:04:07.989> I'll<00:04:08.109> plant

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
still got three two plot now I'll plant

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.839 
still got three two plot now I'll plant
a<00:04:08.440> pivot<00:04:08.709> in<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.859> middle<00:04:09.159> of<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.400> section

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
a pivot in the middle of that section

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.210 
a pivot in the middle of that section
then<00:04:10.720> you're<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.019> going<00:04:11.139> to<00:04:11.169> reduce<00:04:11.349> the

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
then you're just going to reduce the

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.430 
then you're just going to reduce the
size<00:04:12.519> of<00:04:12.909> the<00:04:13.209> searchable<00:04:13.599> area<00:04:13.959> each<00:04:14.169> time<00:04:14.409> I

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
size of the searchable area each time I

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.289 
size of the searchable area each time I
hate<00:04:14.829> gained<00:04:15.069> a<00:04:15.250> villager<00:04:15.639> always<00:04:15.970> go<00:04:16.150> the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
hate gained a villager always go the

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.839 
hate gained a villager always go the
wrong<00:04:16.419> way<00:04:16.889> but<00:04:17.889> now<00:04:18.010> I'm<00:04:18.130> here<00:04:18.310> I'm<00:04:18.519> going<00:04:18.789> to

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
wrong way but now I'm here I'm going to

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.729 
wrong way but now I'm here I'm going to
plant<00:04:19.060> yet<00:04:19.269> another<00:04:19.510> pellet<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.560> makes

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
plant yet another pellet and that makes

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.870 
plant yet another pellet and that makes
my<00:04:20.859> section<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.220> can<00:04:21.280> smaller<00:04:21.579> said<00:04:21.760> they're

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
my section you can smaller said they're

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.430 
my section you can smaller said they're
a<00:04:21.909> dot<00:04:22.120> in<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> middle<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.570> that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
a dot in the middle of that

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.070 
a dot in the middle of that
remove<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.160> dead<00:04:24.340> one<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:25.750> run<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.990> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
remove the dead one and we run to the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.130 
remove the dead one and we run to the
center<00:04:30.030> now<00:04:31.030> you'll<00:04:31.330> see<00:04:31.540> I'm<00:04:31.690> on<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.840> market

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
center now you'll see I'm on the market

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.360 
center now you'll see I'm on the market
but<00:04:32.200> actually<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.590> pivots<00:04:32.860> come<00:04:33.040> up<00:04:33.160> there

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
but actually the pivots come up there

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.590 
but actually the pivots come up there
and<00:04:33.550> for<00:04:33.640> some<00:04:33.790> reason<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.090> don't<00:04:34.240> pick<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.510> up

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
and for some reason I don't pick it up

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.700 
and for some reason I don't pick it up
when<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:34.750> walk<00:04:34.900> over<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.260> even<00:04:35.530> though<00:04:35.620> it

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
when I walk over it even though it

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.230 
when I walk over it even though it
registers<00:04:36.130> as<00:04:36.250> having<00:04:36.490> picked<00:04:36.670> up<00:04:36.850> it's<00:04:37.060> still

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
registers as having picked up it's still

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.730 
registers as having picked up it's still
floating<00:04:37.630> there<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.170> guess<00:04:38.350> that's<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:38.590> a

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
floating there but I guess that's just a

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.550 
floating there but I guess that's just a
glitch<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:40.150> now<00:04:40.330> we've<00:04:40.600> got<00:04:40.750> second<00:04:41.260> code<00:04:41.380> to

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
glitch so now we've got second code to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.750 
glitch so now we've got second code to
find<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:41.920> that's<00:04:41.980> somewhere<00:04:42.430> in<00:04:42.640> this

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
find and that's somewhere in this

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.160 
find and that's somewhere in this
section<00:04:43.150> here<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.450> I'm<00:04:43.540> going<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.750> remove<00:04:43.930> a

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
section here so I'm going to remove a

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.600 
section here so I'm going to remove a
couple<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.470> markers<00:04:44.830> because<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.160> know<00:04:45.220> roughly

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
couple of markers because I know roughly

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.480 
couple of markers because I know roughly
where<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:47.070> even<00:04:48.070> though<00:04:48.220> we've<00:04:48.460> got

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
where it is and even though we've got

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.890 
where it is and even though we've got
this<00:04:48.730> whole<00:04:48.850> green<00:04:49.060> section<00:04:49.480> I<00:04:49.570> know<00:04:49.630> that

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
this whole green section I know that

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.300 
this whole green section I know that
there's<00:04:50.050> one<00:04:50.200> around<00:04:50.410> here<00:04:50.620> somewhere<00:04:50.680> in

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
there's one around here somewhere in

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.410 
there's one around here somewhere in
this<00:04:51.520> bottom<00:04:51.790> section<00:04:51.910> so<00:04:52.180> I'm<00:04:52.270> going<00:04:52.390> to

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
this bottom section so I'm going to

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.150 
this bottom section so I'm going to
travel<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.750> this<00:04:52.900> fort<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.440> lay<00:04:53.920> one<00:04:54.130> down

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
travel to this fort and lay one down

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.850 
travel to this fort and lay one down
here<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:55.030> make<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.420> triangle<00:04:56.050> that's<00:04:56.560> going<00:04:56.800> to

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
here to make a triangle that's going to

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.320 
here to make a triangle that's going to
show<00:04:56.980> you<00:04:57.040> which<00:04:57.280> side<00:04:57.520> of<00:04:57.640> that<00:04:57.790> section<00:04:58.180> was

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
show you which side of that section was

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.290 
show you which side of that section was
on<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:59.020> then<00:04:59.890> I'm<00:05:00.190> going<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.520> fast<00:05:00.820> travel<00:05:01.060> to

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
on and then I'm going to fast travel to

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.560 
on and then I'm going to fast travel to
this<00:05:01.600> section<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:03.550> lay<00:05:03.730> down<00:05:03.940> another<00:05:04.060> pivot

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
this section to lay down another pivot

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.910 
this section to lay down another pivot
because<00:05:04.780> that's<00:05:04.990> pretty<00:05:05.410> close<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:05.830> the

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
because that's pretty close to the

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
because that's pretty close to the
center<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.220> if<00:05:06.310> you<00:05:06.400> don't<00:05:06.550> have<00:05:06.640> the<00:05:06.760> fast

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
center and if you don't have the fast

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.610 
center and if you don't have the fast
travel<00:05:07.150> opened<00:05:07.510> it's<00:05:07.600> that<00:05:07.810> cart<00:05:08.140> there<00:05:08.410> that

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
travel opened it's that cart there that

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.040 
travel opened it's that cart there that
I<00:05:08.680> just<00:05:08.860> showed<00:05:09.420> and<00:05:10.420> now<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:10.690> know<00:05:10.840> it's<00:05:10.990> in

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
I just showed and now I know it's in

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.810 
I just showed and now I know it's in
this<00:05:11.140> section<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:11.710> again<00:05:12.190> put<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.550> custom

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
this section so again put a custom

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.460 
this section so again put a custom
market<00:05:13.390> in<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.600> middle<00:05:13.810> I'm<00:05:14.020> going<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.260> fast

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
market in the middle I'm going to fast

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.750 
market in the middle I'm going to fast
travel<00:05:14.650> back<00:05:14.890> to<00:05:14.920> the<00:05:15.070> fort<00:05:15.400> just<00:05:15.610> because

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
travel back to the fort just because

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.040 
travel back to the fort just because
that's<00:05:15.910> a<00:05:16.000> little<00:05:16.240> closer<00:05:16.450> when<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:16.810> fast

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
that's a little closer when you fast

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.390 
that's a little closer when you fast
travel<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:17.410> have<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.620> relay<00:05:17.920> your<00:05:18.040> custom

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
travel you have to relay your custom

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.490 
travel you have to relay your custom
marker<00:05:18.760> so<00:05:18.910> don't<00:05:19.060> forget<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.300> do<00:05:19.450> that<00:05:19.570> put<00:05:20.380> it

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
marker so don't forget to do that put it

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.020 
marker so don't forget to do that put it
in<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.650> middle<00:05:20.890> of<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.040> section<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.610> then

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
in the middle of the section and then

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.610 
in the middle of the section and then
run<00:05:22.270> towards<00:05:22.630> it<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:22.870> get<00:05:23.200> on<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.350> force

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
run towards it I get on the force

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.810 
run towards it I get on the force
because<00:05:23.830> I<00:05:23.920> think<00:05:24.070> it<00:05:24.160> might<00:05:24.250> be<00:05:24.340> quicker<00:05:24.520> but

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
because I think it might be quicker but

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.160 
because I think it might be quicker but
as<00:05:24.940> always<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.360> horse<00:05:25.540> turns<00:05:25.780> out<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:26.050> be<00:05:26.080> a

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
as always the horse turns out to be a

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.710 
as always the horse turns out to be a
failed<00:05:26.530> effort<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.850> get<00:05:28.330> back<00:05:28.450> on<00:05:28.540> the<00:05:28.630> horse

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
failed effort I get back on the horse

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.480 
failed effort I get back on the horse
here<00:05:29.080> jump<00:05:29.470> over<00:05:29.680> here<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:29.980> you<00:05:30.100> can't<00:05:30.340> lay

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
here jump over here and you can't lay

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.159 
here jump over here and you can't lay
pivots<00:05:30.880> while<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:31.120> on<00:05:31.240> your<00:05:31.360> horse<00:05:31.600> so<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:31.960> got

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
pivots while you on your horse so I got

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.770 
pivots while you on your horse so I got
off<00:05:32.290> it<00:05:32.470> but<00:05:32.620> I<00:05:32.680> cut<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:33.010> bit<00:05:33.660> make<00:05:34.660> this

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
off it but I cut that bit make this

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.530 
off it but I cut that bit make this
section<00:05:35.169> smaller<00:05:35.820> remove<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:36.940> dead<00:05:37.120> marker

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
section smaller remove the dead marker

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.450 
section smaller remove the dead marker
run<00:05:38.200> to<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.440> new<00:05:38.560> custom<00:05:38.980> marker<00:05:39.280> in<00:05:39.400> the

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
run to the new custom marker in the

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.070 
run to the new custom marker in the
middle<00:05:39.700> of<00:05:39.760> your<00:05:39.820> previous<00:05:40.240> in<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.840> middle<00:05:41.020> of

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
middle of your previous in the middle of

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.320 
middle of your previous in the middle of
your<00:05:41.200> location<00:05:41.590> this<00:05:41.680> is<00:05:41.770> on<00:05:41.890> the<00:05:41.950> bridge<00:05:42.330> so

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
your location this is on the bridge so

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.820 
your location this is on the bridge so
I'm<00:05:43.419> going<00:05:43.540> to<00:05:43.570> put<00:05:43.750> a<00:05:43.780> custom<00:05:44.169> marker<00:05:44.650> down

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
I'm going to put a custom marker down

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.280 
I'm going to put a custom marker down
here<00:05:45.070> now<00:05:45.820> another<00:05:46.570> section<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:46.960> even<00:05:47.110> smaller

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
here now another section is even smaller

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.540 
here now another section is even smaller
so<00:05:47.500> put<00:05:47.650> another<00:05:47.740> marker<00:05:48.100> down<00:05:48.280> and<00:05:48.430> actually

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
so put another marker down and actually

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.890 
so put another marker down and actually
you'll<00:05:48.850> see<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.150> pivots<00:05:49.450> already<00:05:49.690> on<00:05:49.780> my

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
you'll see the pivots already on my

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.320 
you'll see the pivots already on my
mini-map<00:05:50.290> I<00:05:50.410> just<00:05:50.590> didn't<00:05:50.860> notice<00:05:51.120> so<00:05:52.120> run

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
mini-map I just didn't notice so run

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.350 
mini-map I just didn't notice so run
over<00:05:52.480> there<00:05:52.690> grab<00:05:53.680> your<00:05:53.860> next<00:05:54.040> pivot<00:05:54.360> and

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
over there grab your next pivot and

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.610 
over there grab your next pivot and
that's<00:05:55.540> the<00:05:55.630> frontier<00:05:55.990> done<00:05:56.140> and<00:05:56.350> all<00:05:56.470> you're

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
that's the frontier done and all you're

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.350 
that's the frontier done and all you're
going<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.830> do<00:05:56.950> is<00:05:57.070> repeat<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.430> same<00:05:57.910> method<00:05:58.270> in

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
going to do is repeat the same method in

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.290 
going to do is repeat the same method in
New<00:05:58.480> York<00:05:58.750> so<00:05:58.960> lay<00:05:59.140> down<00:05:59.320> three<00:05:59.650> two<00:06:00.370> markers

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
New York so lay down three two markers

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.810 
New York so lay down three two markers
to<00:06:01.870> cut<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.320> place<00:06:02.650> in<00:06:02.830> half<00:06:03.010> then<00:06:03.400> one<00:06:03.640> in<00:06:03.760> the

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
to cut the place in half then one in the

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.490 
to cut the place in half then one in the
middle<00:06:03.910> of<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.300> section<00:06:04.540> that's<00:06:04.780> left<00:06:05.020> and

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
middle of the section that's left and

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.260 
middle of the section that's left and
just<00:06:05.800> slowly<00:06:06.100> make<00:06:06.370> your<00:06:06.400> section<00:06:06.940> smaller

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
just slowly make your section smaller

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.780 
just slowly make your section smaller
and<00:06:07.480> smaller<00:06:07.720> by<00:06:07.960> laying<00:06:08.280> custom<00:06:09.280> waypoints

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
and smaller by laying custom waypoints

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.400 
and smaller by laying custom waypoints
running<00:06:10.150> towards<00:06:10.510> them<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:10.870> laying<00:06:11.200> another

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
running towards them and laying another

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.500 
running towards them and laying another
pivot<00:06:11.710> ask<00:06:12.610> me<00:06:12.730> any<00:06:12.850> questions<00:06:13.240> in<00:06:13.419> the

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
pivot ask me any questions in the

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.030 
pivot ask me any questions in the
comments<00:06:13.870> if<00:06:13.990> that's<00:06:14.169> unclear<00:06:14.440> but<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:14.770> hope<00:06:14.890> it

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
comments if that's unclear but I hope it

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.820 
comments if that's unclear but I hope it
was<00:06:15.130> useful<00:06:15.160> it's<00:06:15.580> a<00:06:15.669> lot
