00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:03.571
We left Stikine around four days ago.

00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.813
We’ve been on the road for over 40 hours.

00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:07.492
We are getting ready for Key Hole.

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:09.413
We’re going to be all around this area,

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:11.757
looking for big waterfalls to run.

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:19.237
Jumping off in my kayak, to me,

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.831
is one of the best sensations
 in the world.

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:24.420
Two seconds where nothing else 
matters in the world.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.856
It's you, your kayak, 
flying through the air.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:28.399
An amazing sensation.

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:37.510
The reason my brother 
Gerd is involved in this project:

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.393
He’s one of the best kayakers in the world

00:00:40.393 --> 00:00:42.560
and he'll be in charge of my safety.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.475
He’s going to be there 
on the most dangerous day of my life.

00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:52.130
To be honest, I actually feel nervous 
about Aniol running Key Hole.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.845
It is an extremely high waterfall.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.336
We were able to see
the huge flow of water falling,

00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:59.245
and the force, and how chaotic 
it is there right now.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.449
I’ve done everything I could
to prepare myself,

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.552
both mentally and physically.

00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:10.002
I’m running the falls well, so...

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.388
I think it’s a good time
to take on Key Hole.

00:01:12.388 --> 00:01:13.540
I’m ready!

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.958
We are ecstatic to be going there.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:18.592
There we go!

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.584
We are reaching Key Hole now,
right by the side of the waterfall,

00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:33.779
and we'll finally learn 
whether it’s possible.

00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:37.560
This place is amazing!

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:40.376
Most of the time it’s just misting,

00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:43.727
but every now and then, woah!
It comes flying up out of the thing.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.064
Man oh man!

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:47.886
It’s like one of the craziest canyons
I’ve ever seen.

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:50.746
Dark gorge and water 
shooting up in every direction.

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:51.940
It’s pretty wild.

00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:54.380
It’s just volcanic rock. It's not...

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.456
It’s sketchy rock.

00:01:58.488 --> 00:01:59.859
It wants to fall apart.

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:12.819
I’m at the lip of the waterfall,
around 10 meters from the plunge,

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.452
and I can see it’s a monster.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.056
It’s gigantic and all the water 
pushes towards the wrong place.

00:02:24.962 --> 00:02:27.250
The entrance is also very complicated.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.398
It’s madness.

00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:31.678
It’s very strong.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.943
Just reaching the lip 
of the waterfall while standing up

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.590
and in the right spot
is extremely difficult.

00:02:40.348 --> 00:02:44.480
If Aniol wanted to run it now,
 I would ask him not to do it.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.623
What can happen is that 
he could project forward

00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:51.837
and might not have control 
for the 30-40 meters of the plunge,

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:55.948
and be dragged from his kayak
with tonnes of water rushing over him.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:01.260
There’s too much waterflow,
it can’t be done right now.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.358
I have a family I care about.

00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:05.529
It's best to abort the mission for now

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.920
and come back when conditions improve.

00:03:13.815 --> 00:03:15.151
Nobody could believe it.

00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:17.887
It can’t be,
this can’t be happening.

00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:20.595
Trying, doing everything possible
to be able to warn him.

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:23.736
It was like witnessing
my friend's suicide.
