I think it you know with the blue shirt

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.729 
I think it you know with the blue shirt
and<00:02:59.060> men's<00:02:59.690> shirts<00:02:59.959> it's<00:03:00.200> always<00:03:00.470> hard<00:03:00.650> to

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
and men's shirts it's always hard to

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.740 
and men's shirts it's always hard to
keep<00:03:00.980> kind<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.489> thinking<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.090> new<00:03:02.209> things<00:03:02.239> to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
keep kind of thinking of new things to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.870 
keep kind of thinking of new things to
do<00:03:02.870> for<00:03:03.200> sure<00:03:03.380> ting<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.130> i<00:03:04.190> think<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.550> season

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
do for sure ting but i think the season

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.920 
do for sure ting but i think the season
is<00:03:04.940> really<00:03:05.120> interesting<00:03:05.600> because<00:03:05.630> there's

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
is really interesting because there's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.210 
is really interesting because there's
some<00:03:06.080> really<00:03:06.200> interesting<00:03:06.530> takes<00:03:07.010> on

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
some really interesting takes on

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.240 
some really interesting takes on
textures<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.560> interesting<00:03:09.560> takes<00:03:09.799> on<00:03:09.980> color

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
textures and interesting takes on color

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.890 
textures and interesting takes on color
it's<00:03:10.760> all<00:03:10.880> about<00:03:10.910> texture<00:03:11.420> rather<00:03:11.660> than

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
it's all about texture rather than

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.150 
it's all about texture rather than
pattern<00:03:12.290> which<00:03:12.470> i<00:03:12.590> think<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.950> nice

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
pattern which i think is a nice

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.890 
pattern which i think is a nice
interesting<00:03:13.519> take<00:03:13.880> on<00:03:14.060> things<00:03:14.269> it's<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.810> little

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
interesting take on things it's a little

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.930 
interesting take on things it's a little
quieter<00:03:15.140> which<00:03:15.860> i<00:03:16.010> think<00:03:16.070> that's<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.880> way

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
quieter which i think that's the way

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.970 
quieter which i think that's the way
things<00:03:17.239> have<00:03:17.450> been<00:03:17.480> moving<00:03:17.600> less<00:03:18.410> pattern<00:03:18.829> a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
things have been moving less pattern a

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.350 
things have been moving less pattern a
little<00:03:19.250> more<00:03:19.459> kind<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:19.940> texture<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:22.269> think<00:03:23.269> it's

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
little more kind of texture I think it's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.930 
little more kind of texture I think it's
perfect<00:03:23.780> for<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.459> for<00:03:25.459> what<00:03:25.579> we're<00:03:25.700> looking
