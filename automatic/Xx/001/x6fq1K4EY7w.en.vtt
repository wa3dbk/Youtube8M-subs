00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.750
 but we are here in madrid with gustavo 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.550
 can you do us some 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.040
 questions that the fans sent because 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.790
 the first time why did you decide to leave 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.100
 the nba and return to the truth that no 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.720
 they were a very easy decision but 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.240
 the decision at the end he took it because 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.300
 I come looking to play and play 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.040
 compete at a high level and reach a 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.230
 team as club as is real madrid 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.500
 is 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.870
 is to compete and fight for all 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.829
 titles that are played 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 and mainly it was 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.890
 I met this country my family also what 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.890
 I knew they are happy to be here 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.570
 basically what I was looking to accept is the 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.990
 called the national team if you're 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.940
 summoned 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.970
 well that's right now I'm focused 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.970
 in 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.070
 think only about the club is a season 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.900
 very long the last day 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 in the last game here is on 28 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.550
 June then the bet costs me 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.460
 think about this situation now 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.870
 What is it that I totally 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.090
 disconnected from any situation of 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.330
 the selection as two years 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.220
 previous where I had a lot of 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.350
 influence on what could be done or 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.930
 they took me into account in what could be 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.450
 now do not 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.360
 and he has only concentrated on the blooming 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 and that's it if you were dt of the selection 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.710
 national who you convocarÃ­as many 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.409
 very good players to mexico 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.260
 coach would have no problems doing 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.340
 a good team 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.670
 well I think I would not think that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.830
 I have 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.009
 I do not have the patience to be a coach 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.330
 although it is difficult to make a decision 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.080
 of the players that can 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.750
 I wanted to return to the nba 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.310
 Well now I have a contract of two 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.990
 years here in Madrid 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.990
 you never know what can happen to you 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.849
 if I go back to nba 2 and I stay here 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.630
 I just think about these two years that 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.630
 I have a contract 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.840
 what do you miss most about mexico and 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.200
 what is least missed in your Mexico 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.200
 I miss my family 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:36.350
 my country is always always strange is not 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.350
 It's strange to be in your house 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:45.020
 things that you have known during all your 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.990
 life and I do not have something that does not miss everything 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.120
 I have love and always in some 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.620
 moment what the sardine 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.140
 being so tall we have problems with 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.930
 European facilities beds by 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.620
 example the beds here are small 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.569
 summer in my house 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.239
 I have a camera he finds out about the 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:09.400
 We send to do not have the problem 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:12.930
 from here they are very small if they had 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.940
 act a movie would you be willing 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.850
 the basketball player I'm not an actor 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.890
 and I do not think it could be something like that 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.750
 I feel able to get into an area 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.590
 where I do not know and would be missing the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.990
 respect for the really actors is not 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.030
 as if an actor wants to come and want 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.010
 play basketball well that man too 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.510
 dedicate yourself to act better corrected me 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.700
 I dedicate to play and is that they are dedicated to 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.990
 right if you can touch I need that is 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.420
 some instrument because if you can play 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.870
 some in which which would be no I do not have 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.510
 no instrument and if I could play or 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.050
 if I had the facility to do it 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.950
 I would like to play the guitar 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.030
 I love music I'm a fan of the 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.460
 music in general I do not put something of the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.560
 that I can not stop doing in the day is 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.140
 listen to music or car I listen 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.030
 music before practice listens 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.090
 music then all the time I have the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.440
 music with me then something that 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.750
 would like to do at some point is 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.920
 learn to play guitar I listen a lot 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.150
 The Mexican band listens a lot to 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.150
 ballads in Spanish 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.030
 and finally I lean more for the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.819
 Mexican themes saving all 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.069
 fans thank you for the questions and 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.630

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:44.610

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.610
