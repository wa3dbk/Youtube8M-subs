00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.640
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.210
 tutorial with funds was not today 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.669
 on the big pc but here on 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.129
 my way of working top and would like 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.790
 I show you today as you in the 

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:32.480
 virtualbox at your operating system 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.180
 virtual operating system 16 9 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.670
 format can usually be set 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.480
 are only 4 3 format possible so 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:46.579
 For example, 1280 x 1024 pixel so 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.899
 but you can stretch that to 16 19 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.440
 or is there for it 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.940
 program that is supplied with it and so 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.370
 he goes only made only once as a 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.899
 right click on it and open the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.520
 file path from the installer 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.020
 Directory and best you invite 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.500
 the demand as 100 I have now 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.659
 here 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.689
 with it you can virtual drive 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.670
 create as this year beet rom 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.840
 drives and you can then disk 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.060
 embed images disk images but that 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.759
 Let's do it now, we'll go then 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.020
 just try it now 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.609
 Here out of here is a disk 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.039
 image provided there it is already 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:29.299
 virtualbox guest editions double click 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.569
 then it will automatically enter 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:39.380
 Next best drive included so times 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:42.020
 look for security there it is 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.310
 that is the drive g we need to have 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.520
 just look that at the operating systems 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.649
 where we want to install it now 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.899
 that there also involved the drive 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.899
 is automatic playback 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.760
 horst drive g if you do not know 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.560
 how it works 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.380
 I'm going to do that for a short while so then 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.980
 However, he goes on this little cd 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 here 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.840
 I will not do any medium then click 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.430
 I then I go here on this 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.500
 small button on it and we need 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.690
 a run experienced the drive is 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.860
 the moment ok and then we start 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.800
 the operating system is now 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.690
 asked for speed because you have f8 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.130
 Press this very quickly is in windows 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.100
 xp so that actually all windows 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.940
 version so you can short form boot menu 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.490
 or in front of the screen can yes 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.100
 menu if you often if so 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.209
 press 8 at the right point 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.209
 but could just choose like you 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.040
 want to start and this one 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.260
 direct3d what you install for it 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.300
 what must editions with these guests with 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.040
 is supplied you can only in the 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.959
 install safe mode therefore 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.970
 Let's start this now 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.890
 operating system in safe mode so 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.730
 until it has finished loading 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.730
 It went pretty fast 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.209
 we can not see 16 to 9 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.010
 so now have our virtual 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.450
 Operating system in safe mode 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.260
 that is now here with me windows 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.480
 xp at work in my case 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.319
 here at windows xp and there has the here 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.120
 will tv box edition is so we do 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.000
 we double click on it and then yes 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.030
 already the installer opened and 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 then we go through very important here 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.870
 The direct 3D support is two 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.870
 experimental 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.940
 but there you have to set the hook now 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.920
 he goes to install 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.120
 another point is during the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.340
 Installation come messages alerts 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.569
 So far the first one has been here so far 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.269
 comes because everything read through wonderful 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.470
 could click cancel 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.940
 but it does not work because of that 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.140
 i have tried it now i had to 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.870
 no errors now 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.850
 here just click on installations 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.950
 continue 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.290
 The zafira comes several times that makes you 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.700
 just like that and then he does 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.239
 he will do that now 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.239
 still stop 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:24.810
 So then it will start down then 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.150
 she is a little stupid with the new one 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.330
 the screen refreshes itself that way 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:35.750
 there is now started 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.750

 16 to 9 but we have the stand and 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.729
 now could look here too 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.039
 he goes to the 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.389
 presentation on settings and again 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:12.270
