00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello my friends are speaking here 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.970
 set and today I want to show you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.570
 like her in the league of legends 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.120
 exclamation click correctly and use four 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.009
 that stops everything if I know what 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.880
 The car tech conflict at all is that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.870
 I'll do that for a moment 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.640
 to explain 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 The order must be click is actually 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 only on terrys or of champions league 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.199
 ale or maybe clearly necessary because 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.789
 you can easily handle it better 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.730
 for example, if you play wayne and too 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.320
 Click the button to the auto tech move 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.450
 Ex set and you just ein 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.430
 you can easily pursue savage mouths 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.079
 always running back sometime 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.100
 just extract and think up too 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.320
 activate and then attack if 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.059
 Automatically mundo without you are allowed 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 right back to you right mouse 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.219
 haste clicked because the author tecan 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 move clicks with it automatically 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.059
 next opponent in your area 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.460
 attacks if it is in your environment eg in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.350
 the range of 100 1 million stands and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 in front of you in a range of 90 mundo 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.039
 then stands apart from the coupe 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.390
 click automatically on anywhere 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.239
 clicks with the outlook 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.840
 because mundo the next goal before yours 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.489
 champion is 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.590
 but now within a range of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.020
 100 million stand or reach 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.659
 from 110 behind it a mouth would stand 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.369
 would still click on the minis 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.400
 attack because the minions vormunde 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.930
 Of course , the author's cover 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.930
 must click not on million fans 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 effectively because we are with katharina 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.750
 is possible out of use is the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.159
 aim automatic next opponent 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.710
 and then walk up to him and it's 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.150
 actually totally unnecessary but me 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.290
 Of course, I want to show you and anyway 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
 from now on just the andy 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.650
 carroll churches and I will 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.840
 show them how he now best 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.909
 provides and uses therefore is 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.320
 right now we are here too 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.299
 already in game and now show surface 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 like that exactly with the ethics movement 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.500
 click works and that goes first 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.899
 on the settings and yes I am one 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.329
 a little bit upset and I would 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.040
 first of all my controls on the 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.119
 So look forward to the standards 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.880
 Reset condition to inner 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.890
 only for myself so my name was 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.520
 once fresh food and my item 1 x 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:14.099
 button 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:19.660
 and always okay and the counts normal 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.680
 smartcast all right so go now 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.510
 I go back to the settings or 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.489
 We could stay and gold once 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.049
 down to the rider player 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.290
 movement come in german power 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.150
 I do not know player movements 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.580
 do not know exactly we click there 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.000
 once on it and are now here 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.440
 different choices and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.420
 although once player move click 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.910
 playtech move click for it 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.459
 once deny others and once 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.829
 playtech move playtech moves actually 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.410
 the same as playtech move just click 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.450
 the perfect calls to say like nothing 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.230
 smart cast variant to times briefly 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.549
 away I then press I see my 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.560
 radius of my champion my 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.079
 commitment is all that pretty high 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.720
 and 256 and if I go somewhere now 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.349
 clique such now after here one would 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.470
 champion firmly after running here and then 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.730
 when he sees a champion someday 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.480
 immediately demanded the next champion 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.069
 attack 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.530
 So I hope it at least on the way 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:22.019
 there and I arrived here 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.019
 in waynes minions come immediately attack 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.829
 complete 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.380
 and when I come in rankweil which - come 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.459
 we grab these lines automatically 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.360
 if we have possession vettel 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.980
 beg 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.230
 the constellations and yes I wanted to have 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.180
 for once a piece and before the 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.520
 attack next opponent so forgive 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.130
 will go under player attack click 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.470
 Now that our ski is on I have this one 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.420
 now on Xbox because they have it even 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.110
 on the left stain because the left just 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.320
 never use 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.510
 and yes I have him now I'll stop it 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.970
 is ok if we are now extreme 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.830
 press runs when champion automatically 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.820
 to this animal or if one 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.800
 opponents in the range 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.959
 already before or during the way 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.459
 picture edition reaches for her named 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.579
 Run twice that a bit 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.769
 does the same damage can be 7 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.110
 and now can get press 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.580
 and if you attack enemies permanently 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.440
 so you can just come so well 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.240
 Actually also as activities in the 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.250
 just once legally does nothing 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.660
 right click right click and so can 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.110
 killing about one opponent you 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.700
 yes and that is with this tutorial 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.820
 I 'll just a little lab 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.560
 I also show us made again 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.729
 that you either shop because of me 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.900
 will not find internet anywhere 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.580
 A damp the then namely 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:58.990
 uploaded and can try if 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:04.340
 Run twice, run, run and run 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.510
