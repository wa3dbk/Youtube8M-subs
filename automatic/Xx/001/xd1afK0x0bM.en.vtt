00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.960
 check or positive feedback on 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.960
 photo test 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:34.430
 proceed huston you ok everything 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.950
 received ios 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.410
 but in the methane in her plant 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.800
 now I do 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.810
 the voice is a beautiful tool and something 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.950
 you can do very different things 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.020
 at the cinema in the theater 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.970
 I must say that the dubbing of a 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.970
 videogame is still something different 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.449
 it was an unexpected experience because 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.340
 in the dubbing you have another actor to whom 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.800
 give voice or the same in this case 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.619
 there was not a figure of reference, however, 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.780
 therefore it is beautiful because you have one 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.240
 clay part 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.850
 much wider is the possibility of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.510
 choose what kind of direction to give 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 the character 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:26.480
 and reason for intensity and we have to go 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.480
 do something 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.400
 becker woman here do not have to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.400
 take possession of each 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.999
 they open well 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.230
 to heaven the data, however, ethically 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.230
 maybe pole 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.120
 I get of there is a certain type of cinema 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.100
 that is lining up with video games 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.810
 and video games will launch a certain type 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.380
 of cinema in the sense that they are now two 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.580
 contexts that are inspired by each other 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.010
 I realize that over the years 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.020
 video games are increasingly similar to 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.360
 cinematic story where the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.760
 attempt is to make it 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.950
 spectator identifies and then the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.489
 player identifies with the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.260
 protagonist of the video game 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.860
 we experience different ones 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.860
 not some type 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.050
 you did really well
