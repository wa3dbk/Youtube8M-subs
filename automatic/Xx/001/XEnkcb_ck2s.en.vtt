00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
think that's where the women only track

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.910 
think that's where the women only track
days<00:02:08.069> win<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.229> made<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.500> feel

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
days win because you're not made to feel

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.559 
days win because you're not made to feel
that<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.730> fast

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
that you have to go fast

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.770 
that you have to go fast
