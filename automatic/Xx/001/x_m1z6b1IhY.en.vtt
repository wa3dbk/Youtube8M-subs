00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.499
 very good guys that as you are my 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.800
 name is genius 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:19.260
 today I bring you a real departure to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.000
 channel is enough to say that it is not mine since 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.010
 as you know I do not have the movie 4 no 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.650
 I have the beta so I've played two 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.890
 days in a row playing the beta thanks 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.779
 to a colleague that I have to because that has 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.970
 let go to his house to play today and the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.800
 another day was here in my house the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.990
 with the movie 4 so infinite thanks 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.520
 but this game is not my worth this 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.090
 game is better said 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.500
 this game is from the Lord I object 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.360
 thank you very much uncle you will have his channel 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.060
 in the description or this game 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.740
 ask that at least you take a look at 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.320
 your channel because it is an absolute beast 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.330
 bestiality better said starting for 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.460
 how little we carry of call of duty 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.850
 black ops 3 I'm talking about no more 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.510
 no less a streak of 59 weapons that is 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 almost a nuclear double without dying 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.320
 it's totally awesome so that it 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.510
 I do a little more or less employment and 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.420
 such guys tell you that I've put the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.520
 straight from that of the inexorable by 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.280
 which has almost 20 straight lines 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.010
 that soon you will really see the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.170
 nuclear as I say is totally 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.760
 awesome what job is I follow 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.850
 seeing it and I do not believe it goes 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.350
 wielding the excuse and if I remember correctly 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 that is called this weapon that is like the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.280
 five major of all the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.010
 colloquia at least reminds me with 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.080
 a pretty cool camouflage not 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.940
 I know or in general the gameplay is very 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.070
 ok so it has to be said that the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.120
 gameplay lasts quite the kid 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 play how to say it 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.950
 play smart so we're going to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.960
 leave it in smart kids very 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.030
 Smart playing is not played in 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 no time and as I say not going to 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.620
 watch die anywhere in the gameplay 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.770
 only dies three times as you are seeing 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.810
 there are 27 3 and no more die, that is, no 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.840
 I'm going to spoiler the final result and 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.280
 you know a fucking streak of 59 and since the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.290
 boy has taken this authentic 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.930
 heading then you have to give it your 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.390
 recognition so I hope you leave 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.790
 Many of you like me in this video and I hope 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.650
 also that well then that up to 6 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.880
 your channel at least to throw a 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.560
 look and such 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.960
 there is a lot of game left much game 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.120
 It's going to cost me a lot to comment on this 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.920
 departure since it is quite long and I 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.750
 I'm going to leave my voice because it's not the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.400
 first time I'm commenting already this 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.310
 departure is already the third or fourth since 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.980
 I want it to be as good as possible 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.750
 so to say it as I say guys is that or 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.520
 I'm commenting on the game and I've 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.910
 been freaking seriously with the game 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.530
 what is it is that it is very shabby to take this 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.850
 type of game you already know that good 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.550
 most of youtubers have taken a 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.400
 nuclear yes but think that this is a 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.100
 almost double nuclear in a network of 59 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.480
 weapons or is it a bitch of this place I 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.520
 I'm already calling from the game to guys 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.820
 just enjoy the background 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.040
 while I say 45 nonsense and nothing 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.280
 you know that well tomorrow the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.850
 Beta on Sunday 23rd is a pity 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.180
 ends the beta for then that for what 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.180
 it's been 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.750
 whites 3 in 4 and 26 in xbox one 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.840
 that of course I'll play it but the 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.810
 I will play very little I do not know how much longer 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.190
 that I'm probably going to cruise this 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.890
 next week I do not have the date yet 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.860
 clear so you can not say anything 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.840
 files just that I'll play it 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.730
 I will try to bring you some light that another 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.380
 since I will be able to play myself in my little house 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.170
 with the command of the one that is with which 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.110
 I have precision and such and nothing simply 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.870
 that I will try to bring you the best 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.610
 possible real guys that I have a lot 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.670
 hai for playing the beta as I say I have 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.760
 two days playing the bird board but not 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.640
 there is way that is, there is no way to 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.270
 get a good streak bitch since it 's 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.850
 they burst me 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.680
 I have to upload a couple video a couple of 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.670
 more white 3 videos that I want to upload 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.560
 those who try so I want to talk about 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.110
 my opinion about the game about the beta 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.640
 rather, since it's a beta and a lot 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.170
 people complain about the connection there 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.459
 today he is playing even if he is my friend and 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.650
 yes, it 's true that it's going badly 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.560
 but guys for that is 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.600
 this beta is you are really 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.420
 for it to do connection test 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.490
 to do test of response for 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.220
 balance the weapons all or really 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.720
 this beta is made for this so 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.610
 nothing will have to wait for the version 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.400
 end of the game the truth is that I have 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.080
 a lot of granitas for those who 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.470
 ask if the final version of the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.680
 I'm going to play it in play four if 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.780
 I'm not going to play in teams one 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.450
 probably the game on playstation 4 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.250
 since for and already I will surely have 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.350
 money saved enough to 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.180
 buy me the movie 4 and if not then the 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.180
 I will play in teams wanda this Christmas that 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.520
 I bought the playstation 4 many you say 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.310
 the partner the partner and the partner I do not know 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.700
 I do not know less because no guys are not going 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.030
 to stop 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.330
 I wish I gave for so much it does not give so much 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.640
 and nothing graphic stays a while 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.650
 I think the best thing is going to be goodbye and 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.820
 that you end up seeing her with 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.060
 your own eyes 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.370
