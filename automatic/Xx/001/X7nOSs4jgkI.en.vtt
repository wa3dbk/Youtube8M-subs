the<00:00:22.500> last<00:00:22.560> few<00:00:23.010> years<00:00:23.070> I've<00:00:23.550> tried<00:00:23.850> cheaper

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the last few years I've tried cheaper

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.660 
the last few years I've tried cheaper
alternatives<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.590> Chinese<00:00:25.949> made<00:00:26.250> sheng

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670

gu<00:00:26.880> SG<00:00:27.449> 108<00:00:28.019> which<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:29.010> cheap<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
gu SG 108 which was really cheap and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.260

then<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.090> op<00:00:30.359> tikka<00:00:30.900> vm<00:00:31.320> 200<00:00:32.009> not<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.820> chief

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
then this op tikka vm 200 not as chief

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.819 
then this op tikka vm 200 not as chief
but<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> did<00:00:33.840> get<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> cheaper<00:00:34.350> than<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.620> price

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
but I did get a cheaper than this price

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.740 
but I did get a cheaper than this price

on-screen this one especially who

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
on-screen this one especially who
actually<00:00:36.960> sounded<00:00:37.530> pretty<00:00:37.680> good<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.250> neither

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
actually sounded pretty good but neither

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.119 
actually sounded pretty good but neither
of<00:00:39.000> them<00:00:39.149> compared<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.500> quality<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
of them compared to the quality of the

of them compared to the quality of the
rode<00:00:41.280> videomic<00:00:41.610> series<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.510> last<00:00:42.899> year<00:00:43.110> rode

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930 
released the video mic go for 100
dollars<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> far<00:00:47.010> simpler<00:00:47.370> microphone

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
dollars it's a far simpler microphone

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 
dollars it's a far simpler microphone
than<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.570> other<00:00:48.690> products<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.350> no

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
than there are other products with no

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
than there are other products with no
switches<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.100> controls<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.700> mic<00:00:50.850> itself

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
switches or controls on the mic itself

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.360 
switches or controls on the mic itself
it's<00:00:51.780> also<00:00:51.960> phantom<00:00:52.559> powered<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it's also phantom powered so you have to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.889 
it's also phantom powered so you have to
make<00:00:53.520> sure<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:53.940> camera<00:00:54.270> supports<00:00:54.719> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
make sure that your camera supports that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.590 
make sure that your camera supports that
surprisingly<00:00:55.800> my<00:00:56.070> gh2<00:00:56.430> supports<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.480> an

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
surprisingly my gh2 supports it with an

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900 
surprisingly my gh2 supports it with an
adapter<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.230> went<00:00:58.379> 3.5<00:00:59.010> milimeter<00:00:59.460> female

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
adapter that went 3.5 milimeter female

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330 
adapter that went 3.5 milimeter female
it's<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> 2.5<00:01:00.989> millimeter<00:01:01.410> male<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> say

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it's a 2.5 millimeter male but I say

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.860 
it's a 2.5 millimeter male but I say
surprisingly<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.329> when<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> was

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
surprisingly because when I was

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
surprisingly because when I was
researching<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.799> looked<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> lot<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
researching this I looked in a lot of

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.609 
researching this I looked in a lot of
places<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.479> lot<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> people<00:01:07.049> said<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
places and a lot of people said that the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.289 
places and a lot of people said that the
GH<00:01:07.920> 2<00:01:08.159> didn't<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.610> phantom<00:01:09.030> powered

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
GH 2 didn't do phantom powered

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.870 
GH 2 didn't do phantom powered
microphones<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> noticed<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
microphones but then I noticed in one of

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.130 
microphones but then I noticed in one of
the<00:01:11.970> test<00:01:12.180> videos<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.960> wrote

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the test videos put up I wrote

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200 
the test videos put up I wrote
themselves<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.950> said<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:15.000> here

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
themselves they said that this one here

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.830 
themselves they said that this one here
was<00:01:15.450> shot<00:01:15.720> using<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.500> GH<00:01:16.950> 2<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.939> went<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
