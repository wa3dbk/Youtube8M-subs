we<00:01:37.160> had<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.310> Kickstarter<00:01:37.520> project<00:01:37.820> that<00:01:38.300> went

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
we had a Kickstarter project that went

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.600 
we had a Kickstarter project that went
through<00:01:38.690> March<00:01:39.080> where<00:01:39.770> we<00:01:39.860> blew<00:01:40.130> our<00:01:40.250> goal<00:01:40.460> out

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
through March where we blew our goal out

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.580 
through March where we blew our goal out
of<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.760> water<00:01:40.940> we<00:01:41.090> put<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.420> $10,000<00:01:42.200> goal<00:01:42.470> we

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
of the water we put up a $10,000 goal we

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.080 
of the water we put up a $10,000 goal we
thought<00:01:42.740> we'd<00:01:42.860> sell<00:01:43.010> about<00:01:43.160> 20<00:01:43.610> Zboard

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
thought we'd sell about 20 Zboard

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.850 
thought we'd sell about 20 Zboard
and<00:01:44.570> instead<00:01:44.870> on<00:01:45.170> Kickstarter<00:01:45.620> we've<00:01:45.710> sold

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
and instead on Kickstarter we've sold

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.210 
and instead on Kickstarter we've sold
about<00:01:46.210> 375<00:01:47.210> Z<00:01:47.450> boards<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.680> right<00:01:48.830> now<00:01:48.980> we're

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
about 375 Z boards so right now we're

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.310 
about 375 Z boards so right now we're
ramping<00:01:49.700> our<00:01:50.300> manufacturing<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.110> kind<00:01:51.260> of

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
ramping our manufacturing to kind of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
ramping our manufacturing to kind of
meet<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.770> demand

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
meet that demand

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.260 
meet that demand
so<00:01:53.020> since<00:01:54.020> CES<00:01:54.500> because<00:01:55.220> of<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.460> overwhelming

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
so since CES because of the overwhelming

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.360 
so since CES because of the overwhelming
response<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.230> we<00:01:57.320> received<00:01:57.370> especially
