 Barragon Movement and a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.330
 Another way to cure back pain 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.170
 I'm the guy that I am doing Kedomo I would like to talk about it 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.230
 8 It is saying that clam shell awareness physical therapy 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.500
 There is a book called the String Health Policy. 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.030
 And book rests is quite that 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.970
 It's about it 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.559
 Good looking 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:37.050
 When it is difficult, I will talk about it a bit confusingly theoretical but I will talk a little bit 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:39.700
 90% of the people in Toyo Toyo are 8 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.630
 I have a backache but that 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.990
 90% of those who have had back pain also 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.180
 It is a human 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.660
 The right foot seems to be long 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.280
 A person with a long right leg 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:02.890
 I'm going down I am here with heavy here because it is in the left of the heart 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.810
 And put the weight on the left foot when there is no and you are standing right foot 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.500
 If there is a person 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.500
 So really 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.320
 You can judge 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:19.140
 And the characteristic of long-legged people is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:24.760
 Lie flat is not it still legs when lying me this is Masu Komie 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:28.460
 And get down who crab on the inside It is sometimes so was I'd best seen in their own 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:34.159
 Almost normal people have left foot 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.480
 Bae data Ntte or only line Well However right foot in this kind of felt until the middle even if the inside 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.000
 Do not have 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:44.010
 That the wheat foot What this mean? 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.010
 Because it is open 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.020
 It is good to live here 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.050
 But good 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.090
 It is the left foot eh To 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.170
 I'm stuck here inside 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.759
 It will be said that this will be three copies from the side 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.759
 For example , you are now standing in the ruling party 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:11.170
 Please ask for an exit and leave in Hirai 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:16.180
 Then I think that the pelvis was the corner 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:21.930
 And go for now this vertical of the inner thigh and leg 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 Then I think that the pelvis was out butt came out 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.810
 Open 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.810
 If you open it and listen in front of the pelvis , you will know the pelvis 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.060
 For example the mon, such 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.380
 I think I want 'em to say doing 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.460
 left hand 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.900
 And feet opens that eh ordinary people the right foot is longer 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:52.620
 Right foot left foot is getting shorter 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.290
 That means the left foot is open 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.860
 My right foot is cow 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.510
 Pelvis 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.600
 I'm twisted like this 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.960
 Different kinda fancy those who are open 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.660
 Close it with 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:14.150
 Easy to put the weight on the left foot drinking is twisted without knowing Teru with screws 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.150
 And it is easy to come out from the right foot when walking 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.990
 Weight on left foot when standing 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.690
 It has become common 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.710
 In the book of 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:33.230
 Because it should not be doing is it has become most well applications 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:37.310
 First of all right foot is big + this is for better it is better to quit 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.000
 I can do this with my left foot in front 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.890
 There is Atsuko Ogi 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.720
 It is not good to burn 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.290
 And when you open things up you always know the right 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.290
 lift 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:59.069
 And when you stand up, you should always put your weight on your right foot 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.069
 It went name 's thing and reverse until now 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.840
 You understand 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.040
 That saying 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.710
 It is difficult but I sold it myself 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:12.560
 I do not think whether it has been found also for 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.500
 And that 's why I 'm doing it on my mind both day with instrumental music and I am doing my own pelvic correction 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.250
 Because of 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.260
 That's right, with long legs 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.670
 When you put your right foot 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.850
 By shifting a little 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.290
 And 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.870
 In this way this left foot 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:32.320
 It is Irun doing this in lightly advocacy to please in that 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.689
 And half a step tiger the right foot and do a headache 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.240
 Or it is or earlier whiff of it's land dissatisfaction or that security is out with security 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.569
 Because 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.120
 This is a bit open 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.740
 Even this is rooted 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.030
 Here 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.050
 Komu twist Alternate this and Gutte of the right foot 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.529
 Careless 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.580
 By all means not to come to the left pelvis 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.590
 Because 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:07.169
 The fear of hitting each other 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:10.849
 I'll do it in such a way that I'm screwing in the right side of the hole . 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.849
 Well this 100 times or so 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.160
 do it 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.139
 I do a lot of times when I am in a bad condition 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.009
 And be sure the child to go with that 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:27.199
 Be alphared 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:29.720
 When the people of the right foot before the right foot is thought that Na has been distorted a little is prone Do Toka pelvis before 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.060
 I'm sure I'm doing this 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.060
 It is Mairi you and the left foot of Kana after doing this 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.639

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.090

 I think I 'm working and this state name is quite sleepy 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:31.340
 If you get used to it, this is easy to throw 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:32.760
 When I go to bed , Vata crotch opens, pelvis opens and l nya does not heal

 A bad person should read by all means in front of the water building 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.690
 It's totally different just to tie and sleep 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:06.360
 It was difficult but 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.889
