00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.390
 friends it's a nice to be greeted I hope 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.670
 find all very well and today 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.830
 I have more 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.100
 questions that answers 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.870
 because semiotics get wet salutes two 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.180
 days 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.030
 why 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.680
 many times even if it does not rain 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.279
 we found that there is water delayed from 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.310
 in in this case and it is not 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.650
 specifically this brand happens to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.650
 other brands happens to the aforementioned 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.050
 and most are semi optical 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.170
 polycarbonate 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 one of the explanations is that it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.540
 produces a condensation the only one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.100
 It happens in the windows of our 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.690
 houses in the videos of our houses 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.640
 when it's cold outside and inside 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.960
 in droplets of water the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 humidity 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.130
 and we find now 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.129
 in this case when we turn on the lights 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.560
 barnacles generate heat when you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.930
 increases the power to the lamps 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.720
 they generate a lot of heat 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.730
 and then that may be one of the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.730
 causes that contribute to grow 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.950
 get wet 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.149
 fill with water 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.149
 what you have to do is 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.050
 relatively simple you have to leave it 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.590
 The sun should be taken out of the lamps 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.560
 others so that when it evaporates have 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.730
 where to leave and also what is 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.960
 You can check because many times 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.400
 is another one of the answers 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.740
 there are some frustrations this 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.450
 we go one day that it rains and when 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.490
 we found that it is wet it can be 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.890
 that need a seal sell 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.890
 on the board because this video comes out 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 and this good I hope you help me 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.789
 with some other answer 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.189
 possible causes why you can 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.189
 wet one means greetings
