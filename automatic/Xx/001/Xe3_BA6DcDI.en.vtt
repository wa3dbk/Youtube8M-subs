00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.319
 Hi all 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.490
 I'm going to do an analysis of the entire staff of Barcelona 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.280
 that by the way I do not know how they resist without killing each other of how badly 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.789
 they play 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.199
 buoy start before he vomits 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.249
 we go there with the goalkeepers 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.070
 This is Victor Víctor 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.980
 a brat who got out of junior euros because he sings more than bustamante in the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.819
 fight and it is the most irregular that is never seen 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.959
 josé pinto a goalkeeper signed in extremis by the fucking directive of 

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:31.319
 barsa and that although it is not bad will not play a holy minute for the affection that 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.100
 they have to valdés that I do not know where they take it 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.140
 now all the defenses 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.080
 gabi milito 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.990
 this is a poor Argentine central who came to Spain looking for work and what 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.360
 found as meteos tias del barsa 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.100
 Rafa Marquez This guy, more than a football player, is a character from the heart 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.670
 He goes out with his girlfriends in all the magazines in the world like 10 or 20 times 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.490
 per week 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.570
 a pure and hard beast taken from the African jungle 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.320
 why he has that tangle of hairs 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.390
 He knows how to do two things and take penalties in order 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.400
 gianluca zambrota 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.750
 this is an Italian that to be clear is like all the other Italians 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.310
 he plays the balls alex tremo until he gets tired and breaks his throat several times 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.230
 sylvinho 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.910
 another one that I do not know what he looks like in the barsa because he's a super mediocre player 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.350
 like the barsa hahaha xd what good 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.970
 Hahaha 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.100
 come now 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.090
 lilian thuram to the colleague this one should call him grandfather 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 veteran 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.740
 old shit or whatever you want but the fact is that it is no longer age to play 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.250
 football 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.560
 retire bastard 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.920
 abidal a black of the beast's whole life 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.910
 fast and strong 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.500
 the pity is that in one of his careers the poor man must have lost his brain 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.290
 circus 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.570
 eo how does this sucker want to be called 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.960
 is really the one that unbalances the entire staff with their shits 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.340
 independence 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.260
 how it happened 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.100
 It is also a foyer like the lion's cathedral 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.450
 they are already giving me retreats we go with the means 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.530
 if vielman des this payment was the best of the best but time passes and no 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.770
 he forgives and the poor man can no longer with his ass 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.740
 He only knows perpers because what is running ceased to exist for him 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.009
 many years 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.929
 André iniesta really one of the few who are saved 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.109
 just give you an Andrew advice if you want to win something at least 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:21.920
 have fun 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.739
 come out of this team but now 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:24.480
 edmilson 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.229
 Maybe someone has seen him play this guy 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:31.159
 if it is not for injuries by trip and if not for the simple fact of being a bad 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.400
 a turkey that although the port was the cock came to the barsa and had a year 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.519
 medium good to then shoot and not play like all the cases that only want 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.259
 money 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.299
 touré yaya 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.309
 this player is the team's scorer what a shame he does not know how to play football 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:47.439
 Hahaha 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.200
 my mother I'm getting dizzy 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.859
 now the forwards 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.289
 script are 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.579
 aa 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.769
 just look at this thing makes me want to kill myself 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.519
 it's the worst I've seen on a football field 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.969
 my god let's move on to another one please 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:04.989
 samuel eto'o 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.590
 a Cameroonian bastard who only knows how to create shit through that mouth 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.369
 swollen to hosts that has 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.299
 if you play as much as you talk 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.669
 you would be the host 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:18.099
 ronaldiño the one who was the best player in the world who now only knows how to drink 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.479
 was to give and not to train 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.469
 the barsa wants to start but no longer want any equipment 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.609
 that pringao 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.699
 thierry henry 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.429
 another one for the club that is like that 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.879
 was the host and although the one that had retained 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.879
 It has not been the same since he arrived at the barsa 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.259
 I do not know what to say about this turkey because I have not seen him play in all of history 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.199
 of the barsa every time this is more painful 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.859
 two saints a young Mexican promise that plays the last two minutes of 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.859
 every game and I hope he leaves the barsa so he can improve 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:54.749
 Yes it is very good and it makes many sailors but it does against getafe 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.889
 valencia or recreational 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.059
 against Manchester the madrid or the liverpool does not move a shit 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:03.439
 Last but not least 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.789
 on the contrary it is the most important boyan quirquinchos 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.669
 a very young player who 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.609
 for the good of Spanish football receive an offer from Madrid and go there to 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.079
 exploit all its quality because it has to give and take 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.579
 greetings to all the Madridistas 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.120
 goodbye
