hey<00:00:00.810> guys<00:00:00.960> for<00:00:01.140> your<00:00:01.230> technology<00:00:01.560> what<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.159> have

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hey guys for your technology what I have

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.150 
hey guys for your technology what I have
here<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.120> iphone<00:00:03.270> 6<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.350> iphone<00:00:04.830> 6

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
here is the iphone 6 and the iphone 6

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.639 
here is the iphone 6 and the iphone 6
plus<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.910> we're<00:00:06.330> going<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.509> be<00:00:06.629> doing<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.109> speed

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
plus and we're going to be doing a speed

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.530 
plus and we're going to be doing a speed
test<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.220> both<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.490> these<00:00:08.730> just<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> see<00:00:09.389> what

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
test on both of these just to see what

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.110 
test on both of these just to see what
type<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.750> LTE<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.400> type<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.610> Wi-Fi

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
type of LTE and what type of Wi-Fi

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.120 
type of LTE and what type of Wi-Fi
speeds<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.750> these<00:00:12.960> get<00:00:13.259> now<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:14.099> fair

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
speeds that these get now to be fair

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.730 
speeds that these get now to be fair
both<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.670> these<00:00:14.730> are<00:00:14.969> running<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.690> telus<00:00:16.350> LTE

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
both of these are running on telus LTE

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.380 
both of these are running on telus LTE
as<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.400> see<00:00:17.550> both<00:00:17.730> at<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> top<00:00:18.210> right

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
as you can see both at the top right

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.910 
as you can see both at the top right
there<00:00:18.600> they<00:00:18.750> both<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.170> looks<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> same

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
there they both have looks like the same

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
there they both have looks like the same
amount<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.340> bars<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.880> we'll<00:00:21.630> also<00:00:21.810> show<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
amount of bars and we'll also show you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.170 
amount of bars and we'll also show you
that<00:00:22.590> there<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.980> no<00:00:23.189> other<00:00:23.369> applications

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that there is no other applications

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.540 
that there is no other applications
running<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:25.019> these<00:00:25.260> devices<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.010> moment

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
running on these devices at the moment

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.150 
running on these devices at the moment
so<00:00:27.119> we'll<00:00:27.390> use<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.930> popular<00:00:28.380> speed<00:00:28.710> test<00:00:28.980> app

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
so we'll use the popular speed test app

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580 
so we'll use the popular speed test app
so<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.060> will<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.660> into<00:00:30.869> those<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.349> well

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
so we will go right into those as well

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.340 
so we will go right into those as well
and<00:00:31.980> i'll<00:00:32.790> actually<00:00:32.940> swipe<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.079> show

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and i'll actually swipe up just to show

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.740 
and i'll actually swipe up just to show
you<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.620> there's<00:00:35.040> no<00:00:35.309> other<00:00:35.910> things<00:00:36.390> running

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you that there's no other things running

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.830 
you that there's no other things running
and<00:00:37.020> everything<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.620> completely<00:00:38.160> fair<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.090> we

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and everything is completely fair and we

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
and everything is completely fair and we
will<00:00:39.989> also<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.530> sure<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.040> are<00:00:41.219> both

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
will also make sure that these are both

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
will also make sure that these are both
running<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> same<00:00:42.120> servers<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.989> once

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
running on the same servers so once

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.279 
running on the same servers so once
burnaby<00:00:43.860> ones<00:00:44.420> delta<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.660> we'll<00:00:45.809> switch<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
burnaby ones delta so we'll switch to

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.510 
burnaby ones delta so we'll switch to
the<00:00:46.410> burnaby<00:00:47.870> server<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.649> we'll

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the burnaby server right here and we'll

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.299 
the burnaby server right here and we'll
go<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> speed<00:00:51.570> test<00:00:51.780> begin<00:00:52.260> test<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.890> i

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
go to the speed test begin test and i

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
go to the speed test begin test and i
will<00:00:53.489> begin<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.300> exactly<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> same

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
will begin these at exactly the same

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.750 
will begin these at exactly the same
time<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.800> fair<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> we'll<00:00:56.370> use<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
time just to be fair and we'll use the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
time just to be fair and we'll use the
same<00:00:57.030> bandwidth<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.660> everything<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.949> two

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
same bandwidth and everything so one two

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.009 
same bandwidth and everything so one two
three<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:01.670> we'll<00:01:02.670> let<00:01:03.000> those<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> we'll

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
three and we'll let those go and we'll

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.600 
three and we'll let those go and we'll
see<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.320> type<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> results<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.100> get

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.600 

so<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.330> got<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.480> pang<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.930> 38<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> iphone<00:01:14.340> 6

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so we got a pang of 38 on the iphone 6

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.630 
so we got a pang of 38 on the iphone 6
and<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.000> ping<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.480> 94<00:01:16.320> milliseconds<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and a ping of 94 milliseconds on the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.260 
and a ping of 94 milliseconds on the
iphone<00:01:17.970> 6<00:01:18.150> plus<00:01:19.310> looks<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.670> speeds<00:01:21.090> are

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
iphone 6 plus looks like this speeds are

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.460 
iphone 6 plus looks like this speeds are
very<00:01:21.660> similar<00:01:22.910> so<00:01:23.910> there<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.320> 26.5<00:01:25.320> 2

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
very similar so there we go 26.5 2

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.740 
very similar so there we go 26.5 2
megabits<00:01:25.800> per<00:01:25.920> seconds<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> iphone<00:01:27.180> 6<00:01:27.360> 20

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
megabits per seconds on the iphone 6 20

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
megabits per seconds on the iphone 6 20
8.09<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.830> iphone<00:01:29.130> 6<00:01:29.370> plus<00:01:29.870> and<00:01:31.970> upload

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
8.09 on the iphone 6 plus and upload

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.250 
8.09 on the iphone 6 plus and upload
speeds<00:01:33.210> we've<00:01:33.810> got<00:01:34.160> 13.4<00:01:35.160> for<00:01:35.760> on<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.810> iphone

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
speeds we've got 13.4 for on the iphone

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.430 
speeds we've got 13.4 for on the iphone
6<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.650> 14<00:01:38.160> point<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.880> 3<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> iphone<00:01:40.200> 6

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
6 and 14 point for 3 on the iphone 6

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.310 
6 and 14 point for 3 on the iphone 6
plus<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> does<00:01:41.580> look<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.840> results

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
plus so it does look like the results

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.420 
plus so it does look like the results
are<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.830> very<00:01:44.250> similar<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.400> fair

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
are very very similar and so to be fair

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.390 
are very very similar and so to be fair
will<00:01:47.759> actually<00:01:48.119> change<00:01:49.080> servers<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:50.009> we'll

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
will actually change servers here we'll

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.130 
will actually change servers here we'll
go<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.750> vancouver<00:01:51.750> bc<00:01:52.610> change<00:01:53.610> server

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
go to vancouver bc change server

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.740 
go to vancouver bc change server
vancouver<00:01:55.140> bc<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:56.940> restart<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
vancouver bc and we will restart this

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.600 
vancouver bc and we will restart this
test<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> we'll<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.830> what<00:01:58.950> type<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.160> results

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
test and we'll see what type of results

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.609 
test and we'll see what type of results
when<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.509> restarted<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.560> we

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
when we get when we restarted so here we

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:09.340 
when we get when we restarted so here we

considerably<00:04:23.950> slower<00:04:24.340> than<00:04:24.610> my<00:04:25.270> older<00:04:25.540> place

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
considerably slower than my older place

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.180 
considerably slower than my older place
I<00:04:25.870> lived<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.260> but<00:04:26.500> it's<00:04:26.740> something<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.160> just

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
I lived in but it's something I just

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.600 
I lived in but it's something I just
have<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.520> deal<00:04:27.760> with<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.410> will<00:04:29.410> actually<00:04:29.860> show

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
have to deal with and will actually show

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.100 
have to deal with and will actually show
you<00:04:30.639> those<00:04:30.880> results<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:31.419> as<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.750> can<00:04:31.870> see

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
you those results so as you can see

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.469 
you those results so as you can see
looks<00:04:32.560> like<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.860> iphone<00:04:33.340> 6<00:04:33.610> plus<00:04:33.700> again<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.450> a

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
looks like the iphone 6 plus again is a

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.080 
looks like the iphone 6 plus again is a
little<00:04:35.139> bit<00:04:35.260> faster<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.580> will<00:04:36.910> change

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
little bit faster and will change

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.930 
little bit faster and will change
servers<00:04:37.510> again<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.990> we'll<00:04:38.590> see<00:04:39.040> here<00:04:39.610> let's

servers again and we'll see here let's

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.330 
servers again and we'll see here let's
go<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.360> let's<00:04:41.020> go<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.350> Bellingham<00:04:42.100> Washington

Washington<00:04:50.460> will<00:04:51.460> go<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.639> speed<00:04:52.000> test<00:04:52.300> and

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
Washington will go to speed test and

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:03.100 
Washington will go to speed test and
we'll<00:04:53.889> go<00:04:54.280> five<00:04:55.060> four<00:04:55.479> three<00:04:55.510> two<00:04:55.960> one<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:57.010> go

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.830 

and<00:05:03.230> we<00:05:03.980> got<00:05:04.100> 26<00:05:04.760> millisecond<00:05:05.330> ping<00:05:05.570> on<00:05:05.810> the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
and we got 26 millisecond ping on the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.260 
and we got 26 millisecond ping on the
iphone<00:05:06.290> 6<00:05:06.530> 34<00:05:07.220> millisecond<00:05:07.820> ping<00:05:08.000> on<00:05:08.180> the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
iphone 6 34 millisecond ping on the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.890 
iphone 6 34 millisecond ping on the
iphone<00:05:08.660> 6<00:05:08.990> plus<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:10.390> again<00:05:11.390> it<00:05:11.540> looks<00:05:11.570> like

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
iphone 6 plus and again it looks like

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.010 
iphone 6 plus and again it looks like
the<00:05:12.050> 6<00:05:12.290> plus<00:05:12.500> has<00:05:12.680> faster<00:05:13.100> speeds<00:05:13.520> so<00:05:14.330> we<00:05:14.840> got<00:05:14.990> a

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
the 6 plus has faster speeds so we got a

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.760 
the 6 plus has faster speeds so we got a
9.3<00:05:15.650> 8<00:05:16.130> megabits<00:05:16.670> per<00:05:16.760> second<00:05:17.240> download<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:18.290> a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
9.3 8 megabits per second download and a

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.310 
9.3 8 megabits per second download and a
13-point<00:05:19.490> 86<00:05:20.000> megabits<00:05:20.540> per<00:05:20.630> second<00:05:21.170> download

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
13-point 86 megabits per second download

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.440 
13-point 86 megabits per second download
on<00:05:21.680> these<00:05:21.830> 6<00:05:22.070> plus<00:05:23.590> and<00:05:24.730> OH<00:05:25.730> point<00:05:25.940> nine<00:05:26.090> to

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
on these 6 plus and OH point nine to

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.830 
on these 6 plus and OH point nine to
upload<00:05:27.140> on<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.470> six<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:27.950> a<00:05:28.130> 1.0<00:05:28.850> one<00:05:29.090> on<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.570> 6

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
upload on the six and a 1.0 one on the 6

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.290 
upload on the six and a 1.0 one on the 6
plus<00:05:30.200> so<00:05:30.950> there<00:05:31.430> you<00:05:31.520> have<00:05:31.580> it<00:05:31.700> guys<00:05:31.790> I<00:05:32.090> didn't

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
plus so there you have it guys I didn't

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.880 
plus so there you have it guys I didn't
know<00:05:32.360> myself<00:05:32.540> which<00:05:32.990> one<00:05:33.170> would<00:05:33.290> be<00:05:33.410> faster<00:05:33.800> it

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
know myself which one would be faster it

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.950 
know myself which one would be faster it
was<00:05:34.010> completely<00:05:34.460> a<00:05:34.580> test<00:05:34.910> at<00:05:35.090> random<00:05:35.480> here<00:05:35.810> and

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
was completely a test at random here and

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.080 
was completely a test at random here and
it<00:05:36.770> does<00:05:36.980> look<00:05:37.160> like<00:05:37.280> this<00:05:37.460> speeds<00:05:37.790> that<00:05:37.940> you

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
it does look like this speeds that you

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.570 
it does look like this speeds that you
do<00:05:38.270> get<00:05:38.510> on<00:05:38.720> the<00:05:38.960> six<00:05:39.230> plus<00:05:39.500> are<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.800> little<00:05:40.370> bit

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
do get on the six plus are a little bit

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.050 
do get on the six plus are a little bit
faster<00:05:41.240> not<00:05:41.900> by<00:05:42.110> a<00:05:42.140> whole<00:05:42.470> lot<00:05:42.860> amounts<00:05:43.370> but<00:05:43.670> if

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
faster not by a whole lot amounts but if

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.640 
faster not by a whole lot amounts but if
you<00:05:44.360> definitely<00:05:44.780> want<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.050> best<00:05:45.230> of<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.440> best

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
you definitely want the best of the best

you definitely want the best of the best
and<00:05:45.740> you<00:05:45.860> want<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.190> faster<00:05:46.580> speeds

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
and you want the faster speeds

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.030 
and you want the faster speeds
definitely<00:05:47.480> go<00:05:47.810> with<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:47.990> six<00:05:48.200> plus<00:05:48.470> there
