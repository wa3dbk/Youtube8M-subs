00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 what have I been doing for five years 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 guitars ah yes yes an insured expert 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:19.160
 still focus on artists who 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.160
 causes admiration and jealousy 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.810
 2 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.400
 he 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.400
 well my life 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.020
 hi to all these civilians and today 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.520
 I will show you the bags 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.770
 features to recognize a 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.960
 musician be careful if you are a musician 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.580
 it is possible that you discover a 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.980
 hidden part of your personality 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.260
 but at 1 the musician is a mythomaniac 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.910
 you will always hear from 6 n 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.190
 Nancy did not do much 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.270
 girls do not they do not like too much 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.790
 the musicians 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.340
 ah I missed on this song I 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.300
 do not know why but to my ears that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.610
 sounds wrong what they say 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:08.130
 because in reality they do rather know 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 not very well played number 2 the musician 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.250
 is a passionate and when I say 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.710
 passionate he still passes the de 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.570
 9% of his time on his instrument 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:26.119
 when we get up in the morning we come back to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.119
 school my right therapy at night 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.520
 and of course he can no longer part with it 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:39.869
 why he sleeps with he eats with them 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.649
 play together they dress at no but 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.899
 I tell you a number 3 the musician is 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.580
 an artist and when I say to 6 of course 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.899
 we immediately think of professional 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.119
 and of course you are a little impression 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.619
 as if it was too easy for them to 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.280
 play their instruments but that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.280
 get angry 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:10.599
 but what we can read 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:12.550
 his mother while you ah no I'm 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.160
 still missed and of course that says 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.860
 professionalism of i popularity and 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.190
 popularity is equal to it can all be 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.410
 to allow to babes hi beauty you 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.840
 want to go play my instrument 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.290
 further by talking about everything 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.819
 to permit 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.500
 there is a phenomenon that I do not understand 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.370
 especially that's why in a 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.680
 rock concert 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.080
 the guitarists its object to fart their 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.370
 instruments what's a whim 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.069
 I have the impression that when I play I 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.280
 put but it's not a gibson 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.650
 I had ordered a Gibson sinned 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.970
 fourth the musician is a sentimental 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.970
 it is the one who pays 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.710
 most of the 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.710
 movie music 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.160
 to his twilight music 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.480
 when mario is a movie what marios not 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.310
 a movie and the assured play sing 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.959
 anything he knows only three 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.239
 agreements it's not enough to think 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.629
 that they play as a god I want the 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.590
 wheat could not look among the kids 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.560
 the schedules to be the subject but when 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.430
 even 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.819
 yesterday in passing if he reaches on the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.819
 Earth 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.050
 is fifth and last 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.400
 feature 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:48.690
 the musician is a drug addict if that especially 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.490
 listening to some music that one who 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.700
 have words to these trees and I'm 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.959
 ask how they can create that 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.810
 there are not thirty six thousand solutions 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.230
 the guys I want to mess up will incite 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.270
 everywhere where it does not trouble and slippers 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.050
 the rise of the money there on this one there 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.910
 guys I just discovered an agreement 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:16.650
 with the ghost facts bousquet 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:20.720
 completely wrong say that this is the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.720
 end result he is still really 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.450
 on a cardboard there we go to make girls 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.540
 we will make money 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.130
 that's why making grass 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.440
 conclusion a musician is basically a 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.910
 passionate artist 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.160
 emotionally addicted to mythomania 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.500
 finally why was jealous of such 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.760
 shitty life then me I kindly 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.070

 g 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.840
 m 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.790
 female 1 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:42.229
 to explain a psychopath listen to this 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:42.229
