00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 we launch this mobile unit 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.200
 satellite that does remote monitoring of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.519
 Incident conflict situations 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.469
 of situations related to accidents and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.750
 we also start up this fleet of 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.850
 drones that are what is vulgarly 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.439
 you know as quadrocopters like 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.480
 protection program complement 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.420
 citizen this mobile unit what we 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.150
 allows is in a fire in a 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.630
 important incident of transit in a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.850
 strong situation of insecurity have in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 a single place fire department 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.469
 ambulance dispatch 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.930
 police dispatch of municipal mobiles 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.030
 because this satellite mobile unit what 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.230
 what it does is concentrate all the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 functions that the center has 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.000
 tiger monitoring and in the case of what 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.460
 the quadrocopters are drones the idea 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.489
 is that we have an assistant that can 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.320
 see all situations in perspective 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 this obviously serves us for the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 security situations to do what 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.739
 which is called patrolling of different 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.969
 neighborhoods for transit situations 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.600
 because where there is a large 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.369
 transit incident allows you to look at the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.610
 perspective area and make derivation 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.170
 this also puts us in the possibility 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.210
 to control buildings 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 clandestine because it allows us to do 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.610
 overflight 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.830
 satellite but also on flight 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.930
 face- to- face in each of the neighborhoods and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.090
 see what is being built is to say 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 which is an important tool that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.330
 sum to all the tools of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.650
 technology that has the municipality two 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.560
 new unmanned aerial vehicles 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.110
 they are robots that were built in 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.910
 holland are the first to get in 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.890
 working in Latin America this 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.540
 tool that allows us to fly over 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.580
 the area of ​​an emergency put 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.619
 available to prosecutors put 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.540
 provision of security force 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.100
 an image in high definition that can 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 be monitored from the center 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.369
 mobile operations that we are 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.340
 also presenting today through a gps 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.100
 you can program different points in 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.399
 space and send the drone to fly and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.320
 for example, to rest on a point and 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.750
 through a control one can go 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.729
 moving the camera to have a better 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 take what you need to see in that 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.440
 At the moment, the truth is that 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.750
 they will be very useful will come 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.870
 well grows the municipality grows it seems 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.090
 something that is good for all 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.920
 neighbors the truth that is something very 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.050
 What else can I say? 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.430
 in the districts not only in tiger 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.319
 that everyone would have to take the example 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.810
 of tiger everything with protection 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.360
 to protect the people is fine the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.510
 The municipality has made an investment in 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.000
 cameras on satellite phones in 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.030
 panic buttons for collectives for 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.170
 School transport in panic buttons 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.670
 domiciliary 12,000 tiger homes 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.920
 today they are connected to the tiger alert 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.260
 has also made a very investment 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.450
 strong in what has to do with the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.519
 0-800 drug in what has to do with 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.500
 the complaint channels and this is a 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.019
 tool more because we believe that the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.180
 technology used in the fight against 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.650
 Insecurity is very important for 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 win the battle of the criminals
