00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
it I think the next review I'm going to

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.360 
it I think the next review I'm going to
do<00:06:19.060> is<00:06:19.210> actually<00:06:19.420> on<00:06:19.840> this<00:06:20.200> I<00:06:20.530> bought<00:06:21.010> this<00:06:21.220> on

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
do is actually on this I bought this on

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.530 
do is actually on this I bought this on
Amazon<00:06:21.430> this<00:06:22.090> it's<00:06:23.020> a<00:06:24.030> Bluetooth<00:06:25.030> receiver

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
Amazon this it's a Bluetooth receiver

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.090 
Amazon this it's a Bluetooth receiver
actually<00:06:26.100> so<00:06:27.100> you<00:06:27.190> could<00:06:27.460> plug<00:06:27.670> it<00:06:27.790> in<00:06:27.910> to

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
actually so you could plug it in to

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.490 
actually so you could plug it in to
where<00:06:30.100> the<00:06:30.390> iPod<00:06:31.390> is<00:06:31.540> and<00:06:31.750> no<00:06:31.810> power<00:06:32.080> and<00:06:32.410> then

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
where the iPod is and no power and then

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.620 
where the iPod is and no power and then
you<00:06:32.590> could<00:06:32.770> receive<00:06:33.340> from<00:06:33.520> there<00:06:33.760> so<00:06:34.600> that

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
you could receive from there so that

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.180 
you could receive from there so that
should<00:06:34.930> take<00:06:35.020> care<00:06:35.140> of<00:06:35.200> my<00:06:35.350> problem<00:06:35.740> I<00:06:35.860> figure

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190
