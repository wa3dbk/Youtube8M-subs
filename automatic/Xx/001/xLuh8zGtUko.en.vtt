about this product is you can create

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.730 
about this product is you can create
different<00:00:17.910> types<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.599> curl<00:00:18.840> with<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.590> have

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
different types of curl with it we have

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.099 
different types of curl with it we have
three<00:00:20.130> temperatures<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.269> this<00:00:21.630> appliance

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
three temperatures on this appliance

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.060 
three temperatures on this appliance
first<00:00:22.980> temperature<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:24.470> 190<00:00:25.470> degrees

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
first temperature is 190 degrees

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.900 
first temperature is 190 degrees
your<00:00:26.429> second<00:00:26.849> temperature<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.980> 210<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
your second temperature is 210 and the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.380 
your second temperature is 210 and the
highest<00:00:30.300> temperature<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.370> 230<00:00:32.370> so<00:00:33.180> you've<00:00:33.270> got

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
highest temperature is 230 so you've got

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.300 
highest temperature is 230 so you've got
three<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> choose<00:00:33.900> from<00:00:34.470> so<00:00:34.830> if<00:00:34.950> you've<00:00:35.130> got

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
three to choose from so if you've got

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.560 
three to choose from so if you've got
hair<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.390> fine<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:37.140> over<00:00:37.500> colored<00:00:37.980> or

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
hair it's really fine or over colored or

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.970 
hair it's really fine or over colored or
just<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.840> quite<00:00:40.020> delicate<00:00:40.260> hair<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:40.950> you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
just really quite delicate hair then you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.040 
just really quite delicate hair then you
would<00:00:41.220> choose<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.490> lower<00:00:41.850> setting<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.600> if

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
would choose the lower setting and if

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.810 
would choose the lower setting and if
you've<00:00:43.200> got<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.650> quite<00:00:43.920> coarse<00:00:44.340> hair<00:00:44.580> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you've got really quite coarse hair you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.820 
you've got really quite coarse hair you
can<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.150> to<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> higher<00:00:45.570> setting<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.440> second

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
can go to the higher setting the second

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.220 
can go to the higher setting the second
button<00:00:47.130> we<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.310> here<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.910> our<00:00:48.150> timer<00:00:48.570> setting

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
button we have here is our timer setting

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.360 
button we have here is our timer setting
and<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:50.400> takes<00:00:50.790> us<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.240> 8<00:00:51.780> seconds<00:00:52.590> 10

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and this takes us from 8 seconds 10

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.200 
and this takes us from 8 seconds 10
seconds<00:00:54.060> or<00:00:54.540> 12<00:00:54.990> seconds<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.830> basically<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
seconds or 12 seconds and basically the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
seconds or 12 seconds and basically the
lower<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:57.660> setting<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.290> looser<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> curl

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
lower the setting the looser the curl

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400 
lower the setting the looser the curl
the<00:00:59.520> higher<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.030> setting<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.690> 12<00:01:00.960> seconds

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the higher the setting up to 12 seconds

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
the higher the setting up to 12 seconds
but<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.040> I<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.430> tighter<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.030> curl<00:01:03.060> will

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
but all I see the tighter the curl will

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
but all I see the tighter the curl will
be<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:04.019> formed<00:01:04.469> the<00:01:04.649> curl<00:01:04.859> all<00:01:05.009> be<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
be or more formed the curl all be the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.740 
be or more formed the curl all be the
final<00:01:05.729> button<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.329> here<00:01:06.539> is<00:01:06.719> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
final button we have here is a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.109 
final button we have here is a
directional<00:01:07.679> setting<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.579> is<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.850> about

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
directional setting this is all about

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.510 
directional setting this is all about
which<00:01:09.390> direction<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.170> curl<00:01:10.409> goes<00:01:10.649> into<00:01:11.159> so

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
which direction the curl goes into so

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580 
which direction the curl goes into so
you've<00:01:11.670> got<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> right-hand<00:01:12.750> side<00:01:13.109> which<00:01:13.439> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you've got a right-hand side which is

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you've got a left hand side which takes

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.889 
you've got a left hand side which takes
it<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.460> another<00:01:17.670> direction<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.719> also

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
succession that means that that curl is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.800

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
now what I'd like to show you is that

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.710 
now what I'd like to show you is that
this<00:03:14.780> product<00:03:15.110> has<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.950> sensor<00:03:16.490> built<00:03:17.060> into<00:03:17.330> it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
this product has a sensor built into it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.380 
this product has a sensor built into it
so<00:03:18.320> if<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.070> actual<00:03:19.400> section<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.180> too

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
so if the if the actual section is too

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.810 
so if the if the actual section is too
thick<00:03:20.720> or<00:03:21.050> it's<00:03:21.170> tangled<00:03:21.500> or<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.400> don't<00:03:22.610> put

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
thick or it's tangled or you don't put

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.230 
thick or it's tangled or you don't put
it<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.060> properly<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.470> close<00:03:24.860> down<00:03:25.310> to

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
it in properly and you close down to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.360 
it in properly and you close down to
allow<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:27.230> curl<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.710> go<00:03:27.860> into<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.160> chamber

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
allow the curl to go into the chamber

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.270 
allow the curl to go into the chamber
the<00:03:29.120> sensor<00:03:29.690> tells<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.140> something<00:03:30.590> wrong<00:03:30.830> so

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
the sensor tells this something wrong so

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.040 
the sensor tells this something wrong so
it<00:03:31.400> stops<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.210> gives<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.570> bleeping

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
it stops and it gives you a bleeping

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.990 
it stops and it gives you a bleeping
sound<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:34.100> I'm<00:03:34.220> going<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.460> show<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:34.730> what<00:03:34.970> I

sound and I'm going to show you what I

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.090 
sound and I'm going to show you what I
mean<00:03:35.270> so<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.630> stick<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.050> there<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.590> can<00:03:36.620> hear

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
mean so you stick it there you can hear

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.520 
mean so you stick it there you can hear
the<00:03:37.520> bleeping<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.360> won't<00:03:38.570> actually<00:03:38.750> take<00:03:39.050> the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
the bleeping it won't actually take the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.050 
the bleeping it won't actually take the
hair<00:03:39.740> in<00:03:39.950> because<00:03:40.250> there's<00:03:40.430> too<00:03:40.640> much<00:03:40.790> hair

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.760 
hair in because there's too much hair
there<00:03:41.300> or<00:03:41.480> it's<00:03:41.630> naughty<00:03:41.900> or<00:03:42.080> something<00:03:42.620> like
