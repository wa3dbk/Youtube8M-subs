00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
ourselves to come up with something that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
ourselves to come up with something that
felt<00:00:39.120> organic<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> middle<00:00:40.469> act<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
felt organic like a middle act of a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.260 
felt organic like a middle act of a
trilogy<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:42.300> earned<00:00:42.629> its<00:00:42.840> place<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
trilogy that that earned its place and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.459 
trilogy that that earned its place and
just<00:00:45.270> carrying<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> forward<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.230> keeping

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
just carrying that forward just keeping

each other honest kind of paid off

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.869 
each other honest kind of paid off
because<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.829> think<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.250> were<00:00:50.370> our<00:00:50.520> toughest

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
because I think we were our toughest

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.720 
because I think we were our toughest
critics<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.420> when<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.660> got<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.960> there

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
critics and when it got out there

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.880 
critics and when it got out there
daring<00:00:54.730> aspects<00:00:55.329> of<00:00:55.539> it<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.410> emotionally

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890

daring aspects of it the emotionally
resonant<00:00:57.250> side<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:57.790> it<00:00:58.000> all<00:00:58.360> seemed<00:00:58.629> to

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
resonant side of it it all seemed to

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.750 
resonant side of it it all seemed to
really<00:00:58.870> hit<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.199> audience<00:00:59.530> at<00:00:59.680> him<00:00:59.829> in<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.610> way

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.970 
really hit the audience at him in a way
that<00:01:00.969> was<00:01:01.090> pretty<00:01:01.360> validated<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:02.559> know<00:01:02.680> you

you<00:01:03.339> really<00:01:03.610> we<00:01:04.239> really<00:01:04.269> didn't<00:01:04.809> want<00:01:04.930> to

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
you really we really didn't want to

you really we really didn't want to
disappoint<00:01:05.350> ourselves<00:01:06.280> because<00:01:06.670> we<00:01:07.119> all<00:01:07.240> had

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
disappoint ourselves because we all had

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.270 
disappoint ourselves because we all had
worked<00:01:07.600> on<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.780> first<00:01:08.049> film<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.619> we<00:01:09.130> knew

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
worked on the first film and we knew

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.190 
worked on the first film and we knew
that<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.610> resonated<00:01:10.330> with<00:01:10.540> an<00:01:10.630> audience<00:01:10.990> so

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
that it resonated with an audience so

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.710 
that it resonated with an audience so
when<00:01:11.409> we<00:01:11.530> started<00:01:11.920> working<00:01:12.070> on<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.340> we<00:01:13.240> felt

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
when we started working on it we felt

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.389 
when we started working on it we felt
the<00:01:13.810> same<00:01:13.840> way<00:01:14.170> about<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:14.649> first<00:01:14.860> film<00:01:15.190> and

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
the same way about that first film and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.300 
the same way about that first film and
so<00:01:16.300> we<00:01:16.450> wanted<00:01:16.659> to<00:01:16.720> make<00:01:16.930> sure<00:01:16.990> we<00:01:17.530> stay<00:01:18.070> true

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
so we wanted to make sure we stay true

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.880 
so we wanted to make sure we stay true
to<00:01:18.399> that<00:01:18.640> idea<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.420> yet<00:01:19.720> bring<00:01:20.560> something

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
to that idea and yet bring something

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.710 
to that idea and yet bring something
really<00:01:20.920> new<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.460> different<00:01:21.640> than<00:01:21.940> when<00:01:22.570> it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
really new and different than when it

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.899 
really new and different than when it
the<00:01:22.840> movie<00:01:23.080> came<00:01:23.290> out<00:01:23.320> we<00:01:23.680> felt<00:01:23.920> like<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.759> know

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
the movie came out we felt like you know

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.120 
the movie came out we felt like you know
that<00:01:25.360> started<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:25.929> resonate<00:01:26.080> with<00:01:26.410> people<00:01:26.950> and

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
that started to resonate with people and

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.040 
that started to resonate with people and
if<00:01:27.670> people<00:01:27.820> are<00:01:28.000> surprised<00:01:28.390> by<00:01:28.720> where<00:01:28.929> this

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
if people are surprised by where this

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.919 
if people are surprised by where this
movie<00:01:29.440> takes<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.369> audience<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.270> think

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
movie takes the audience and I think

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.540 
movie takes the audience and I think
we're<00:01:32.229> really<00:01:32.380> proud<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.310> hearing

we're really proud of that and hearing
that<00:01:33.820> resonate<00:01:34.810> back<00:01:35.050> is<00:01:35.289> really<00:01:35.800> rewarding

every<00:01:49.960> movie<00:01:50.260> goes<00:01:50.440> through<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.860> lot<00:01:51.070> of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
every movie goes through a lot of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.040 
every movie goes through a lot of
incarnations<00:01:51.310> through<00:01:52.120> storyboards<00:01:52.900> you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
incarnations through storyboards you

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.170 
incarnations through storyboards you
rework<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:53.770> rework<00:01:54.160> it<00:01:54.400> was<00:01:54.910> there<00:01:55.150> a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
rework it you rework it was there a

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.030 
rework it you rework it was there a
radically<00:01:55.810> different<00:01:55.840> version<00:01:56.650> of<00:01:56.830> this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
radically different version of this

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.650 
radically different version of this
movie<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.580> almost<00:01:57.940> got<00:01:58.120> made

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
movie that almost got made

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.180 
movie that almost got made
did<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.050> come<00:01:59.200> close<00:01:59.440> or<00:01:59.650> was<00:01:59.830> this<00:01:59.980> the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
did it come close or was this the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.740 
did it come close or was this the
version<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.730> you'd<00:02:01.180> been<00:02:01.330> basically

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
version that you'd been basically

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.330 
version that you'd been basically
tweaking<00:02:02.260> with<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.620> whole<00:02:02.740> time<00:02:02.980> if<00:02:03.160> you<00:02:03.220> know

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
tweaking with the whole time if you know

but at the same time

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.270 
but at the same time
it<00:02:51.940> was<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:52.720> she<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> mother<00:02:53.740> we

it was because she is a mother we

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.400 
it was because she is a mother we
started<00:02:54.910> getting<00:02:55.030> immediate<00:02:55.330> feedback<00:02:55.720> from

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
started getting immediate feedback from

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.950 
started getting immediate feedback from
mothers<00:02:56.710> out<00:02:56.890> there<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.310> that's<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:57.640> an

mothers out there that that's just an

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.870 
mothers out there that that's just an
irredeemable<00:02:58.960> character<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.950> we<00:03:00.550> realized

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
irredeemable character and we realized

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.370 
irredeemable character and we realized
we<00:03:01.030> had<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.210> arc<00:03:01.450> her<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.720> little<00:03:01.900> bit<00:03:02.080> sooner

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
we had to arc her a little bit sooner

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.090 
we had to arc her a little bit sooner
and<00:03:02.650> come<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.400> see<00:03:03.550> hiccups<00:03:03.910> way<00:03:04.830> by<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.890> end

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
and come to see hiccups way by the end

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.920 
and come to see hiccups way by the end
of<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.370> by<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.820> end<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.090> second<00:03:07.420> act<00:03:07.540> so

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
of the by the end of the second act so

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.420 
of the by the end of the second act so
that<00:03:07.959> she<00:03:08.200> could<00:03:08.320> support<00:03:08.650> him<00:03:08.860> going<00:03:09.070> forward

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that she could support him going forward

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.030 
that she could support him going forward
and<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.209> meant<00:03:10.390> pulling<00:03:10.840> pulling<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.770> villain

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
and it meant pulling pulling the villain

and it meant pulling pulling the villain
in<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.400> little<00:03:13.090> earlier<00:03:13.360> than<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.600> anticipated

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
goes this is a lot a lot more complex

goes this is a lot a lot more complex
than<00:03:20.800> he<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.190> presented<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:21.970> second

installment by the way this leads me to

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.740 
installment by the way this leads me to
my<00:03:24.580> next<00:03:24.700> question<00:03:25.060> which<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.450> was<00:03:25.570> going<00:03:25.690> to

there<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.810> us<00:03:58.930> so<00:03:59.290> that's<00:03:59.470> not<00:03:59.590> bad<00:03:59.650> when

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
you have the entire outline pretty much

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.160 
you have the entire outline pretty much
mapped<00:04:03.130> out<00:04:03.370> or<00:04:03.730> how<00:04:04.390> much<00:04:04.540> are<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.750> figuring

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
mapped out or how much are you figuring

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.400 
mapped out or how much are you figuring
out<00:04:05.290> as<00:04:05.470> you're<00:04:05.650> adding<00:04:05.980> words<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.700> dialogue

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
out as you're adding words and dialogue

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.530 
out as you're adding words and dialogue
well<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.500> believe<00:04:09.160> in<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.430> outline<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.510> I

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
well I believe in the outline and so I

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.479 
well I believe in the outline and so I
spend<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> lot<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.019> time<00:04:11.260> structurally<00:04:12.220> beating

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
spend a lot of time structurally beating

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.789 
spend a lot of time structurally beating
it<00:04:12.580> up<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.000> by<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.810> time<00:04:14.080> I'm<00:04:14.230> ready<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.620> write

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
it up and by the time I'm ready to write

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:15.960 
it up and by the time I'm ready to write
dialogue<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.549> flush

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
dialogue and flush

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.720 
dialogue and flush
scene<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.290> scene<00:04:17.950> has<00:04:18.220> its<00:04:18.459> place

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
scene that that scene has its place

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.330 
scene that that scene has its place
already<00:04:19.269> pretty<00:04:19.510> cemented<00:04:20.110> in<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.320> story<00:04:20.620> so

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
already pretty cemented in the story so

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.980 
already pretty cemented in the story so
it's<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:22.720> for<00:04:23.020> me<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:24.120> lot<00:04:25.120> of<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.480> a<00:04:25.690> lot<00:04:25.810> of

it's a it's for me a lot of the a lot of

it's a it's for me a lot of the a lot of
the<00:04:26.140> planning<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:27.310> lot<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.840> sort<00:04:28.840> of

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
the planning and a lot of the sort of

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.990 
the planning and a lot of the sort of
head-scratching<00:04:29.290> goes<00:04:29.980> on<00:04:30.160> upfront<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.880> by

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
head-scratching goes on upfront and by

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.240 
head-scratching goes on upfront and by
the<00:04:31.060> time<00:04:31.300> I'm<00:04:31.510> fleshing<00:04:32.380> out<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.500> scene<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:32.830> have

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
the time I'm fleshing out a scene I have

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.590 
the time I'm fleshing out a scene I have
a<00:04:33.280> pretty<00:04:33.490> clear<00:04:33.580> idea<00:04:33.730> of<00:04:33.970> what<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.300> so

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
a pretty clear idea of what it is so

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.330 
a pretty clear idea of what it is so
that<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:34.990> part<00:04:35.350> tends<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.710> go<00:04:35.830> relatively

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
that that part tends to go relatively

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.910 
that that part tends to go relatively
faster<00:04:36.670> so<00:04:37.630> my<00:04:38.050> last<00:04:38.260> thing<00:04:38.440> for<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:38.860> I
