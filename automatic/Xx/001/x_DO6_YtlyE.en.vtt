00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.270 
this is a pretty good one this is how it
opens<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:42.140> um<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.469> see<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.739> only<00:00:44.129> have

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
opens up um as you can see I only have

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.029 
opens up um as you can see I only have
the<00:00:44.700> three<00:00:45.260> rings<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.860> now

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the three rings in there right now

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.700 
the three rings in there right now
because<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.930> using<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.469> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
because I just if I'm not using one I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.410 
because I just if I'm not using one I
don't<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.180> take<00:00:51.390> up

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
don't want it to be in there to take up

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.139 
don't want it to be in there to take up
extra<00:00:51.780> space<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.500> anything<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.670> took

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
extra space or anything so I just took

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.299 
extra space or anything so I just took
it<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.260> use<00:00:55.469> these<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:58.309> keychains

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it off and I use these little keychains

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.880 
it off and I use these little keychains
or<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.329> wings<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.320> use<00:01:01.620> these

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
or the little wings and just use these

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.340 
or the little wings and just use these
so<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.280> easier<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.820> me<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> take<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so it's easier for me to take it in and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.980 
so it's easier for me to take it in and
out<00:01:04.530> when<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:04.949> switching<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.450> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that and I don't mind having this out

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.819 
that and I don't mind having this out
because<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.420> end<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.200> putting<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.650> in

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
because if I do end up putting this in

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.370 
because if I do end up putting this in
my<00:01:40.920> bag<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.000> main<00:01:42.180> purpose<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> keys

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
my bag the main purpose is for the keys

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
not to scratch anything in my bag or the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.730 
not to scratch anything in my bag or the
interior<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.979> my<00:01:47.100> bag<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:49.079> no<00:01:49.229> problem

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
interior of my bag so I have no problem

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.679 
interior of my bag so I have no problem
leaving<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> key

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
leaving this out because it's not a key

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.450 
leaving this out because it's not a key
it's<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.380> key<00:01:52.590> fob<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> won't<00:01:53.369> really

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it's just a key fob and it won't really

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.719 
it's just a key fob and it won't really
scratch<00:01:54.000> anything<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.439> I've<00:01:56.159> been<00:01:56.310> really

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
scratch anything so I've been really

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.609 
scratch anything so I've been really
liking<00:01:56.969> using<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.689> lately<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.320> only

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
liking using this lately the only

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.350 
liking using this lately the only
downside<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.969> won't<00:02:00.180> be

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
downside to this is that you won't be

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.810 
downside to this is that you won't be
able<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> put<00:02:00.990> any<00:02:01.170> credit<00:02:01.560> cards<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> inside

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
able to put any credit cards and inside

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.120 
able to put any credit cards and inside
if<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.270> running<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.780> or<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.619> running<00:02:04.890> an

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
it up and I think it's starting to be a

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.900 
it up and I think it's starting to be a
little<00:05:58.380> bulky<00:05:58.919> so<00:05:59.160> you<00:05:59.250> kind<00:05:59.460> of<00:05:59.490> have<00:05:59.640> to<00:05:59.669> like

little bulky so you kind of have to like

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.570 
little bulky so you kind of have to like
maneuver<00:06:00.090> around<00:06:00.600> it<00:06:01.169> still<00:06:01.740> closes<00:06:02.160> up<00:06:02.310> just

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
maneuver around it still closes up just

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.260 
maneuver around it still closes up just
fine<00:06:02.850> as<00:06:03.150> you<00:06:03.300> can<00:06:03.480> see<00:06:03.950> but<00:06:04.950> it<00:06:05.310> does<00:06:05.940> feel<00:06:06.180> a

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
fine as you can see but it does feel a

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.450 
fine as you can see but it does feel a
little<00:06:06.330> tight<00:06:06.840> but<00:06:07.230> it's<00:06:07.410> not<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:08.160> a<00:06:08.190> point

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
little tight but it's not to a point

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.490 
little tight but it's not to a point
where<00:06:08.700> I<00:06:08.730> would<00:06:09.300> be<00:06:09.480> worried<00:06:09.870> about<00:06:09.990> it<00:06:10.320> it's

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
where I would be worried about it it's

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.820 
where I would be worried about it it's
not<00:06:10.970> pulling<00:06:11.970> or<00:06:12.480> stretching<00:06:12.840> any<00:06:13.470> canvas

not pulling or stretching any canvas
that<00:06:14.280> I<00:06:14.870> could<00:06:15.870> feel<00:06:16.140> right<00:06:16.380> now<00:06:16.590> but<00:06:17.550> yeah

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
that I could feel right now but yeah
