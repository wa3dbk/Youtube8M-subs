00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.870
 How about how are you greeting jimena 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.490
 nagano and today I tell you to drive a 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:18.400
 new proposal that reaches the market 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:20.410
 Mexican the infiniti brand has had a 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.110
 great acceptance in our country since 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.520
 which was renewed in 2012 as 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.770
 you know the segment of the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.420
 crossovers is something of the most competitive 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.750
 especially for luxury brands 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.789
 infiniti presents us with qx 60 but in one 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.879
 hybrid version in addition to all wheel 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.879
 drive 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.320
 on the outside we see bi-xenon headlights 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.079
 high intensity in addition to headlights 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 fog lights brake leds the spoiler 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.820
 back that to my taste looks very 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.430
 integrated to the body with wheels of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.430
 20 inches plus chromed inserts 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.409
 in grill handle and sides as well as 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.180
 the hybrid logo to indicate us that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.759
 we are managing the hybrid version 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 these are some of the differences with 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.050
 we know we have a vehicle 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.940
 that combines the gasoline engine and the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.390
 electric battery to provide us 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.640
 the 230 horsepower the goal 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.160
 is to save more fuel and for this 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.020
 they put a gasoline engine of 2.5 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.880
 liters that together with a battery of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.909
 lithium that is charging while 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.440
 we cross the kilometers already 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.320
 decelerating or braking and an engine 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.830
 electrical together gives us these 230 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830
 horsepower 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.030
 the engine responds quite well in fact 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.250
 if we are calm driving in the city 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.900
 we could only occupy the engine 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.360
 electric most of the time 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.640
 especially if we go in transit when 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.740
 we need more power between the engine 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.600
 gasoline and using the box 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.820
 six-speed ve is that 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.950
 we get a handling that leaves us nothing 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.960
 to want this version has traction 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.270
 on all four wheels and gives us the option 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.700
 to choose different handling options 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.310
 with a knob we can adjust 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.860
 the way we want to drive 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.970
 standard eco sport and snow for example 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.190
 if we were in any situation 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.190
 where the pavement is wet 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.390
 If we want to get the most out of 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.790
 the consumption of fuel suits us 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.159
 put it in eco mode the benefits do not 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.200
 slow to appear this truck more 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.659
 of 2 tons or cross software we 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.640
 can give up to 17 kilometers per liter 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.349
 in the city we were more or less 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.150
 driving around 14 kilometers 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.150
 per liter without any problem 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.940
 on the subject of security is quite 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.730
 well balanced 8 air bags 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.230

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.769
 blind distance control system 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.450
 front and many more features 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.519
 that make everything around 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.190
 of our vehicle becomes of some 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.470
 safer way is the case of the 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.299
 Reverse camera front and rear with 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.129
 the around view monitor that is as if 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.930
 all the time we brought a drone 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.280
 flying over us and we can 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.150
 appreciate what is around 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.150
 of the vehicle 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.579
 the center highlights a screen of 8 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.730
 inches where we can find 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.709
 entertainment navigation data and 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 fuel efficiency of how they have 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.909
 been our different journeys 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.760
 besides these visions where we have 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.890
 360 degrees of the vehicle to know what 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.049
 is around us in the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.599
 interior leather seats in black 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.000

 has a third row of seats 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.010

 passengers the third row of seats 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.230
