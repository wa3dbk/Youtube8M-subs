00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.420
 Hi, the good guys have already answered me 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.389
 a tag for you this land calls 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.809
 little food I saw there in the channel 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.570
 low she answered this tag along with a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.220
 another person I think it's cool and I'm going 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 answer to you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.420
 are ten questions about my 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.730
 feeding as soon as the first 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.920
 ask what you got to eat at 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.670
 your day to day 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.340
 my routine if it is my advanced I like 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.530
 enough to eat is not necessarily 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.020
 rice beans but need to have the thing not 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.570
 can eat pork or chicken like this without 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.030
 nothing just to installed then the thing with 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.930
 chicken rice with meat rice and cotton 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 off rice always have to have the rest go 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.530
 varying from day to day to day so the second 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.379
 question prefers sweet or salty by 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.960
 incredible that it seems I prefer the salty 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.680
 I like to eat sweet but you like this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.329
 from time to time and if they have a side without 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.400
 I really like salty 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.869
 until then I was more 12 videos because 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.549
 salty but I like more salty things 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.799
 third fight and how much to diet you 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.180
 worry about it or you eat commitment 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.330
 without thinking of tomorrow 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.729
 It's days, it does not have to be like this yet. 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.250
 Did not just start the week, you have to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.220
 eat right as it is spoken do not eat 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.650
 Sweet is coming half of the sisters already 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.140
 start to see the rope that charges you 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.140
 a painting arrives next week 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.130
 I went foot in the jackfruit and then in the second it starts 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.439
 all over again 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.630
 so I 'm doing no diet 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.000
 nothing specific but I try to keep a 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.280
 Basque during the week eat right 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.570
 to the company since at the end of 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.350
 week but sometimes even dancing 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.170
 Ana one day or another happens in Bonn 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.360
 fourth question, what is your food and 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.790
 favorite dessert 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.490
 my favorite food is stroganoff 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 I love chicken I always enjoyed having 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.880
 the name of favorite chicken and dessert 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.800
 It's the simplest thing there is Brigadier 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.840
 I love several types of dessert but 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.480
 for me the spoon bartender made in 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.780
 home and see how hot it is the best 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.980
 dessert that exists so alone these 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.580
 are my favorites 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:34.590
 5 What you hate to eat but eat because 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:38.200
 It 's accurate, there's nothing wrong with it. 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.239
 I do not do not use it 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.880
 so there's nothing wrong with that I did not like 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.320
 of fish before but now I can and I know 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.500
 which is something that we need but 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:52.299
 I did not eat dinner I ate so much that I 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.370
 hate or not sell is how much you weigh 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.810
 which was going to weigh more or less is 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.810
 satisfied with your weight 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.459
 so I'm weighing 58 pounds 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.959
 I wish I had regret 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.840
 I already arrived last year but I gained weight 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.130
 again then stay Maria, I want to go back 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.750
 to 55 this year but it's good then too 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.700
 dissatisfied so I think it's over 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.670
 nothing of the kind but I wanted to get from 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.940
 55 7 what is your favorite fruit 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.130
 look at my favorite 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.120
 I really like green pitted grapes 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.880
 is affectionate 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.290
 I like it a lot like testing a box 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.510
 full on the day I think our green 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.820
 it's red 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.480
 but I'd say I'd rather rain 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.480
 than apple 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:58.450
 8 Do you eat or like vegetables vegetables 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:01.090
 Look, I like it, it's not everything I like 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.060
 so she spreads wide treats of salad 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.819
 No, but I do not like how I do not like it 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.830
 always because you only marry like your body 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.690
 Ready if I have to buy do 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.410
 tems such as staff not only to 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.330
 eat 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.479
 I just do not comment I buy those 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.010
 bags of ready-made salads like 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:23.050
 eat sometimes some vegetables know father is 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.020
 face in the pan with vegetables business this 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.870
 thing but it's not always that I do not like it 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.240
 How many meals do you make daily? 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.260
 looks complicated as well which varies 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.510
 enough 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.070
 but I'm breakfast lunch and dinner 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.290
 sure, and there 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.340
 between them I eat some things like 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.820
 fruit 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.389
 I as a lady buy this package 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.639
 would be small and like a little carrot 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.940
 so it goes up to four to five 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:55.600
 meals per day 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:58.120
 the last question you would like to 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.990
 eat but I with your conscious not 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.990
 allows 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.800
 I would like to eat everything awake in that 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.570
 here are days you want to eat one 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.940
 A little more out of pride because it 's 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.620
 It's really good for you to talk and not to but already 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.250
 I am satisfied Jacobin had to 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.020
 eat 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.030
 so you do not eat to get past 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.010
 Will but you will not 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.560
 but it's nothing, so I realized that I 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.690
 Come on, I can not eat what I 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.910
 I really want the cone that was just a little 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.000
 How do you know I'm not spending too much time? 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.710
 Wish is not good, just a question 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.979
 This feeds me if I want to read if 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.750
 I would look at you someday and this is the week. 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.510
 whole all scared during the week 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.510
 I recorded it in the morning. 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.400
 the action for a week but it is a bit 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.080
 complicated but I'll try to show 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.990
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.560
 liked a kiss that until the next video 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.560
 bye
