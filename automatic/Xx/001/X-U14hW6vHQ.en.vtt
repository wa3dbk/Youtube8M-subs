here<00:00:01.079> are<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> few<00:00:01.560> things<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.310> should

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
here are a few things you should

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.329 
here are a few things you should
consider<00:00:02.730> before<00:00:03.440> designing<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.710> then

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
consider before designing and then

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.140 
consider before designing and then
building<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.970> home<00:00:06.240> with<00:00:07.020> decorative<00:00:08.150> shelves

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
building a home with decorative shelves

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.720 
building a home with decorative shelves
like<00:00:09.420> these<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:10.590> course<00:00:10.740> they<00:00:10.950> are<00:00:11.130> built<00:00:11.429> into

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
like these of course they are built into

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.049 
like these of course they are built into
the<00:00:12.330> home<00:00:12.750> they<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.500> drywalled<00:00:14.130> most<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the home they are drywalled most of the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.189 
the home they are drywalled most of the
time<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:16.590> course<00:00:16.890> will<00:00:17.460> need<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.880> be

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
time and of course will need to be

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.929 
time and of course will need to be
maintained<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.130> refer<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.699> them<00:00:20.910> as

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
maintained I like to refer to them as

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.080 
maintained I like to refer to them as
dust<00:00:21.660> collectors<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.769> again<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.820> would<00:00:24.029> be

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
dust collectors and again this would be

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.650 
dust collectors and again this would be
our<00:00:24.269> first<00:00:24.900> tip<00:00:25.680> before<00:00:26.640> building<00:00:27.330> something

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
our first tip before building something

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.209 
our first tip before building something
like<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.760> they<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.820> collect<00:00:30.420> dust<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.219> every

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
like this they do collect dust and every

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.510 
like this they do collect dust and every
once<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> while<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:32.940> collect<00:00:33.270> mold<00:00:33.660> -<00:00:34.520> what

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

this is going to happen let's face it if
you<00:01:08.850> warned<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.659> children<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> probably

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you warned your children it probably

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
you warned your children it probably
wouldn't<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.460> course<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> them<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.780> would

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

wouldn't of course some of them it would
entice<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> exact<00:01:14.729> opposite

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
entice them to do the exact opposite

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.359 
entice them to do the exact opposite
however<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.439> another<00:01:16.470> problem<00:01:17.189> with

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
however there is another problem with

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.660 
however there is another problem with
shelves<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.970> are<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.420> close<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.310> an<00:01:20.310> area

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
shelves that are this close to an area

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.310 
shelves that are this close to an area
where<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.060> actually<00:01:21.270> reach<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
where you can actually reach and if you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.170 
where you can actually reach and if you
could<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.619> imagine<00:01:22.890> someone<00:01:23.340> cleaning<00:01:23.880> this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
could just imagine someone cleaning this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.899 
could just imagine someone cleaning this
area<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.590> reaching<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.520> further

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
area and then reaching a little further

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.580 
area and then reaching a little further
so<00:01:27.210> let's<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.570> say<00:01:27.659> you're<00:01:27.810> standing<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.380> top

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so let's just say you're standing on top

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.890 
so let's just say you're standing on top
of<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.860> balcony<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.579> you're<00:01:30.390> leaning<00:01:30.750> over

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.440 
of the balcony and you're leaning over
the<00:01:31.110> handrail<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.159> you're<00:01:32.850> reaching<00:01:33.030> over

the handrail and you're reaching over

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
the handrail and you're reaching over
and<00:01:33.479> you're<00:01:33.659> cleaning<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.259> area<00:01:34.619> because

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and you're cleaning this area because

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
and you're cleaning this area because
you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.280> clean<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> section<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.570> you've

reaching over there to grab and you do
this<00:01:43.320> regularly<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> pretty<00:01:45.240> soon

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
this regularly and then you pretty soon

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.789 
this regularly and then you pretty soon
you<00:01:45.509> start<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.899> comfortable<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.530> this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
you start to get comfortable with this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.109 
you start to get comfortable with this
and<00:01:47.040> pretty<00:01:47.189> soon<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:47.549> reaching<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.970> little

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
you're going to design something and you

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.100 
you're going to design something and you
know<00:03:09.940> hey<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.120> need<00:03:10.239> some<00:03:10.569> light<00:03:10.780> here<00:03:11.049> I'm

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
forget that this window will need to be

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.720 
forget that this window will need to be
cleaned<00:03:15.819> from<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.780> inside<00:03:17.319> which<00:03:17.739> which

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
cleaned from the inside which which

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.360 
cleaned from the inside which which
might<00:03:19.030> be<00:03:19.209> difficult<00:03:19.480> for<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:21.100> situation

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
might be difficult for this situation

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.000 
might be difficult for this situation
here<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.200> course<00:03:23.230> it's<00:03:23.590> also<00:03:23.739> gonna<00:03:23.920> be

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
here and of course it's also gonna be

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.800 
here and of course it's also gonna be
need<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.400> cleaned<00:03:24.670> from<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.120> outside<00:03:25.630> which

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
need to cleaned from the outside which

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.280 
need to cleaned from the outside which
could<00:03:26.079> provide<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.709> with<00:03:26.970> even<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.290> larger

like this you can always make the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.000 
like this you can always make the
shelves<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.790> little<00:03:40.030> smaller<00:03:40.739> they<00:03:41.739> don't<00:03:41.890> need

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
shelves a little smaller they don't need

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.009 
shelves a little smaller they don't need
to<00:03:42.160> be<00:03:42.280> monster<00:03:42.850> wide<00:03:43.090> shelves<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.810> then<00:03:43.900> of

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
to be monster wide shelves and then of

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.280 
to be monster wide shelves and then of
course<00:03:44.160> be<00:03:45.160> careful<00:03:45.609> what<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.819> design<00:03:46.510> around

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
course be careful what you design around

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.030 
course be careful what you design around
these<00:03:47.590> shelves<00:03:47.970> windows<00:03:49.650> fancy<00:03:50.650> trim

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
these shelves windows fancy trim

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.940 
these shelves windows fancy trim
whatever<00:03:51.609> if<00:03:52.239> or<00:03:52.780> even<00:03:53.079> electrical<00:03:53.709> light

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950

whatever if or even electrical light
fixtures<00:03:54.489> trust<00:03:54.880> me<00:03:55.030> I've<00:03:55.120> seen<00:03:55.269> people<00:03:55.569> put

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
fixtures trust me I've seen people put

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.629 
fixtures trust me I've seen people put
light<00:03:55.870> fixtures<00:03:56.350> in<00:03:56.560> these<00:03:56.739> things<00:03:57.069> so<00:03:57.609> that

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
light fixtures in these things so that

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.289 
light fixtures in these things so that
they<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.150> highlight<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:59.670> stuff<00:04:00.670> they<00:04:00.850> put<00:04:01.090> on

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
they can highlight the stuff they put on

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.910 
they can highlight the stuff they put on
the<00:04:01.540> shelf<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.260> then<00:04:02.380> of<00:04:02.470> course<00:04:02.500> when<00:04:02.829> the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
the shelf and then of course when the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.190 
the shelf and then of course when the
light<00:04:03.069> bulb<00:04:03.310> goes<00:04:03.549> out<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:04.150> creates<00:04:04.660> another

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
light bulb goes out this creates another

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.069 
light bulb goes out this creates another
problem<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:06.010> think<00:04:06.790> you've<00:04:07.450> got<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.900> put<00:04:08.049> some

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
problem so think you've got to put some

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.479 
problem so think you've got to put some
thought<00:04:08.440> into<00:04:08.709> this<00:04:08.920> stuff<00:04:09.190> when<00:04:09.400> you're

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
thought into this stuff when you're

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.180 
thought into this stuff when you're
designing<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.750> building<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.410> way<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.709> will

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
designing the building that way you will

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.170 
designing the building that way you will
not<00:04:12.609> run<00:04:13.480> into<00:04:13.690> problems<00:04:14.319> after<00:04:14.829> it<00:04:15.130> is<00:04:15.340> built

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
not run into problems after it is built

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.240 
not run into problems after it is built
this<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.260> very<00:04:18.130> important<00:04:18.729> and<00:04:19.889> anything<00:04:20.889> you

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
this is very important and anything you

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.750 
this is very important and anything you
can<00:04:21.400> possibly<00:04:21.700> think<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:24.340> know<00:04:24.430> look<00:04:24.669> at

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
can possibly think of you know look at

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.130 
can possibly think of you know look at
it<00:04:24.940> look<00:04:25.180> at<00:04:25.240> every<00:04:25.479> part<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.810> building

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
it look at every part of the building

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.510 
it look at every part of the building
you<00:04:26.260> can<00:04:26.289> possibly<00:04:26.890> look

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
you can possibly look

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.999 
you can possibly look
and<00:04:27.940> put<00:04:28.270> as<00:04:28.360> much<00:04:28.539> thought<00:04:28.780> into<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.259> as<00:04:29.500> you

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
and put as much thought into this as you

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.980 
and put as much thought into this as you
can<00:04:30.039> even<00:04:30.490> while<00:04:30.759> you're<00:04:30.940> building<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.539> even

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
can even while you're building it even

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.150 
can even while you're building it even
while<00:04:32.110> you're<00:04:32.259> building<00:04:32.410> if<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.830> think<00:04:33.039> you

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
while you're building if you think you

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.700 
while you're building if you think you
know<00:04:33.250> what<00:04:33.430> ah<00:04:33.460> crap<00:04:33.970> I'm<00:04:34.180> messed<00:04:34.419> up<00:04:34.630> hey<00:04:35.440> at

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
know what ah crap I'm messed up hey at

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.930 
know what ah crap I'm messed up hey at
least<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:36.069> can<00:04:36.220> fix<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.610> during<00:04:36.849> the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
least you can fix it during the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.730 
least you can fix it during the
construction<00:04:37.180> phase<00:04:37.569> would<00:04:38.500> have<00:04:38.620> been

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
construction phase would have been

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.460 
construction phase would have been
better<00:04:38.949> to<00:04:39.160> fix<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.550> during<00:04:39.819> the<00:04:39.940> design<00:04:40.270> phase

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
better to fix it during the design phase

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.600 
better to fix it during the design phase
but<00:04:41.470> at<00:04:41.560> least<00:04:41.710> if<00:04:41.919> it's<00:04:42.069> something<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.460> can

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
but at least if it's something you can

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.309 
but at least if it's something you can
fix<00:04:42.759> during<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.180> construction<00:04:43.419> phase<00:04:43.750> it's

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
fix during the construction phase it's

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.680 
fix during the construction phase it's
and<00:04:44.740> it's<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.280> big<00:04:45.460> enough<00:04:45.699> problem<00:04:46.030> then

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
and it's a big enough problem then

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.400 
and it's a big enough problem then
you've<00:04:46.900> eliminated<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:48.009> problem<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.199> home

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
you've eliminated a problem in the home

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.939 
you've eliminated a problem in the home
and<00:04:51.090> won't<00:04:52.090> need<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:52.449> worry<00:04:53.139> about<00:04:53.259> it

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
and won't need to worry about it

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.100 
and won't need to worry about it
in<00:04:54.009> the<00:04:54.280> future<00:04:54.639> or<00:04:54.849> deal<00:04:55.300> with<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:55.750> for<00:04:55.990> that

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
in the future or deal with it for that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.410 
in the future or deal with it for that
matter
