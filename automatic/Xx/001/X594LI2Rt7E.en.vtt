00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.170 

so<00:03:42.959> what<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.140> do<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:44.130> just<00:03:44.190> use<00:03:44.520> this<00:03:44.700> card<00:03:45.060> to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
so what I do is I just use this card to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.440 
so what I do is I just use this card to
flip<00:03:46.080> over<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.770> only<00:03:47.280> blue<00:03:47.489> card<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.090> they<00:03:48.270> can

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
flip over the only blue card so they can

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.300 
flip over the only blue card so they can
see<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.690> contrast<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:50.930> cards<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.200> red<00:03:52.680> blue<00:03:53.040> makes

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
see a contrast of cards a red blue makes

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.809 
see a contrast of cards a red blue makes
a<00:03:53.430> contrast<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:57.470> there<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.620> go<00:03:58.800> so<00:03:59.580> then<00:03:59.700> you

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
a contrast and there you go so then you

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.600 
a contrast and there you go so then you
can<00:03:59.970> just<00:04:00.180> put<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:00.540> card<00:04:00.930> back<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.430> the
