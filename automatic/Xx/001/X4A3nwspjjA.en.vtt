rockin a hair in this case I'm loading
some<00:00:14.240> Genesis<00:00:15.240> ones<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.130> as<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.250> noticed<00:00:17.580> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
some Genesis ones and as you noticed I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.769 
some Genesis ones and as you noticed I
also<00:00:17.970> apply<00:00:18.630> some<00:00:19.010> simple<00:00:20.010> poses<00:00:20.480> so<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.539> see

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
also apply some simple poses so you see

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.349 
also apply some simple poses so you see
that<00:00:21.990> preview<00:00:22.800> hair<00:00:23.010> will<00:00:23.400> adjust<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that preview hair will adjust and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.859 
that preview hair will adjust and
conform<00:00:25.490> automatically<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:27.180> also<00:00:27.390> use<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
conform automatically I can also use the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.040 
conform automatically I can also use the
post<00:00:28.140> tool<00:00:29.060> to<00:00:30.590> finely-tuned<00:00:31.590> my<00:00:31.859> pose<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:33.050> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
post tool to finely-tuned my pose and of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.780 
post tool to finely-tuned my pose and of
course<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.440> works<00:00:34.649> also<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.280> other<00:00:35.489> models

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
course this works also with other models

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.410 
course this works also with other models
in<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> case<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> gorilla<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:39.000> also

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
in this case we have a gorilla and also

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.720 
in this case we have a gorilla and also
here<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:41.010> apply<00:00:41.790> any<00:00:42.390> pose<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
here we can apply any pose we like and

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.590 
here we can apply any pose we like and
as<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.649> go<00:00:46.649> through<00:00:47.340> modifying<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> hair

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
as you see go through modifying the hair

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.740 
as you see go through modifying the hair
quantity<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:50.039> route<00:00:50.219> n2t<00:00:50.940> sorry<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> root

quantity the route n2t sorry the root

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.660 
quantity the route n2t sorry the root
and<00:00:51.960> tip<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.570> do<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> test<00:00:54.870> render

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
and tip with and do a test render

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.760 
and tip with and do a test render
actually<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.090> will<00:00:57.329> come<00:00:57.590> here<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
actually the more will come here is a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.819 
actually the more will come here is a
new<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.550> with<00:00:59.789> another<00:01:00.000> pose<00:01:00.620> we<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
new one with another pose we get a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
new one with another pose we get a
little<00:01:02.129> bit<00:01:02.250> closer<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> test

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
little bit closer and we get a test

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.480 
little bit closer and we get a test
render<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.489> head<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.390> gorilla<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
render from the head of the gorilla and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.390 
render from the head of the gorilla and
the<00:01:08.490> pain<00:01:08.670> allows<00:01:09.030> also<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.540> change<00:01:10.320> route<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the pain allows also to change route and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.510 
the pain allows also to change route and
thick<00:01:11.610> colors<00:01:12.090> even<00:01:12.780> apply<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.979> custom

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
thick colors even apply your custom

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.840 
thick colors even apply your custom
shaders<00:01:15.049> whether<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.500> loaded<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.159> down

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
shaders whether they are loaded or down

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.359 
shaders whether they are loaded or down
in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> shredder<00:01:18.689> mixer<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.890> case<00:01:20.130> I'm

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
in the shredder mixer in this case I'm

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
in the shredder mixer in this case I'm
going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.030> create<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.930> pink<00:01:22.439> gorilla<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
going to create a pink gorilla so you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.060 
going to create a pink gorilla so you
see<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.820> pen<00:01:27.030> allows<00:01:27.330> great<00:01:28.020> amount<00:01:28.920> of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
see that the pen allows great amount of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
see that the pen allows great amount of
customization<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:31.020> change<00:01:31.290> everything

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
customization you can change everything

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.370 
customization you can change everything
there<00:01:33.049> now<00:01:34.049> I'm<00:01:34.259> playing<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.430> horse

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
there now I'm playing with that horse

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.020 
there now I'm playing with that horse
and<00:01:38.990> loading<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.110> new<00:01:40.140> preset<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.610> will<00:01:41.790> see

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and loading a new preset as you will see

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.380 
and loading a new preset as you will see
in<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.110> little<00:01:43.259> bit<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:45.200> will<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.320> able<00:01:46.439> also<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
in a little bit I will be able also to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.330 
in a little bit I will be able also to
modify<00:01:48.390> each<00:01:49.020> shade<00:01:49.649> group<00:01:49.979> available<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
modify each shade group available and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.709 
modify each shade group available and
change<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:54.720> properties<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.530> those

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
change the properties of those

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.700 
change the properties of those
individually<00:01:59.060> so<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> test<00:02:01.049> render<00:02:01.320> as

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
individually so here is a test render as

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.389 
individually so here is a test render as
you<00:02:01.860> notice<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.610> colors<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.570> gathered

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
you notice the colors are gathered

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.050 
you notice the colors are gathered
automatically<00:02:05.399> from<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.939> model<00:02:06.810> texture<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
automatically from the model texture and

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.500 
automatically from the model texture and
here<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.330> are<00:02:10.039> applying<00:02:11.039> some<00:02:11.520> poses<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
here we are applying some poses to the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.550 
here we are applying some poses to the
whole

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
whole

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.840 
whole
and<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:16.390> we<00:02:16.600> are<00:02:16.630> satisfied<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.830> do<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.250> test

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
and as we are satisfied we can do a test

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.470 
and as we are satisfied we can do a test
render

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
render

are just test renders so as I told you

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.340 
are just test renders so as I told you
earlier<00:02:29.770> we<00:02:30.400> are<00:02:30.460> going<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.760> modify<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:32.080> shade

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
earlier we are going to modify the shade

I'm<00:02:51.760> going<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.240> show<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.510> how<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:53.820> force<00:02:54.820> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
I'm going to show you how to force a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.450 
I'm going to show you how to force a
custom<00:02:55.690> color<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.590> do<00:02:56.710> also<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.130> from

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
custom color you can do also that from

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.660 
custom color you can do also that from
the<00:02:57.670> surfaces<00:02:58.360> pane<00:02:58.990> in<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.070> case<00:03:00.310> I'm<00:03:00.490> going

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
the surfaces pane in this case I'm going

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.290 
the surfaces pane in this case I'm going
to<00:03:00.930> apply<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.050> red<00:03:02.410> color<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:03.340> all<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:04.000> four

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
to apply a red color to all the four

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.400 
to apply a red color to all the four
shade<00:03:04.900> groups<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:07.330> as<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.630> will<00:03:07.810> see<00:03:08.020> in<00:03:08.350> a

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
shade groups so as you will see in a

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.360 
shade groups so as you will see in a
moment<00:03:09.330> when<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.420> do<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.600> test<00:03:10.690> render<00:03:11.200> all<00:03:12.010> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
moment when I do a test render all the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.480 
moment when I do a test render all the
food<00:03:12.610> will<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:12.910> red<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.190> say<00:03:15.310> that

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
food will be red so this is to say that

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.920 
food will be red so this is to say that
it<00:03:15.610> allows<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.910> great<00:03:16.300> amount<00:03:16.720> of

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
it allows a great amount of

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.590 
it allows a great amount of
customization<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:18.520> we<00:03:18.580> go<00:03:18.850> even<00:03:19.240> to

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
customization and now we go even to

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.980 
customization and now we go even to
export<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.650> obj<00:03:20.800> because<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.730> pain<00:03:21.970> does<00:03:22.630> also

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
export to obj because the pain does also

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.130
