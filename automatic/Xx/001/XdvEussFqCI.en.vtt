like<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.480> truly<00:00:57.719> blame<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> on

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
like this but I truly blame it on

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.709 
like this but I truly blame it on
Mitsubishi<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.520> not<00:00:59.640> bringing<00:00:59.820> enough<00:01:00.180> value

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
Mitsubishi for not bringing enough value

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.660 
Mitsubishi for not bringing enough value
while<00:01:01.109> pricing<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> almost<00:01:01.980> identically<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
while pricing it almost identically to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.690 
while pricing it almost identically to
the<00:01:02.910> STI<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:04.619> known<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.220> STI<00:01:05.610> is

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the STI it is well known that the STI is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.670 
the STI it is well known that the STI is
a<00:01:05.880> much<00:01:06.090> better<00:01:06.119> all-around<00:01:06.630> package<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
a much better all-around package and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
a much better all-around package and
there's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> lot<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.400> value<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.299> base

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
there's a lot more value on the base

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.109 
there's a lot more value on the base
models<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.070> rigid<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> evo

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
models but it's not as rigid as the evo

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.570 
models but it's not as rigid as the evo
with<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.320> more<00:01:13.530> effort<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:14.070> luxury

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
with a little more effort on luxury

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
with a little more effort on luxury
inside<00:01:15.119> there<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:15.840> an<00:01:15.930> opportunity<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.680> win

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
inside there was an opportunity to win

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.090 
inside there was an opportunity to win
some<00:01:17.100> business<00:01:17.460> back<00:01:17.780> now<00:01:18.780> back<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.170> 2003<00:01:19.979> an

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
some business back now back in 2003 an

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.550 
some business back now back in 2003 an
interior<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.180> okay<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.439> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
interior like this was okay but as you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.960 
interior like this was okay but as you
can<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.890> over<00:01:23.189> time<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:24.030> much<00:01:24.270> has<00:01:24.450> changed

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
can see over time not much has changed

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.600 
can see over time not much has changed
over<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> years<00:01:27.570> both<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.500> STI<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> evo

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
over the years both the STI and the evo

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
over the years both the STI and the evo
evolved<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.840> believe<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> evo<00:01:31.770> 10

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
evolved but I believe when the evo 10

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.280 
evolved but I believe when the evo 10
came<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> sheer<00:01:33.659> decline<00:01:34.110> in

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
came out is when the sheer decline in

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.730 
came out is when the sheer decline in
sales<00:01:34.500> began<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> STI<00:01:36.030> took<00:01:36.360> over<00:01:36.750> things

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
sales began and the STI took over things

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.830 
sales began and the STI took over things
as<00:01:37.920> simple<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.400> only<00:01:38.670> offering<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.210> 5-speed

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
as simple as only offering a 5-speed

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
as simple as only offering a 5-speed
instead<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.380> 6-speed<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> base<00:01:41.369> model

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
instead of a 6-speed in a base model

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
instead of a 6-speed in a base model
will<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.360> enough<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> turn<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:43.380> drivers<00:01:43.799> away

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
will be enough to turn some drivers away

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.190 
will be enough to turn some drivers away
because<00:01:44.670> most<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.149> us<00:01:45.270> use<00:01:45.329> these<00:01:45.689> cars<00:01:45.990> as

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
because most of us use these cars as

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
because most of us use these cars as
daily<00:01:46.560> drivers<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> having<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.909> loud<00:01:48.210> drone

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
daily drivers and having that loud drone

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.469 
daily drivers and having that loud drone
on<00:01:48.840> some<00:01:49.079> commutes<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> work<00:01:49.680> would<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.159> old

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
on some commutes to work would get old

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.149 
on some commutes to work would get old
now<00:01:51.479> obviously<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.290> my<00:01:52.439> opinion<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
now obviously this is my opinion so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.010 
now obviously this is my opinion so
please<00:01:53.430> share<00:01:53.700> yours<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.299> why<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.899> the
