00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.709 
actually fully gonna double and serviced
in<00:01:50.460> half<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.570> oh<00:01:51.780> well

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719

so generic mantra that we see all the
time<00:01:58.899> basically<00:01:59.170> I'm<00:01:59.979> actually<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.280> nappy

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
time basically I'm actually a nappy

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:01.830 
time basically I'm actually a nappy
knees<00:02:00.609> this<00:02:00.789> one's<00:02:01.060> gonna<00:02:01.149> put<00:02:01.390> in<00:02:01.479> there<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:01.749> I

knees this one's gonna put in there so I

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.709 
knees this one's gonna put in there so I
know<00:02:02.200> what<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:03.310> goes<00:02:03.549> with<00:02:03.819> obviously<00:02:04.600> this

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
know what it goes with obviously this

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.779 
know what it goes with obviously this
would<00:02:04.899> be<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.740> good<00:02:06.009> one<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.310> do<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.549> water

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
would be a good one to do the water

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.100 
would be a good one to do the water
trick<00:02:07.179> with<00:02:07.359> where<00:02:07.569> you<00:02:07.659> can<00:02:07.750> straighten<00:02:08.019> them

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
trick with where you can straighten them

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.130 
trick with where you can straighten them
out<00:02:08.200> with<00:02:08.500> using<00:02:08.799> hot<00:02:09.099> warm<00:02:09.399> water<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.179> mean

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
out with using hot warm water I mean

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.119 
out with using hot warm water I mean
what<00:02:11.739> hot<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.160> cold<00:02:12.370> water<00:02:12.430> excuse<00:02:13.030> me<00:02:14.129> so

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
what hot and cold water excuse me so

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.309 
what hot and cold water excuse me so
looks<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:15.940> actually<00:02:16.269> metal<00:02:16.450> part<00:02:16.690> does<00:02:17.049> look

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
looks like actually metal part does look

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.580 
looks like actually metal part does look
like<00:02:17.440> it's<00:02:17.620> metal<00:02:17.950> still<00:02:18.280> that's<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:19.000> good<00:02:19.180> sign

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
like it's metal still that's a good sign

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.309 
like it's metal still that's a good sign
as<00:02:20.590> far<00:02:20.830> as<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.040> quality<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:21.700> BAE

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
as far as the quality of this BAE

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.869 
as far as the quality of this BAE
there's<00:02:23.319> still<00:02:23.530> code<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:23.980> here<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.580> go<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.790> BAE

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
there's still code on here and go to BAE

there's still code on here and go to BAE

watch this that may not be an effect

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.240 
watch this that may not be an effect
anymore<00:02:34.049> but<00:02:35.049> there's<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.590> commercial<00:02:35.980> for

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
anymore but there's a commercial for

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.770 
anymore but there's a commercial for
these<00:02:36.370> guys<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.150> think<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.450> says<00:02:37.599> if<00:02:37.720> you

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
these guys and I think it says if you

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.940 
these guys and I think it says if you
enter<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.989> cold<00:02:38.170> stealth<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.560> get<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.739> tweak

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
enter the cold stealth to get a tweak

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.710 
enter the cold stealth to get a tweak
free<00:02:39.160> try<00:02:39.370> out<00:02:39.489> work<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.910> think<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:40.599> use

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
free try out work I think you can use

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.619 
free try out work I think you can use
any<00:02:41.019> bays<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.470> any<00:02:41.829> pieces<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.579> on<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
any bays and any pieces in that on the

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.890 
any bays and any pieces in that on the
online<00:02:43.780> game<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.560> looks<00:02:45.459> like<00:02:45.670> that's<00:02:46.540> there's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
online game so looks like that's there's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.080 
online game so looks like that's there's
not<00:02:47.019> multiple<00:02:47.170> arcgis<00:02:47.620> show<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:48.819> looks<00:02:48.970> like

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
not multiple arcgis show it looks like

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.610 
not multiple arcgis show it looks like
perhaps<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.019> course<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.319> battle<00:02:50.590> that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
perhaps to the course the battle that

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.099 
perhaps to the course the battle that
tip<00:02:50.950> maybe<00:02:51.250> changes<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:51.910> that's<00:02:52.000> what<00:02:52.390> causes

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
tip maybe changes and that's what causes

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.809 
tip maybe changes and that's what causes
the<00:02:53.290> blades<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.870> enter<00:02:55.870> her<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.379> open<00:02:56.950> up<00:02:57.190> see

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
the blades to enter her to open up see

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.180 
the blades to enter her to open up see
what<00:02:57.940> duck<00:02:58.230> instructions<00:02:59.230> here<00:02:59.530> safe<00:02:59.859> it's<00:03:00.130> a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
what duck instructions here safe it's a

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.220 
what duck instructions here safe it's a
dead<00:03:00.340> end<00:03:00.370> special<00:03:00.880> just<00:03:01.599> that<00:03:01.720> weapon<00:03:01.989> push

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
dead end special just that weapon push

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.050 
dead end special just that weapon push
wins<00:03:02.440> into<00:03:02.799> they<00:03:02.889> lock<00:03:03.069> in<00:03:03.250> place<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.760> color

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
wins into they lock in place and color

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.990 
wins into they lock in place and color
blocks<00:03:04.420> turn<00:03:04.840> blue<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.519> can<00:03:06.700> see<00:03:06.849> there's

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
blocks turn blue so you can see there's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.729 
blocks turn blue so you can see there's
some<00:03:07.209> blue<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.660> there<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.109> you<00:03:08.200> push<00:03:08.470> them<00:03:08.620> in

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
some blue on there if you push them in

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.920 
some blue on there if you push them in
the<00:03:09.099> blue<00:03:09.340> goes<00:03:09.549> in<00:03:09.790> there<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.660> instead<00:03:10.870> of

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the blue goes in there so instead of

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.780 
the blue goes in there so instead of
being<00:03:11.079> orange<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:11.680> blue<00:03:11.919> and<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.519> will<00:03:12.639> lock

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
being orange it's blue and it will lock

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.940 
being orange it's blue and it will lock
in<00:03:12.970> if<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.120> push<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.419> all<00:03:13.480> away<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.680> then<00:03:14.799> just

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
in if you push it all away and then just

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.250 
in if you push it all away and then just
shows<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.190> how<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.340> launch<00:03:15.639> it<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.139> says

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
shows you how to launch it see it says

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.900 
shows you how to launch it see it says
when<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.470> top<00:03:17.709> collides<00:03:18.220> color<00:03:18.639> block

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
when the top collides color block

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.050 
when the top collides color block
changes<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.480> orange<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.169> wings<00:03:20.380> deploy

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
changes to orange and the wings deploy

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.780 
changes to orange and the wings deploy
five<00:03:22.060> reset<00:03:22.599> in<00:03:22.720> battle<00:03:22.989> again<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.489> guess

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
five reset in battle again so I guess

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.599 
five reset in battle again so I guess
first<00:03:25.540> decent<00:03:26.290> collision<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:26.950> gets<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.370> should

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
first decent collision it gets it should

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.940 
first decent collision it gets it should
deploy<00:03:27.849> them<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:29.079> let's<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.500> try<00:03:29.739> cooking

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
deploy them so let's just try cooking

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.059 
deploy them so let's just try cooking
these<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.430> here<00:03:30.730> then<00:03:31.690> I'm<00:03:31.780> guessing<00:03:32.019> if<00:03:32.590> one

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
these in here then I'm guessing if one

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.809 
these in here then I'm guessing if one
of<00:03:33.130> these<00:03:33.190> gets<00:03:33.400> hit<00:03:35.040> yeah<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.340> Folies<00:03:36.639> gets

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
of these gets hit yeah so Folies gets

put it on the launcher without actually
activating<00:04:34.060> him<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.480> that<00:04:34.630> turn<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.870> just

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
activating him so that turn I just

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.230 
activating him so that turn I just
naturally<00:04:35.260> push<00:04:36.190> in<00:04:36.460> on<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.610> little<00:04:36.940> levers

goes totally not a stadium but deployed
his<00:04:46.570> wings<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:47.110> guess<00:04:47.740> see<00:04:47.890> without<00:04:48.010> any<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:48.430> our

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
his wings I guess see without any of our

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.909 
his wings I guess see without any of our
contact<00:04:49.030> how<00:04:49.240> quickly<00:04:49.510> he<00:04:49.660> gets<00:04:49.690> lopsided<00:04:50.410> and

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
contact how quickly he gets lopsided and

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.680 
contact how quickly he gets lopsided and
also<00:04:51.190> we<00:04:51.250> all<00:04:51.340> stopped<00:04:51.580> spinning<00:04:51.880> basically

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
also we all stopped spinning basically

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.200 
also we all stopped spinning basically
one<00:04:52.930> tip<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.650> balloons<00:04:54.130> are<00:04:54.220> deployed<00:04:54.520> and

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
one tip that balloons are deployed and

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.390 
one tip that balloons are deployed and
his<00:04:55.450> balance<00:04:55.840> is<00:04:55.900> completely<00:04:56.380> gone<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:57.310> can

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
his balance is completely gone you can

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.400 
his balance is completely gone you can
see<00:04:57.550> there<00:04:57.730> he<00:04:58.060> lasts<00:04:58.450> a<00:04:58.600> very<00:04:58.960> short<00:04:59.290> while

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
see there he lasts a very short while

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.909 
see there he lasts a very short while
after<00:04:59.740> his<00:05:00.370> weapons<00:05:00.730> are<00:05:00.820> deployed<00:05:01.080> so<00:05:02.080> he's

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
after his weapons are deployed so he's

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.230 
after his weapons are deployed so he's

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
the best option I obviously I've been

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.610 
the best option I obviously I've been
