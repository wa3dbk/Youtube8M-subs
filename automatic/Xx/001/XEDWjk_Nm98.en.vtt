00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.910 

hmm<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.620> is<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:04.130> smooth<00:02:04.400> fire<00:02:04.730> yes<00:02:05.920> that's

hmm this is a smooth fire yes that's
what<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.130> can<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.700> conclude<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.170> battery

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
what I can just conclude and the battery

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.770 
what I can just conclude and the battery
wasn't<00:02:09.830> charged<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.490> we<00:02:10.640> flew<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.030> only<00:02:11.510> for<00:02:11.750> a

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
wasn't charged so we flew it only for a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.020 
wasn't charged so we flew it only for a
minute<00:02:12.170> or<00:02:12.320> so<00:02:12.430> I'm<00:02:13.430> gonna<00:02:13.640> charge<00:02:13.880> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
minute or so I'm gonna charge the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.640 
minute or so I'm gonna charge the
batteries<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:14.930> give<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> fly<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.440> again

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
batteries that we give a fly it again

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.760 
batteries that we give a fly it again
but<00:02:16.340> let's<00:02:16.610> take<00:02:16.940> out<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.510> think<00:02:18.050> what<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.560> that

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
but let's take out I think what is that

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.140 
but let's take out I think what is that
so3<00:02:19.370> 2<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.150> s<00:02:20.420> 100
