00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.420 
technique because when I teach whether
it's<00:02:20.860> beginner<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.280> white<00:02:21.579> belt<00:02:21.819> or<00:02:22.389> a<00:02:23.430> 27th

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
it's beginner a white belt or a 27th

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.699 
it's beginner a white belt or a 27th
degree<00:02:24.639> black<00:02:24.880> belt<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.200> break<00:02:26.440> down<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
degree black belt if you break down the

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.400 
degree black belt if you break down the
technique<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.639> far<00:02:28.060> what<00:02:28.989> happens<00:02:29.260> if<00:02:29.380> people

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
technique so far what happens if people

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.990 
technique so far what happens if people
get<00:02:29.650> very<00:02:29.920> mechanical<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:30.639> they<00:02:30.760> start

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
get very mechanical and they start

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.960 
get very mechanical and they start
thinking<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.810> much<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.319> all<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.650> sudden<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
thinking so much and all of a sudden the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.710 
thinking so much and all of a sudden the
flow<00:02:34.590> isn't<00:02:35.590> able<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.889> take<00:02:36.220> over<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.690> I

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
flow isn't able to take over and so I

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.059 
flow isn't able to take over and so I
want<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.079> guys<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.590> couple<00:02:38.920> of

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
want you guys to have a couple of

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.150 
want you guys to have a couple of
fundamentals<00:02:40.200> one<00:02:41.200> fundamental<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.829> when<00:02:42.069> you

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
fundamentals one fundamental is when you

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.890 
fundamentals one fundamental is when you
make<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.489> kick<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.030> flat<00:02:43.389> of<00:02:43.540> your<00:02:43.569> foot

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
make the kick the flat of your foot

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.420 
make the kick the flat of your foot
makes<00:02:44.109> contact

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.880 

so<00:02:46.940> it's<00:02:47.060> not<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.360> ball<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.690> my<00:02:47.720> foot<00:02:48.019> it's<00:02:48.739> not

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
so it's not the ball of my foot it's not

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.710 
so it's not the ball of my foot it's not
necessarily<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.610> heel<00:02:49.819> it's<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.150> whole<00:02:50.420> flat

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
necessarily the heel it's the whole flat

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.490 
necessarily the heel it's the whole flat
I<00:02:51.370> want<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:53.510> course<00:02:53.780> look<00:02:54.110> before<00:02:54.290> you

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
I want you to of course look before you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.809 
I want you to of course look before you
kick

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.520 

I<00:02:58.909> want<00:02:59.629> you<00:02:59.749> to<00:02:59.870> have<00:03:00.079> snap

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.320 

and<00:03:05.620> then<00:03:06.190> eventually<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.670> want<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.030> just<00:03:07.209> to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
and then eventually I want you just to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.830 
and then eventually I want you just to
feel<00:03:07.930> your<00:03:08.770> opponent's<00:03:09.370> body<00:03:09.880> position<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
feel your opponent's body position and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.199 
feel your opponent's body position and
you<00:03:11.230> will<00:03:11.350> no<00:03:11.500> longer<00:03:11.709> have<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.010> look<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:13.090> will

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
you will no longer have to look you will

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.980 
you will no longer have to look you will
just<00:03:13.390> know<00:03:13.720> they're<00:03:13.900> in<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.140> right<00:03:14.170> position

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.820 

so<00:03:21.500> if<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.520> was<00:03:22.700> training<00:03:23.150> for<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:24.320> fight<00:03:24.560> coming

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
so if I was training for a fight coming

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.980 
so if I was training for a fight coming
up<00:03:24.980> I'd<00:03:25.130> be<00:03:25.280> practicing<00:03:25.850> myself<00:03:26.270> by<00:03:26.570> spinning

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
up I'd be practicing myself by spinning

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.800 
up I'd be practicing myself by spinning
sidekick<00:03:27.410> more<00:03:27.560> than<00:03:27.710> any<00:03:27.830> other<00:03:28.010> kick<00:03:28.810> from
