okay<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.790> put<00:00:08.969> these<00:00:09.179> sponge<00:00:09.570> rollers<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.290> her

okay we put these sponge rollers in her

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.310 
okay we put these sponge rollers in her
hair<00:00:10.709> last<00:00:10.950> night<00:00:11.219> while<00:00:11.459> it<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:11.759> wet<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.389> as

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
hair last night while it was wet and as

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.940 
hair last night while it was wet and as
you<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.709> see<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.920> didn't<00:00:14.279> use<00:00:14.400> very

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
you can see I didn't use very

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.620 
you can see I didn't use very
any<00:00:15.040> of<00:00:15.130> them<00:00:15.250> I<00:00:15.400> think<00:00:15.610> there's<00:00:15.760> eight<00:00:16.119> on<00:00:16.420> her

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
any of them I think there's eight on her

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.529 
any of them I think there's eight on her
whole<00:00:16.840> head<00:00:17.110> so<00:00:18.100> now<00:00:18.460> that<00:00:18.520> they're<00:00:18.820> dry<00:00:19.150> we're

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
whole head so now that they're dry we're

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.900 
whole head so now that they're dry we're
just<00:00:19.720> going<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.869> take<00:00:20.080> these<00:00:20.289> out<00:00:20.529> and<00:00:20.910> I

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
just going to take these out and I

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.359 
just going to take these out and I
usually<00:00:22.270> start<00:00:22.630> at<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:23.050> bottom<00:00:23.230> because<00:00:23.830> if

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
usually start at the bottom because if

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.970 
usually start at the bottom because if
you<00:00:24.759> take<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.090> ones<00:00:25.270> out<00:00:25.480> on<00:00:25.509> top<00:00:25.930> then<00:00:26.860> you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
you take the ones out on top then you

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.440 
you take the ones out on top then you
have<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.279> kind<00:00:27.430> of<00:00:27.550> fight<00:00:27.790> the<00:00:28.000> hair<00:00:28.210> when

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
have to kind of fight the hair when

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.970 
have to kind of fight the hair when
you're<00:00:28.540> taking<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.900> ones<00:00:29.110> on<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.320> bottom<00:00:29.650> so

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
you're taking the ones on the bottom so

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.060 
you're taking the ones on the bottom so
you<00:00:30.250> do<00:00:31.180> those<00:00:31.360> first<00:00:31.660> it'll<00:00:32.110> go<00:00:32.259> easier<00:00:32.680> for

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
you do those first it'll go easier for

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.190 
you do those first it'll go easier for
you<00:00:33.280> all<00:00:33.820> right<00:00:34.000> so<00:00:34.180> after<00:00:34.390> you<00:00:34.720> get<00:00:34.870> the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
you all right so after you get the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.170 
you all right so after you get the
curlers<00:00:35.800> taken<00:00:36.220> out<00:00:36.370> this<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.760> what<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.059> will

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
curlers taken out this is what it will

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.660 
curlers taken out this is what it will
look<00:00:37.239> like<00:00:37.570> and<00:00:37.899> you<00:00:38.860> don't<00:00:39.040> want<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.370> comb

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
look like and you don't want to comb

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.850 
look like and you don't want to comb
through<00:00:39.700> these<00:00:40.210> unless<00:00:40.660> you<00:00:40.930> want<00:00:41.170> it<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.739> be

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
through these unless you want it to be

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.549 
through these unless you want it to be
frizzy<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:43.270> I<00:00:43.300> usually<00:00:43.510> do<00:00:43.840> is<00:00:44.050> just<00:00:44.079> kind<00:00:44.469> of

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
frizzy what I usually do is just kind of

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.889 
frizzy what I usually do is just kind of
take<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.250> curls<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.790> separate<00:00:46.329> them<00:00:46.510> with<00:00:46.719> my

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
take the curls and separate them with my

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.560 
take the curls and separate them with my
fingers<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.290> little<00:00:47.620> bit<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:49.000> when<00:00:49.300> I<00:00:49.330> was

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
fingers a little bit and when I was

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.380 
fingers a little bit and when I was
putting<00:00:50.140> these<00:00:50.320> in<00:00:50.560> I<00:00:51.010> did<00:00:51.220> make<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.790> part<00:00:52.180> right

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
putting these in I did make a part right

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.050 
putting these in I did make a part right
here<00:00:52.570> on<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:52.840> top<00:00:53.079> so<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.650> will<00:00:53.910> already<00:00:54.910> be

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
here on the top so that will already be

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.760 
here on the top so that will already be
there<00:00:55.420> because<00:00:55.720> it's<00:00:55.990> pretty<00:00:56.140> hard<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.590> make<00:00:56.740> a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
there because it's pretty hard to make a

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.459 
there because it's pretty hard to make a
part<00:00:57.130> with<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.460> curls<00:00:57.820> in

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.960 

so<00:01:01.039> just<00:01:01.250> kind<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.550> get<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.359> curls<00:01:02.629> separated

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.030 

and<00:01:08.060> then<00:01:08.690> at<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:09.080> point<00:01:09.410> I'm<00:01:09.830> going<00:01:09.950> to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
and then at this point I'm going to

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.120 
and then at this point I'm going to
leave<00:01:10.220> some<00:01:10.250> hair<00:01:10.760> in<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.150> front<00:01:11.480> and<00:01:11.870> so<00:01:12.830> just

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
leave some hair in the front and so just

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.160 
leave some hair in the front and so just
make<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.370> part<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:16.090> do<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.240> on<00:01:17.480> both<00:01:17.720> sides

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
make a part and do that on both sides

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.320 
make a part and do that on both sides
that<00:01:18.590> one's<00:01:18.920> kind<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:19.280> already<00:01:19.460> parted<00:01:19.940> out<00:01:20.120> so

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
that one's kind of already parted out so

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.960 
that one's kind of already parted out so
I'm<00:01:20.450> going<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.780> leave<00:01:21.050> that<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.760> then<00:01:22.760> with

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
I'm going to leave that and then with

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.660 
I'm going to leave that and then with
this<00:01:23.150> hair<00:01:23.510> on<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.930> top<00:01:24.170> I'm<00:01:24.980> just<00:01:25.190> going<00:01:25.640> to

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
this hair on the top I'm just going to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.600 
this hair on the top I'm just going to
gather<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.240> half<00:01:26.720> ponytail<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.680> if<00:01:28.460> you're

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
gather a half ponytail and if you're

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.490 
gather a half ponytail and if you're
working<00:01:28.820> with<00:01:29.120> long<00:01:29.480> hair<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:29.840> might<00:01:30.260> want<00:01:30.440> to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
working with long hair you might want to

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.020 
working with long hair you might want to
just<00:01:30.680> take<00:01:30.830> all<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.400> hair<00:01:31.640> into<00:01:31.880> a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
just take all of the hair into a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.160 
just take all of the hair into a
ponytail<00:01:32.450> instead<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.500> doing<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.830> half<00:01:33.980> pony

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
ponytail instead of doing a half pony

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.990 
ponytail instead of doing a half pony
but<00:01:36.170> just<00:01:36.440> smooth<00:01:36.710> that<00:01:36.740> out<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.130> little<00:01:37.460> bit<00:01:37.790> on

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
but just smooth that out a little bit on

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.530 
but just smooth that out a little bit on
the<00:01:38.180> top<00:01:38.450> don't<00:01:39.230> comb<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.710> curls<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.540> then

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
the top don't comb the curls and then

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.730 
the top don't comb the curls and then
you<00:01:41.900> can<00:01:42.050> add<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.260> clear<00:01:42.680> elastic<00:01:44.320> or<00:01:45.320> if<00:01:45.590> you

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
you can add a clear elastic or if you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.469 
you can add a clear elastic or if you
would<00:01:45.860> rather<00:01:46.070> bobby<00:01:46.490> pin<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.030> can<00:01:47.330> do

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
would rather bobby pin it you can do

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.000 
would rather bobby pin it you can do
that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.710 

and<00:01:51.190> then<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:51.700> don't<00:01:52.030> want<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.360> super<00:01:52.720> tight<00:01:53.200> so

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and then I don't want it super tight so

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.330 
and then I don't want it super tight so
I'm<00:01:55.720> going<00:01:55.870> to<00:01:55.960> loosen<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.530> up<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.860> little<00:01:57.040> bit

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
I'm going to loosen it up a little bit

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.219 
I'm going to loosen it up a little bit
on<00:01:57.790> top

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.560 

and<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.159> pull<00:02:02.399> some<00:02:02.670> hair<00:02:02.700> out<00:02:03.149> on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and just kind of pull some hair out on

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.620 
and just kind of pull some hair out on
the<00:02:03.689> top

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the top

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.520 
the top
so<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:06.260> will<00:02:06.350> look<00:02:06.470> like<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:08.530> I'm

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
so it will look like that and then I'm

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
bobby pins I can tell that piece might

come<00:04:00.170> out<00:04:00.760> spin<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.880> as<00:04:02.000> much<00:04:02.180> as<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.360> need<00:04:02.660> to

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
come out spin it as much as you need to

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.040 
come out spin it as much as you need to
but<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.850> is<00:04:05.090> pretty<00:04:05.300> much<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.720> finished

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
but that is pretty much the finished

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.600 
but that is pretty much the finished
look<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.740> only<00:04:06.890> takes<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.310> few<00:04:07.340> minutes<00:04:07.910> I<00:04:09.610> think

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
look it only takes a few minutes I think

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:21.370 
look it only takes a few minutes I think
it<00:04:10.880> turned<00:04:11.120> out<00:04:11.240> really<00:04:11.300> pretty
