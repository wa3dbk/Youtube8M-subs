00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.469
 today we have a scribble 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.469
 this witch hat 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.470
 for making origami hats we 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.980
 take a square sheet of paper and fold 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.980
 it diagonally 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.400
 now we need to make two corners so 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.530
 towards each other 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.530
 top corner somewhere around 30 degrees 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.550
 fold the folds now two corners 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.730
 lift up and fold so that's why 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.730
 to 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.020
 we put them down we fold them so that 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.160
 This is the line we have come to this 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.410
 horizontal that's such a long 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:19.450
 narrow triangle once folded and 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.750
 on the previously laid up line by bending 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.100
 now the second triangle is exactly the same 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.440
 horizontal lines we get 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.280
 long narrow triangle and again 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.810
 tucked it up here with us 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.330
 it turned out she is such a hat 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.789
 pointed and flat now we will 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.770
 make it bulky 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.119
 take the workpiece in hand and so 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.119
 open and do here 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.119
 volume 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.880
 Here she watches for the night turned out 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.630
 now we need to make a tail and of we 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.400
 flatten it a little and fold it down 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.310
 can be used for this purpose 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.860
 pen this pencil 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.740
 twirl the tip of the hat and fix 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.610
 when small we will be so cool 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.310
 thing to our hat better we stood 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.820
 Day after day down here this line 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:30.270
 here to this and second fibers we bend too 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.270
 way down 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.120
 our sorceress's hat is ready
