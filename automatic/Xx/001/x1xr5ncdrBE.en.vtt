00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:05.730 

well<00:05:03.180> it's<00:05:04.180> sad<00:05:04.510> that<00:05:04.540> it<00:05:05.140> has<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.470> be<00:05:05.590> like

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
well it's sad that it has to be like

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.170 
well it's sad that it has to be like
this<00:05:05.950> because<00:05:06.670> it's<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.240> great<00:05:07.420> game<00:05:08.970> but<00:05:09.970> this

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
this because it's a great game but this

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.310 
this because it's a great game but this
really<00:05:10.540> really<00:05:11.050> ruins<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.680> game<00:05:11.770> play<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.900> I

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
really really ruins the game play so I

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.470 
really really ruins the game play so I
wouldn't<00:05:15.010> recommend<00:05:15.280> it<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:15.610> play<00:05:16.090> this<00:05:16.270> game

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
wouldn't recommend it to play this game

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.370 
wouldn't recommend it to play this game

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
of this phone I mean it kind of makes it

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.500 
of this phone I mean it kind of makes it
unplayable<00:05:20.890> I<00:05:21.310> mean<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.700> worked<00:05:21.880> good<00:05:22.150> in<00:05:22.360> the

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
beginning but when you got into the

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.500 
beginning but when you got into the
