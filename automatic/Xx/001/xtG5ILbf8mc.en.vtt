a<00:02:05.159> part<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:06.000> that's<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.540> bit<00:02:06.719> more

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
a part here that's a little bit more

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.770 
a part here that's a little bit more
fleshy<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.390> kind<00:02:09.690> of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
fleshy what you can do is just kind of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.610 
fleshy what you can do is just kind of
bring<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.709> contour<00:02:11.250> powder<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:12.120> this

bring the contour powder up like this

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.440 
bring the contour powder up like this
so<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.310> gives<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.610> more<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.090> cheekbone

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
all over the place and the same

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.649 
all over the place and the same
technique<00:05:32.460> applies<00:05:32.879> now<00:05:33.240> we're<00:05:33.360> going<00:05:33.449> to<00:05:33.509> go

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
technique applies now we're going to go

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.360 
technique applies now we're going to go
up<00:05:33.870> with<00:05:34.020> step<00:05:34.259> so<00:05:34.409> you<00:05:34.500> basically<00:05:34.680> have<00:05:35.159> three

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
up with step so you basically have three

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.260 
up with step so you basically have three
steps<00:05:35.789> contour<00:05:36.750> blush<00:05:37.409> highlight<00:05:38.270> sounds

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
steps contour blush highlight sounds

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.270
