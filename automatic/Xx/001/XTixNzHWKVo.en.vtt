moves around right there so you can put
it<00:02:13.400> whatever<00:02:13.700> angle<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.180> want<00:02:14.300> connect<00:02:14.810> it

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
it whatever angle you want connect it

it whatever angle you want connect it
into<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> computer<00:02:17.739> looks<00:02:18.739> like<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.950> nice

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
into the computer looks like a nice

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.820 
into the computer looks like a nice
little<00:02:19.459> device<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.860> there<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.129> right<00:02:22.340> there

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
little device so there it is right there

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.170 
little device so there it is right there
okay<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:24.890> here<00:02:25.280> we<00:02:25.400> are<00:02:25.430> we're<00:02:25.670> going<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.879> plug

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
okay so here we are we're going to plug

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.809 
okay so here we are we're going to plug
in<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.569> freedom<00:02:27.140> spot<00:02:28.510> here

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
in the freedom spot here

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.600 
in the freedom spot here
freedom<00:02:31.819> stick<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:33.799> we'll<00:02:33.980> see<00:02:34.099> what<00:02:34.220> happens

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
freedom stick and we'll see what happens

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.460 
freedom stick and we'll see what happens
and<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:34.940> can<00:02:35.060> see<00:02:35.269> there<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.629> just<00:02:35.840> lit<00:02:36.170> up<00:02:38.470> has

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
and you can see there it just lit up has

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.979 
and you can see there it just lit up has
an<00:02:39.829> amber<00:02:40.280> light<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.239> main<00:02:41.450> circular

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
an amber light and the main circular

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.940 
an amber light and the main circular
light<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.379> then<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:43.000> five<00:02:44.319> LEDs<00:02:45.319> there<00:02:45.680> are

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
light and then the five LEDs there are

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:54.720 
light and then the five LEDs there are
lit<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.250> as<00:02:46.519> well<00:02:52.120> looks<00:02:53.120> like

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
lit up as well looks like

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.890 
lit up as well looks like
it<00:02:55.730> has<00:02:55.939> a<00:02:55.989> solid<00:02:56.989> green<00:02:57.260> light<00:02:57.560> now<00:02:57.769> and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
it has a solid green light now and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.509 
it has a solid green light now and
signal<00:02:59.900> here<00:03:00.319> at<00:03:00.439> my<00:03:00.560> house<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.950> about<00:03:01.129> three

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
signal here at my house is about three

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.710 
signal here at my house is about three
blue<00:03:02.269> LEDs<00:03:02.840> out<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:03.620> five<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.569> sound<00:03:05.569> like<00:03:05.659> a

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
blue LEDs out of five so sound like a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.289 
blue LEDs out of five so sound like a
decent<00:03:06.019> connection<00:03:06.709> now<00:03:07.670> typically<00:03:08.269> you

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
decent connection now typically you

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.940 
decent connection now typically you
would<00:03:08.480> need<00:03:08.599> to<00:03:08.720> activate<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.379> device<00:03:09.560> as

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
would need to activate this device as

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.280 
would need to activate this device as
well<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:11.209> one's<00:03:11.390> already<00:03:11.569> been<00:03:11.780> activated

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
well this one's already been activated

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.839 
well this one's already been activated
by<00:03:12.439> the<00:03:12.560> folks<00:03:12.829> that<00:03:12.920> freedompop<00:03:13.370> before<00:03:13.760> they

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
by the folks that freedompop before they

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.490 
by the folks that freedompop before they
sent<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.150> out<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.480> me

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
sent it out to me

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.059 
sent it out to me
so<00:03:15.920> let's<00:03:16.189> just<00:03:16.959> try<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.079> out<00:03:18.319> now<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.769> see<00:03:19.040> if

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
so let's just try it out now and see if

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:27.309 
so let's just try it out now and see if
this<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.370> working<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:26.450> can<00:03:26.599> see<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.019> lights

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
this is working you can see the lights

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.839 
this is working you can see the lights
are<00:03:27.500> all<00:03:27.590> lit<00:03:27.739> up<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.099> I<00:03:28.250> just<00:03:28.489> went<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.819> a

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.930 
website and went to the freedompop
website<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:32.000> came<00:03:32.120> up<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:32.359> fine

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
enough to do a little bit of testing by

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.580 
enough to do a little bit of testing by
so<00:04:57.490> why<00:04:57.910> don't<00:04:58.060> we<00:04:58.120> once<00:04:58.930> again<00:04:59.230> go<00:04:59.500> to

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
so why don't we once again go to

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.660 
so why don't we once again go to
speedtest.net<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:01.120> try<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:01.960> out<00:05:02.640> okay<00:05:03.640> so

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
speedtest.net and try it out okay so

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
wasn't as good see do we still have am

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.029 
wasn't as good see do we still have am
still<00:05:51.860> 40<00:05:52.220> connections<00:05:52.639> up<00:05:53.349> in<00:05:54.349> that<00:05:54.590> test

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
still 40 connections up in that test

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.040 
still 40 connections up in that test
right<00:05:55.340> there<00:05:55.669> both<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.509> devices<00:05:56.720> were

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
right there both the devices were

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.320 
right there both the devices were
basically<00:05:57.860> in<00:05:58.099> the<00:05:58.250> same<00:05:58.460> position<00:05:58.490> there<00:05:59.300> and

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
basically in the same position there and

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.110 
basically in the same position there and
the<00:05:59.780> freedom<00:06:00.080> stick<00:06:00.319> bolt<00:06:00.970> had<00:06:01.970> this

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
the freedom stick bolt had this

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.089 
the freedom stick bolt had this
significantly<00:06:02.750> better<00:06:02.900> download<00:06:03.199> speed<00:06:03.620> and

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
significantly better download speed and

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.029 
significantly better download speed and
a<00:06:04.160> little<00:06:04.370> bit<00:06:04.490> of<00:06:04.610> upload<00:06:04.880> speed<00:06:05.150> as<00:06:05.300> well<00:06:06.039> so

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
a little bit of upload speed as well so

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.950 
a little bit of upload speed as well so
there<00:06:07.340> we<00:06:07.460> have<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.729> the<00:06:07.880> freedom<00:06:08.120> pop<00:06:08.449> freedom

has the 3G fallback on there as well

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.580 
has the 3G fallback on there as well
and<00:06:28.610> what<00:06:29.449> I'm<00:06:29.539> driving<00:06:29.750> outside<00:06:30.229> of<00:06:30.349> a<00:06:30.409> good

and what I'm driving outside of a good
4G<00:06:31.009> area<00:06:31.340> it'll<00:06:31.669> just<00:06:32.330> fall<00:06:32.509> back<00:06:32.569> to<00:06:32.930> that<00:06:33.050> 3G

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
4G area it'll just fall back to that 3G

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.800 
4G area it'll just fall back to that 3G
internet<00:06:33.949> connection<00:06:34.400> whereas<00:06:35.240> this<00:06:35.419> is<00:06:35.479> only

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
internet connection whereas this is only

internet connection whereas this is only
for<00:06:36.050> G<00:06:36.289> so<00:06:36.590> it's<00:06:36.740> mainly<00:06:36.919> going<00:06:37.099> to<00:06:37.220> be<00:06:37.280> of<00:06:37.580> use

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
for G so it's mainly going to be of use

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.379

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
some more tests on that but

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.879 
some more tests on that but
right<00:07:08.830> now<00:07:09.250> can't<00:07:09.760> beat<00:07:09.970> either<00:07:10.150> one<00:07:10.889> it's
