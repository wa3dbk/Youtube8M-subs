replace the glass mm-hmm and then we

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.160 
replace the glass mm-hmm and then we

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
here mm-hmm what I like about this is

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.499 
here mm-hmm what I like about this is
first<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.580> all<00:01:58.670> it's<00:01:58.819> not<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:58.970> light<00:01:59.240> fixture

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
first of all it's not a light fixture

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.139 
first of all it's not a light fixture
that<00:02:00.020> everyone's<00:02:00.860> doing<00:02:01.100> right<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:01.850> it's<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.380 
new idea and if you're in a competition
about<00:02:05.570> repurposing<00:02:06.500> these<00:02:06.979> are<00:02:07.189> now<00:02:07.609> a<00:02:08.060> couple

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
about repurposing these are now a couple

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.029 
about repurposing these are now a couple
items<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.989> are<00:02:09.200> gonna<00:02:09.320> get<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> second<00:02:09.920> life

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
items that are gonna get a second life

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.039 
items that are gonna get a second life
so<00:02:10.280> I'm<00:02:10.340> really<00:02:10.489> excited<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.450> we've<00:02:11.660> got<00:02:11.840> some

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
so I'm really excited so we've got some

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.849 
so I'm really excited so we've got some
yarn<00:02:12.290> right<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.700> if<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.150> soak<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:15.109> some

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
yarn right so if we soak this in some

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.400 
yarn right so if we soak this in some
lighter<00:02:16.250> fluid<00:02:16.489> or<00:02:16.790> nail<00:02:17.660> polish<00:02:17.959> remover<00:02:18.290> or

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
lighter fluid or nail polish remover or

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.770 
lighter fluid or nail polish remover or
something<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:18.920> heat<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.250> with<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.370> torch

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
something and heat it with the torch

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.020 
something and heat it with the torch
wrap<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.959> string<00:02:21.200> around<00:02:21.230> here<00:02:21.940> thinking<00:02:22.940> we

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
wrap the string around here thinking we

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.370 
wrap the string around here thinking we
can<00:02:23.209> cut<00:02:23.359> the<00:02:23.480> bottom<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.930> bottle<00:02:24.230> off

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
can cut the bottom of the bottle off

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.360 
can cut the bottom of the bottle off
okay<00:02:28.810> all<00:02:29.810> right<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.079> we<00:02:30.170> got<00:02:30.320> yarn<00:02:30.680> we<00:02:31.220> got

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
okay all right so we got yarn we got

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.910

cooks<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.099> bottom<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.579> and<00:03:18.510> then<00:03:18.750> we'll<00:03:18.900> let

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
cooks the bottom off and then we'll let

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.229 
cooks the bottom off and then we'll let
it<00:03:19.140> go<00:03:19.290> as<00:03:19.469> long<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:19.769> we<00:03:19.859> can<00:03:20.069> then<00:03:21.030> we'll<00:03:21.120> just

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
it go as long as we can then we'll just

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.160 
it go as long as we can then we'll just
flash<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.569> in<00:03:21.870> here

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
flash it in here

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.740 
flash it in here
hopefully<00:03:25.170> it'll<00:03:25.319> snap<00:03:25.680> off<00:03:25.980> cleanly<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.939> think

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
hopefully it'll snap off cleanly I think
