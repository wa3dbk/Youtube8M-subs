00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.969
 i 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.809
 hi auto city friends how can you 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.480
 observe today we face two of the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.349
 most legendary and legendary sports 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.630
 market one of Japanese origin the gt-r 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:26.100
 530 horses and a twin-turbo engine the other 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.080
 the mythical bmw m-3 420 horses with a v8 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.390
 atmospheric we measure two forms 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
 different from achieving excellence 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.980
 prestacionales the radicality of the gt-r 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.790
 in the face of refinement and tradition 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.790
 of the m3 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.690
 at a dynamic level the gtr is one of the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.489
 best sports on the market thanks to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.860
 a twin-turbo v6 engine with 3.8 liters that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.259
 delivery for the occasion nothing less than 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.720
 530 horsepower with a 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.170
 really supernatural acceleration we 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.850
 hits the seat to the minimum gas stroke 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.399
 in front of the m3, evidently the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.789
 benefits are much greater 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.369
 accelerates from 0 to 100 in 35 seconds and 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.340
 reaches a maximum speed without limiting 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.679
 of 315 kilometers per hour its traction 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.720
 electronic total helps you to be the 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.070
 most efficient car of all 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.229
 supercars that are sold now 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.750
 same in the market achieving the best 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.460
 times in a circuit that yes when 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.039
 we seek its effectiveness at the level of 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.200
 fun one iota does not move or 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.760
 although we tend to you with the address going 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.750
 on rails 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.750
 this happens 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.700
 on board this subway it 's fair to say that 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.310
 there are faster and more powerful cars 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.770
 in the market but also that few 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.049
 conveys the fun of this 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.390
 supercar also its first 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.020
 weight argument is its colossal engine 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.020
 atmospheric 4 liters and 420 horses 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.750
 of power in configuration v8 the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.360
 sports division bmw motorsport has 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.670
 updated the chassis the first thing we 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.940
 we find the traditional traction 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.819
 Rear with a self-locking differential 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.819
 electronic variable plus the address 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.170
 servotronic is extremely effective and for 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.640
 last bmw has coupled to this m3 a 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.060
 double sequential gearbox 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.600
 seven- link box clutch with 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.700
 all this the bmw has attributes more than 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.390
 of leftovers to behave brilliantly 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.160
 the circuit even comparing with 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.110
 supercars superior to him as is 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.260
 the case of gdf 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.260
 and not 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.730
 in front of the m3 the gtr is obviously 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.550
 in a step above by power 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.370
 by dynamic and tensile effectiveness 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.860
 yes, if you're looking for fun and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.220
 make hands at the wheel maybe this is not 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.220
 be your car 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.780
 we get going with the m3 and it's 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.760
 true that at quiet speeds is 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.180
 a relatively easy car to drive 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.950
 and also quite comfortable but then the 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.800
 circuit we see that it is very 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.500
 fun its ability to accelerate and 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.630
 recovery is quite linear 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.570
 this way the engine regime 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.170
 usable is very broad thanks to its 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:43.330
 400 newtons maximum torque meter 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.330
 accelerating from 0 to 100 in 4.8 seconds 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.340
 9 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.200
 for 99 thousand euros the gt-r can be yours 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.510
 offering a relationship power price 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.790
 unparalleled in the market while 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.610
 to get an m3 the disbursement is 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.130
 of 78 thousand euros although to little that we are 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.870
 generous with the optional equipment 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.780
 as for example these spectacular 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.940
 19-inch wheels the matter is us 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.530
 can shoot beyond 90 thousand 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.750
 euros if you want to know all the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.610
 secrets of these models do not forget 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.420
 to get into auto city and there I'll tell you 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.420
 we reveal everything 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.090
