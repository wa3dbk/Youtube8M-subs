00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.070
 every time it's a surprise I love 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.100
 so here we are going to discover together 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.990
 this new package is leaving then I 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.580
 will show you the pretty record just at 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.240
 the end of this video is here we go 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.210
 to start 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.070
 so this tasting with the cakes 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.509
 good mom is called the 4 hours so 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.290
 it's very good name is for the 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.000
 tasting the kids loved ice and 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.370
 a little cookie is actually you have 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.920
 a caramel heart and above you have 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.360
 a little milk chocolate topping so 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.890
 I do not tell you the killing 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.720
 apparently there is also the version 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.210
 milk chocolate because the season 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.090
 chocolate and caramel and it's really 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.770
 very very good then continue with 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.480
 an English mark then this one and I 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.640
 know them very well it's great 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.070
 good these are vegetable numbers so 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.899
 on oka roth with turnips and parsnips 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.089
 parsnips look like carrots 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.860
 except that these whites and it's a small 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.969
 sweet taste me i like i like 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.719
 a lot my it's particular like 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.100
 you but I like a lot 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.390
 so here it is that you do figures 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.740
 of all colors I love it 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.890
 after we love or we do not like but me 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.140
 I liked it so then the small 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.330
 salty treats that I loved months 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.650
 in the parcel these are the tuques then 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.720
 it's a huge package one morning from 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.369
 easter and family is in fact 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.140
 you have plenty of little bag 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.450
 cool so that's it's great 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.040
 handy takeaway to nibble when 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.210
 you have a little hollow and actually 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.060
 this is three grain is wheat at 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.470
 rice and barley and it's crisp 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 and what's funny is that when we 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.830
 crunches at the beginning there is a little bit 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.590
 of sugar and after that disappears and that 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.090
 gives way to theaters and it's very good 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.350
 so there a very very beautiful discovery 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.820
 that I can not wait to try in 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.830
 the salads the jelly just taste like 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.119
 that quickly it's super good actually 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.310
 it's a vinegar but it's a lot 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.220
 no more vinegar and it's flavored 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.500
 Basil Lemon Honey that is 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.090
 the infusion of plants is really 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.950
 delicious I can not wait to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.350
 try it in a salad for you in 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.909
 talk a little bit more then then 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.689
 we have a drink called grazing 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.299
 detox aromas lemon 0 sugar with tea 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.970
 green lemon essential oil 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.959
 very very few calories 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.880
 apparently it looks like a 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.810
 drink anyway that gives you no 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.819
 bad of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.489
 how to say physical resistance on 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.050
 will say but finally I did not like 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.360
 it's sparkling and I did not like it at all 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.550
 the lemon taste that was really 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.569
 very present this for me not without more 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.130
 go on we will continue with a small 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.530
 drink I know very well these are 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.180
 the coco vita so there we have the one at the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.590
 coconut 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.290
 I have already done a test I will put you 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.420
 a little link to see this video 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.849
 and then we invite to coke with aromas 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.500
 lemon then this one I do not know him 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.000
 I'm really happy to be able to 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.730
 test so I have not tested yet 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.470
 you will talk about it in comment and ben 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.090
 that's very cool so 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.470
 add ice cubes place them in the fridge 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.000
 you can even make smoothies 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.769
 you and towards judges you can do 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.319
 full of recipes with that so here's a 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.970
 nice little surprise 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.549
 then we have the veloutÃ© of tomatoes 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.580
 and miss kitchen so that comes from london 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.760
 then this one it is organic it is without 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.319
 gluten is suitable for vegetarians and 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.510
 done you can either use it in 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.590
 so velvety to drink as you 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.349
 simply warm it up in a 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.480
 pan or so you can include it 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.730
 in your sauces with chicken beef 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.320
 or in lasagna and honestly I 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.019
 think it's more suitable to have it 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.400
 tried last night I found that it was 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.690
 too sweet I did not like and my 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.730
 children do not deny loved either 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.290
 yet we love the tomato soup 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.760
 lemoult and tomatoes which I think 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.620
 it's much better to include it in 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.840
 a sauce rather than eating it such 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.730
 what then after a nice surprise 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.350
 so that's my great girlfriend I love 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.910
 this mustard found in the states 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.139
 united is too good in the 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.780
 burgers in hot dogs 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.310
 it's super good I already made you a 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.200
 test on it I'll tell you the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.910
 link I had tested honey room knows if 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.299
 it's the classic version and just as 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.100
 good we continue with a sauce from 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.959
 panzani so it's basil pesto 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.540
 with parmesan cheese 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.639
 very fragrant pine very very fragrant 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.750
 really famous then when you do not have 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.430
 no time I prefer to do it 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.410
 homemade pesto but honestly when we 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.030
 did not cook so much it's in pot 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.420
 it's like the same system as the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.209
 ketchup 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.889
 we put everywhere it's too good you 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.570
 can make cakes muffins funds 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.370
 table of pizzas you put in the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.800
 paws in the rice even in the rooms 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.110
 why not so that's it fits and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.659
 it's very very good so we will conclude 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.249
 this tasted with this May 2 with a pack 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.569
 of beers 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:34.179
 I understand why the package was 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.549
 super heavy now so here it's 

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:37.659
 bavaria is then this one was going 

00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:39.129
 original because it is alcohol-free 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.489
 it's a white beer 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:44.469
 so I'm not very alcoholic and 

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:46.299
 even less beer 100 and and cider 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.499
 I would have been really happy but then the 

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:49.599
 beer no it's not possible 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:51.399
 the limit flavored beers 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.229
 exotic fruits with strawberry all that stuff 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:54.549
 pass but hey it's not my cup of tea 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.049
 so I showed you the same 

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:58.329
 video what did it give one she was 

00:04:56.049 --> 00:05:00.849
 very cool a superb yesterday who 

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:02.589
 foam enormously so here's by 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.759
 against one finds a little less 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:06.009
 the taste of beer compared to that 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.209
 who alcoholic I find but here I am 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.369
 can not tell you more because 

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:10.989
 it's really not my thing 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:13.509

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:16.539
