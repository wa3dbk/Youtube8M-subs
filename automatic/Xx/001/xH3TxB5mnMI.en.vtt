the little there's a little gear some

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.280 
the little there's a little gear some
way<00:02:26.940> right<00:02:27.120> here<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.569> once<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.959> popped<00:02:28.170> out

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
way right here and once it popped out

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.240 
way right here and once it popped out
the<00:02:28.470> hinge<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:30.510> what<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.020> did<00:02:31.200> was<00:02:31.440> that

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
the hinge then what it did was that

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.130 
the hinge then what it did was that
actually<00:02:32.640> looks<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:32.970> mine's<00:02:33.270> not<00:02:33.510> broken

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
actually looks like mine's not broken

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.059 
actually looks like mine's not broken
looks<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> hinge<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:36.110> came<00:02:37.110> up<00:02:37.350> but<00:02:38.010> I

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
looks like the hinge just came up but I

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.410 
looks like the hinge just came up but I
already<00:02:38.400> ordered<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.790> new<00:02:38.910> one<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.209> we're<00:02:39.330> going

this<00:02:41.400> done<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.850> know<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.870> new<00:02:43.020> door<00:02:43.260> handle

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
this done I know so the new door handle

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.559 
this done I know so the new door handle
it's<00:02:43.770> got<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> flat<00:02:44.160> pin<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.819> top<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.330> it's

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
it's got a flat pin on the top and it's

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.690 
it's got a flat pin on the top and it's
been<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.110> type<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.319> rivet<00:02:46.800> type<00:02:47.040> setup<00:02:47.370> on

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
been it's a type of rivet type setup on

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.250 
been it's a type of rivet type setup on
there<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.480> doesn't<00:02:48.780> look<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.230> can

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
there so it doesn't look like it can

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.990 
there so it doesn't look like it can
slide<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:49.950> like<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.310> other<00:02:50.400> one<00:02:50.580> but<00:02:50.940> it

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
slide for like the other one but it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.610 
slide for like the other one but it
looks<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.330> pretty<00:02:51.540> good<00:02:51.630> construction<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
looks like a pretty good construction I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.850 
looks like a pretty good construction I
mean<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.160> gear<00:02:53.370> drives<00:02:54.120> air<00:02:54.620> here<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:55.739> the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
mean the gear drives air here was the

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.040 
mean the gear drives air here was the
old<00:02:56.010> one<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.640> we're<00:02:56.940> gonna<00:02:57.060> good<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.450> we're

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
old one so we're gonna good and we're

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.810 
old one so we're gonna good and we're
going<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> reinstall<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.010> same<00:02:59.250> exact<00:02:59.640> way

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
going to reinstall it the same exact way

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.100

first<00:03:00.209> thing<00:03:00.330> I'm<00:03:00.390> going<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.570> do<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.780> pull<00:03:00.989> this

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
first thing I'm going to do is pull this

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.650 
first thing I'm going to do is pull this
down<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:02.220> more<00:03:02.670> likely<00:03:02.970> which<00:03:03.420> mine<00:03:03.720> did<00:03:04.080> your

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
down and more likely which mine did your

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.540 
down and more likely which mine did your
never<00:03:06.660> drop<00:03:07.380> down<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.920> we're<00:03:08.040> going<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.400> it

outside door handles when they go bad

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.620 
outside door handles when they go bad
usually<00:05:25.340> they'll<00:05:25.490> rust<00:05:25.790> out<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.390> very

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
usually they'll rust out and the very

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.930 
usually they'll rust out and the very
ears<00:05:27.020> that<00:05:27.230> hold<00:05:27.470> them<00:05:27.680> on<00:05:27.950> they'll<00:05:28.460> just<00:05:28.700> pull

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
ears that hold them on they'll just pull

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.700 
ears that hold them on they'll just pull
right<00:05:28.970> through<00:05:29.480> and<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.930> makes<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.350> either

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
right through and it makes it either

right through and it makes it either
they'll<00:05:31.010> break<00:05:31.190> on<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.490> side<00:05:31.670> that<00:05:31.700> you<00:05:31.940> can't

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
they'll break on the side that you can't

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.340 
they'll break on the side that you can't
pull<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.480> through<00:05:32.690> they'll<00:05:32.960> break<00:05:33.080> on<00:05:33.290> the

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
pull it through they'll break on the

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.780 
pull it through they'll break on the
other<00:05:33.410> side<00:05:33.710> so<00:05:33.920> they're<00:05:34.040> sitting<00:05:34.250> up<00:05:34.460> at<00:05:34.640> an

other side so they're sitting up at an
angle<00:05:34.940> so<00:05:35.690> regardless<00:05:36.650> that's<00:05:37.100> the<00:05:37.250> next<00:05:37.490> one

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580
