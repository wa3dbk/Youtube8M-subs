00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 I would have liked this presentation 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.370
 it could have been done with the betis already 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.730
 without gambling anything we have been 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.949
 postponing 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:17.470
 so as not to mix themes in which no no 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:20.410
 I agreed but well I'm sure 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.619
 that on Sunday things will come out 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.349
 frankly good and good in the plane 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.080
 personal then another different facet each 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.339
 one in his free time as he occupies 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.800
 different ways I have already explained 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.620
 many times that I am passionate about 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.960
 reading and writing and well it is 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.850
 wonderful for me to have had 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.620
 good acceptance in the first and so 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.710
 so much so that I can continue publishing 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.140
 books there are always ten minutes to 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.660
 to try to relax the head because 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.210
 he also thinks that my job is to take 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.519
 of decisions and when the head is in 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.829
 voted generally those decisions are 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.140
 wrong so the sat takes 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.079
 decisions and the shots never better said 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.870
 with the calm of being relaxed is more 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.120
 simple and that gives me the 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.950
 this passion that is a hobby and call it 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.950
 as you want and what makes me stay 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.990
 quiet is no no no no reason to be 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.000
 read the first one to have to 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.790
 read the second yes that is a small 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.100
 continuation but no there is no 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.720
 problem for not having read the first 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.800
 and understand perfectly the second one is 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.170
 the plot seemed of mystery with 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.460
 different places another of my passions 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.460
 is to travel and therefore 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.520
 I talk about places that I know well and well 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.530
 what I try is that people when 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.740
 speak open a book then be entertained and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.030
 he gets away from his daily problems is very 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.710
 difficult to park your profession because 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.230
 When you write you write with your heart 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.030
 and therefore in the end you leave something of yourself 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.200
 same and as it is a book that I want 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.780
 take it to the maximum reality in the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.550
 moment I was writing is the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.100
 moment when we play the derby 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.920
 last year and as a part of the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.340
 book occurs in Seville, yes there is 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.869
 mentions to that derbi to betis to things 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.330
 of the betis of course if the betis 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.190
 is a very important entity within 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.650
 sevilla within andalusia within 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.070
 Spain and therefore it is mandatory 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.220
 name it when a plot of any 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.900
 book is running in the city I have 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.910
 clear what is my profession I have clear 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.370
 what is it that gives me food I have clear 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.830
 What does 90 have to occupy me? 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.990
 percent of my time and where I have 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.030
 that having the five senses is in the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.950
 daily work with the club is in the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.500
 daily work that is taking us 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.989
 to that for three years the betis to a 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.420
 tremendous change towards better towards good 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.640
 if God wants that illusion with which the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.890
 that we all started in 2010 you can 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.349
 see come true this Sunday that is 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.220
 wear this shield and this shirt by 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.650
 out of Spain and therefore as you 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.360
 I said that's what all the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.010
 attention of this coach because 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.390
 because to war what I am is 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.120
 soccer coach the other I'm a 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.890
 humble tells stories nothing more you 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.870
 together with the football players carry behind 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.000
 from you the passion and feelings of 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.860
 many people that I'm sure had been 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.170
 disappointed as all of us by 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.750
 especially for the first time of 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.360
 team not something incomprehensible and that the 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.860
 players and I have already talked and so 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.760
 so much when one is a coach and is in 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.390
 the band what you have a bit 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.489
 impotence to see that few things 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.970
 Can you change when the ball is already 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.130
 wheel not then well then I'm 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.420
 sure that this Sunday is going 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.190
 to get it right I'm sure this 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.990
 Sunday with our people we are going to 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.790
 get the goal 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.620
 and that people stay with that 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.270
 bÃ©tico stay with that that throw a little 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.880
 look back and think where we were 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.470
 two years ago all we suffered for 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.810
 get a promotion everything we had 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.060
 to live to get here and if at 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.090
 final if god wants this Sunday it ends 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.040
 everything well I think it's a merit of all 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.840
 of a whole club of you from 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.970
 amateur of course he's always 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.640
 there and of all those who work day to 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.170
 day in this club that you 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.270
 you know how hard it is to get things out 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.100
 forward, obviously, I'm still agreeing 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.830
 I got support from my family because it's 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.709
 essential for you to isolate it from 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.049
 everything and then then to people how like 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.780
 Isabel thought it helped me at the time 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.270
 to be able to document me about the file 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.210
 Indian people like lion lasa that has 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.190
 facilitated the knowledge of a country and 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.950
 wonderful how is Ireland that gives and does not 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.440
 knows waves and that's why then 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.689
 people a lot of people that are there and that 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.409
 help 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.779
 I have good friends who know well the 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.610
 Sevillian society and therefore I have 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:48.239
 given advice at the time because I told you 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.539
 that this novel many many of his 

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:53.009
 frames does not occur in Seville and so 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.709
 so much sevilla is the protagonist and for 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.439
 therefore you can not fail in things that 

00:04:55.709 --> 00:05:00.929
 They are real I think everyone because 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.369
 in your work if you who are in front of 

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:04.139
 a microphone or surely with the step 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:05.179
 of time you get bonded you feel more 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.949
 safe 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:10.619
 think you progress and you think the 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.829
 mistakes that you make, you polish that 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:15.899
 is to have an office, that's not the job of 

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:19.409
 footballer the job of coach the 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:21.569
 journalism job as writing 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.459
 it is equal the passion is the same 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.699
 delivery is the same and obviously when 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:28.679
 you are giving birth to children who are books 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.119
 surely you are polishing those errors 

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:32.119
 that you can have in the previous ones
