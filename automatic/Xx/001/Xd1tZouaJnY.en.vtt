00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 friend definitely the enemy capiroto 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.379
 bad thing is trying to sabotage the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.059
 joy my story began when 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 I was on the couch messing around on my cell phone. 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.130
 that strikes my trust in the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.650
 facebook of good not at peace and suddenly 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.050
 Not even my wife, my girl, my angel. 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.320
 The woman that God gave me and starts with a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.869
 growing role 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910
 I found this boy here talking about 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.250
 how long we tweaked skin 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.289
 National and we do not harnesses the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.510
 things in life we do not do 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.239
 attention and farm on our side the people 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.520
 limits our experience of life I 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.960
 still on my final page I went to check 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.379
 the video or the video was more or less like this 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.480
 from book is on the table the snow of the mouth 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.430
 or tribe to have a good taste of walking a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.149
 little can assertive his 81 signed 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.219
 and after having good football the mast 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.219
 in the last year it goes on 7 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.880
 knowing my wife I already knew 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.530
 that the video did not matter what 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.750
 matter at that time was the video 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.630
 that there was only one indirect she wanted 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.610
 send me a message via video 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 is the message arrived at my love that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.460
 You mean by that you mean 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.990
 I 'm spending a lot of time on my cell phone. 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.790
 that I'm limiting your 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770
 experience of life because I am 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.040
 using the phone replied facebook is 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.530
 That's right, maybe that's right. 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.140
 What the customer wants to say is that if you 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.000
 I really want to see you can 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.729
 simply do not lend to those who have won 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.729
 in life is happening mentioned 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.510
 why the hell she does not speak as soon as she 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.850
 Why are not you coming soon? 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.410
 Speak, my love, I'm dissatisfied. 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.340
 was that you use less in your 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.320
 cell phone 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.210
 Are you giving me less attention than 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.220
 I think I deserve it because it does not 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.440
 this instead she wants to decipher the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.000
 code of things feeling are 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.050
 passing in her heart I came to the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.810
 conclusion that the best was this same 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.910
 She does not say what they want for 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.970
 example if a guy who has bread he goes 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.980
 to get the person to do I want to eat bread 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.140
 In order to eat bread now if a woman 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.110
 that's good she's not going to be direct her 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.290
 will speak a mass falls well track is so 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.220
 Tasty with difficulty speaking of his 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.900
 love 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.270
 if you want something you talk 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.890
 to me it 's exactly what you want 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.320
 soon you want even a bargain you 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.930
 The glass speaks so hard to speak now. 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.160

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.350

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.670
 It was a mall and we arrived at the 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.709

 You're ignoring the world around you. 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.750
 pay attention to the people who are the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.610
 around you 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.830

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.600
 Life looks my love, there's that couple. 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.480

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.310
 Come on, I met, home, look, they do not. 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.950
 they are able to take advantage of the company 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.620
 one another we can maybe 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.819

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.439
 Of course it would never be sarcastic 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.810
 that I can not stand we want to give 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.849

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.609
