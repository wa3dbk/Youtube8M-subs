00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.379
 Kamenka Dnieper district Zaporizhia 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.870
 areas 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.930
 historically is a mecca growing 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.140
 early vegetable knowledge and experience here 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.759
 handed down from generation to generation 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.259
 today we came to this area but 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.660
 invitation of the director of the greenhouse 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.239
 Housekeeping Viktor Vasilyevich Kryvonosa 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.969
 who cultivates vegetable crops on 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.430
 over 12 years thanks to its 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.040
 knowledge and modern approach to keeping 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.360
 farmer farms this season received 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.140
 high yield of tomatoes I get 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.400
 covered 40 acres 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.290
 we work partly we are already on 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.920
 We have been growing for 12 years 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:57.239
 tall varieties of tomato originally we 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.140
 grown varieties like bailey then 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.930
 switched to a pink griffin too 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.420
 promising tomato he 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.310
 Transportable Moscow takes it well 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:15.020
 Now here's this pa we â€™re making those 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:18.420
 mojito sleep is very giving then our raft 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.060
 uniform all such with his nose 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.549
 very well take on our market Ukraine 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.679
 and Russia Viktor Valerievich 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.990
 tries to use the most effective 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.770
 fertilizer also farmer applies 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.780
 biological products 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.149
 that help plants start 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.639
 fruiting before the ripening fruit 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.369
 evenly according to Victor Krivonos 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:40.889
 results of the use of Baikal m and growth 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.340
 concentrate don't keep everything waiting 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.979
 bushes 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.990
 healthy fruits become more of them 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.410
 good commodity 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.650
 earlier about five years ago I was sitting on such 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:59.170
 there fertilizers that is nitrates everything is there 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.930
 liter of the ring there is no expensive fertilizer here 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.770
 literally the third year I switched to 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.860
 humates 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.600
 that is, roses are baikal concentrate, that is, we 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.709
 we bring organic matter to earth 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.709
 this manure then after planting immediately 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.030
 in a week we make concentrate three times 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.780
 Five of Baikal 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.400
 they start land from it to raise 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.350
 amino acids and humates begin to develop 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.900
 root system i.e. tomato 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.660
 adapts quickly accepted plant 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.230
 vegetates well that is the point 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.010
 growth 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.290
 good blooms behind them sticking in 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.920
 extreme situation when hot heat 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.989
 cooling there is a change soil 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.200
 for seedlings also choose careful 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.489
 it is the soil of which seeds are sprout 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.640
 depends on how strong and 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.830
 resistant plants will be with quality and 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.340
 soil structure related factors 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.370
 how frequency and profundity polina 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.560
 apply generous land 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.700
 soak its growth with concentrate 20 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.030
 cubes per 10 liters of water similarity can be 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.140
 say 99 percent ie development 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.720
 root process in autumn is very large 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.299
 that is, immediately see the difference just where 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.250
 seedlings in another peat go generously land 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.170
 generously land on a stronger and 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.100
 disease resistant 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.840
 Here is this variety planted Mojito with 12 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.440
 april axis seed was planted 28 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.940
 January 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:38.079
 it is in the cassette and planted in the ground already 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:41.079
 April 12 today June 13 is already on and there 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.170
 Tomato was removed the first brush that is 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.000
 already have the first harvest the farmer has created 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.000
 its efficient power system 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.220
 Tomato plants are treated once a week. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.620
 by leaf and twice a week at the root 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.319
 through drip irrigation tubes 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.200
 baikal um helps strengthen the immunity from 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.930
 phytophthora their diseases arus concentrate 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.870
 stimulates the development of plants in order 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.470
 so that the earth snatches a cucumber more 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.569
 grab steel he cleans the ground 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.170
 Tomato, he initially does not need feces 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.690
 cucumber is a crop rotation plus tomatoes then 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.470
 eat tomatoes after crop rotation 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.860
 look like this way that is, if not 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.280
 zhir tomatoes are pouring that's all to him 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.160
 just enough, we process the tomatoes have 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.660
 us get a hand sprayer 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.860
 motor fill there 15 liters 10 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:42.190
 liters of water we are 30 grams concentrate growth 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.449
 We go and pour leaves abundantly I 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.010
 try on a sheet once a week and in 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.210
 a droplet twice a week 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:57.330
 mind and uniform growth of three fives with 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:01.479
 baikal then I give a push pour I give 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.780
 15 77 concentrate growth at the moment and 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:08.490
 I switched to viburnum I need that fruit 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.110
 ripened potassium gives rise to ripening 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.840
 use of organic mineral fertilizer 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.330
 rus concentrate and biological product baikal em 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.039
 dodging plant immunity give 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.410
 integrated effect for sustainable 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.330
 development and ripening of vegetable crops and 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.880
 according to Victor Krivonos 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.919
 use of environmentally friendly 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.650
 preparations allow his au pair 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.930
 getting an earlier healthy crop 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.010
 who eagerly buy in country markets 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.010
 and near abroad
