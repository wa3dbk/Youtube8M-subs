00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
game I was just it's just more velocity

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.830 
game I was just it's just more velocity
actually<00:01:50.820> looks<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> lot<00:01:51.060> nicer<00:01:51.119> objective

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
actually looks a lot nicer objective

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
actually looks a lot nicer objective
basis<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.320> about<00:01:52.470> kills<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> stuff<00:01:53.070> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
basis more about kills and stuff so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.100 
basis more about kills and stuff so
often<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> players<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.329> Jared<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.869> always

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
often the players like Jared are always

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.700 
often the players like Jared are always
much<00:01:55.770> much<00:01:56.040> more<00:01:56.250> useful<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:57.560> it's<00:01:58.560> just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
much much more useful but it's just

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.959 
much much more useful but it's just
quite<00:01:58.860> an<00:01:58.979> anyone<00:01:59.310> could<00:01:59.399> shoot<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> gun<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.820> cod

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
quite an anyone could shoot a gun in cod

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.399 
quite an anyone could shoot a gun in cod
to<00:02:00.630> bring<00:02:00.750> us<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> little<00:02:00.990> better<00:02:01.170> step<00:02:01.380> back

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to bring us a little better step back

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
to bring us a little better step back
though<00:02:01.680> less<00:02:01.890> features<00:02:02.070> less<00:02:02.490> variables<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
though less features less variables of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.310 
though less features less variables of
the<00:02:03.119> game<00:02:03.329> connected<00:02:03.750> thicken<00:02:03.960> dictate<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the game connected thicken dictate the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.870

outcome<00:02:04.350> yeah<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> hundred<00:02:05.100> percent<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.610> hard

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
outcome yeah a hundred percent like hard

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.370 
outcome yeah a hundred percent like hard
point<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> massive<00:02:06.719> change<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
point was a massive change for the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.719 
point was a massive change for the
collegiate<00:02:07.770> community<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.580> like

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
collegiate community and I think it like

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.809 
collegiate community and I think it like
did<00:02:09.080> make<00:02:10.080> God<00:02:10.319> helping<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.860> today

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
did make God helping it was today

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.130 
did make God helping it was today
but<00:02:11.969> I<00:02:11.999> don't<00:02:12.569> know<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.689> don't<00:02:12.870> know<00:02:12.959> how<00:02:13.079> the

but I don't know I don't know how the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.539 
but I don't know I don't know how the
