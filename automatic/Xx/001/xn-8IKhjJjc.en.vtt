00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello my name and bruno coulanges followed if it's to see the demonstration of 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.399
 guitars eq is that he is a craftsman marc pelletier 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:15.139
 dams in grass 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.210
 go with it successfully 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 without the guitars chanting tchamba is before the lesson bÃ©dard went to 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.429
 to improve the quality of its swordfish tuna 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.139
 but how we must help in this sense this environment so still skeleton 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.289
 in places it rises to 1 3 a maple for the assistant of the sleeve or 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.260
 again 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.020
 medarex excel are made of usually two kinds of wood 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.840
 an exit to the rectorate and another lot to de sutter and the underside of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.900
 the guitar 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.630
 the carrer not done 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.620
 2 saadane or fine bissy 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.630
 which is a parcel by british columbia 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.700
 The top is the most perfect mahogany 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.710
 the sleeve and dial and maple 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.650
 with a touch 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.840
 in dylan rosewood of race 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.940
 in terms of the electronics on it 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.230
 it's about to scoop seven track these words in which m 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.220
 a volume 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.400
 at the same time regular 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.520
 the ben ali system while we found on the old 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.800
 few weeks it's weighing him it's the bibi king 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.570
 the system will expand 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.220
 is a system by the baron that lets certain frequencies pass according to his 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.790
 position 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.790
 for example 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.490
 for 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.050
 Berlin 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.040
 so here is the final result 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.650
 the people's tastes doran-ford 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.740
 to fix the sleeve 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.460
 and we also see that with the condition with sexual there is no plastic the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.880
 last to behead of electronics alan brand pringles 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.559
 as for the trouble of selecting it this bros cut it 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:13.099
 to put it aside and then delage went to the guitar to give his 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.099
 sober elegant note 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.709
 so me what I knew about excess salt guitars this is the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.929
 lightness obviously the duo corp say 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:41.919
 this one especially by the spectrum five dead one voice 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.560
 with this guitar in conjunction with nine inhabitants we are waiting we elect to 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.289
 to make this church of peace 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.649
 it allows me to go for the hand 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:53.869
 December for 100 th 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:58.239
 force is to note that only pierced three points 5 already 1 to 0 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.669
 gsk reached the castes 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.669
 example 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.029
 it 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.499
 I asked Marc on this particular model 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:56.540
 that the middle percent position is exactly like a firecracker in boxing so 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:59.709
 that peeled there occupies mauritius faure 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.709
 Which give 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.449
 mm
