00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.390
 good to add a color first thing 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.980
 what you have to have is a cable that has 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.770
 these two points a little tip and a 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.040
 big tip we can assemble the chalice as 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:16.840
 I did that I put it together to join the two points 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.360
 and the two tips 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.600
 how can we buy a cable that has 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.090
 two tips like this one and then 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.070
 buy an adapter this great 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.060
 then we connect the tip that we 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.010
 is free to the computer and the tip 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.750
 with the adapter we connect it to 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.230
 instrument and we can do the same to 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.949
 reverse two points as well and an adapter to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.949
 chinese pin 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.829
 well once we have the cable 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 we have to plug it in the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.290
 back in our office at the entrance 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 Blue Microphone the red green 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.850
 for headphones or speakers and the blue 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.720
 is the line entry that is where 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 we have to plug in the cable that 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.119
 put together we buy or whatever 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.770
 we have done once we connect the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.630
 mayor to the office we have to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 download these two files that will 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.729
 I leave the link in the description this is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.130
 the program with which we are going to record and 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.250
 this is the installer of lazio which is the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.940
 audio driver that will allow us 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.649
 record once we have it downloaded 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:32.280
 we open it we put next I accept 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:37.290
 next next install 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.130
 finish and ready let's save that we 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.150
 he left the internet we opened the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.150
 unzip this shit 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.780
 I hope you unpack 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.800
 once it is compressed we close this 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.810
 we hope that a poster appears 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.170
 now that he will continue unpacking 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.170
 something 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.910
 well that I advance the video in this 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.910
 part 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.580
 good when he offers this poster 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.910
 we come to next I accept next 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.910
 next next next here this has to be 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.550
 blank do not have to be 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.920
 selected let's say next next and 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.160
 we hope you install this takes a 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.050
 so, so for the recording and the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.050
 new row has not finished 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.189
 when it's over, we finish 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.950
 and we close this inner one that opens 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.240
 and we're going to see that on the desk 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:09.730
 we have 3 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:13.950
 icons this is once we already have the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.950
 lazio and the inter and we open followed king 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.860
 and we have to configure them we put it 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.780
 round we are going to fire audio settings 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.660
 the channel has to be put on 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.460
 in action and here has to be put in 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.470
 acid to b2 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.450
 if it is well configured these we put 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.340
 ok and it should be sounding our 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.440
 instrument to record we have to 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.840
 squeeze this has is in red and 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.180
 put full we get hold of it we must 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.680
 click here if we want to listen 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.630
 we press close and select that 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.020
 save press here we configure 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.020
 the 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.190
 the audio input if we put a lot goes 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.230
 to saturate the sound and here the outputs 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.460
 also if we put much more structure 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.360
 of the audio and these are all 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.660
 amplification in the distortions that 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.530
 have 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:16.130
 we selected the program and already 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.940
 we have to configure the good ones and that 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.940
 that's it
