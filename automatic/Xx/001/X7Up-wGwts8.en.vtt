this installment of on ice we're talking
ice<00:00:22.050> safety<00:00:22.290> I<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:23.189> not<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.669> most<00:00:23.790> exciting

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
ice safety I know not the most exciting

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.480 
ice safety I know not the most exciting
topic<00:00:24.450> out<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.650> given<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> warm

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
topic out there but given the warm

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
topic out there but given the warm
weather<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.599> ice<00:00:27.750> fishing<00:00:28.079> season<00:00:28.259> I<00:00:28.529> think

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
weather this ice fishing season I think

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.650 
weather this ice fishing season I think
is<00:00:28.829> rather<00:00:28.980> appropriate<00:00:29.669> and<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.509> say

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
is rather appropriate and I can say

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.510 
is rather appropriate and I can say
without<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.960> doubt<00:00:31.079> I<00:00:31.500> cannot<00:00:31.980> recall<00:00:32.160> an<00:00:32.430> ice

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
without a doubt I cannot recall an ice

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.430 
without a doubt I cannot recall an ice
fishing<00:00:32.880> season<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.540> poorly<00:00:33.960> matched<00:00:34.140> up

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
fishing season that so poorly matched up

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.170 
fishing season that so poorly matched up
with<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> calendar<00:00:35.250> by<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> mean<00:00:35.910> hates

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
with the calendar by that I mean hates

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.720 
with the calendar by that I mean hates
it's<00:00:36.600> middle<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.200> January<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:38.430> should<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.670> able

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it's middle of January we should be able

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.729 
it's middle of January we should be able
to<00:00:38.880> drive<00:00:39.059> trucks<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.630> here<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> fact

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
to drive trucks out here when in fact

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.040 
to drive trucks out here when in fact
we're<00:00:41.340> still<00:00:41.640> pulling<00:00:41.879> sleds<00:00:42.239> by<00:00:42.480> hand<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
we're still pulling sleds by hand of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110 
we're still pulling sleds by hand of
course<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> last<00:00:44.129> thing<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.489> want<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.790> do<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
course the last thing I want to do is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
course the last thing I want to do is
give<00:00:45.570> people<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.170> impression<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.739> ice

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
give people the impression that ice

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400 
give people the impression that ice
fishing<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.399> unsafe<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.179> my<00:00:48.329> opinion<00:00:48.870> nothing

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
fishing is unsafe in my opinion nothing

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.049 
fishing is unsafe in my opinion nothing
could<00:00:49.769> be<00:00:49.859> further<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> truth<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.850> fact

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
could be further from the truth in fact

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.180 
could be further from the truth in fact
I<00:00:51.179> would<00:00:51.359> say<00:00:51.600> ice<00:00:51.839> fishing<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.379> safer<00:00:52.769> than

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I would say ice fishing is safer than

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
I would say ice fishing is safer than
crossing<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> street<00:00:54.179> of<00:00:55.019> course<00:00:55.260> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
crossing the street of course you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.509 
crossing the street of course you
wouldn't<00:00:55.559> cross<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.010> street<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.370> your

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
wouldn't cross that street with your

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.029 
wouldn't cross that street with your
eyes<00:00:56.640> closed<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.179> that's<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.659> brings<00:00:57.960> me<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
eyes closed and that's what brings me to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.649 
eyes closed and that's what brings me to
my<00:00:59.159> first<00:00:59.399> piece<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.819> safety<00:00:59.999> equipment<00:01:00.179> this

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
my first piece of safety equipment this

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.029 
my first piece of safety equipment this
is<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.870> spud<00:01:01.199> from<00:01:01.409> frabill<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
is a spud from frabill it's a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.910 
is a spud from frabill it's a
collapsible<00:01:02.339> spud<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.179> it<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.470> what

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
collapsible spud and it really is what

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
collapsible spud and it really is what
keeps<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.460> eyes<00:01:05.670> open<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.240> there<00:01:06.659> when

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
keeps your eyes open out there when

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440 
keeps your eyes open out there when
you're<00:01:07.229> checking<00:01:07.710> ice<00:01:08.010> thicknesses<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.820> got<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
you're checking ice thicknesses I got to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.090 
you're checking ice thicknesses I got to
tell<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> I've<00:01:09.930> seen<00:01:10.229> far<00:01:10.530> too<00:01:10.590> many<00:01:10.860> ice

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
tell you I've seen far too many ice

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.610 
tell you I've seen far too many ice
fishermen<00:01:11.640> test<00:01:12.180> ice<00:01:12.420> thickness<00:01:12.780> by<00:01:13.229> jumping

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
fishermen test ice thickness by jumping

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.770 
fishermen test ice thickness by jumping
up<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.830> down<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.190> ice<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:15.120> it's<00:01:15.330> too<00:01:15.510> thin

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
up and down in the ice if it's too thin

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.990 
up and down in the ice if it's too thin
at<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.200> point<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.620> a<00:01:16.710> little<00:01:17.010> too<00:01:17.159> late<00:01:17.370> so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
at that point it's a little too late so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149 
at that point it's a little too late so
what<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.899> that<00:01:19.159> collapsible

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
what I have here is that collapsible

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.499 
what I have here is that collapsible
spud<00:01:20.430> there's<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.700> pin<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:20.969> here<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
spud there's a pin right here in the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
spud there's a pin right here in the
center<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.930> allows<00:01:22.110> me<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> take<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.740> spud

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
center that allows me to take that spud

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
center that allows me to take that spud
apart<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.780> about<00:01:24.990> this

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
apart but what I really like about this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
apart but what I really like about this
piece<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.799> gear<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.460> keeps<00:01:26.850> me<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.119> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
piece of gear is it keeps me out of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.980 
piece of gear is it keeps me out of
harm's<00:01:27.719> way

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
harm's way

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.469 
harm's way
before<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:29.130> into<00:01:29.369> trouble<00:01:29.759> when<00:01:30.329> I'm

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
before I get into trouble when I'm

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630 
before I get into trouble when I'm
walking<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.140> testing<00:01:31.530> ice<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:32.039> spud<00:01:32.399> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
walking or testing ice this spud is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
walking or testing ice this spud is
gonna<00:01:32.880> reveal<00:01:33.240> ice<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.780> too<00:01:34.079> thin<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
gonna reveal ice that's too thin to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.889 
gonna reveal ice that's too thin to
support<00:01:34.649> my<00:01:35.100> weight<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:36.210> walking<00:01:36.240> I'm

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
spudding out in front of me to make sure

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.230 
spudding out in front of me to make sure
that<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.899> have<00:01:40.140> ice<00:01:40.409> thickness<00:01:41.000> sufficient<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that I have ice thickness sufficient to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
that I have ice thickness sufficient to
support<00:01:42.570> my<00:01:42.750> weight<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.799> me<00:01:43.920> personally

people would consider this a piece of

people would consider this a piece of
safety<00:01:48.299> equipment<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:49.020> also<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.439> very<00:01:49.799> useful

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
safety equipment it's also a very useful
