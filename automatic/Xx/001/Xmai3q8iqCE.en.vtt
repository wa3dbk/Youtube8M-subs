transport is free for covenant so those
are<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.200> two<00:02:17.290> little<00:02:17.560> balancing<00:02:18.130> issues

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
are the two little balancing issues

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.050 
are the two little balancing issues
right<00:02:18.730> now<00:02:18.790> i<00:02:19.300> am<00:02:19.710> just<00:02:20.730> leveling<00:02:21.730> up<00:02:21.880> my

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
right now i am just leveling up my

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.000 
right now i am just leveling up my
leader<00:02:22.360> sort<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.930> thing<00:02:23.140> going<00:02:23.830> around

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
leader sort of thing going around

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.970 
leader sort of thing going around
killing<00:02:24.340> basis<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.450> can<00:02:25.600> get<00:02:25.780> stars<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.770> your

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
killing basis you can get stars on your

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.790 
killing basis you can get stars on your
units<00:02:27.340> which<00:02:27.670> makes<00:02:28.000> them<00:02:28.300> more<00:02:29.260> powerful

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
units which makes them more powerful

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.980 
units which makes them more powerful
each<00:02:29.920> time<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.340> get<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.490> star<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.300> if<00:02:31.630> i<00:02:31.780> get<00:02:31.960> a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
each time you get a star so if i get a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.350 
each time you get a star so if i get a
star<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.560> my<00:02:32.800> leader<00:02:33.010> from<00:02:33.460> killing<00:02:34.090> things

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
star on my leader from killing things

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.970 
star on my leader from killing things
then<00:02:35.290> he'll<00:02:35.620> be<00:02:35.800> more<00:02:35.980> stronger<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.930> he<00:02:37.930> he<00:02:38.860> is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
then he'll be more stronger and he he is

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.790 
then he'll be more stronger and he he is
a<00:02:39.010> main<00:02:39.370> part<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:40.060> covenant<00:02:40.800> strategy

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
a main part of a covenant strategy

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.030 
a main part of a covenant strategy
because<00:02:42.280> if<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.940> have<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> strong<00:02:43.360> leader<00:02:44.040> you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
because if you have a strong leader you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.890 
because if you have a strong leader you
can<00:02:45.190> take<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.520> lot<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.820> units<00:02:46.090> with<00:02:46.300> one<00:02:46.510> unit

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
can take it a lot of units with one unit

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.740 
can take it a lot of units with one unit
and<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.330> right<00:02:49.959> here<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.260> believe<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:51.190> am<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:52.510> I

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
and so right here I believe I am just I

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.340 
and so right here I believe I am just I
just<00:02:53.370> brought<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.670> brood<00:02:55.000> in<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:56.110> kill

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
just brought a little brood in to kill

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.470 
just brought a little brood in to kill
the<00:02:56.650> last<00:02:57.010> enemies<00:02:57.490> that<00:02:57.640> were<00:02:57.760> air<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.360> my

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the last enemies that were air and my

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.170 
the last enemies that were air and my
brute<00:02:58.780> can't<00:02:59.110> get<00:02:59.410> air<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.250> did<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:00.970> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
brute can't get air so I did that and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.660 
brute can't get air so I did that and
now<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.690> have<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.080> go<00:03:02.170> back<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.740> make<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.250> couple

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
now I have to go back and make a couple

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.380 
now I have to go back and make a couple
of<00:03:04.800> engineers<00:03:05.800> which<00:03:06.520> all<00:03:06.790> they<00:03:07.000> can<00:03:07.060> do<00:03:07.360> is

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
of engineers which all they can do is

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.260 
of engineers which all they can do is
heal<00:03:07.840> your<00:03:07.990> units<00:03:08.440> that's<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.520> downside<00:03:10.000> of

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
heal your units that's one downside of

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.900 
heal your units that's one downside of
the<00:03:10.360> Covenant<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.800> Covenant<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.370> not<00:03:12.580> get<00:03:12.880> a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
the Covenant the Covenant do not get a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.500 
the Covenant the Covenant do not get a
free<00:03:13.470> well<00:03:14.790> they<00:03:15.790> don't<00:03:15.910> get<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.120> heel<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.480> can

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
free well they don't get a heel you can

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.800 
free well they don't get a heel you can
use<00:03:16.720> any<00:03:16.900> time<00:03:17.110> you<00:03:17.260> have<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.470> build<00:03:17.590> engineers

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
use any time you have to build engineers

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.400 
use any time you have to build engineers
which<00:03:19.810> are<00:03:19.930> very<00:03:20.019> weak<00:03:20.320> but<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.640> can<00:03:22.380> get<00:03:23.380> a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
which are very weak but you can get a

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.620 
which are very weak but you can get a
lot<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.070> them<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.580> heal<00:03:24.730> up<00:03:24.910> your<00:03:25.060> leader<00:03:25.269> and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
lot of them and heal up your leader and

lot of them and heal up your leader and
everyone<00:03:25.780> pretty<00:03:26.650> fast<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.370> they're<00:03:27.519> pretty

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
everyone pretty fast and they're pretty

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.140 
everyone pretty fast and they're pretty
useful<00:03:28.209> after<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.870> while<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.190> lot<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.820> people

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
useful after a while so a lot of people

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.930 
useful after a while so a lot of people
do<00:03:31.300> this<00:03:31.540> with<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:33.040> chieftain<00:03:33.550> because<00:03:33.850> he

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
do this with the chieftain because he

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.160 
do this with the chieftain because he
can't<00:03:34.150> self<00:03:34.480> heal<00:03:34.890> or<00:03:35.890> even<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.700> arbiter<00:03:37.180> not

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
can't self heal or even the arbiter not

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.630 
can't self heal or even the arbiter not
so<00:03:38.350> much<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.590> prophet<00:03:38.980> because<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.250> prophet

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
so much the prophet because the prophet

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.960 
so much the prophet because the prophet
as<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.820> shield<00:03:40.269> before<00:03:40.630> which<00:03:41.260> recharges<00:03:42.190> so

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
as a shield before which recharges so

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.759 
as a shield before which recharges so
you<00:03:43.420> don't<00:03:43.600> really<00:03:43.810> need<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.200> heal<00:03:44.380> him<00:03:44.620> as

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
you don't really need to heal him as

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.000 
you don't really need to heal him as
much<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.660> basically<00:03:46.690> what<00:03:47.200> I'm<00:03:47.530> doing

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010

they<00:06:36.430> have<00:06:36.669> a<00:06:36.940> full<00:06:37.300> army<00:06:37.720> of<00:06:38.169> warthogs<00:06:39.039> and

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
they have a full army of warthogs and

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.659 
they have a full army of warthogs and
hornets<00:06:41.050> warthogs<00:06:41.620> are<00:06:41.979> good<00:06:42.400> against

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
hornets warthogs are good against

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.930 
hornets warthogs are good against
infantry<00:06:43.419> and<00:06:43.870> they're<00:06:44.169> good<00:06:44.320> against<00:06:44.680> air<00:06:44.940> so

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
infantry and they're good against air so

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.909 
infantry and they're good against air so
they're<00:06:46.419> really<00:06:46.810> really<00:06:47.050> bad<00:06:47.350> against<00:06:47.680> other

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
they're really really bad against other

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.480 
they're really really bad against other
vehicles<00:06:48.490> though<00:06:48.699> so<00:06:49.860> Cameron<00:06:50.860> can<00:06:51.039> continue

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
vehicles though so Cameron can continue

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.370 
vehicles though so Cameron can continue
to<00:06:51.610> make<00:06:51.729> cobras<00:06:52.180> at<00:06:52.389> Wolverine<00:06:52.870> which<00:06:53.259> is

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
to make cobras at Wolverine which is

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.550 
to make cobras at Wolverine which is
pretty<00:06:53.560> good<00:06:53.680> for<00:06:53.800> us<00:06:54.160> but<00:06:55.060> my<00:06:55.600> vampires<00:06:56.169> won't

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
pretty good for us but my vampires won't

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.689 
pretty good for us but my vampires won't
do<00:06:56.770> damage<00:06:57.639> to<00:06:57.669> those<00:06:58.030> warthogs<00:06:58.479> at<00:06:58.720> all<00:06:58.930> so

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
do damage to those warthogs at all so

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.999 
do damage to those warthogs at all so
well<00:07:00.699> it<00:07:00.849> will<00:07:01.030> but<00:07:01.330> not<00:07:01.509> much<00:07:01.780> I'm<00:07:02.650> pretty

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
well it will but not much I'm pretty

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.480 
well it will but not much I'm pretty
good<00:07:03.160> on<00:07:03.220> the<00:07:03.639> Hornets<00:07:04.150> side<00:07:04.360> so<00:07:04.900> I<00:07:05.259> think<00:07:05.740> I

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
good on the Hornets side so I think I

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.950 
good on the Hornets side so I think I
started<00:07:07.120> to<00:07:07.240> build<00:07:08.220> a<00:07:09.220> couple<00:07:10.150> banshees<00:07:10.720> with

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
started to build a couple banshees with

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.719 
started to build a couple banshees with
it<00:07:11.169> just<00:07:13.349> for<00:07:14.349> the<00:07:14.440> fact<00:07:14.590> in<00:07:14.830> case<00:07:15.070> he'd<00:07:15.340> builds

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:15.729 
it just for the fact in case he'd builds

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.240 
it just for the fact in case he'd builds
any<00:07:15.910> tanks<00:07:16.479> his<00:07:17.199> panties<00:07:17.680> are<00:07:17.860> good<00:07:18.009> against

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250 
any tanks his panties are good against

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.100 
any tanks his panties are good against
tanks<00:07:18.550> but<00:07:19.000> they're<00:07:19.180> not<00:07:19.330> good<00:07:19.570> against<00:07:19.810> war

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
tanks but they're not good against war

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.129 
tanks but they're not good against war
hogs<00:07:20.349> and<00:07:20.770> this<00:07:21.580> game<00:07:21.820> is<00:07:22.060> sort<00:07:22.270> of<00:07:22.360> a<00:07:22.599> big

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:23.139 
hogs and this game is sort of a big

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.740 
hogs and this game is sort of a big
counter<00:07:23.919> game<00:07:24.130> as<00:07:24.849> you<00:07:25.060> see<00:07:25.240> it<00:07:25.389> will<00:07:25.570> have<00:07:25.720> a

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:25.750 
counter game as you see it will have a

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.629 
counter game as you see it will have a
big<00:07:25.960> battle<00:07:26.229> here<00:07:26.590> in<00:07:26.710> front<00:07:26.889> of<00:07:27.039> our<00:07:27.160> base<00:07:27.310> and

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 
big battle here in front of our base and

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.820 
big battle here in front of our base and
they<00:07:28.150> actually<00:07:28.330> do<00:07:28.810> manage<00:07:29.260> to<00:07:29.289> kill<00:07:29.620> one<00:07:29.800> of

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
they actually do manage to kill one of

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.520 
they actually do manage to kill one of
Cameron's<00:07:30.310> faces<00:07:30.820> all<00:07:31.449> my<00:07:31.810> bases<00:07:32.020> have<00:07:32.500> a

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530 
Cameron's faces all my bases have a

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.219 
Cameron's faces all my bases have a
shield<00:07:33.099> on<00:07:33.340> which<00:07:33.849> protects<00:07:34.599> them<00:07:34.870> but<00:07:35.110> the

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:35.229 
shield on which protects them but the

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.760 
shield on which protects them but the
UNSC<00:07:35.710> can't<00:07:35.979> get<00:07:36.340> shields<00:07:36.940> so<00:07:37.840> that's<00:07:38.409> one<00:07:38.740> of

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770 
UNSC can't get shields so that's one of

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.980 
UNSC can't get shields so that's one of
the<00:07:39.039> little<00:07:39.490> downfalls<00:07:40.090> but<00:07:40.330> their<00:07:40.449> bases<00:07:40.780> are

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
the little downfalls but their bases are

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.680 
the little downfalls but their bases are
stronger

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690 
stronger

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.810 
stronger
so<00:07:43.690> they're<00:07:44.140> sort<00:07:44.620> of<00:07:44.740> avoiding<00:07:45.220> my<00:07:45.310> bases<00:07:45.670> and

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:45.820 
so they're sort of avoiding my bases and

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.600 
so they're sort of avoiding my bases and
going<00:07:45.970> for<00:07:46.150> cameron's<00:07:46.600> and<00:07:46.840> I<00:07:47.740> basically<00:07:48.160> have

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:48.610 
going for cameron's and I basically have

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.630 
going for cameron's and I basically have
to<00:07:48.790> protect<00:07:49.210> his<00:07:49.450> bases<00:07:49.930> here<00:07:50.200> just<00:07:51.010> for<00:07:51.430> the

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:51.640 
to protect his bases here just for the

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.890 
to protect his bases here just for the
fact<00:07:51.820> that<00:07:53.490> hey<00:07:54.490> they'll<00:07:54.940> go<00:07:55.090> for<00:07:55.270> his<00:07:55.450> because

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:55.900 
fact that hey they'll go for his because

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.560 
fact that hey they'll go for his because
they<00:07:56.110> don't<00:07:56.290> shield<00:07:56.680> and<00:07:57.120> if<00:07:58.120> they<00:07:58.330> attack

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:58.570 
they don't shield and if they attack

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.780 
they don't shield and if they attack
mine<00:07:58.870> and<00:07:59.140> don't<00:07:59.320> successfully<00:08:00.130> destroy<00:08:00.610> it

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:00.790 
mine and don't successfully destroy it

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.450 
mine and don't successfully destroy it
the<00:08:01.060> shields<00:08:01.420> will<00:08:01.600> recharge<00:08:02.110> and<00:08:02.560> they<00:08:03.250> will

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:03.460 
the shields will recharge and they will

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.730 
the shields will recharge and they will
have<00:08:03.640> wasted<00:08:03.820> their<00:08:04.120> time<00:08:04.180> so<00:08:05.020> Cameron<00:08:05.470> is<00:08:05.590> the

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:05.740 
have wasted their time so Cameron is the

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.880 
have wasted their time so Cameron is the
main<00:08:05.980> target<00:08:06.490> in<00:08:06.610> this<00:08:06.790> game<00:08:07.030> for<00:08:07.270> them<00:08:07.390> and<00:08:07.890> I

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:08.890 
main target in this game for them and I

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.890 
main target in this game for them and I
think<00:08:09.430> this<00:08:09.790> is<00:08:09.850> good<00:08:10.090> enough<00:08:10.210> for<00:08:10.360> the<00:08:10.660> first

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:10.900 
think this is good enough for the first

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.300 
think this is good enough for the first
part<00:08:11.140> and<00:08:11.410> we<00:08:11.710> will<00:08:12.040> move<00:08:12.580> on<00:08:12.790> to<00:08:12.820> the<00:08:13.030> second
