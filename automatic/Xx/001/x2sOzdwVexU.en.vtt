little<00:00:12.990> bit<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.530> lag<00:00:13.769> Buster<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
little bit about the lag Buster and the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.460 
little bit about the lag Buster and the
countermeasure<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.719> software<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.350> comes

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
countermeasure to software that comes

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.920 
countermeasure to software that comes
along<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.090> now<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.210> sure<00:00:18.420> you've<00:00:18.660> run

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
along with it now I'm sure you've run

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.510 
along with it now I'm sure you've run
into<00:00:19.080> plenty<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.590> problems<00:00:20.160> with<00:00:20.310> lag

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
into plenty of problems with lag

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.340 
into plenty of problems with lag
compensation<00:00:21.210> when<00:00:21.600> gaming<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.199> your

friends<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:23.460> we're<00:00:23.609> gonna<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.240> show<00:00:24.570> you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
friends what we're gonna do is show you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.019 
friends what we're gonna do is show you
how<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> fix<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:26.130> let's<00:00:26.789> take<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
how to fix that but first let's take a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.570 
how to fix that but first let's take a
look<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.720> some<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.230> horrible<00:00:28.560> examples<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
look at some really horrible examples of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.400 
look at some really horrible examples of
lag<00:00:29.939> compensation<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.109> know<00:00:31.230> exactly

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
lag compensation so you know exactly

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.979 
lag compensation so you know exactly
what<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.130> let's<00:00:32.880> start<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.239> call<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.630> duty

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989

see me unloading my entire clip into

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.080 
see me unloading my entire clip into
this<00:01:08.610> guy<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.119> he's<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.659> dying

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
this guy and he's not dying

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.520 
this guy and he's not dying
that<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.439> lag<00:01:13.439> compensation<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.460> its<00:01:14.640> best<00:01:15.530> now

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that is lag compensation at its best now

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
that is lag compensation at its best now
you've<00:01:16.740> seen<00:01:16.979> some<00:01:17.189> examples<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.390> lag

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you've seen some examples of what lag

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.230 
you've seen some examples of what lag
compensation<00:01:19.290> looks<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:20.030> let's<00:01:21.030> take<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
compensation looks like let's take a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
compensation looks like let's take a
look<00:01:21.479> at<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> countermeasure<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.590> software

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
look at the countermeasure to software

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
look at the countermeasure to software
for<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.580> lag<00:01:23.759> buster<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.390> find<00:01:24.600> some<00:01:24.780> ways

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
for your lag buster and find some ways

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.800 
for your lag buster and find some ways
to<00:01:24.990> solve<00:01:25.979> these<00:01:26.220> problems<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.600> can

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
to solve these problems so you can

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.520 
to solve these problems so you can
access<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.470> software<00:01:29.009> either<00:01:29.189> via<00:01:29.549> your

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
access the software either via your

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.690 
access the software either via your
Android<00:01:31.530> phone<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.240> via<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.329> laptop<00:01:33.600> computer

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
control panel for the lag buster let's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.969 
control panel for the lag buster let's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
hit the gear tab from here you can check

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.730 
hit the gear tab from here you can check
out<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.159> network<00:01:47.729> performance<00:01:47.970> meters<00:01:48.750> but

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
let's go on and hit the countermeasure

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.590 
let's go on and hit the countermeasure
tab<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.820> takes<00:01:54.149> us<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
then over it bandwidth once again let's

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.540 
then over it bandwidth once again let's
type<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.690> Gears<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.590> War<00:02:19.800> 3<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.930> use

200 kilobits per second once again this
is<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.459> an<00:02:26.610> example<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.569> best<00:02:27.870> if<00:02:28.050> you're

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
is just an example it's best if you're

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.740 
is just an example it's best if you're

what you can do with this your teammates

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.690 
what you can do with this your teammates
and<00:03:07.049> enemies<00:03:07.739> are<00:03:07.769> still<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.610> be

using this advantage let's take a look

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.970 
using this advantage let's take a look
at<00:03:16.080> what<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.500> do<00:03:18.260> here<00:03:19.260> I'm<00:03:19.410> using<00:03:19.620> a

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
at what we can do here I'm using a

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.430 
at what we can do here I'm using a
short-range<00:03:20.640> rifle<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.600> take<00:03:21.810> down<00:03:22.049> enemies

short-range rifle to take down enemies
from<00:03:22.650> afar<00:03:22.799> I've<00:03:23.640> got<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.820> teammate<00:03:24.269> running<00:03:24.510> in

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
from afar I've got a teammate running in

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.430 
from afar I've got a teammate running in
there<00:03:25.400> stealing<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.489> kill<00:03:27.109> but<00:03:28.109> now<00:03:28.200> he's

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
there stealing a kill but now he's

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.229 
there stealing a kill but now he's
shooting<00:03:29.160> at<00:03:29.310> things<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:29.820> are<00:03:29.940> right<00:03:30.060> next

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
shooting at things that are right next

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.910

pick someone up on your team you

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.440 
pick someone up on your team you
actually<00:04:02.430> pick<00:04:02.640> them<00:04:02.819> up<00:04:02.940> instead<00:04:03.299> of<00:04:03.359> just

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
actually pick them up instead of just

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.630

happening<00:04:05.819> a<00:04:06.269> big<00:04:07.230> problem<00:04:07.590> online<00:04:07.980> but<00:04:08.970> this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
happening a big problem online but this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.740 
happening a big problem online but this
device<00:04:09.950> solves<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.100> problem

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
device solves that problem

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.930 
device solves that problem
let's<00:04:12.750> take<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.959> look<00:04:13.200> at<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.440> again<00:04:13.850> going<00:04:14.850> to
