for<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.510> cupcake<00:03:02.780> challenge<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.470> think

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
for the cupcake challenge I think

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.140 
for the cupcake challenge I think
because<00:03:04.280> they're<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.489> little<00:03:04.580> different<00:03:04.790> kind

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
because they're a little different kind

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.759 
because they're a little different kind
of<00:03:05.239> off<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.420> wall<00:03:05.569> out<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.049> box<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.560> not<00:03:06.620> a

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
of off the wall out of the box and not a

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.170 
of off the wall out of the box and not a
normal<00:03:07.069> cupcake<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.489> think<00:03:07.700> that's<00:03:07.849> going<00:03:08.060> to

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
normal cupcake I think that's going to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.309 
normal cupcake I think that's going to
grab<00:03:08.360> everybody's<00:03:08.780> attention<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.140> little<00:03:09.200> bit

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
grab everybody's attention a little bit

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.229 
grab everybody's attention a little bit
more<00:03:09.410> it's<00:03:10.099> not<00:03:10.220> your<00:03:10.340> normal<00:03:10.489> in<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.090> wrapper

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
more it's not your normal in the wrapper

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.059 
more it's not your normal in the wrapper
cupcake<00:03:11.750> with<00:03:12.019> some<00:03:12.200> pretty<00:03:12.560> design<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
cupcake with some pretty design on the

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.020 
cupcake with some pretty design on the
top<00:03:14.380> cupcakes<00:03:15.380> are<00:03:15.620> kind<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.400> pain<00:03:16.430> it's

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
top cupcakes are kind of a pain it's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.940 
top cupcakes are kind of a pain it's
hard<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.420> make<00:03:17.720> something<00:03:17.900> really<00:03:18.110> cool<00:03:18.590> that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
hard to make something really cool that

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.039 
hard to make something really cool that
doesn't<00:03:19.640> take<00:03:19.819> a<00:03:19.849> ton<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.150> time<00:03:20.420> because<00:03:20.870> they

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
doesn't take a ton of time because they

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.539 
doesn't take a ton of time because they
are<00:03:21.079> kind<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.590> tedious<00:03:22.010> when<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.280> get<00:03:22.430> into

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
are kind of tedious when you get into

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.559 
are kind of tedious when you get into
the<00:03:22.760> fancy<00:03:23.180> ones

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
the fancy ones

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.559 
the fancy ones
I<00:03:23.769> think<00:03:24.769> texture<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.459> an<00:03:25.640> easy<00:03:25.940> way<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.269> add

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
I think texture is an easy way to add

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.710 
I think texture is an easy way to add
pop<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.620> your<00:03:27.650> cake<00:03:28.069> or<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.819> cupcakes<00:03:29.480> or

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
pop to your cake or the cupcakes or

pop to your cake or the cupcakes or
whatever<00:03:30.079> you're<00:03:30.260> working<00:03:30.290> on<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.950> way<00:03:31.099> it's

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
whatever you're working on that way it's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.930 
whatever you're working on that way it's
just<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:32.000> little<00:03:32.150> added<00:03:32.569> something<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:33.940> think

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
just that little added something I think

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.270 
just that little added something I think
getting<00:03:35.390> everything<00:03:35.959> on<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.260> cupcakes<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:36.890> 15

getting everything on the cupcakes in 15

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.780 
getting everything on the cupcakes in 15
minutes

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
minutes

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.119 
minutes
time<00:03:38.000> has<00:03:38.269> really<00:03:38.629> just<00:03:38.870> been<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.799> biggest

thing this was all learned on the job
for<00:04:17.780> me<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.760> back<00:04:19.760> before<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.359> days<00:04:20.539> of

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
for me and back before the days of

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.440 
for me and back before the days of
fondant<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.639> cutters<00:04:22.639> and<00:04:22.849> molds<00:04:23.330> and

fondant and cutters and molds and
pre-made<00:04:23.900> flowers<00:04:24.440> this<00:04:24.889> was<00:04:25.190> how<00:04:25.580> we<00:04:25.639> did<00:04:25.910> it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
pre-made flowers this was how we did it

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.400 
pre-made flowers this was how we did it
all<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.599> was<00:04:26.660> all<00:04:26.870> just

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
all it was all just

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.740 
all it was all just
by<00:04:27.530> hand<00:04:27.800> it's<00:04:28.310> kind<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.760> becoming<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.360> lost<00:04:29.570> art

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
by hand it's kind of becoming a lost art

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.300 
by hand it's kind of becoming a lost art
because<00:04:30.290> there's<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.800> much<00:04:31.420> fondant<00:04:32.420> work

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
because there's so much fondant work

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.530 
because there's so much fondant work
can't<00:04:34.310> really<00:04:34.520> do<00:04:34.640> this<00:04:34.790> without<00:04:34.970> the

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
can't really do this without the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.640 
can't really do this without the
marshmallow<00:04:35.990> or<00:04:36.080> having<00:04:36.350> something

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
marshmallow or having something

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.900 
marshmallow or having something
underneath<00:04:37.220> there<00:04:37.430> because<00:04:37.610> that<00:04:37.700> would<00:04:37.820> be

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
underneath there because that would be

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.300 
underneath there because that would be
too<00:04:38.090> much<00:04:38.120> icing<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.780> would<00:04:38.960> just<00:04:39.800> fall<00:04:40.070> over

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
too much icing and would just fall over

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
up a little higher and maybe put a

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.700

little mousse in it but I'm really happy
with<00:05:55.920> the<00:05:56.040> presentation<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.580> think<00:05:56.730> it's<00:05:56.820> very

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
with the presentation I think it's very

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.370 
with the presentation I think it's very
pretty<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.600> it's<00:05:57.750> also<00:05:57.870> gonna<00:05:58.050> be<00:05:58.140> really

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
pretty and it's also gonna be really

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:07.420 
pretty and it's also gonna be really
yummy

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.550 

for<00:06:08.430> me<00:06:08.550> I<00:06:08.580> like<00:06:08.880> new<00:06:09.060> text<00:06:09.450> because<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:10.260> grain

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
for me I like new text because the grain

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.470 
for me I like new text because the grain
to<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.710> sponge<00:06:11.130> is<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.370> lot<00:06:11.610> tighter<00:06:11.910> you<00:06:12.390> have

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
to the sponge is a lot tighter you have

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.300 
to the sponge is a lot tighter you have
a<00:06:12.540> better<00:06:12.750> mouthfeel<00:06:13.320> you<00:06:13.830> know<00:06:13.950> it's<00:06:14.130> more

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
a better mouthfeel you know it's more

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.180 
a better mouthfeel you know it's more
smoother<00:06:14.820> and<00:06:15.000> I<00:06:15.870> also<00:06:16.020> think<00:06:16.350> that<00:06:16.470> it<00:06:16.650> holds

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
smoother and I also think that it holds

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.210 
smoother and I also think that it holds
in<00:06:17.310> moisture<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.790> lot<00:06:18.000> better
