this<00:00:00.359> is<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.539> gy6<00:00:02.030> 150cc<00:00:03.030> carburetor<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.490> a

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
this is a gy6 150cc carburetor and a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.379 
this is a gy6 150cc carburetor and a
couple<00:00:06.150> things<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.690> wanted<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.140> show<00:00:07.470> you

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
couple things that I wanted to show you

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.140 
couple things that I wanted to show you
number<00:00:09.389> one<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.590> automatic<00:00:11.550> choke<00:00:11.849> which

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
number one is the automatic choke which

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.560 
number one is the automatic choke which
is<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.980> this<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.250> most<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> most

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
is here this is the most one of the most

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.930 
is here this is the most one of the most
common<00:00:15.960> parts<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.470> fail<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:17.190> these<00:00:17.460> devices

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
common parts to fail on these devices

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.429 
common parts to fail on these devices
they<00:00:19.250> it's<00:00:20.250> more<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.810> resistor<00:00:21.810> feeds

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
they it's more like a resistor feeds

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.460 
they it's more like a resistor feeds
this<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.160> there's<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.210> plunger<00:00:24.570> inside<00:00:24.990> here

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
this and there's a plunger inside here

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.589 
this and there's a plunger inside here
that<00:00:25.619> goes<00:00:25.800> down<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:27.180> adjusts<00:00:27.810> variably

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
that goes down and this adjusts variably

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.220 
that goes down and this adjusts variably
depending<00:00:30.599> upon<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.439> thumb<00:00:31.980> sends<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
depending upon what the thumb sends it

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.610 
depending upon what the thumb sends it
now<00:00:34.399> over<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.809> throttle<00:00:37.230> cable

secure that so that's not too difficult
this<00:01:20.880> side<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> carburetor<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:23.270> some<00:01:24.270> kind

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
this side of the carburetor is some kind

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.810 
this side of the carburetor is some kind
of<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.630> diaphragm<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.220> maybe

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
of a diaphragm I really don't know maybe

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880 
of a diaphragm I really don't know maybe
somebody<00:01:27.240> else<00:01:27.270> could<00:01:27.869> explain<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.530> but

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
somebody else could explain that but

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.780 
somebody else could explain that but
this<00:01:29.670> hose<00:01:30.450> goes<00:01:31.259> basically<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:32.100> ventilation

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
this hose goes basically to ventilation

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.929 
this hose goes basically to ventilation
so<00:01:33.229> anywhere<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> vent<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
so anywhere you want to vent that

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.170 
so anywhere you want to vent that
usually<00:01:35.939> vent<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> seat<00:01:36.930> whatever

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
usually vent it up to the seat whatever

usually vent it up to the seat whatever
this<00:01:39.180> side<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> carburetor<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.470> your

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
this side of the carburetor is your

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.760 
this side of the carburetor is your
intake<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.090> breather<00:01:42.390> side<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:43.619> this

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
intake or your breather side where this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.359 
intake or your breather side where this
hooks<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.280> normally<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.939> your<00:01:45.090> airbox<00:01:45.509> and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
hooks up normally to your airbox and

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.940 
hooks up normally to your airbox and
there's<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> filter<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:47.939> that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.510 

this<00:01:55.290> barbed<00:01:56.290> hooks<00:01:57.040> up<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.250> your<00:01:57.490> fuel<00:01:58.479> tank

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
this barbed hooks up to your fuel tank

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.320 
this barbed hooks up to your fuel tank
so<00:02:00.520> fuel<00:02:01.119> in<00:02:01.330> right<00:02:01.600> here<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:03.460> here<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.270> a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
so fuel in right here down here is is a

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.359 
so fuel in right here down here is is a
bull<00:02:05.159> drain<00:02:07.050> this<00:02:08.050> just<00:02:08.410> goes<00:02:08.649> out<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.190> nowhere

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
bull drain this just goes out to nowhere

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.920 
bull drain this just goes out to nowhere
and<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.940> bike<00:02:13.900> itself<00:02:14.319> there's<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:15.930> intake

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and on the bike itself there's a intake

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.320 
and on the bike itself there's a intake
tube<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.700> clamps<00:02:19.209> here<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:21.610> has<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.910> hose

tube that clamps here and it has a hose
as<00:02:22.660> well<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.170> goes<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.410> nowhere<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:24.970> a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
as well that goes to nowhere it's just a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.600 
as well that goes to nowhere it's just a
breather<00:02:25.330> hose<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.110> just<00:02:26.440> tie<00:02:27.310> them<00:02:27.519> all

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
breather hose and I just tie them all

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.920 
breather hose and I just tie them all
together<00:02:27.760> by<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.959> other<00:02:29.380> side<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:31.630> hose

right here and the intake hose together
this<00:02:42.010> one<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.400> goes<00:02:42.549> down<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.269> drain<00:02:45.480> okay

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
this one just goes down to drain okay

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.199 
this one just goes down to drain okay
we're<00:02:46.930> going<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:48.040> measure<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.670> carb<00:02:49.060> if

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
we're going to just measure this carb if

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.880
