00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 And, folks, beauty is good, the video of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.720
 game brisbane holding aquino nokia asha 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.900
 35 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.840
 first send a play here and here 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.539
 it's like you can see several missions in 15 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:22.260
 our little screen + 15 + 15 and ended up with 45 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.609
 play a game here for you guys 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.500
 So much as difficult so I go 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.220
 Telling you, I quit Wednesday. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.900
 phase 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 I'm so keep playing 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.369
 It's very difficult to pass up, so it takes a while. 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.550
 to pass each phase the first two 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.960
 phases until they are easy but the first 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 for the second city ​​feels good 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 difference because you are very easy you 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.280
 end up wrong 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.350
 The goal is to throw the rabbit and 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.649
 get all the carrots from there you can 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.260
 throw several to say kind I think 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.530
 in this first phase there are three or four 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.120
 you can use and how much less 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 you use them I know more or to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.000
 Weird punctuation, shall we say? 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.489
 at the end of the video you can see yourself free 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 free and three stars because I used few 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.369
 with them 's power could have used more 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.350
 I used only a few three next phase 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 This phase is difficult, it took me a long time. 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.080
 to pass 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.780
 I have to pick up and see that lady. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 It's from above and this is talk to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.560
 It's very difficult to find out a little 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.840
 but it's just to be able to hit here and 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.150
 to hit is difficult to hit here 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.369
 and give the coupon to resume the mission 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.360
 so it 's a bit difficult but I play 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.530
 Well, he's good at 35 and with 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.780
 sure will help much better in the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.659
 article 311, then there is another three years and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.210
 also like this game 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.689
 remember these three carrots here from 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.689
 corner 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.649
 There was only one I'm going to release now. 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.659
 after I went on the mission it was more 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.380
 You already know what to do, right? 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.329
 I know I did two stars to see 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.810
 if I had given it - rabbit would have 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.980
 probably won 33 with that heavy 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.800
 2 promises to have won 3 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.800
 Good now that I can not use these 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.140
 spirits that remain 1 on the map do not 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.250
 only in five other parts up here 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.540
 here to dwell on them what he dies 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.390
