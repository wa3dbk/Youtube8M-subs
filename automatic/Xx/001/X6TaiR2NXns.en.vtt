on a pre-rigged rig for rescue system at
level<00:00:16.299> one<00:00:16.480> okay<00:00:17.050> so<00:00:17.949> it's<00:00:18.100> part<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.400> syllabus

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
one dead system our guy will start

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.979 
one dead system our guy will start
coming<00:01:03.429> back<00:01:03.459> up<00:01:03.789> taking<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.420> bit<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.690> his<00:01:04.780> back

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
coming back up taking a bit on his back

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.219 
coming back up taking a bit on his back
up<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.700> then<00:01:06.940> we<00:01:06.970> can<00:01:07.240> just<00:01:07.420> start<00:01:07.659> just<00:01:08.049> in

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
up and then we can just start just in

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:19.730 
up and then we can just start just in
the<00:01:08.409> jammers<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:10.360> bringing<00:01:10.690> him<00:01:10.810> back<00:01:10.990> up

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.320 

quite<00:01:20.740> straightforward<00:01:21.520> especially<00:01:21.910> if

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
quite straightforward especially if

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.230 
quite straightforward especially if
you're<00:01:22.420> using<00:01:22.570> an<00:01:22.780> ace<00:01:22.930> up<00:01:23.190> if<00:01:24.190> we<00:01:24.880> want<00:01:25.060> to

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
you're using an ace up if we want to

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.270 
you're using an ace up if we want to
lower<00:01:25.420> him<00:01:25.660> again<00:01:25.930> again<00:01:26.440> it's<00:01:26.620> very<00:01:26.830> simple

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
lower him again again it's very simple

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.990 
lower him again again it's very simple
we<00:01:27.580> just<00:01:27.730> take<00:01:27.970> off<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:29.230> jammer<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:30.640> we<00:01:30.820> pull

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
we just take off the jammer if we pull

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.660 
we just take off the jammer if we pull
all<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:31.330> tight<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.930> off<00:01:32.160> that<00:01:33.160> axis<00:01:33.580> is

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
all this tight that off that axis is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.330 
all this tight that off that axis is
friction<00:01:34.090> beaner<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.650> we<00:01:35.920> just<00:01:36.100> need<00:01:36.250> to

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
friction beaner and we just need to

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.400 
friction beaner and we just need to
unlock<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.850> ASAP<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.430> will<00:01:39.610> now<00:01:39.730> run

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
unlock the ASAP so this will now run

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.230 
unlock the ASAP so this will now run
unlock<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.590> handle<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:44.010> you<00:01:45.010> can<00:01:45.190> lower<00:01:45.460> just

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
unlock the handle and you can lower just

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.460 
unlock the handle and you can lower just
making<00:01:46.570> sure<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:46.870> everything<00:01:47.230> is<00:01:47.320> running

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
making sure that everything is running

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.760 
making sure that everything is running
all<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.890> time<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.720> can<00:01:49.900> lower<00:01:50.110> your<00:01:50.230> casualty

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
all the time you can lower your casualty

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.430 
all the time you can lower your casualty
back<00:01:50.950> down<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.400> ground<00:01:52.320> didn't<00:01:53.320> put

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
back down to the ground didn't put

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.149 
back down to the ground didn't put
anyone<00:01:53.710> else<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:54.010> danger<00:01:54.400> going<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.670> get<00:01:54.820> him

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
anyone else that danger going to get him

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.180 
anyone else that danger going to get him
it's<00:01:57.159> nice<00:01:57.370> and<00:01:57.550> straightforward
