00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.400
 today's second phone that I 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.019
 presents you in credit card format 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.780
 so as usual we take a ride 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.789
 quick of the box so that's it 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.360
 written in red is the name of the brand 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.890
 and the reference is x5 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.630
 so let's go on the right side 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.750
 to the drafts in fact there is just the name 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.580
 of the mark like that on the bottom there is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 a website 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.960
 it was not bought on this site there 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.850
 was bought on eder buring so for 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.790
 less than 27 dollars with postage 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.730
 including 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.420
 so on two setbacks you have the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.060
 front - facing phone down so you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 have product references which weighs 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:55.620
 28 grams there are 320 million terror of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:59.850
 batteries recharge micro usb 85 on 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.160
 55 and it's 4 8 8 or 4.6 I do not see 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.509
 very well mm it's really very very 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.509
 hungry are we going there 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.620
 that's what we find directly 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.760
 phone I find it's a lot 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.100
 better I find that the already just cardboard 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.930
 like that it's a lot better than the one 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.049
 this the m5 that I had presented to you on 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.049
 chain 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.920
 so I phone 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.260
 we will come back to it right after this is a 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.369
 white version and gold so there is 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.670
 found directly as marked the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670
 USB cable 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.650
 that was like the other a veil to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.650
 an exceptional a small cable 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.650
 then you have a box that is empty 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.530
 it is simply to enhance 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.090
 do the phone you have that copy 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.620
 perfect of what is found in the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.690
 iphone except it's much thinner 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:17.870
 much more fragile the case it is very 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:19.010
 very easily and you have that I do not 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.600
 do not know what's the point 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.120
 maybe a guarantee I do not even know 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.870
 what they phone and guarantee them 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.430
 personally for 20 euros 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.010
 we need a little bit of the guarantee 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.290
 are not so directly 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.260
 phone you have a plastic film 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.430
 on before by even for phones 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.320
 not very expensive it's still not bad 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.640
 so whiteness version as I you 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.980
 said so on the right side 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.950
 so there is nothing there you can 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.720
 hang wrist against the neck by 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.450
 the accessory is not provided on the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.580
 left side there is nothing on the bottom 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.070
 so it's to put a sim card 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.120
 the art loading usb 2.0 and there all 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.630
 just to block the phone 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.900
 to cry but here it is the little one 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.640
 button 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.190
 how to find on each other on 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.730
 the back so there is also a movie 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.620
 plastic 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.459

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.820
 stickers 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.239
 if the focus we want is 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.160

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:25.700

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:28.640
 good very well then this phone I have 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.840
 taken in hand very very quickly and 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.799
 just in fact it's exactly the same 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.930
 both are really the same 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.959
 the screen works fine it's just 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.400
 the camera that did not film him except that 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.680
 the screen of this one is much more 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.600
 clear much more flashy compared 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.790
 this one is much more comfortable 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.380
 to know that this one there is a menu 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.380
