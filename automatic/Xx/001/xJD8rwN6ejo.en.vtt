00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
two reasons first of all Gallup polls

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.040 
two reasons first of all Gallup polls
have<00:00:21.439> indicated<00:00:21.890> that<00:00:22.570> there<00:00:23.570> has<00:00:23.779> been<00:00:23.990> a

have indicated that there has been a

have indicated that there has been a

steady loss of belief in life after

steady loss of belief in life after
death<00:00:26.210> as<00:00:26.720> there<00:00:27.650> has<00:00:27.829> been<00:00:27.860> an<00:00:28.189> increase<00:00:28.880> in

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
death as there has been an increase in

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.810 
death as there has been an increase in
the<00:00:29.210> belief<00:00:29.689> that<00:00:29.719> were<00:00:30.020> our<00:00:30.169> brains<00:00:30.520> the<00:00:31.520> idea

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the belief that were our brains the idea

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.850 
the belief that were our brains the idea
that<00:00:32.000> many<00:00:32.149> people<00:00:32.360> have<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.079> sensibly

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
that many people have and sensibly

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.470 
that many people have and sensibly
enough<00:00:34.219> is<00:00:34.460> that<00:00:34.489> your<00:00:34.850> if<00:00:34.969> you're<00:00:35.149> a<00:00:35.180> brain

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
enough is that your if you're a brain

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.209 
enough is that your if you're a brain
and<00:00:35.750> your<00:00:35.840> brain<00:00:36.020> dies<00:00:36.320> that's<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.920> end<00:00:37.100> of

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
and your brain dies that's the end of

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.040 
and your brain dies that's the end of
you<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.860> if<00:00:39.860> there<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.370> soul<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:41.480> means

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
you and so if there is a soul this means

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.020 
you and so if there is a soul this means
that<00:00:42.500> there<00:00:42.710> is<00:00:42.739> more<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:43.370> us<00:00:43.399> than<00:00:43.730> our<00:00:43.820> brains

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
that there is more to us than our brains

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.500 
that there is more to us than our brains
and<00:00:44.539> it<00:00:44.629> tends<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.200> lend<00:00:45.530> support<00:00:45.740> to<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.190> idea

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
and it tends to lend support to the idea

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.290 
and it tends to lend support to the idea
that<00:00:47.510> there's<00:00:47.750> life<00:00:47.990> after<00:00:48.320> death<00:00:48.560> so<00:00:49.460> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
that there's life after death so the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.590 
that there's life after death so the
neuro<00:00:50.540> scientific<00:00:51.410> findings<00:00:52.040> if<00:00:52.730> they<00:00:53.120> do<00:00:53.180> in

neuro scientific findings if they do in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.250 
neuro scientific findings if they do in
fact<00:00:53.680> undermine<00:00:54.680> belief<00:00:55.130> in<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.430> soul<00:00:55.900> has<00:00:56.900> for

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
fact undermine belief in a soul has for

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.020 
fact undermine belief in a soul has for
many<00:00:57.380> people<00:00:57.829> undermined<00:00:58.310> belief<00:00:58.700> in<00:00:58.880> life

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
many people undermined belief in life

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.910 
many people undermined belief in life
after<00:00:59.270> death<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.750> made<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.079> gospel<00:01:00.590> sort<00:01:00.829> of

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
after death and made the gospel sort of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.999 
after death and made the gospel sort of
pointless<00:01:01.780> what<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.560> point<00:01:03.739> of<00:01:03.920> the

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
pointless what is the point of the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.330 
pointless what is the point of the
gospel<00:01:04.159> if<00:01:04.729> this<00:01:05.030> life<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:05.479> all<00:01:05.630> there<00:01:05.659> is<00:01:06.340> the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
gospel if this life is all there is the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.090 
gospel if this life is all there is the
second<00:01:07.729> reason<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:09.079> is<00:01:09.290> important<00:01:09.860> is

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
second reason that this is important is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.760 
second reason that this is important is
because<00:01:10.579> it<00:01:11.360> appears<00:01:11.930> that<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.350> Bible

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
because it appears that the Bible

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.520 
because it appears that the Bible
teaches<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:13.430> there's<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.670> soul<00:01:13.969> and<00:01:14.390> if<00:01:15.259> we

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
teaches that there's a soul and if we

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.190 
teaches that there's a soul and if we
are<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:16.100> revise<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:16.970> Bible's<00:01:17.390> teachings<00:01:17.900> in

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
are to revise the Bible's teachings in

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.590 
are to revise the Bible's teachings in
this<00:01:18.380> area<00:01:18.850> under<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.970> pressure<00:01:20.270> of

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
this area under the pressure of

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.539 
this area under the pressure of
neuroscience<00:01:21.760> what's<00:01:22.760> next<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.840> important

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
neuroscience what's next it's important

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.030 
neuroscience what's next it's important
to<00:01:25.549> ask<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:26.090> question<00:01:26.630> has<00:01:27.470> science

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
to ask the question has science

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.609 
to ask the question has science
undermined<00:01:28.729> traditional<00:01:29.659> biblical<00:01:30.170> teaching

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
undermined traditional biblical teaching

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.130 
undermined traditional biblical teaching
there<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.490> actually<00:01:32.150> another<00:01:32.180> reason<00:01:32.960> why

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
there is actually another reason why

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.750 
there is actually another reason why
this<00:01:33.200> matters<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.310> average<00:01:34.670> person

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
this matters to the average person

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.300 
this matters to the average person
Darwin<00:01:37.760> admitted<00:01:38.450> when<00:01:39.440> he<00:01:39.619> came<00:01:39.860> up<00:01:40.070> with<00:01:40.100> his

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
Darwin admitted when he came up with his

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.940 
Darwin admitted when he came up with his
theory<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.790> evolution<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.560> could<00:01:42.799> not

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
theory of evolution that it could not

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.660 
theory of evolution that it could not
explain<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.520> origin<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.210> mind<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.950> what<00:01:46.340> his

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
explain the origin of mind that what his

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.060 
explain the origin of mind that what his
theory<00:01:47.000> could<00:01:47.330> do<00:01:47.540> was<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.439> explain<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
theory could do was to explain the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.390 
theory could do was to explain the
origin<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.850> animal<00:01:50.420> bodies<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.049> brains<00:01:51.400> but

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
origin of animal bodies and brains but

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.760 
origin of animal bodies and brains but
it<00:01:52.580> couldn't<00:01:52.970> explain<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.750> origin<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.380> mind

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
it couldn't explain the origin of mind

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.179 
it couldn't explain the origin of mind
and<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.000> Darwin<00:01:56.330> was<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.900> materialist<00:01:57.890> and

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
and so Darwin was a materialist and

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.700 
and so Darwin was a materialist and
argued<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:58.909> his<00:01:59.240> theory<00:01:59.780> should<00:02:00.560> be

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
argued that his theory should be

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.179 
argued that his theory should be
understood<00:02:01.340> as<00:02:01.700> promoting<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:03.189> materialist

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
understood as promoting a materialist
