00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
everyone that was the sound demo of the

everyone that was the sound demo of the
flapjack<00:05:25.920> overdrive<00:05:26.520> it's<00:05:26.940> based<00:05:27.180> on<00:05:27.420> the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
flapjack overdrive it's based on the

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.970 
flapjack overdrive it's based on the
Crowther<00:05:28.320> audio<00:05:29.250> hotcake<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:31.350> hotcake<00:05:31.770> was

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
Crowther audio hotcake the hotcake was

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.650 
Crowther audio hotcake the hotcake was
first<00:05:32.280> made<00:05:32.940> in<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.900> 70s<00:05:34.500> by<00:05:35.430> paul<00:05:35.970> pro<00:05:36.270> from

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
first made in the 70s by paul pro from

first made in the 70s by paul pro from
split<00:05:37.260> ends<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.790> there's<00:05:38.790> been<00:05:38.910> quite<00:05:39.330> a<00:05:39.390> few

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
split ends and there's been quite a few

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.690 
split ends and there's been quite a few
different<00:05:39.900> revisions<00:05:40.140> this<00:05:40.890> is<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:41.460> one<00:05:41.610> that

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
different revisions this is the one that

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.610 
different revisions this is the one that
I've<00:05:41.820> built<00:05:42.030> I'm<00:05:42.660> pretty<00:05:42.870> sure<00:05:42.990> is<00:05:43.140> based<00:05:43.380> on

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
I've built I'm pretty sure is based on

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.880 
I've built I'm pretty sure is based on
the<00:05:43.740> on<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.220> old<00:05:44.520> style<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.530> seventies

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
the on the old style of the seventies

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.630 
the on the old style of the seventies
version<00:05:47.390> not<00:05:48.390> the<00:05:48.510> modern<00:05:48.780> version<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:50.460> thing

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
version not the modern version the thing

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.370 
version not the modern version the thing
that<00:05:50.850> appeals<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.330> me<00:05:51.480> about<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.810> hotcake<00:05:52.200> is

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
that appeals to me about the hotcake is

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.550 
that appeals to me about the hotcake is
that<00:05:52.590> when<00:05:53.220> their<00:05:53.430> drives<00:05:53.700> on<00:05:53.940> zero<00:05:54.440> you<00:05:55.440> can

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
that when their drives on zero you can

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.860 
that when their drives on zero you can
get<00:05:55.740> a<00:05:55.920> clean<00:05:56.310> boost<00:05:56.580> as<00:05:57.240> you<00:05:57.450> turn<00:05:57.630> it<00:05:57.660> up<00:05:57.840> you

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
get a clean boost as you turn it up you

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.540 
get a clean boost as you turn it up you
start<00:05:58.170> to<00:05:58.260> get<00:05:58.440> some<00:05:58.590> light<00:05:58.830> overdrive

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
start to get some light overdrive

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.820 
start to get some light overdrive
heavier<00:06:00.090> overdrive<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:01.020> then<00:06:01.230> towards<00:06:01.740> the

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
heavier overdrive and then towards the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.800 
heavier overdrive and then towards the
sort<00:06:02.040> of<00:06:02.100> about<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.000> last<00:06:03.210> quarter<00:06:03.630> of<00:06:03.690> the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
sort of about the last quarter of the

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.630 
sort of about the last quarter of the
turn<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.200> start<00:06:04.440> to<00:06:04.560> get<00:06:04.710> almost<00:06:05.310> into

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
turn and you start to get almost into

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.840 
turn and you start to get almost into
sort<00:06:05.850> of<00:06:05.880> fuzz<00:06:06.660> territory<00:06:07.290> I<00:06:07.320> guess<00:06:07.730> it's<00:06:08.730> got

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
sort of fuzz territory I guess it's got

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.810 
sort of fuzz territory I guess it's got
a<00:06:08.880> huge<00:06:09.210> range<00:06:09.450> on<00:06:09.690> that<00:06:09.840> on<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.140> drive<00:06:10.820> it's

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
a huge range on that on the drive it's

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.600 
a huge range on that on the drive it's
probably<00:06:12.420> got<00:06:12.480> the<00:06:12.600> biggest<00:06:12.840> range<00:06:13.160> I've<00:06:14.160> I've

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
probably got the biggest range I've I've

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.820 
probably got the biggest range I've I've
heard<00:06:14.880> on<00:06:15.120> any<00:06:15.390> pedal<00:06:15.750> it<00:06:16.080> just<00:06:16.350> goes<00:06:16.560> from

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
heard on any pedal it just goes from

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.240 
heard on any pedal it just goes from
clean<00:06:17.190> boost<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:18.540> nearly<00:06:19.320> into<00:06:19.560> sort<00:06:19.860> of<00:06:19.920> yeah

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
clean boost to nearly into sort of yeah

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.960 
clean boost to nearly into sort of yeah
fuzz<00:06:20.640> territory<00:06:23.090> so<00:06:24.090> this<00:06:24.240> uses<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:24.810> IC<00:06:25.970> the

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
fuzz territory so this uses the IC the

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.740 
fuzz territory so this uses the IC the
LM<00:06:27.780> 741<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:29.340> I<00:06:29.760> you<00:06:29.820> actually<00:06:30.210> used<00:06:30.390> a<00:06:30.510> UA<00:06:31.010> 741

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
LM 741 and I you actually used a UA 741

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.280 
LM 741 and I you actually used a UA 741
which<00:06:33.750> is<00:06:34.610> the<00:06:35.610> same<00:06:35.850> thing

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.180 

circuits<00:06:40.290> really<00:06:40.590> easy<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:40.890> put<00:06:41.070> together

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
circuits really easy to put together

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.190 
circuits really easy to put together
there's<00:06:41.910> only<00:06:42.090> a<00:06:42.210> few<00:06:42.390> components<00:06:42.780> in<00:06:43.080> there

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
there's only a few components in there

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.890 
there's only a few components in there
as<00:06:43.290> you<00:06:43.320> can<00:06:43.440> see<00:06:43.850> it's<00:06:44.850> it's<00:06:45.330> a<00:06:45.480> pretty<00:06:45.690> easy

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
as you can see it's it's a pretty easy

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.220 
as you can see it's it's a pretty easy
build<00:06:46.260> and<00:06:46.790> yeah<00:06:47.790> sounds<00:06:48.150> really<00:06:48.390> good<00:06:48.540> didn't

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
build and yeah sounds really good didn't

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.130 
build and yeah sounds really good didn't
do<00:06:49.320> any<00:06:49.470> other<00:06:49.710> any<00:06:50.280> other<00:06:50.430> subs<00:06:50.850> or

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
do any other any other subs or

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.630 
do any other any other subs or
modifications<00:06:52.140> pretty<00:06:53.010> much<00:06:53.160> built<00:06:53.430> at<00:06:53.550> a

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
modifications pretty much built at a

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.280 
modifications pretty much built at a
stock<00:06:53.910> if<00:06:54.360> you're<00:06:54.570> looking<00:06:54.780> at<00:06:54.870> building<00:06:55.170> one

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
someone on the mayor bean forums it's

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.800 
someone on the mayor bean forums it's
actually<00:07:05.040> itching<00:07:05.850> nice<00:07:06.060> if<00:07:06.360> you<00:07:06.510> if<00:07:06.720> you
