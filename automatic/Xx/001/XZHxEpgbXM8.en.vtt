00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.359
 around 1830 the first photographers 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.200
 used chemical agents 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.990
 photosensitive to capture images 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.849
 on paper today the machines do more or 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.370
 less the same thing but with a speed 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.960
 and an impressive accuracy in the era 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.240
 digital still prefer many 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.240
 this traditional photographic technique 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.670
 the photo lab receives pictures 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
 envelopes containing the rollers to be developed 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.540
 the manufacturing process allows for 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.880
 transform every exhibit into a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.980
 negative and then in a positive the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.629
 positive and what we call photography 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.340
 a scanner captures an image 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.649
 digital of the details concerning 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.719
 the order specified on the envelopes as the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.680
 size and quality of the print and the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.680
 number of copies requested 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.630
 a roller distributes the envelopes into 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.500
 different containers grouping them by 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.500
 similar orders 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.460
 then a car pulls out rollers from 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.900
 metal capsules in total darkness because 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.350
 expose the film to light 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.060
 ruin the photographs the envelopes 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.610
 they are stored waiting to be 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.970
 gathered with the respective photos and with the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.970
 negative 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.920
 here is the car seen from inside one 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.050
 blade cuts the metal container e 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.000
 another cut the initial tongue 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.369
 of the film 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.450
 the machine unrolls and line up to 60 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.160
 one-meter films each label 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.050
 adhesive reaches the ends 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.340
 identifies each film with a code 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.500
 the machine measures the strip in bars 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.240
 assembled and then wrapped around a 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.520
 role inside a box 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.560
 metallic another machine rolls the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.539
 roller and slide it under the light to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.300
 infrared so that a technician can 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.100
 check that there are no layers the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.229
 even a small one would be enough to do 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.470
 jam the car and ruin them all 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.470
 the photos 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.850
 if the technician finds a tear it 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.690
 repair the repair comes manually 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.690
 carried out in the dark 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.590
 first apply tape to sew 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.420
 the tear 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.889
 then blades cut the ribbon into 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.889
 uniform way on the sides 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.760
 the technician can follow the operation up 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.290
 a monitor connected to a camera 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.290
 internal infrared 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.490
 film development requires 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.220
 four chemical toilets again in July on 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.500
 first the sulfates make appear 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.900
 the negative image 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.660
 second contains acetic acid per 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.520
 stop the effect of sulphates i 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.410
 last two bathrooms serve to preserve 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.380
 the image and eliminate the traces of the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.120
 chemical agents to print photos i 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.190
 negatives are loaded on another 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.690
 machine 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.390
 this contains some paper 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.290
 photosensitive to transfer the image 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.420
 just a flash 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.430
 but it is almost as powerful a light 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.810
 the solar one a sensor regulates 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.489
 automatically the intensity for 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.129
 correct any errors in 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.870
 exposure to develop the print la 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.030
 card passes through four bathrooms 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.959
 chemicals similar to those used for i 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.640
 negatives a bathroom reveals the image on 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.340
 second stops this process 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.900
 the team the two serve to preserve 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.349
 the image and remove the substances 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.349
 chemical 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.200
 the difference this time is that the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.330
 paper passes in an oven to dry for 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.330
 two minutes at 70 degrees centigrade 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.150
 now an attendant marks the photographs that 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.790
 they are too light too dark or 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.150
 blurry and removes them to develop a 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.150
 new 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.590
 then a machine unrolls the tape read 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.019
 bar codes and cuts the photos that 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.400
 they must be put together 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:28.440
 even negative cuts four at a time 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.240
 in strips numbered now the photos and 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.330
 related negatives are put into one 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.639
 envelope the computer shows the matches 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.620
 exact and a car retrieves the envelope 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.620
 which initially contained the rollers 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.510
 when you pick up the photos you can 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.550
 check by referring 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.950
 to the original order in this way there 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.730
 it can be assured that everything works well 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.730
 perfection
