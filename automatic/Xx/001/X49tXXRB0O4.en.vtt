rev the mower motor blew the tire off

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.679 
rev the mower motor blew the tire off
one<00:01:22.080> meant<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> speed<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> guess<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
one meant for that speed I guess is the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.890 
one meant for that speed I guess is the
other<00:01:24.810> front<00:01:25.619> tire<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.159> blew<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.780> guess

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
other front tire that blew and I guess

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.179 
other front tire that blew and I guess
you<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.049> say<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.320> motor<00:01:31.829> might<00:01:32.070> have

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you could say that motor might have

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.749 
you could say that motor might have
blown<00:01:33.259> because<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.619> guarantee<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.189> was<00:01:35.430> stuck

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
blown because I guarantee it was stuck

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.789 
blown because I guarantee it was stuck
at<00:01:36.000> full<00:01:36.479> throttle<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> good<00:01:37.500> I
