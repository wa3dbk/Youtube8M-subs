00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.690 
bright purple and Red's together we're
going<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.639> go<00:04:51.700> backwards<00:04:52.570> around<00:04:53.550> just<00:04:54.550> going

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
going to go backwards around just going

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.740 
going to go backwards around just going
to<00:04:54.760> lay<00:04:55.000> some<00:04:55.330> glue<00:04:55.630> down<00:04:55.900> here<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:57.750> I'm

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
to lay some glue down here and I'm

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.850 
to lay some glue down here and I'm
folding<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.620> in<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.790> middle<00:05:01.060> each<00:05:01.300> leaf<00:05:01.860> and

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
folding it in the middle each leaf and

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.290 
folding it in the middle each leaf and
I'm<00:05:02.950> going<00:05:03.070> to<00:05:03.100> put<00:05:03.190> one<00:05:03.430> in<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.610> middle<00:05:03.760> and

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
I'm going to put one in the middle and

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.350 
I'm going to put one in the middle and
then<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.870> gives<00:05:05.169> it<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.470> little<00:05:05.830> bit<00:05:06.130> of<00:05:06.550> volume

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
then it gives it a little bit of volume

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.510 
then it gives it a little bit of volume
and<00:05:08.350> then<00:05:08.950> I'm<00:05:09.220> gonna<00:05:09.310> try<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.550> mix<00:05:09.790> it<00:05:09.970> up<00:05:11.520> hold

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
and then I'm gonna try to mix it up hold

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.430 
and then I'm gonna try to mix it up hold
this<00:05:14.100> here<00:05:15.100> so<00:05:16.060> I'm<00:05:16.150> gluing<00:05:16.450> this<00:05:17.020> down<00:05:17.410> like

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440

this here so I'm gluing this down like
that<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:18.720> i'm<00:05:19.720> not<00:05:19.870> even<00:05:20.139> paying<00:05:20.770> attention

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389
