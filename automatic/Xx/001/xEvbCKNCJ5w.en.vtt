00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
to me it's getting even better as it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.140 
to me it's getting even better as it
gets<00:02:48.720> over<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.160> way<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.310> maintain<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:51.000> I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
gets over and the way I maintain it I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.229 
gets over and the way I maintain it I
put<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> bonnet<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.260> night<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:54.000> kind

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
put a bonnet one at night and that kind

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.310 
put a bonnet one at night and that kind
of<00:02:54.299> like<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:55.640> condensed<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> curls<00:02:57.170> but<00:02:58.170> it

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
of like it condensed the curls but it

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.650 
of like it condensed the curls but it
doesn't<00:02:58.739> make<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:58.920> fuzzy<00:02:59.790> or<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.030> nasty-looking

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
doesn't make it fuzzy or a nasty-looking

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.500 
doesn't make it fuzzy or a nasty-looking
so<00:03:01.500> even<00:03:01.739> though<00:03:01.829> it<00:03:01.980> smashed<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:03.420> work

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
so even though it smashed in I can work

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.850 
so even though it smashed in I can work
