00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.430
 in our collection of over 7 5 tons 8h16 suffolk classic it 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.269
 is for people who want to learn 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 the guitarist a simple and effective way 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.160
 elsewhere agreements 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.750
 an agreement is a set of three minimum notes 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
 used to accompany songs on the edit menu 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.370
 by this method 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.010
 the chords are written as diagrams 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.890
 the diagram is a rating system that like the tablet on suggest that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.610
 the neck of the guitar 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.590
 unlike the tablet on the numbers written on the ropes with the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410
 number two should not be used 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.410
 the agreement of the major 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 the major gift agreement 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.040
 now the technique of arpeggios 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 as I explained to you at the beginning of this DVD 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.310
 to play the guitar there are two techniques 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.310
 finger technique 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 and the pick technique 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.840
 the technique of arpeggios is to play the notes of a chord 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.880
 after others with thumb index 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 the middle finger and the ring finger of the right hand 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.899
 let's talk about stilts 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.569
 he was trying to improve the adaptation of a piece 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.569
 the top of the g20 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.019
 I play the rope 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.089
 golden ouch 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:45.939
 and while he continues boarded 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.939
 second box 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.269
 the boon is an exit technique use his six body 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 it consists of playing from the first notes 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.579
 conference on the rope to reach our goal 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.229
 at worst we fight 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.009
 it is to this method 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.909
 thinking that three pieces in style 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.099
 but with the unions 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.319
 the manceau le banc 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.759
 with regard to both the wicket 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.099
 launch today 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.099
 he talks about his daily life 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.169
 with a little jazzy ballad of the world 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.399
 we will come back to it by Friday liddy
