really enjoyed this started with the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.700 
really enjoyed this started with the
original<00:02:14.310> poems<00:02:14.820> i<00:02:15.180> think<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:15.780> called<00:02:15.870> time

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
original poems i think it's called time

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.820 
original poems i think it's called time
years<00:02:17.070> remain<00:02:17.490> or<00:02:17.730> something<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.770> I

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
years remain or something and so I I

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.550 
years remain or something and so I I
wanted<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.030> look<00:02:21.180> another<00:02:21.720> way<00:02:21.990> not

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
wanted it to look another way not

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.200 
wanted it to look another way not
exactly<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.280> way<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.670> works<00:02:23.850> in<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
exactly the way that it works in the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.870 
exactly the way that it works in the
final<00:02:24.540> result<00:02:25.040> because<00:02:26.040> i<00:02:26.130> don't<00:02:26.370> have<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
final result because i don't have the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.530 
final result because i don't have the
Twilight<00:02:27.360> exact<00:02:28.020> point<00:02:28.790> but<00:02:29.790> what<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.270> wanted

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
Twilight exact point but what I wanted

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.260 
Twilight exact point but what I wanted
to<00:02:30.600> do<00:02:30.840> was<00:02:31.350> make<00:02:32.160> something<00:02:32.550> different<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.180> I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
to do was make something different and I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.890 
to do was make something different and I
didn't<00:02:33.540> want<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.780> download<00:02:34.170> any<00:02:35.420> any<00:02:36.420> farms

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
didn't want to download any any farms

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.320 
didn't want to download any any farms
because<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.470> would<00:02:37.680> be<00:02:37.830> illegal<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.060> had

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
because that would be illegal and I had

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.410 
because that would be illegal and I had
enough<00:02:39.890> problems<00:02:40.890> with<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.400> channel<00:02:41.940> about

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
enough problems with this channel about

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.900 
enough problems with this channel about
copyright<00:02:43.050> stuff<00:02:44.240> so<00:02:45.240> i<00:02:45.510> changed<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.680> font<00:02:47.070> to

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
copyright stuff so i changed the font to

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.320 
copyright stuff so i changed the font to
me<00:02:48.180> about<00:02:48.530> half<00:02:49.530> an<00:02:49.680> hour<00:02:50.000> because<00:02:51.000> i<00:02:51.270> never

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
me about half an hour because i never

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.140 
me about half an hour because i never
done<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.989> before<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:53.370> was<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.640> fun

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
done that before and it was a fun

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.420 
done that before and it was a fun
experiment<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:54.959> i<00:02:55.230> never<00:02:55.380> done<00:02:56.100> anything

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
experiment because i never done anything

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.840 
experiment because i never done anything
like<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:58.230> was<00:02:58.470> quite<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.370> challenge

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
like it so it was quite of a challenge

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.720 
like it so it was quite of a challenge
the<00:03:00.060> whole<00:03:00.270> work<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.650> might<00:03:01.860> sound<00:03:02.220> and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the whole work and it might sound and

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.000 
the whole work and it might sound and
look<00:03:03.300> very<00:03:04.170> easy<00:03:04.560> for<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:05.820> for<00:03:06.860> for<00:03:07.860> me

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
look very easy for you but for for me

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.360 
look very easy for you but for for me
i'm<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:08.820> really<00:03:09.269> experimented<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.950> i'm

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370

every<00:03:17.940> day<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.610> opportunity<00:03:21.269> I

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
every day and and this opportunity I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.770 
every day and and this opportunity I
wanted<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.700> make<00:03:23.700> something<00:03:23.940> different<00:03:24.540> and
