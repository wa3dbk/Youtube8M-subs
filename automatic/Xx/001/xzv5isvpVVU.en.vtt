00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.810
 jo people and wellcome to the winner video 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.769
 also 1000 subscribers special on the 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.440
 history channel yes there was this time 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.690
 first three skins to win or 3 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.330
 you could choose gifs 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.670
 if you want to have skins or chips and 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.290
 this time have mega many participated so 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.300
 we view this same again at 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.210
 but first I want to say that I 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.210
 So now three winners will draw 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.519
 and again one of them 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.079
 to move in if one of 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.820
 these winners do not report or 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.879
 I know of is deleted account 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.280
 maybe there not so 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.960
 i am in need of offshore then i will 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.999
 this one the one or the fourth 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.309
 which did not take off, so to speak 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.629
 replace those very yes would have 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.190
 then in the case luck the other had 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.929
 then bad luck if he does not answer 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.100
 if he does not write me back because 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.850
 I was actually the people always 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.510
 directly to 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.710
 and yes I explain now how fast 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.249
 it works the whole way it works 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.130
 run like the last choice you 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.860
 you have your withdrawal procedure 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.740
 in these these things registered 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.930
 this form and now i have here 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.549
 when I look at it all are now 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.119
 quasi results of this form 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.299
 nicely listed in the google drive 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:30.219
 document and the whole thing starts with the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:33.609
 number four at up here and ends at there 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:36.729
 down at 812 so one is right 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.460
 have mega many people want to find the 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.060
 I'm also cool that that's so good 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.679
 Arrives everything I say 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.630
 We're at the beginning if you do not 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.219
 yes, it should win 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.479
 probably the probability 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.250
 is pretty high that she does not win 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.929
 then it is so he still at the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.009
 next chance game the chance quasi 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.210
 has to win once again that is their 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.100
 you do not have to re-register 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.950
 the names always stay here yes the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.780
 this list and thus you have quasi 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.320
 always the chance in mystery skin too 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.299
 win 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.009
 I'm still thinking if I'm that 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.149
 continue to let it so you can do that 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.830
 yes, just the comment writer if 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.090
 I always leave the names in it 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.270
 should or should he at every win game 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.020
 an extreme or just another today 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.450
 logged in yes that could be the 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.470
 Write comments so that I still 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.620
 a very close had 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.480
 actually still there okay okay 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.550
 then I would say catch it now 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.130
 Just let me do this all over here 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.900
 now with the other point ag make 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.489
 means I'll be right at 4 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.769
 it starts I'm here now 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.910
 enter four 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:49.030
 and forget about it again 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:52.299
 which number cent exactly at the number 813 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.280
 okay that means real number 813 here 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.620
 come in because I generally clique then 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.989
 it will generate a random number and 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.870
 from between 4 and 8 113 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.010
 and that would be the first winner 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.310
 just caught is okay generally 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:19.989
 So that means I'm going to be here now 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:24.130
 Scroll up to 311 311 311 here 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.220
 The eleven euros per hd so if I have that 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.799
 not forgotten that way 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.930
 I'll do it all the same 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.579
 mourning with some gray color fill it up 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.370
 exactly 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:44.109
 pro hd it the first winner and 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.340
 Overall, the moment of the fifth faith 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.890
 I then have to go on this 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.430
 channel has already received or 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:56.319
 will be given so last second 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.709
 Winner 40 or relative is relative 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.709
 far above 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:08.840
 here 40 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:12.629
 lp lp lp the hd is the second winner 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.300
 lpd very cool congratulations 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.799
 the third winner was even there 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.660
 not likely the channel itself three skins 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:41.310
 losses but really crass even for 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:45.210
 me now 273 273 is exactly gentleman 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.760
 then hopefully Happy 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.020
 third winner 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.950
 so now I have a quick look if I 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.800
 it's just not that right 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.470
 that somehow also through that now 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.169
 somehow still discrepancies exist 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:09.210
 just up here is exactly the 40 was 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:13.400
 the 40 as well okay then now 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.450
 still the fourth so to speak the one of the 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.120
 used three is pushed if 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:24.169
 one of these three people themselves 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.169
 should not report that would be the 189th 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:48.620
 189 here 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:51.630
 that would be the puerta of such things exactly 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.410
 that's why it's set down now 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.690
 fast or 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.950
 bread because otherwise I'm the one 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:04.110
 messed up so really awesome you 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.510
 You are the one who pronounces something you are 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.849
 the one who would win a 10 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.580
 if one of the 30 does not report 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.279
 we will not hope for that, of course 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.599
 where you're probably hoping 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.909
 I also in a stall in any case 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.619
 and yes, in any case, we have the 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.449
 three winners i would have equal now 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.789
 I should always write the names out 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.490
 Fool 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:30.629
 that was right here was one of the 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.369
 Copy then was relatively high up 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:37.469
 pity that not one of 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:39.029
 a little further down, yes, that's not up 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:42.689
 in a number of something below 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:45.209
 but it is well there is still 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:46.979
 some games of chance on this channel 

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:49.379
 or others some mystery poison 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.419
 Raffles that's not us 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:53.339
 Just have a look or something 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:07:05.809
 I could still copy the last one 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:07:10.679
 red name from here exactly 

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:13.019
 50 to 100 while 502,000 at the next 

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:14.309
 with 2,500 subscribers be next 

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:17.159
 raffle again three failed 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.819
 then at 5,000 it will be six mystery 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:21.240
 give gifs 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:25.709
 at 10,000, there will be 20 at 5,050 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:29.669
 1040 and 100,000 100 are over 

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:32.009
 40,000 riot points that have to be there 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.629
 then be 49,000 paying the prices for 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:36.389
 raid teams initially raised or something like that 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:38.249
 are usually not raised so much 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:41.189
 a little bit will be a little bit more 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:42.169
 more expensive but we already do that 

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:45.899
 We'll manage 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:47.490
 well then i would say all the best and 

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:49.009
 Congratulations to the three 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.179
 winner
