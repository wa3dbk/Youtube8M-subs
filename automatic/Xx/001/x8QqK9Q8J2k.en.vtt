fourpence in caves and holes so if

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.209 
fourpence in caves and holes so if
you're<00:00:37.899> on<00:00:38.050> a<00:00:38.079> drifts<00:00:38.620> we'll<00:00:38.769> be<00:00:38.859> down<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.190> the

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
you're on a drifts we'll be down in the

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.819 
you're on a drifts we'll be down in the
current<00:00:39.670> you're<00:00:40.089> go<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.390> go<00:00:40.510> for<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.809> hole<00:00:41.469> or

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
current you're go and go for a hole or

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.229 
current you're go and go for a hole or
you<00:00:41.859> get<00:00:42.010> access<00:00:42.160> to<00:00:42.370> a<00:00:42.519> cave<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:42.969> turn<00:00:43.120> the

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
you get access to a cave you turn the

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.450 
you get access to a cave you turn the
torch<00:00:43.480> on<00:00:43.690> then<00:00:44.170> you<00:00:44.260> also<00:00:44.410> be<00:00:44.649> really<00:00:44.980> short

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
torch on then you also be really short

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.489 
torch on then you also be really short
and<00:00:45.579> maneuverable<00:00:46.239> so<00:00:46.719> if<00:00:46.899> you<00:00:47.019> go<00:00:47.170> after<00:00:47.230> that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.499 
and maneuverable so if you go after that

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.680 
and maneuverable so if you go after that
very<00:00:48.370> quickly<00:00:48.699> if<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.239> want<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.449> get<00:00:49.570> your

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
very quickly if you want to get your

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.720 
very quickly if you want to get your
shut<00:00:49.899> off<00:00:50.079> so<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.920> want<00:00:50.949> something<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:51.699> can

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
shut off so you want something you can

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.239 
shut off so you want something you can
basically<00:00:52.089> just<00:00:52.390> wave<00:00:52.629> around<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.859> that's<00:00:54.039> it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
basically just wave around and that's it

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:55.950 
basically just wave around and that's it
that's<00:00:54.519> where<00:00:54.789> you'd<00:00:54.940> use<00:00:55.149> your<00:00:55.659> very<00:00:55.809> short

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
that's where you'd use your very short

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.709 
that's where you'd use your very short
guns<00:00:56.489> available<00:00:57.489> should<00:00:57.819> a<00:00:57.879> monitor<00:00:58.420> machine

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
guns available should a monitor machine

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.560 
guns available should a monitor machine
good<00:00:58.929> for<00:00:59.409> the<00:00:59.530> small<00:01:00.460> confined<00:01:00.999> spaces<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
good for the small confined spaces and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.510 
good for the small confined spaces and
good<00:01:04.570> good<00:01:04.930> like<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.290> UK<00:01:05.710> traditionally<00:01:06.430> I'd

good good like the UK traditionally I'd
say<00:01:07.020> most<00:01:08.020> people<00:01:08.140> end<00:01:08.590> up<00:01:08.710> with<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:09.250> 70<00:01:10.150> 80<00:01:10.390> or

100 centimeter go you could go to a 120
no<00:02:22.310> problem<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> main<00:02:24.080> thing<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.290> you've

got the double bands you've got two 16
millimeter<00:02:26.870> bands<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.800> really<00:02:28.070> maximize<00:02:28.310> your

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
millimeter bands to really maximize your

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.330 
millimeter bands to really maximize your
firepower<00:02:29.480> capability<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.830> capitalize

on<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.610> extra<00:02:31.910> range<00:02:32.150> you're<00:02:32.330> going<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.510> gain

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
on the extra range you're going to gain

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.140 
on the extra range you're going to gain
from<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.770> always<00:02:33.890> do<00:02:34.130> rap<00:02:34.430> out<00:02:34.640> guns<00:02:34.910> as

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
from that we always do rap out guns as

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.610 
from that we always do rap out guns as
well<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:35.750> you've<00:02:35.870> got<00:02:35.990> maximum<00:02:36.350> firepower

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
well so you've got maximum firepower

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.890 
well so you've got maximum firepower
maximum<00:02:37.340> range<00:02:37.580> with<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.090> particular<00:02:38.660> setup

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
maximum range with this particular setup

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.180 
maximum range with this particular setup
we<00:02:39.140> also<00:02:39.709> increase<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.670> size<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> spirit

always a percent point five millimeter
because<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.230> find<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.100> high<00:02:52.370> caliber<00:02:52.730> spear

because I find the high caliber spear
it's<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.320> more<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.890> small<00:02:55.100> punch<00:02:55.430> when

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
it's this more of the small punch when

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
I've got with me right now but you would

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.479 
I've got with me right now but you would
normally<00:03:28.459> go<00:03:28.640> for<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:29.110> 140<00:03:30.110> to<00:03:30.260> 160

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489

normally go for a 140 to 160
I<00:03:31.549> prefer<00:03:32.360> 160<00:03:33.170> because<00:03:33.410> that's<00:03:33.650> just<00:03:34.209> maximum

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
I prefer 160 because that's just maximum

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.120 
I prefer 160 because that's just maximum
firepower<00:03:35.450> it's<00:03:36.049> like<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.200> cannon<00:03:36.709> under<00:03:36.950> water

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
firepower it's like a cannon under water

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.090 
firepower it's like a cannon under water
so<00:03:37.510> maximum<00:03:38.510> range<00:03:38.720> it's<00:03:39.200> absolutely<00:03:39.620> amazing

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
so maximum range it's absolutely amazing

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.160 
so maximum range it's absolutely amazing
but<00:03:40.430> yeah<00:03:40.549> anyway<00:03:40.730> this<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.209> 130<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:41.930> it's

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
but yeah anyway this is a 130 so it's

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.780 
but yeah anyway this is a 130 so it's
getting<00:03:42.380> into<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:42.799> kind<00:03:43.070> of<00:03:43.160> Bluewater

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
getting into that kind of Bluewater

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.490 
getting into that kind of Bluewater
