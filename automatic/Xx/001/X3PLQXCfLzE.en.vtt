00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
to see one yet you know this might be a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
to see one yet you know this might be a
genuine<00:01:56.880> oversight<00:01:57.329> also<00:01:57.689> sometimes<00:01:58.079> within

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
genuine oversight also sometimes within

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.510 
genuine oversight also sometimes within
the<00:01:58.409> government<00:01:58.770> circles<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.280> such

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the government circles you know such

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
the government circles you know such
oversights<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.180> done

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
oversights are done

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.780 
oversights are done
but<00:02:01.140> then<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.560> repeated<00:02:01.979> twice<00:02:02.490> over

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
but then if it's repeated twice over

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.580 
but then if it's repeated twice over
then<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> think<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.110> sort<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
then I think it can be sort of a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.490 
then I think it can be sort of a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.140 
are still game for some tempering but do
you<00:03:07.110> think<00:03:07.170> as<00:03:07.860> when<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.280> was<00:03:08.340> saying<00:03:08.580> Karthik<00:03:09.030> a

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
you think as when I was saying Karthik a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.720 
you think as when I was saying Karthik a
his<00:03:09.870> views<00:03:10.320> on<00:03:10.739> Republic<00:03:11.280> they<00:03:11.430> were<00:03:11.550> very

his views on Republic they were very

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.910 
his views on Republic they were very
strong<00:03:12.180> when<00:03:12.480> he<00:03:12.600> was<00:03:12.780> holding<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.410> Donna<00:03:13.739> as

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
strong when he was holding a Donna as

Chief Minister of Delhi last year

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.620 
Chief Minister of Delhi last year
sometime<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.280> think<00:03:17.489> perhaps<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:18.510> is

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
sometime do you think perhaps this is

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.870 
sometime do you think perhaps this is
also<00:03:18.900> where<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:19.860> is<00:03:20.010> emanating<00:03:20.640> from

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
also where this is emanating from

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.490 
also where this is emanating from
because<00:03:21.269> he<00:03:21.420> hasn't<00:03:21.720> been<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> biggest<00:03:22.230> fan

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
because he hasn't been the biggest fan

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.160 
because he hasn't been the biggest fan
of<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.830> public<00:03:23.130> day<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.820> know<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.510> ironical

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
of a public day you know it's ironical

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.470 
of a public day you know it's ironical
that<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.340> has<00:03:26.489> become<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.790> controversy

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
that this has become a controversy

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.390 
that this has become a controversy
because<00:03:27.959> he<00:03:28.290> showed<00:03:28.530> no<00:03:28.680> respect<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
because he showed no respect to the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.420 
because he showed no respect to the
parade<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:29.970> was<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.720> same<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.650> these<00:03:32.280> were

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
parade that was the same that these were

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.920 
parade that was the same that these were
the<00:03:32.549> reason<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.209> whole<00:03:33.239> area<00:03:33.630> needs<00:03:33.660> to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the reason that the whole area needs to

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.050 
the reason that the whole area needs to
be<00:03:34.019> sanitized<00:03:34.500> because<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.310> have<00:03:35.430> got<00:03:35.610> a
