all right first thing that changed the

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.439 
all right first thing that changed the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
you can't take out the tire you not be

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.670 
you can't take out the tire you not be
able<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.960> do<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.170> job

secondly you do this at any point in

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.410 
secondly you do this at any point in
time<00:00:11.179> but<00:00:12.179> your<00:00:12.360> ABS<00:00:12.780> wire<00:00:13.080> which<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.440> this

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
time but your ABS wire which is this

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.550 
time but your ABS wire which is this
secondly<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.540> your<00:00:15.630> ABS<00:00:15.960> wire<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.350> need<00:00:16.440> to

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
secondly is your ABS wire you need to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.640 
secondly is your ABS wire you need to
disconnect<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.630> start<00:00:18.630> pulling<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.050> up<00:00:19.289> to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
disconnect that start pulling that up to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.109 
disconnect that start pulling that up to
the<00:00:19.740> switch<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.160> there<00:00:20.340> get<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.550> all<00:00:20.880> loose

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
light is just flapping anyways since it

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
light is just flapping anyways since it
turned<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.140> dark<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> video<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
turned out dark in the video you take a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
turned out dark in the video you take a
screwdriver<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.539> something<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> tap<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
screwdriver or something and you tap it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
screwdriver or something and you tap it
kind<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.430> pry<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:07.170> doesn't<00:01:07.439> really

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
kind of pry it out it doesn't really

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.219 
kind of pry it out it doesn't really
come<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.100> simple<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> may<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.229> as

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
come out as simple as you may think as

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.929 
come out as simple as you may think as
you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:10.860> Mike<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.760> got

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
you can see right here Mike I got

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.190 
you can see right here Mike I got
damaged<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.540> bit<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
damaged a little bit so I'm going to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
damaged a little bit so I'm going to
have<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.590> round<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.299> before

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
have to round it out a little bit before

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.469 
have to round it out a little bit before
I<00:01:15.570> put<00:01:15.630> her<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.759> then<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.060> here

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
I put her back in then what you see here

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:31.700 
I put her back in then what you see here
I<00:01:18.509> believe<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> 13<00:01:19.860> mil<00:01:30.590> sometimes<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
I believe that is a 13 mil sometimes you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.899 
I believe that is a 13 mil sometimes you
get<00:01:31.799> rusted<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.310> pretty<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
get rusted off pretty good and you

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.030 
get rusted off pretty good and you
really<00:01:33.150> got<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> bang<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.750> off<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.829> not<00:01:34.979> on

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
really got to bang them off it's not on

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
really got to bang them off it's not on
the<00:01:35.130> backside<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> barrenness<00:01:36.060> four<00:01:36.390> bolts

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the backside of barrenness four bolts

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
the backside of barrenness four bolts
one<00:01:37.400> other<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:38.700> down<00:01:38.880> below<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:40.490> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
one other one right down below there on

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
one other one right down below there on
the<00:01:41.610> side<00:01:41.820> view<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the side view you can see one here and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.210 
the side view you can see one here and
one<00:01:44.189> there<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.390> identify<00:01:45.540> them<00:01:45.960> by<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
one there you can identify them by the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
one there you can identify them by the
bolt<00:01:47.220> end<00:01:47.490> sticking<00:01:47.820> out<00:01:48.119> from<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> front

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.320 

once<00:02:06.240> you're<00:02:06.390> broke<00:02:06.570> I'm<00:02:06.720> free<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:09.119> they

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
once you're broke I'm free then they

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:18.980 
once you're broke I'm free then they
should<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:10.370> easily<00:02:11.370> spin<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:18.750> in

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
should just easily spin out now in

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.360 
should just easily spin out now in
theory<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.440> bearing<00:02:19.709> should<00:02:19.770> just<00:02:19.980> pull<00:02:20.220> off

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
theory this bearing should just pull off

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.500 
theory this bearing should just pull off
the<00:02:20.580> front

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.350 

you<00:02:28.349> can<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:29.989> it's<00:02:30.989> kind<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:32.360> there

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
you can see it's kind of up there

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.830 
you can see it's kind of up there
we<00:02:33.480> go<00:02:37.610> now<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.879> see<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> shaft<00:02:39.450> where

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
we go now if you can see the shaft where

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.289 
we go now if you can see the shaft where
it's<00:02:39.930> been<00:02:40.049> blued<00:02:40.349> here<00:02:40.739> that's<00:02:41.730> not<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> good

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
it's been blued here that's not a good

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.360 
it's been blued here that's not a good
sign<00:02:42.540> at<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.049> means<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:44.099> these<00:02:44.250> little

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
sign at all that means that these little

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.270 
sign at all that means that these little
roller<00:02:44.700> bearings<00:02:45.180> inside<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.799> dry

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
roller bearings inside there really dry

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.000 
roller bearings inside there really dry
are<00:02:47.790> starting<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.360> fail<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.440> hot<00:02:49.709> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
are starting to fail and get hot and

bolts back in when putting the caliper
back<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.370> easy<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.669> put<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.849> couple

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
back on just as easy to put a couple

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.970 
back on just as easy to put a couple
nuts<00:03:39.419> on<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.900> rotor<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.290> hold<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.829> place

nuts on the rotor to hold it in place
while<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.669> assemble<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.200> yeah<00:03:43.200> make<00:03:43.380> sure<00:03:43.410> you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
while you assemble it yeah make sure you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.650 
while you assemble it yeah make sure you
run<00:03:43.950> your<00:03:44.160> ABS<00:03:44.669> line<00:03:44.910> back<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.389> way<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.599> came

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
run your ABS line back the way it came

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.440 
run your ABS line back the way it came
plug<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.769> up<00:03:46.950> top<00:03:47.160> where<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.120> meets<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
plug it in up top where it meets the

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.009 
plug it in up top where it meets the
other<00:03:48.780> plug<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.889> sensor<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:51.720> just

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
other plug for the sensor and I just

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.720 
other plug for the sensor and I just
added<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.440> couple<00:03:52.769> little<00:03:52.859> zip<00:03:53.160> ties<00:03:53.400> here

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
added a couple little zip ties here

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.800 
added a couple little zip ties here
because<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.209> aftermarket<00:03:55.730> bearing<00:03:56.810> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
because the aftermarket bearing the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.569 
because the aftermarket bearing the
connectors<00:03:58.650> don't<00:03:58.829> really<00:03:59.010> fit<00:03:59.250> well<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.519> the

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
connectors don't really fit well in the

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.460 
connectors don't really fit well in the
factored<00:04:00.000> holes<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.720> don't<00:04:01.109> want<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.319> wire

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
factored holes so I don't want the wire

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.020 
factored holes so I don't want the wire
coming<00:04:01.889> loose<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.400> wreck<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.819> that'll<00:04:02.970> be

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
coming loose and wreck it and that'll be

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.789 
coming loose and wreck it and that'll be
the<00:04:03.120> end<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.500> we're<00:04:04.650> done

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
the end of that so that's it we're done

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.110 
the end of that so that's it we're done
put<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.280> tire<00:04:05.459> back<00:04:05.609> on<00:04:07.489> yeah<00:04:08.549> experience

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
put the tire back on yeah experience

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.020

definitely<00:04:09.389> on<00:04:09.720> its<00:04:09.840> way<00:04:10.019> out<00:04:10.639> turn<00:04:11.639> is<00:04:11.760> pretty

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
definitely on its way out turn is pretty

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.210 
definitely on its way out turn is pretty
easy<00:04:12.590> kind<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.680> rough<00:04:13.889> in<00:04:14.069> sections<00:04:15.919> all<00:04:16.919> right

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
easy kind of rough in sections all right

easy kind of rough in sections all right
some<00:04:17.400> other<00:04:17.729> beer<00:04:18.030> time<00:04:18.299> now<00:04:23.419> I'm

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
some other beer time now I'm

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.969 
some other beer time now I'm
going<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.660> end<00:04:24.870> my<00:04:24.990> video<00:04:25.349> replacing<00:04:25.919> the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
going to end my video replacing the

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.779 
going to end my video replacing the
wheel<00:04:26.130> bearing<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:27.510> your<00:04:27.660> half<00:04:27.780> 150<00:04:28.550> 4x4<00:04:29.550> it's

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
wheel bearing on your half 150 4x4 it's

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.370 
wheel bearing on your half 150 4x4 it's
actually<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.120> pretty<00:04:30.300> easy<00:04:30.570> job<00:04:33.020> my<00:04:34.020> truck

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
actually a pretty easy job my truck

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.200 
actually a pretty easy job my truck
because<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.710> live<00:04:34.889> in<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.099> north<00:04:35.340> experiences

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
because I live in the north experiences

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.770 
because I live in the north experiences
a<00:04:36.240> lot<00:04:36.539> of<00:04:36.830> ice

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
a lot of ice

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.580 
a lot of ice
harsh<00:04:39.440> weather<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.270> rust<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:42.230> was<00:04:42.440> still

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
harsh weather and rust so I was still

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.190 
harsh weather and rust so I was still
able<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.860> get<00:04:42.980> it<00:04:43.100> off<00:04:43.220> without<00:04:43.370> issues<00:04:44.200> the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
able to get it off without issues the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.780 
able to get it off without issues the
only<00:04:45.230> reason<00:04:45.680> why<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:45.830> start<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.340> replace<00:04:46.550> the

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
only reason why I start to replace the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.940 
only reason why I start to replace the
wheel<00:04:46.910> bearing<00:04:47.330> is<00:04:47.450> because<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.230> vacuum<00:04:48.590> hub

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
wheel bearing is because the vacuum hub

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.100 
wheel bearing is because the vacuum hub
was<00:04:49.160> shot<00:04:49.460> so<00:04:50.240> if<00:04:50.390> I<00:04:50.510> have<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:50.690> take<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:50.990> that

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
was shot so if I have to take it that

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.540 
was shot so if I have to take it that
far<00:04:51.140> apart<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.740> might<00:04:51.920> as<00:04:51.980> well<00:04:52.010> just<00:04:52.220> replace

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
far apart I might as well just replace

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.950 
far apart I might as well just replace
the<00:04:52.700> hub<00:04:52.850> as<00:04:53.000> well<00:04:53.180> because<00:04:53.510> it's<00:04:53.660> got<00:04:53.810> almost

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
the hub as well because it's got almost

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.770 
the hub as well because it's got almost
200,000<00:04:54.830> kilometers<00:04:55.250> otherwise<00:04:56.090> normally

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
200,000 kilometers otherwise normally
