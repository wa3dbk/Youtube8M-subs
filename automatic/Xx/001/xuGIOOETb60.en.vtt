caps rather than black key caps black
key<00:00:44.700> caps<00:00:44.910> seemed<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.480> what's<00:00:46.410> cool<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
key caps seemed to be what's cool and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.810 
key caps seemed to be what's cool and
modern<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:49.820> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
know I guess they do look cool but the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.260 
know I guess they do look cool but the
problem<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.219> black<00:00:53.460> key<00:00:53.699> caps<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
problem I have with black key caps is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.770 
problem I have with black key caps is
they<00:00:54.690> tend<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.559> shiny<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:57.539> pretty

they tend to look shiny you know pretty

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.959 
they tend to look shiny you know pretty
quickly<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.739> terms<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.609> know<00:00:59.730> wear

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
quickly in terms of they you know wear

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.869 
quickly in terms of they you know wear
out<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:01.020> start<00:01:01.260> looking<00:01:01.350> shiny<00:01:01.879> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
out and they start looking shiny and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
out and they start looking shiny and
also<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.110> showed<00:01:04.439> us<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.890> stuff

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
also they just showed us and stuff

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679

easier<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.000> prefer<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> white<00:01:06.479> key

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689

you've<00:02:22.700> seen<00:02:22.850> my<00:02:23.000> prior<00:02:23.240> video<00:02:23.540> before<00:02:23.900> where

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
you've seen my prior video before where

see what that looks like and you know

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.460 
see what that looks like and you know
that's<00:02:29.330> certainly<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.870> easiest<00:02:30.170> simplest

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470

I sort of liked a little bit more of a
modern<00:02:33.770> look<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:36.200> know<00:02:36.320> but<00:02:36.470> still<00:02:36.739> have

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
the layout now even though it's a little

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.920 
the layout now even though it's a little
bit<00:02:49.790> different<00:02:50.120> than<00:02:50.330> most

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930

you<00:02:51.110> know<00:02:51.200> keyboards<00:02:51.739> I'm<00:02:52.160> also<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.670> like<00:02:52.910> the

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
you know keyboards I'm also I like the

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.800 
you know keyboards I'm also I like the
Mac<00:02:53.959> driver<00:02:54.350> on<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:55.190> has<00:02:55.519> some<00:02:56.239> things<00:02:56.690> that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
Mac driver on it it has some things that

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.979 
Mac driver on it it has some things that
are<00:02:56.959> very<00:02:57.140> specific<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.769> OS<00:02:58.100> 10<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.750> know<00:02:59.840> like

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
are very specific to OS 10 you know like

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.110 
are very specific to OS 10 you know like
it<00:03:00.410> has<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.739> volume<00:03:01.070> up<00:03:01.190> volume<00:03:01.220> down<00:03:01.580> mute

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
it has the volume up volume down mute

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.330 
it has the volume up volume down mute
eject<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.530> that's<00:03:03.680> kind<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:03.890> nice<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> do

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
eject so that's kind of nice and I do

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.130 
eject so that's kind of nice and I do
use<00:03:04.700> especially<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.570> volume<00:03:05.870> up<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.080> volume

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
use especially the volume up and volume

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.800 
use especially the volume up and volume
down<00:03:06.440> quite<00:03:07.160> often<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.090> it's<00:03:08.209> got<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> function

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
down quite often so it's got a function

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.449 
down quite often so it's got a function
layer<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.230> press<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.680> function<00:03:09.950> key<00:03:10.070> here

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
layer you press the function key here

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.750 
layer you press the function key here
and<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:12.140> can<00:03:12.290> use<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.650> in<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.550> little

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
and you can use that in just the little

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.069 
and you can use that in just the little
touches<00:03:13.940> like<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.390> kind<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:14.870> the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
touches like that I kind of like the

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.410 
touches like that I kind of like the
