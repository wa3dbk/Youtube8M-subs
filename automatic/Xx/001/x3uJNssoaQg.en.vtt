00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.089 

I<00:00:12.049> started<00:00:13.049> skiing<00:00:13.200> when<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.559> about<00:00:13.769> nine

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
I started skiing when I was about nine

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.250 
I started skiing when I was about nine
years<00:00:14.129> old<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:15.420> definitely<00:00:15.959> wasn't<00:00:16.110> a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
years old and I definitely wasn't a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.320 
years old and I definitely wasn't a
natural<00:00:16.439> took<00:00:17.010> me<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.189> long<00:00:17.400> time<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.939> figure

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
natural took me a long time to figure

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.870 
natural took me a long time to figure
out<00:00:18.630> how<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.349> get<00:00:19.890> any<00:00:20.070> sort<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.430> speed<00:00:20.669> because

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
out how to get any sort of speed because

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.390 
out how to get any sort of speed because
I<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> scrawny<00:00:21.900> rat<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.099> created

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
I was the scrawny rat and so I created

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.510 
I was the scrawny rat and so I created
my<00:00:23.580> own<00:00:23.700> technique<00:00:24.210> by<00:00:24.570> allying<00:00:25.560> out<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
my own technique by allying out of the

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.939 
my own technique by allying out of the
bull<00:00:26.730> then<00:00:27.029> grabbing<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.720> board<00:00:28.050> after<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
bull then grabbing my board after the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.800 
bull then grabbing my board after the
fact<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.430> that<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.939> something<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> no<00:00:30.689> one

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
fact and that was something that no one

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.990 
fact and that was something that no one
was<00:00:30.900> doing<00:00:31.140> yet<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.769> became<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.309> way<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.519> do

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
was doing yet that became the way to do

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.450 
was doing yet that became the way to do
air<00:00:33.180> once<00:00:34.019> I<00:00:34.140> started<00:00:34.470> doing<00:00:34.769> that<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
air once I started doing that so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.240 
air once I started doing that so
realizing<00:00:35.879> I<00:00:36.059> had<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:36.300> own<00:00:36.480> style<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.650> started

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
realizing I had my own style I started

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.509 
realizing I had my own style I started
trying<00:00:38.580> to<00:00:38.670> figure<00:00:38.790> out<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.210> tricks

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
trying to figure out how to do tricks

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.090 
trying to figure out how to do tricks
I've<00:00:41.519> tried<00:00:41.820> tricks<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.269> years<00:00:43.019> for<00:00:43.769> years

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
I've tried tricks for years for years

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.579 
I've tried tricks for years for years
until<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.089> made<00:00:45.360> one<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.809> sometimes<00:00:46.049> just<00:00:46.440> that

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
until I made one and sometimes just that

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.560 
until I made one and sometimes just that
one<00:00:46.830> that's<00:00:47.339> not<00:00:47.610> something<00:00:47.820> everyone<00:00:48.120> can

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
one that's not something everyone can

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.729 
one that's not something everyone can
say<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:49.080> have<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.409> sort<00:00:49.650> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
say that they have that sort of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.420 
say that they have that sort of
determination

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.689 

the<00:00:53.430> first<00:00:53.670> 900<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.239> ever<00:00:54.420> tried<00:00:54.720> was<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.699> 1988

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
and I just couldn't figure out how to

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.509 
and I just couldn't figure out how to
spin<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.409> couldn't<00:00:58.739> figure<00:00:58.830> how<00:00:58.979> to<00:00:59.040> commit<00:00:59.369> to

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
spin I couldn't figure how to commit to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
time was a barrel 720 I made it twice my

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.539 
time was a barrel 720 I made it twice my
was<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:32.969> only<00:01:33.119> plan<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.840> Verrill<00:01:34.200> 720<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
was my only plan was Verrill 720 and I

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.730 
was my only plan was Verrill 720 and I
made<00:01:35.789> that<00:01:35.969> pretty<00:01:36.509> early<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:37.109> I<00:01:37.140> made<00:01:37.469> it<00:01:37.590> like

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
made that pretty early on I made it like

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.319 
made that pretty early on I made it like
within<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> first<00:01:38.280> half<00:01:38.399> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> event<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
within the first half of the event and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.260 
within the first half of the event and
so<00:01:39.719> there<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.530> extra<00:01:41.159> time<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:42.240> else

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so there was this extra time what else

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
so there was this extra time what else
am<00:01:42.539> I<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.170> except<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:44.189> chase<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.980 
am I going to do except to chase this
trick<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.060> I've<00:01:45.149> been<00:01:45.270> chasing<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:45.719> almost

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990

shift<00:01:50.369> my<00:01:50.549> weight<00:01:50.579> mid<00:01:51.240> spin<00:01:51.600> maybe<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.469> can<00:01:52.679> fix

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.950 
trick that I've been chasing for so long
I'd<00:02:15.130> say<00:02:15.310> for<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.550> last<00:02:16.000> four<00:02:16.480> or<00:02:16.510> five

I'd say for the last four or five

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.930 
I'd say for the last four or five
attempts<00:02:17.410> at<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.650> event<00:02:17.920> or<00:02:18.130> ones<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.820> I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
attempts at that event or ones that I

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.760 
attempts at that event or ones that I
really<00:02:19.210> thought<00:02:19.390> we're<00:02:19.720> gonna<00:02:19.810> work<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.620> can

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
really thought we're gonna work you can

really thought we're gonna work you can
see<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.280> I've<00:02:21.400> seen<00:02:21.550> Atlanta<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.090> I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
see it you know I've seen Atlanta and I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.640 
see it you know I've seen Atlanta and I
shoot<00:02:22.450> out<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.110> haven't<00:02:23.290> figured<00:02:23.470> out

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
shoot out and I just haven't figured out

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.140 
shoot out and I just haven't figured out
how<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.920> adjust<00:02:24.430> from<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.700> landing

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.360 

when<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:28.989> finally<00:02:29.470> made<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.129> riding

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
when I finally made it and I was riding

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.850 
when I finally made it and I was riding
across<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.879> flat<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.629> still<00:02:32.349> kind<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.620> didn't

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
across the flat I still kind of didn't

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.830 
across the flat I still kind of didn't
believe<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.580> was<00:02:33.640> more<00:02:33.909> like<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.390> was

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
believe it it was more like that was

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.479 
believe it it was more like that was
that<00:02:34.989> really<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.409> well<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.010> night<00:02:36.220> like

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
that really it well is that a night like

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.160 
that really it well is that a night like
that<00:02:36.519> was<00:02:36.879> that<00:02:37.150> was<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> nine<00:02:37.480> hundred<00:02:37.629> and<00:02:37.930> it

that was that was a nine hundred and it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.009 
that was that was a nine hundred and it
wasn't<00:02:38.379> until<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.709> looked<00:02:39.099> up<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.549> saw<00:02:40.019> the

see me sort of force the pump and and to
be<00:03:08.590> honest<00:03:08.829> I<00:03:08.950> didn't<00:03:09.129> think<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.370> would<00:03:09.489> be

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
be honest I didn't think that would be

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.520 
be honest I didn't think that would be
the<00:03:09.609> one<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:10.060> fact<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.390> something<00:03:11.260> didn't

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
the one the fact that something didn't

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.960 
the one the fact that something didn't
go<00:03:11.650> exactly<00:03:12.099> right

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
go exactly right

sometimes that disrupts your thinking

my competition run around that time and

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.949 
my competition run around that time and
that<00:03:29.709> gave<00:03:30.099> me<00:03:30.129> the<00:03:30.340> validation<00:03:30.879> to<00:03:31.239> Sacopee

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
that gave me the validation to Sacopee

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.970 
that gave me the validation to Sacopee
it<00:03:32.889> was<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.669> perfect<00:03:33.849> exit<00:03:34.980> it's
