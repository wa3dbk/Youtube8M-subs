looking at the albatross see that it's a

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:26.210 
looking at the albatross see that it's a
big<00:00:18.330> steep<00:00:19.109> angle<00:00:21.199> and<00:00:22.199> back<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.470> up<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:26.070> can

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
big steep angle and back that up you can

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.510 
big steep angle and back that up you can
see<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.550> there

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.830 

see<00:00:31.150> that<00:00:31.360> and<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.750> problem<00:00:31.930> with<00:00:32.170> mine<00:00:32.380> is

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
see that and the problem with mine is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.750 
see that and the problem with mine is
it's<00:00:34.840> flat<00:00:35.230> on<00:00:35.560> the<00:00:35.740> locking<00:00:35.950> bar<00:00:36.340> and<00:00:36.640> it's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
it's flat on the locking bar and it's

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.190 
it's flat on the locking bar and it's
flat<00:00:37.000> at<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.270> beginning<00:00:37.630> of<00:00:37.870> it<00:00:38.400> but<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.780> but

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
flat at the beginning of it but so but

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.310 
flat at the beginning of it but so but
it's<00:00:41.350> not<00:00:41.530> actually<00:00:41.890> touching<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:44.170> only

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
it's not actually touching and the only

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.530 
it's not actually touching and the only
time<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.890> locks<00:00:45.280> up<00:00:45.520> is<00:00:45.730> when<00:00:45.880> I<00:00:45.910> push<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.390> in

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
time it locks up is when I push it in

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.960 
time it locks up is when I push it in
because<00:00:47.379> I'm<00:00:47.620> pushing<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.129> into<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.550> steep

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
because I'm pushing it into that steep

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:56.190 
because I'm pushing it into that steep
angle<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:54.309> here's<00:00:54.940> how<00:00:55.030> they<00:00:55.809> should<00:00:55.870> have

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
angle now here's how they should have

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.170 
angle now here's how they should have
made<00:00:56.379> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.840

barely<00:01:10.780> an<00:01:10.899> angle<00:01:11.289> just<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.710> slight<00:01:12.009> angle<00:01:14.460> see

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
barely an angle just a slight angle see

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.450 
barely an angle just a slight angle see
that<00:01:18.689> look<00:01:19.689> at<00:01:19.810> that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460

this is how it should have been and no
Bray<00:01:27.670> play<00:01:27.940> at<00:01:28.060> all<00:01:28.210> locks<00:01:28.990> up<00:01:29.229> solid

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.330 

and<00:01:39.580> on<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.270> albatross<00:01:40.980> they<00:01:41.980> could<00:01:42.220> have

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
and on the albatross they could have

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.480 
and on the albatross they could have
made<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.930> locking<00:01:44.800> bought<00:01:44.980> a<00:01:45.010> little<00:01:45.370> bit

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
made the locking bought a little bit

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.550 
made the locking bought a little bit
taller<00:01:45.730> which<00:01:46.480> would<00:01:46.720> took<00:01:46.960> away<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.320> play

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
taller which would took away the play

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.890 
taller which would took away the play
and<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:47.950> would<00:01:48.040> have<00:01:48.160> walked<00:01:48.310> up<00:01:48.520> early<00:01:48.880> but<00:01:49.720> as

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
and it would have walked up early but as

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.840 
and it would have walked up early but as
it<00:01:50.110> would<00:01:50.260> have<00:01:50.290> wore<00:01:50.560> down<00:01:50.830> eventually<00:01:51.550> it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
it would have wore down eventually it

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it would have wore down eventually it
would<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.450> would<00:01:52.510> have<00:01:52.720> got<00:01:52.870> play<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.690> as<00:01:55.690> long

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
would it would have got play so as long

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.770 
would it would have got play so as long
as<00:01:56.050> this<00:01:56.200> blade<00:01:56.710> tangas<00:01:57.100> cut<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.520> way<00:01:57.780> it's

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
as this blade tangas cut that way it's

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.710 
as this blade tangas cut that way it's
going<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.170> get<00:01:59.260> play<00:01:59.530> eventually<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:01.570> won't

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
going to get play eventually it won't

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.520 
going to get play eventually it won't
fail<00:02:02.080> on<00:02:02.380> me<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:03.070> don't<00:02:03.820> think<00:02:04.120> so<00:02:04.990> it's<00:02:05.350> not<00:02:05.470> a
