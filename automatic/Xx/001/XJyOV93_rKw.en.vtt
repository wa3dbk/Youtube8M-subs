00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
nice so I have my production sample here

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.069 
nice so I have my production sample here
this<00:04:00.030> should<00:04:00.239> change<00:04:00.540> when<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.810> hits<00:04:00.959> the

gonna be a cool core lining now which is

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.259 
gonna be a cool core lining now which is
one<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.709> big<00:04:07.829> upgrades<00:04:08.310> over<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.639> 1100<00:04:09.120> so

comfort liner here - snaps along the
occipital<00:04:51.660> Ridge<00:04:52.020> right<00:04:52.500> there<00:04:52.560> along<00:04:52.919> the

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
occipital Ridge right there along the

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.350 
occipital Ridge right there along the
back<00:04:53.160> of<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.370> helmet<00:04:53.520> right<00:04:53.639> once<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.210> that

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
back of the helmet right once you that

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.879 
back of the helmet right once you that
pops<00:04:54.569> right<00:04:54.690> out<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:54.990> if<00:04:55.470> we<00:04:55.560> move<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.860> the

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
pops right out and if we move to the

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:56.809 
pops right out and if we move to the
front<00:04:56.190> one<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.400> things<00:04:56.550> that<00:04:56.639> I<00:04:56.699> actually

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
front one of the things that I actually

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.490 
front one of the things that I actually
like<00:04:57.210> it<00:04:57.660> might<00:04:57.840> make<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.169> little<00:04:58.349> bit

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
like it might make it a little bit

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.350 
like it might make it a little bit
harder<00:04:58.770> for<00:04:58.919> me<00:04:59.009> to<00:04:59.039> get<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.370> out<00:04:59.520> but<00:05:00.240> they

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
harder for me to get it out but they

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.149 
harder for me to get it out but they
optimized<00:05:00.960> for<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:01.289> lack<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.500> pressure<00:05:01.830> point

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
optimized for a lack of pressure point

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.520 
optimized for a lack of pressure point
so<00:05:02.280> what<00:05:02.400> you're<00:05:02.490> gonna<00:05:02.550> see<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.720> there

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
so what you're gonna see is that there

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.499 
so what you're gonna see is that there
are<00:05:04.650> three<00:05:04.979> snaps<00:05:05.310> along<00:05:05.819> the<00:05:05.970> brow<00:05:06.210> that

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
are three snaps along the brow that

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.719 
are three snaps along the brow that
aren't<00:05:06.810> actually<00:05:07.229> in<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.650> helmet<00:05:08.009> or<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.550> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
aren't actually in the helmet or in the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.550 
aren't actually in the helmet or in the
liner<00:05:08.970> itself<00:05:09.210> they're<00:05:09.659> along<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:09.990> front<00:05:10.259> so

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
liner itself they're along the front so

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.230 
liner itself they're along the front so
you<00:05:10.620> have<00:05:10.740> no<00:05:11.009> far<00:05:11.370> head<00:05:11.550> pressure<00:05:11.789> points<00:05:12.150> and

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
you have no far head pressure points and

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.180 
you have no far head pressure points and
if<00:05:12.300> we<00:05:12.389> notice<00:05:12.539> mixture<00:05:13.199> of<00:05:13.289> materials<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.889> 3d

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
if we notice mixture of materials the 3d

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.920 
if we notice mixture of materials the 3d
in<00:05:14.280> there<00:05:14.400> construction<00:05:14.940> good<00:05:15.360> channels<00:05:15.780> for

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
in there construction good channels for

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.480 
in there construction good channels for
air<00:05:16.050> ventilation<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.740> again<00:05:17.130> you're<00:05:17.280> getting

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
air ventilation and again you're getting

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.309 
air ventilation and again you're getting
that<00:05:17.580> cool<00:05:17.789> core<00:05:18.000> liner<00:05:18.210> which<00:05:18.569> is<00:05:18.810> going<00:05:19.229> to

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
that cool core liner which is going to

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.110 
that cool core liner which is going to
