00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
some something to hold the ring I'll

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
some something to hold the ring I'll
have<00:01:00.359> somebody<00:01:00.600> else<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> hold<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
with the pliers and the real hole here

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.109 
with the pliers and the real hole here
make<00:01:07.290> sure<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.650> don't<00:01:07.830> drill<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> too<00:01:08.340> hard<00:01:08.580> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
make sure you don't drill it too hard so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.300 
make sure you don't drill it too hard so
you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.360> break<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> socket<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.130> nice

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you can break the socket just a nice

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.200 
you can break the socket just a nice
hole<00:01:12.290> big<00:01:13.290> enough<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.790> with

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
hole big enough so you can do this with

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.940 
hole big enough so you can do this with
a<00:01:15.240> spark<00:01:15.570> plug

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
a spark plug

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.210 
a spark plug
you<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.100> my<00:01:17.250> headers<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.180> spark<00:01:18.509> plug

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
you are my headers in my spark plug

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.870 
you are my headers in my spark plug
right<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:21.799> in<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.070> situation<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.729> this

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
right there in a situation like this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.530 
right there in a situation like this
some<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> sockets<00:01:25.200> cannot<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> there

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
some of the sockets cannot go in there

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.940 
some of the sockets cannot go in there
Fitzer<00:01:27.540> too<00:01:27.780> big<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:28.920> right

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
Fitzer too big but with this one right

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
Fitzer too big but with this one right
here<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:33.799> poke<00:01:35.119> see<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
here you can go like this poke see the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.830 
here you can go like this poke see the
hole<00:01:37.320> needs<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.829> big<00:01:38.130> enough<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
hole needs to be big enough so the the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.410 
hole needs to be big enough so the the
range<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.439> go<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> spot<00:01:42.030> block<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
range can go in and the spot block and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.219 
range can go in and the spot block and
come<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
be changing them to other plugs and for

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.260 
be changing them to other plugs and for
this<00:01:55.259> time<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.520> favorite<00:01:57.060> wrench

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
can put it right on the top as well see

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.699 
can put it right on the top as well see
and<00:02:47.640> use<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> range<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.870> any<00:02:49.140> kind<00:02:49.440> until<00:02:49.530> you

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
and use a range of any kind until you

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.740 
and use a range of any kind until you
one<00:02:51.350> like<00:02:52.350> any<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.770> these<00:02:52.890> wrenches<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.790> prefer
