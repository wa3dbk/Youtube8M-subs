00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:06.770
 So all the young people here are new to FileMaker One 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.159
 Gameplay from scratch is the UCI polemic on 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:13.179
 from South Tyrol ots 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.659
 just the last one so always Esther Schouten 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:18.900
 and animal have do pulls again 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.890
 but a little different this time because lately plays like me now 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.739
 she will take me on this 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.499
 Burns percent 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.439
 he's been stirring me lately 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.440
 pretty often about this game 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.930
 if it is up to me 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.550
 a lot of fun 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.220
 everything goes with their worries said both are always a black one 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.570
 Screen and 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.570
 fatal error 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.300
 Of course, already percent 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 are printed on the net and with her 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.019
 already after 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.010
 now found so 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.180
 but 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.520
 did not help me and 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.780
 always the same 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.180
 the end of the game Vareler 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.970
 It works fine, I am satisfied 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.920
 I want to present you here and there it happens again after one 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.170
 While black screen fatal error 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.210
 then I have to get out of the game again 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.640
 start frequently 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 and after a while the same again 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.560
 I do not know with every dive then maybe I could understand how 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 very much the one on the table 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.480
 Of course, who knows many more videos uploaded by Black Ops 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.570
 but before that has avenged that in the market last game some of you 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.240
 they've still heard they've heard 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 nevertheless quite so successful director Todd Phillips 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.490
 and with me is just the leaks discovered 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.600
 but just percent 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.530
 these mistakes this 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 the fatal mistake 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.070
 there is not any more everything has a nerve you know mine 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.030
 previous as it already going on 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.270
 Dorsten 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.279
 only that they also like to know what you shipyards 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.049
 at the games 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.309
 it is too 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:15.389
 Ubert for example 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.680
 the me on the bag I do not like my face so many 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:20.299
 bahrain 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.810
 because the two years required 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.369
 on the 2nd 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.659
 but I've been detonated here a few times already 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.389
 or 8 points we have 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.219
 Fighter too far 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:35.609
 he won 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.579
 Half year, I believe everyone in Vienna first 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.579
 or what but that was synonymous in my videos 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.049
 the people 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.389
 mostly lying on the floor 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.889
 Percent 4 8 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.249
 he also calls the years and percent of some of you as well 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:55.249
 it was really interested in stopping what they think about it 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.489
 same way 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.019
 We have certainly commented on the plans here but meanwhile that is 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.139
 use 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.260
 after being sure 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
 Mr. Winter has 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.249
 just like that 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.469
 or that's why 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.959
 what about percent Modern Warfare 13 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.649
 as far as I know that a ski flying this year also appear 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.299
 would you and buy it Mayor Dr 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.229
 the numerous mistakes 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.229
 Percent rather not 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.309
 as well as 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:38.189
 Would you look if they buy again 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.449
 No 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.709
 after all the trouble you had with the game and celebrate after 1 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.999
 around 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.749
 Certainly, some of you definitely do not buy the opinion any more 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.489
 everyone needs 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.769
 I had to say 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.579
 Bern, I've become smarter 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.169
 I would buy Black Ops again because 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.169
 despite all the mistakes and and despite all the trouble 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.929
 playful scary I really like to say 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.349
 the already annoyed after the black screens and skim 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.399
 restarted shortly thereafter, although not actually 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:18.310
 and I could imagine that in some of you Erk too 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.729
 went 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.259
 So the factual and Black Ops normal or on animal hides Modern 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.110
 Warfare 3 mln 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.110
 we have to continue now 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.309
 currently running anyway 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.789
 and same for the allegations 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.529
 there again 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:47.539
 May in% 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.729
 hear his laugh cured 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.090
 I hope he does 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.400
 his book can always be kept in the middle of the castle 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.059
 now is wearing glasses 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.240
 Polenz percent 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.290
 it would be a possibility if now for the rest of the 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.909
 Zeitz work out 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.789
 In any case, I had one in the valid daily votes if so too 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.789
 pointed out 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:26.780
 then I want to say 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.990
 Venter liked Simons in the next video 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.030
 otherwise stop at the other gameplay or let's play IT 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.400
 So see you soon 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.550
 8th 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.520
 Nolle 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.520
 I'll shut up now 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.319
 No 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.050
 more 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.050
 May 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.949
 the 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.759
 he 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.809
 r 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.809
 he has 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:56.360
 Mannheim 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.250
 Heidenheim
