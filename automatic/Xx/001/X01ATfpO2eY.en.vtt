rotator<00:02:23.090> body<00:02:23.360> position<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:24.770> hook<00:02:25.070> up

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
rotator body position and then hook up

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.210 
rotator body position and then hook up
top<00:02:25.600> gotta<00:02:26.600> have<00:02:26.750> positioning<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:28.010> can

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
top gotta have positioning and I can

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.830 
top gotta have positioning and I can
relate<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.640> surfing<00:02:29.210> if<00:02:29.390> you're<00:02:29.570> not<00:02:29.720> in
