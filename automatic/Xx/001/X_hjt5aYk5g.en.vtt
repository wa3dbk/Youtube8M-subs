 Ability to output when needed but unfortunately also 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.280
 Development did not go well 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.360
 In it because He has a nostalgia to Japan 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.340
 And so far in the way to training 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 It has been determined that there is a long time ago, but if you train in Japan, you will get results

 If necessary, we formally ask the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.990
 And finally, if you hit with you from the world 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.100
 The theme may disappear 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:39.130
 There are people who were taken away once that way of cutting 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.470
 I was surprised to see a hit or heard and fell down or something like that including a mess 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.560
 Even if you sing or sing 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.010
 1 What Kana as say nice person I Do It If you think is to also care 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.280
 Well, if you say that it is very American-like, it is until then 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.850
 Anyway, I'm sure I'm just brainwashing 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.340
 And I say that it is supposed to cause it 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.860
 I came out to the Yeah firmly asked whether in that synchronized swimming Ah advice and UEmi 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.670
 I got in the only disciple of 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.270
 Well then this time one of that important reference person 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.130
 Possible One day had to wind Ayano Fukuda of mimicry to 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:22.670
 What started in the interview what Haruka Ayase Takeuchi Yuko 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.880
 In your politely to Yuko Takeuchi and at the time of the resurrection movie and when Haruka Ayase is the drama's 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.500
 Bgm theme 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.840
 2 specs but at first I thought I was only playing a game 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:39.100
 Somehow it looks like ants getting anything 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:45.010
 In anyway this time of the biggest surprise is that it was know 9:00 20 in the broadcast start moving down 20 minutes 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.640
 That's not to say that there was a broadcast of men's volleyball separately, but it was shifted from the beginning 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.740
 By 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:55.040
 So what the hell is that for what it is with the Football World Cup final qualifying Oman match 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:01.820
 In order to avoid unreasonable, the other side is live broadcasted by tele morning 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:04.310
 The match started there in 4 people that the time it ends almost if Since 7:30 9:20 game 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:11.730
 After all it is this to say 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:17.099
 I want to improve the ratings even if there is a good request from Johnny's Side 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:20.370
 And of course it is expected to struggle if it comes to the back of the World Cup 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:26.940
 You hear whether there is no What a Kachiawa not way 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:29.580
 The result is a 20-minute smell Moreover Tteyuu this is true emergency organized in deferred is Stink, etc. 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.750
 In order of moving down 20 minutes 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.840
 The third super color before that 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:40.870
 Both the old TV and the hit future are slightly enlarged by 10 minutes 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.950
 Making a program with 10 minutes of expansion 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.310
 That is not to say that I was recording, it was suddenly said from Heisei 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:55.340
 I guess I managed to add 10 minutes for editing 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:57.530
 In some cases it says somehow 10 minutes + Ette despite not end all of the editing 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.640
 Maybe there was a top down 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.090
 It is why was the hard work 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:09.730
 Well normal To maintain the ratings of one drama 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:14.890
 It is that Tteyuu re-urgent fiscal Up to this point it but it'm a Well unusual things 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:18.519
 After all, saying that it is squeezed out is the strength of Johnny's 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:23.070
 It's fine, Padpaddle also did something like variety. 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:28.000
 Well, the result is that football has an average rating 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:34.540
 31.1 The moment high is 9:00 pm 36.6 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.880
 After all , it is certain that the ball was crushed when it is played with homage, and the one who hits is the seventh episode before that 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.740
 of 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:46.010
 Episode 8 is 14.7% up from 13.5 % 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:49.370
 The side of the hit is strikingly fit, and the soccer resemblance is well managed 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:54.950
 Cladding was of the nhk drama Kiyomori 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:05:00.740
 The Kanto area was 11.0 but it is 9.2% in the Kansai area 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:04.020
 audience in the Kansai of nhk Taiga drama is at an extremely unusual for the Tteyuu an order of magnitude 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.230
 What the first time in January 1994 or later 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.890
 It's tough 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:14.630
 It is useless and yan seen live not after all I Sports 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.500
 It doesn't mean that I'm going to try to record, but if I go through recording , I 'll record the drama 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.110
 Nde put away 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:24.470
 Well, it's really good to say that it's 20 minutes down like this, but this one 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.220
 It is from now on that it becomes the whole country 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.960
 For example, the other way of smap 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:34.480
 Such if there are things like the time was also of so ever in any one of the starring drama 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:40.120
 What a very If you do not go to be dominated flexibility 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:45.400
 If Well But is properly yet been asked to become the leading role the numbers I still Torere Well it 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.540
 It may not have to be said that, but the person who received the program that is right now is done 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.620
 It is said that 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:55.410
 Oh 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.410
