00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
on the same time which was a little bit

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.120 
on the same time which was a little bit
nerve-wracking<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.680> know<00:00:28.830> there<00:00:29.070> would

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
nerve-wracking but you know there would

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580 
nerve-wracking but you know there would
be<00:00:29.189> okay<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.480> us<00:00:30.570> got<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.990> license<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
be okay if one of us got the license and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.400 
be okay if one of us got the license and
one<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.830> us<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> us<00:00:32.700> didn't<00:00:33.149> because<00:00:33.540> like

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
one of us one of us didn't because like

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.069 
one of us one of us didn't because like
the<00:00:34.559> probability<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> both<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.700> us<00:00:36.079> getting

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the probability of both of us getting

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.830 
the probability of both of us getting
our<00:00:37.290> license<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.829> passing<00:00:38.430> wasn't<00:00:39.300> huge

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
our license in passing wasn't huge

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.110 
our license in passing wasn't huge
because<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.410> think<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.129> about<00:00:41.640> fifty<00:00:42.090> percent

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
because I think like about fifty percent

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.310 
because I think like about fifty percent
of<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.950> Swedish<00:00:44.579> people<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.690> Sweden<00:00:46.110> who
