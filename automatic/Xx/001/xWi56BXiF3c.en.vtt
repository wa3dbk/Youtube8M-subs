00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
that's his room this is my room earlier

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.240 
that's his room this is my room earlier
he<00:02:36.300> put<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.500> didn't<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.710> he<00:02:38.040> still

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
he put it like you didn't know he still

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.920 
he put it like you didn't know he still
doesn't<00:02:38.430> know<00:02:38.580> obviously<00:02:38.820> how<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.510> take<00:02:39.900> down

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
doesn't know obviously how to take down

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.650 
doesn't know obviously how to take down
the<00:02:40.290> sign<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.740> change<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.360> which<00:02:42.360> probably

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
the sign and change it which probably

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.210 
the sign and change it which probably
now<00:02:42.960> knows<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.290> he<00:02:43.590> has<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.800> take<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.070> down

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
now knows that he has to take it down

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.360 
now knows that he has to take it down
but<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.720> retaliation<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.040> inside

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
but in retaliation to that one inside

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.070 
but in retaliation to that one inside
you<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:47.940> put<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> sign<00:02:48.390> here<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.720> had<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
you just put a sign here that had a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.470 
you just put a sign here that had a
penis<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.800> or<00:02:49.980> makeshift<00:02:50.490> penis<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.030> was

learning<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.470> problem<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.070> video

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
learning this problem this video

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.980 
learning this problem this video
probably<00:03:08.610> might<00:03:09.060> not<00:03:09.180> even<00:03:09.300> make<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.510> YouTube

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
probably might not even make it YouTube

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.080 
probably might not even make it YouTube
because<00:03:10.170> i'm<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.380> noob<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:11.430> if<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.850> does

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
because i'm a noob but if it does

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.710 
because i'm a noob but if it does
hopefully<00:03:12.960> it's<00:03:13.290> an<00:03:13.350> HDD<00:03:14.360> alrighty<00:03:15.360> well<00:03:15.600> we

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
hopefully it's an HDD alrighty well we

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.449 
hopefully it's an HDD alrighty well we
really<00:03:16.110> want<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.410> make<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.680> super<00:03:17.250> short

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
really want to make this super short

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.270 
really want to make this super short
because<00:03:17.700> our<00:03:18.030> last<00:03:18.470> attempt<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.739> was<00:03:19.920> 60

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
because our last attempt at this was 60

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.820 
because our last attempt at this was 60
minutes<00:03:20.550> long<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.000> we<00:03:21.420> felt<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.560> first

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
minutes long and we felt like the first

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.340 
minutes long and we felt like the first
60<00:03:23.489> minutes<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.850> way<00:03:24.000> too<00:03:24.060> long<00:03:24.360> for<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:25.230> an

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
60 minutes is way too long for just an

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.190 
60 minutes is way too long for just an
initial<00:03:25.560> video<00:03:26.010> saying<00:03:26.370> hey<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.810> future

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
initial video saying hey in the future

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.110 
initial video saying hey in the future
and<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.650> next<00:03:28.830> day<00:03:29.100> we're<00:03:29.790> going<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:29.970> make

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
and the next day we're going to make

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.540
