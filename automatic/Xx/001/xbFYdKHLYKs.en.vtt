was<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.690> over<00:02:54.959> 1,100<00:02:55.530> pounds<00:02:55.650> how<00:02:56.519> does<00:02:56.670> that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
was just over 1,100 pounds how does that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
was just over 1,100 pounds how does that
rank<00:02:57.030> compared<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.660> past<00:02:57.810> years<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.590> about

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
rank compared to past years it's about

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.220 
rank compared to past years it's about
normal<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.760> see<00:03:00.030> about<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.540> same<00:03:00.870> range

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
normal we see about that same range

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.680 
normal we see about that same range
occasionally<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.280> last<00:03:02.640> year<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.450> had<00:03:03.660> one

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
occasionally like last year we had one

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.830 
occasionally like last year we had one
that<00:03:03.989> went<00:03:04.200> over<00:03:04.290> 1,300<00:03:05.160> pounds<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.630> any

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
that went over 1,300 pounds so on any

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.229 
that went over 1,300 pounds so on any
given<00:03:06.930> year<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:07.650> as<00:03:07.830> everybody<00:03:08.459> knows<00:03:08.819> feed

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
given year but as everybody knows feed

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.420 
given year but as everybody knows feed
cost<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.750> little<00:03:10.019> higher<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.410> year<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.920> these

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
cost is little higher this year so these

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.130 
cost is little higher this year so these
boards<00:03:11.880> probably<00:03:12.209> didn't<00:03:12.450> get<00:03:12.569> as<00:03:12.660> much<00:03:12.690> seed

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
boards probably didn't get as much seed

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.780 
boards probably didn't get as much seed
as<00:03:13.290> they<00:03:13.410> would<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.769> normal<00:03:13.830> year<00:03:14.190> we've<00:03:14.550> got

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
gotta have something to start with and

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.759 
gotta have something to start with and
then<00:04:09.150> got<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.989> feed<00:04:10.139> them<00:04:10.230> right<00:04:10.380> when<00:04:10.709> you

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
then got to feed them right when you

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.459 
then got to feed them right when you
decide<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.190> bring<00:04:11.310> them<00:04:11.430> down
