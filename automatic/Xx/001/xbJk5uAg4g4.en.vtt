happens it's connected to a display I've

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
happens it's connected to a display I've
got<00:00:22.320> keyboard<00:00:22.740> masks<00:00:23.130> everything<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.850> let's

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
got keyboard masks everything so let's

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:34.360 
got keyboard masks everything so let's
see<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.660> happens

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
idea what the cd-rom is but it too is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.080 
idea what the cd-rom is but it too is
quite<00:01:09.950> twisted<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.610> damaged<00:01:12.729> still<00:01:13.729> eject

assistance<00:01:21.399> whoops<00:01:22.399> I<00:01:22.880> think<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.179> power

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
assistance whoops I think the power

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.260 
assistance whoops I think the power
supply<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:23.869> going<00:01:25.119> yeah<00:01:26.119> it's<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.360> capacitor

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
supply is going yeah it's a capacitor

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.410 
supply is going yeah it's a capacitor
that's<00:01:29.270> definitely<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.690> capacitor<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:34.420> pewter

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
that's definitely a capacitor and pewter

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.230 
that's definitely a capacitor and pewter
