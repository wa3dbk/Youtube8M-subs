binding<00:00:19.750> wanted<00:00:20.410> to<00:00:20.500> just<00:00:20.680> show<00:00:20.890> you<00:00:20.920> kind<00:00:21.850> of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
binding wanted to just show you kind of

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.210 
binding wanted to just show you kind of
where<00:00:22.119> we've<00:00:22.270> came<00:00:22.539> from<00:00:22.840> this<00:00:23.830> is<00:00:23.980> going<00:00:24.160> to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
where we've came from this is going to

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.310 
where we've came from this is going to
be<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:25.270> ignition<00:00:25.750> to<00:00:26.110> which<00:00:26.860> was<00:00:27.190> there<00:00:27.580> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
be the ignition to which was there I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.779 
be the ignition to which was there I
guess<00:00:29.320> second<00:00:29.740> version<00:00:30.130> of<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.490> ignition

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
guess second version of the ignition

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.880 
guess second version of the ignition
binding<00:00:31.359> basically<00:00:32.169> what<00:00:32.320> we<00:00:32.439> had<00:00:32.590> with<00:00:32.800> the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
binding basically what we had with the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.180 
binding basically what we had with the
baseplate<00:00:33.340> was<00:00:34.080> you<00:00:35.080> know<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.440> slider<00:00:35.860> track

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
baseplate was you know the slider track

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.520 
baseplate was you know the slider track
is<00:00:36.489> now<00:00:36.790> incorporated<00:00:37.239> into<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:38.079> the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
is now incorporated into the the

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.260 
is now incorporated into the the
baseplate<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.160> binding<00:00:39.550> obviously<00:00:40.059> for

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
baseplate of the binding obviously for

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.030 
baseplate of the binding obviously for
new<00:00:40.390> splitters<00:00:40.870> or<00:00:41.410> I<00:00:41.440> should<00:00:41.680> say<00:00:41.829> for<00:00:41.890> old

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
new splitters or I should say for old

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.520 
new splitters or I should say for old
splitters<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.719> know<00:00:43.809> this<00:00:44.020> is<00:00:44.170> nothing<00:00:44.500> new

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
splitters you know this is nothing new

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.370 
splitters you know this is nothing new
but<00:00:44.950> what<00:00:45.670> will<00:00:46.030> has<00:00:46.239> been<00:00:46.390> able<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.660> do<00:00:46.899> with

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
but what will has been able to do with

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.080 
but what will has been able to do with
the<00:00:47.590> new<00:00:47.710> binding<00:00:48.130> is<00:00:48.280> pretty<00:00:48.520> exciting

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
the new binding is pretty exciting

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.650 
the new binding is pretty exciting
basically<00:00:49.870> with<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.170> old<00:00:50.320> binding<00:00:50.770> we<00:00:50.920> had

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
basically with the old binding we had

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.450 
basically with the old binding we had
you<00:00:52.660> know<00:00:52.690> metal<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.860> was<00:00:54.040> basically

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
you know metal that was basically

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.580 
you know metal that was basically
sandwiched<00:00:54.969> together<00:00:55.170> there's<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.230> small

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
sandwiched together there's a small

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.400 
sandwiched together there's a small
piece<00:00:56.770> of<00:00:56.829> plastic<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.610> kind<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:59.379> know

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
piece of plastic that kind of you know

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.290 
piece of plastic that kind of you know
was<00:00:59.710> in<00:00:59.829> between<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.309> binding<00:01:00.730> or<00:01:01.059> I<00:01:01.090> should

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
was in between the binding or I should

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.060 
was in between the binding or I should
say<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.600> two<00:01:01.629> pieces<00:01:01.899> of<00:01:02.050> metal<00:01:02.289> held

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
say the two pieces of metal held

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.700 
say the two pieces of metal held
together<00:01:03.250> by<00:01:03.489> rivets<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:05.470> know<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.619> was

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
together by rivets you know it was

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.529 
together by rivets you know it was
really<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:06.009> pretty<00:01:06.550> big<00:01:06.789> step<00:01:07.000> forward<00:01:07.240> for

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
really a pretty big step forward for

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:10.680 
really a pretty big step forward for
bindings<00:01:08.490> split<00:01:09.490> board<00:01:09.610> bindings<00:01:10.149> at<00:01:10.509> the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
bindings split board bindings at the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.840 
bindings split board bindings at the
time<00:01:10.929> but<00:01:11.259> what's<00:01:11.860> exciting<00:01:12.280> is<00:01:12.429> with<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.759> new

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
time but what's exciting is with the new

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.790 
time but what's exciting is with the new
fuse<00:01:13.119> binding<00:01:13.450> he's<00:01:13.600> really<00:01:13.869> taken<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.709> a<00:01:14.770> step

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
fuse binding he's really taken it a step

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.240 
fuse binding he's really taken it a step
further<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.399> what<00:01:16.119> I<00:01:16.149> want<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.420> show<00:01:16.569> you<00:01:16.630> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
further and what I want to show you is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.240 
further and what I want to show you is
the<00:01:18.250> design<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.880> new<00:01:19.000> baseplate<00:01:19.479> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the design of the new baseplate and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.510 
the design of the new baseplate and
basically<00:01:21.250> what<00:01:21.690> will<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.840> done<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.520> instead

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
basically what will is done is instead

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.760 
basically what will is done is instead
of<00:01:24.580> having<00:01:24.670> two<00:01:25.569> pieces<00:01:25.929> of<00:01:25.959> metal<00:01:26.560> or

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
of having two pieces of metal or

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.820 
of having two pieces of metal or
aluminum<00:01:27.360> riveted<00:01:28.360> together<00:01:28.569> it's<00:01:29.410> basically

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
aluminum riveted together it's basically

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.029 
aluminum riveted together it's basically
one<00:01:30.099> solid<00:01:30.610> piece<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:31.090> aluminum<00:01:32.050> that<00:01:32.800> has

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
one solid piece of aluminum that has

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.050 
one solid piece of aluminum that has
been<00:01:33.250> machined<00:01:33.970> or<00:01:34.660> milled<00:01:34.990> out<00:01:35.849> you<00:01:36.849> know<00:01:36.940> the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
been machined or milled out you know the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.180 
been machined or milled out you know the
slider<00:01:37.330> track<00:01:37.569> groove<00:01:37.929> so<00:01:38.560> basically<00:01:38.920> instead

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
slider track groove so basically instead

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.029 
slider track groove so basically instead
of<00:01:39.490> having<00:01:39.729> two<00:01:40.539> different<00:01:40.569> pieces<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.560> metal

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
of having two different pieces of metal

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.219 
of having two different pieces of metal
you<00:01:43.030> know<00:01:43.119> sandwich<00:01:43.569> together<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.110> held

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
you know sandwich together and held

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.320 
you know sandwich together and held
together<00:01:44.380> by<00:01:44.590> rivets<00:01:44.830> it's<00:01:45.580> now<00:01:45.789> just<00:01:46.060> one

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
together by rivets it's now just one

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.690 
together by rivets it's now just one
piece<00:01:46.569> of<00:01:46.599> metal<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.770> think<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.580> end

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
piece of metal and I think the end

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.120 
piece of metal and I think the end
result<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.209> going<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.450> be<00:01:49.660> a<00:01:50.380> little<00:01:50.979> bit

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
result is going to be a little bit

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.479 
result is going to be a little bit
lighter<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.640> much<00:01:52.179> stronger<00:01:52.509> product<00:01:53.259> and

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.489 
lighter and much stronger product and

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.979 
lighter and much stronger product and
you<00:01:54.489> know<00:01:54.580> cleaner<00:01:54.880> there's<00:01:55.090> not<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.509> bunch<00:01:55.869> of

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:55.989 
you know cleaner there's not a bunch of

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:57.359 
you know cleaner there's not a bunch of
rivets<00:01:56.289> holding<00:01:56.410> it<00:01:56.649> together<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.160> stuff

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
rivets holding it together and stuff

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.990 
rivets holding it together and stuff
like<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.030> pretty<00:01:58.450> exciting<00:01:59.819> just<00:02:00.819> kind

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
like that so pretty exciting just kind

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.190 
like that so pretty exciting just kind
of<00:02:01.060> taking<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.450> look<00:02:01.599> at<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.869> here<00:02:02.050> you'll

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
of taking a look at it here you'll

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.400 
of taking a look at it here you'll
notice<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.709> you<00:02:03.310> know<00:02:03.429> it<00:02:03.550> is<00:02:03.670> one<00:02:03.940> piece<00:02:04.179> of

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
notice that you know it is one piece of

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.699 
notice that you know it is one piece of
of<00:02:05.410> metal<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:08.259> know<00:02:08.380> he's<00:02:08.500> got<00:02:08.679> some

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
of metal and you know he's got some

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.330 
of metal and you know he's got some
cutouts<00:02:09.160> here<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.580> reduce<00:02:09.970> some<00:02:10.209> weight

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
cutouts here to reduce some weight

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.860 
cutouts here to reduce some weight
another<00:02:12.340> big<00:02:12.550> thing<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.879> think<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.450> an

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
another big thing that I think is an

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.470 
another big thing that I think is an
improvement<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:15.159> haven't<00:02:15.459> seen<00:02:15.640> yet<00:02:15.700> is

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
improvement that we haven't seen yet is

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.240 
improvement that we haven't seen yet is
he's<00:02:16.959> got<00:02:17.110> some

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
he's got some

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.090 
he's got some
reinforcements<00:02:19.030> in<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.020> slider<00:02:20.380> pinholes

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
reinforcements in the slider pinholes

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.670 
reinforcements in the slider pinholes
over<00:02:21.730> time<00:02:21.940> these<00:02:22.150> slider<00:02:22.450> pinholes<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.230> bore

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
over time these slider pinholes can bore

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.160 
over time these slider pinholes can bore
out<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.310> become<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> little<00:02:25.390> loose<00:02:25.600> from<00:02:25.930> use

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
out and become a little loose from use

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.790 
out and become a little loose from use
but<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:27.450> material<00:02:28.450> that's<00:02:28.630> been<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.770> know

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
but the material that's been you know

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.890 
but the material that's been you know
sandwiched<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.580> here<00:02:30.790> with<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.270> other<00:02:31.570> metal

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
sandwiched in here with this other metal

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.870 
sandwiched in here with this other metal
is<00:02:32.050> basically<00:02:32.440> going<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.740> prevent<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.490> wear

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
is basically going to prevent that wear

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.250 
is basically going to prevent that wear
so<00:02:34.120> that's<00:02:34.300> pretty<00:02:34.480> exciting<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.050> see<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:38.050> is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
so that's pretty exciting to see this is

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.370 
so that's pretty exciting to see this is
kind<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.500> an<00:02:38.620> earlier<00:02:38.920> proto

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
kind of an earlier proto

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.420 
kind of an earlier proto
actual<00:02:41.380> binding<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:41.980> think<00:02:42.100> on<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
actual binding so I think on the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.920 
actual binding so I think on the
production<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:43.120> you're<00:02:43.330> going<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.510> see<00:02:43.750> this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
production one you're going to see this

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.710 
production one you're going to see this
base<00:02:44.230> plate<00:02:44.459> be<00:02:45.459> polished<00:02:45.910> which<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.450> going<00:02:46.660> to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
base plate be polished which is going to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.460 
base plate be polished which is going to
help<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.380> snow<00:02:47.940> not<00:02:48.940> stick<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:50.350> know

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
help the snow not stick to it you know

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.140 
help the snow not stick to it you know
when<00:02:50.620> you're<00:02:50.770> out<00:02:50.800> there<00:02:50.920> doing<00:02:51.459> transitions

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
when you're out there doing transitions

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.000 
when you're out there doing transitions
and<00:02:52.360> stuff<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.989> think<00:02:53.590> that's<00:02:53.739> going<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:53.950> be

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
and stuff so I think that's going to be

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.040 
and stuff so I think that's going to be
really<00:02:54.280> cool<00:02:54.430> too<00:02:54.640> as<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> polished<00:02:55.330> polished

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
really cool too as a polished polished

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.580 
really cool too as a polished polished
aluminum<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:58.270> know<00:02:58.390> obviously<00:02:59.080> it's<00:02:59.260> got<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
aluminum you know obviously it's got the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.260 
aluminum you know obviously it's got the
the<00:03:00.400> nice<00:03:01.230> bent<00:03:02.230> metal<00:03:02.410> hardware<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
the nice bent metal hardware one of the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.449 
the nice bent metal hardware one of the
things<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:04.690> about<00:03:04.720> their<00:03:05.200> high<00:03:05.980> back<00:03:06.250> is

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
things I like about their high back is

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.220 
things I like about their high back is
the<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.970> holes<00:03:07.209> in<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.540> high<00:03:07.690> back<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.050> think

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the the holes in the high back I think

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.229 
the the holes in the high back I think
it<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:09.160> know<00:03:09.190> reduces<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.850> weight<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.000> little

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
it you know reduces the weight a little

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.900 
it you know reduces the weight a little
bit<00:03:10.390> but<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.840> also<00:03:10.989> when<00:03:11.920> you're<00:03:12.040> taking<00:03:12.880> your

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
bit but it also when you're taking your

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.640 
bit but it also when you're taking your
board<00:03:13.239> off<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.600> maybe<00:03:13.720> walking<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.560> a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
board off and maybe walking with it a

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.229 
board off and maybe walking with it a
few<00:03:14.830> feet<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.310> next<00:03:15.550> spot<00:03:15.790> if<00:03:15.970> there's<00:03:16.150> a

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
few feet to the next spot if there's a

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.479 
few feet to the next spot if there's a
dry<00:03:16.420> spot<00:03:16.690> in<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.020> in<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.739> snow<00:03:17.980> or<00:03:18.130> something

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
dry spot in the in the snow or something

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.520 
dry spot in the in the snow or something
just<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:19.060> real<00:03:19.209> easy<00:03:19.360> place<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.900> grab<00:03:20.050> onto<00:03:20.290> your

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
just a real easy place to grab onto your

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.180 
just a real easy place to grab onto your
bindings<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.160> carry<00:03:21.489> each<00:03:22.019> split<00:03:23.019> ski<00:03:23.350> you

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
bindings and carry each split ski you

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.020 
bindings and carry each split ski you
know<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.340> your<00:03:24.580> next<00:03:24.850> spot<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:27.130> know<00:03:27.250> good<00:03:27.489> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
know to your next spot you know good the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.780 
know to your next spot you know good the
nice<00:03:28.180> spent<00:03:28.450> metal<00:03:28.680> ratchets<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:29.950> that's<00:03:30.580> all

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
nice spent metal ratchets so that's all

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.620 
nice spent metal ratchets so that's all
there<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:32.680> those<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:33.010> like<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.459> toe<00:03:34.180> or<00:03:34.570> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
there for those that like the toe or the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.320 
there for those that like the toe or the
toe<00:03:34.989> caps<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.500> think<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.880> know<00:03:36.970> these<00:03:37.090> are<00:03:37.239> kind

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
toe caps I think you know these are kind

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.880 
toe caps I think you know these are kind
of<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.540> convertible<00:03:37.989> toe<00:03:38.230> cap<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.650> could<00:03:38.799> be

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
of a convertible toe cap that could be

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.039 
of a convertible toe cap that could be
worn<00:03:39.040> over<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.700> toe<00:03:39.880> or<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.830> standard<00:03:42.250> form

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
worn over the toe or in a standard form

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.970 
worn over the toe or in a standard form
another<00:03:44.049> one<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.410> cool<00:03:44.590> things<00:03:44.830> that

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
another one of the cool things that

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.680 
another one of the cool things that
you'll<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.610> you'll<00:03:45.760> notice<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.299> this<00:03:46.510> is

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
you'll that you'll notice and this is

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.509 
you'll that you'll notice and this is
something<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:46.989> obviously<00:03:47.230> has<00:03:47.620> been<00:03:47.829> on<00:03:48.250> the

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
something that obviously has been on the

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.910 
something that obviously has been on the
last<00:03:48.700> couple<00:03:49.170> renditions<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.440> binding<00:03:50.799> is

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
last couple renditions of the binding is

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.580 
last couple renditions of the binding is
the<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.730> high-back<00:03:52.030> cube<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.660> basically

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
the the high-back cube and basically

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.259 
the the high-back cube and basically
what<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.890> allows<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.340> do<00:03:54.519> is<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:55.000> spin

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
what it allows you to do is just spin

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.470 
what it allows you to do is just spin
the<00:03:55.420> cube<00:03:56.400> for<00:03:57.400> various<00:03:57.850> forward<00:03:58.299> lean

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
the cube for various forward lean

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.380 
the cube for various forward lean
adjustments<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.620> a<00:04:00.280> lot<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.910> splitters<00:04:01.120> will

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
adjustments and a lot of splitters will

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.090 
adjustments and a lot of splitters will
like<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.540> kind<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.900> back<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.380> angle<00:04:02.709> off<00:04:02.829> when

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
like to kind of back that angle off when

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.830 
like to kind of back that angle off when
they're<00:04:03.220> skinning<00:04:03.640> up<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.090> then<00:04:04.570> when<00:04:04.750> they

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
they're skinning up and then when they

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.210 
they're skinning up and then when they
get<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.230> top<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.590> want<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.799> ride<00:04:05.980> down

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
get to the top and want to ride down

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.970 
get to the top and want to ride down
they'll<00:04:06.430> add<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:07.360> forward<00:04:07.780> lean<00:04:07.930> back<00:04:08.230> so

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
they'll add that forward lean back so

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.830 
they'll add that forward lean back so
just<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.280> nice<00:04:09.400> comfort<00:04:09.850> factor<00:04:10.030> very<00:04:10.390> easy<00:04:10.600> to

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840
