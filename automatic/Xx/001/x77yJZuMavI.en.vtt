00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.589 
that's mentally I mean next time you go
pick<00:03:24.159> up<00:03:24.280> bananas<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.819> check<00:03:25.030> for<00:03:25.150> spiders

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
pick up bananas you go check for spiders

probably<00:03:25.930> yeah<00:03:26.079> they<00:03:26.470> inject<00:03:26.860> like<00:03:27.340> the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
probably yeah they inject like the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.690 
probably yeah they inject like the
spider<00:03:28.360> we<00:03:28.750> pretty<00:03:28.959> obvious<00:03:29.440> there's<00:03:30.129> a<00:03:30.250> giant

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
spider we pretty obvious there's a giant

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.580 
spider we pretty obvious there's a giant
spider<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.180> size<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.480> man's<00:03:31.659> hat<00:03:31.930> you<00:03:32.440> can

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
imagine how many bananas have got go

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.300 
imagine how many bananas have got go
through<00:03:34.390> every<00:03:34.720> day<00:03:34.870> for<00:03:35.680> not<00:03:35.829> checking<00:03:35.980> every

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
through every day for not checking every

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.750 
through every day for not checking every
single<00:03:36.340> bunch<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.950> hasn't<00:03:39.280> got<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.400> giant

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
single bunch this hasn't got a giant

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.509 
single bunch this hasn't got a giant
hand<00:03:40.209> size<00:03:40.629> transfer<00:03:41.260> in<00:03:41.379> it<00:03:41.530> well<00:03:41.920> they<00:03:42.280> could

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
hand size transfer in it well they could

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.330 
hand size transfer in it well they could
hide<00:03:42.730> underneath<00:03:43.620> there's<00:03:44.620> like<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:45.190> don't

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
hide underneath there's like you don't

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.770 
hide underneath there's like you don't
check<00:03:45.459> for<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.670> eggs<00:03:45.819> inside<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.599> then<00:03:46.690> you

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
check for the eggs inside and then you

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.360 
check for the eggs inside and then you
shove<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.049> bunch<00:03:47.260> into<00:03:47.530> loads<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.859> boxes<00:03:47.950> and

shove a bunch into loads of boxes and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.030 
shove a bunch into loads of boxes and
then<00:03:48.459> there's<00:03:48.819> you've<00:03:48.970> got<00:03:49.090> suddenly<00:03:50.040> water
