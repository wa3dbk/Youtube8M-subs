how I'm not giving any expert tips how
to<00:00:29.180> perfect<00:00:29.780> your<00:00:29.930> esker<00:00:30.410> therefore<00:00:31.100> I<00:00:31.310> just

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
to perfect your esker therefore I just

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.069 
to perfect your esker therefore I just
did<00:00:31.880> learn<00:00:32.149> it<00:00:32.360> myself

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
did learn it myself

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.560 
did learn it myself
but<00:00:33.800> just<00:00:34.039> a<00:00:34.160> few<00:00:34.190> ends<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:34.850> figured<00:00:35.179> out<00:00:35.329> while

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
but just a few ends I figured out while

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.759 
but just a few ends I figured out while

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
direction you want to rotate now you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.560 
direction you want to rotate now you
start<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.340> throw<00:01:43.580> your<00:01:43.730> body<00:01:43.940> on<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.300> stern

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.630 
start to throw your body on the stern
the<00:01:45.200> hand<00:01:45.410> you<00:01:45.530> used<00:01:45.800> for<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.070> fake<00:01:46.280> stroke

throwing impulsively in the direction

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.080 
throwing impulsively in the direction
you're<00:01:48.980> looking<00:01:49.010> over<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.640> shoulder<00:01:49.970> you

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
you're looking over the shoulder you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.420 
you're looking over the shoulder you
rotate<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:51.080> other<00:01:51.230> hand<00:01:51.530> needs<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.920> stay<00:01:52.190> as

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
rotate the other hand needs to stay as

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.850 
rotate the other hand needs to stay as
close<00:01:52.790> as<00:01:53.030> possible<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.600> your<00:01:53.840> chin<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.680> show

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
close as possible to your chin to show

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.000 
close as possible to your chin to show
less<00:01:55.130> resistance<00:01:55.790> for<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> fast<00:01:56.420> rotation

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
less resistance for a fast rotation

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.470 
less resistance for a fast rotation
basically<00:01:58.010> you<00:01:58.400> have<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.670> initiate<00:01:59.030> the

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
basically you have to initiate the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.780 
basically you have to initiate the
rotation<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.170> course<00:02:00.680> before<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.160> happens

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
rotation of course before it happens

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.060 
rotation of course before it happens
means<00:02:02.390> before<00:02:02.810> your<00:02:03.110> body<00:02:03.290> mass<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.800> at<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
means before your body mass is at the

to<00:02:31.579> over<00:02:31.879> rotate<00:02:32.239> too<00:02:32.480> hard<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.290> you

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
to over rotate too hard so that you

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.710 
to over rotate too hard so that you
automatically<00:02:34.220> land<00:02:34.549> on<00:02:34.730> your<00:02:34.849> bottom<00:02:35.000> but

automatically land on your bottom but

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.960 
automatically land on your bottom but
the<00:02:35.870> trick<00:02:36.140> now<00:02:36.409> is<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.950> land<00:02:37.189> flat<00:02:37.400> without

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
the trick now is to land flat without

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.880 
the trick now is to land flat without
putting<00:02:38.209> weight<00:02:38.540> on<00:02:38.689> any<00:02:38.840> edge<00:02:39.109> when<00:02:39.799> you

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
putting weight on any edge when you

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.410 
putting weight on any edge when you
catch<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.340> upstream<00:02:40.819> edge<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.269> eat

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.040 

the<00:02:47.110> downstream<00:02:47.590> one<00:02:47.800> slows<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.430> down<00:02:48.460> and

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
the downstream one slows you down and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.380 
the downstream one slows you down and
you<00:02:50.050> carve<00:02:50.320> out<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.010> way<00:02:51.160> I'll<00:02:51.670> consider
