00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
in the game where if you click in on a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.580 
in the game where if you click in on a
mine<00:01:10.470> cart<00:01:10.680> through<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> wall<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.659> able<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
mine cart through a wall you are able to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.429 
mine cart through a wall you are able to
go<00:01:13.830> through<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.490> wall<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.900> works<00:01:16.200> for

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
go through that wall now this works for

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.429 
go through that wall now this works for
one<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:18.140> one<00:01:19.140> wide<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:20.340> too<00:01:21.090> wide<00:01:21.439> but

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
one well for one wide for too wide but

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.560 
one well for one wide for too wide but
will<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.680> work<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.009> three<00:01:23.369> wide<00:01:23.670> I'm<00:01:24.060> pretty

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.469 
sure it will well not if I am at the
wrong<00:01:28.140> block<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> course<00:01:28.880> again<00:01:29.880> wait<00:01:30.240> where

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
wrong block of course again wait where

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.740 
wrong block of course again wait where
is<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> where<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
should put these in the middle so I

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.910 
should put these in the middle so I
actually<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:36.210> where<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.640> um

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
thing where you instantly break the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
thing where you instantly break the
block<00:01:52.710> behind<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:55.290> cart<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> fifth<00:01:56.579> one

block behind the the cart and fifth one

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.380 
block behind the the cart and fifth one
it's<00:01:57.119> also<00:01:57.689> possible<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.729> think<00:01:59.729> it's<00:01:59.850> five<00:02:00.030> yes

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390

it's also possible I think it's five yes
it's<00:02:00.600> fine<00:02:00.799> then<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> sixth<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it's fine then we have a sixth one and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.139 
it's fine then we have a sixth one and
I'm<00:02:03.360> pretty<00:02:03.659> sure<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.140> impossible<00:02:04.710> oh<00:02:05.189> no

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
I'm pretty sure this is impossible oh no

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.499 
I'm pretty sure this is impossible oh no
it<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.600> possible<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:08.250> honestly<00:02:08.970> no

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
it is possible so I have honestly no

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.920 
it is possible so I have honestly no
idea<00:02:09.539> how<00:02:10.500> far<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.220> go<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.360> so

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
idea how far you can go with this so
let's<00:02:13.739> try<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.099> actually<00:02:15.019> lets<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.769> do

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
let's try it actually lets you just do

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.839 
let's try it actually lets you just do
this<00:02:18.230> break<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.650> know<00:02:19.799> what<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.219> easier<00:02:20.670> if

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
this break you know what it's easier if

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.990 
this break you know what it's easier if
we<00:02:21.329> just<00:02:21.739> nope<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.689> this<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:26.250> this

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
we just nope if we just do this and this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.649 
we just nope if we just do this and this
and<00:02:27.299> this<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:30.709> if<00:02:31.709> we<00:02:32.040> go<00:02:32.250> instant<00:02:32.849> hero<00:02:32.909> no<00:02:33.329> we

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
and this so if we go instant hero no we

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.979 
and this so if we go instant hero no we
can<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.790> okay<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:36.180> doesn't<00:02:36.480> work<00:02:36.629> so

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
can just okay so that doesn't work so

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.800 
can just okay so that doesn't work so
seven<00:02:37.530> doesn't<00:02:37.799> worry<00:02:37.950> about<00:02:38.010> six<00:02:38.310> does<00:02:38.810> so

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
seven doesn't worry about six does so

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.520 
seven doesn't worry about six does so
I'm<00:02:40.349> pretty<00:02:40.530> sure<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.889> is<00:02:41.010> actually<00:02:42.530> that's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
I'm pretty sure it is actually that's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.210 
I'm pretty sure it is actually that's
right<00:02:43.799> at<00:02:43.950> one<00:02:44.129> more<00:02:44.250> time<00:02:44.489> just<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.419> prove

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
right at one more time just to prove

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.940 
right at one more time just to prove
everything<00:02:47.220> which<00:02:48.000> stuff<00:02:51.620> wait<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.889> that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
everything which stuff wait is that

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.470 
everything which stuff wait is that
record<00:02:53.459> actually<00:02:53.639> because<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.209> might<00:02:54.359> have

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
record actually because I might have

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.050 
record actually because I might have
broken<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.819> nope<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.299> there<00:02:57.569> wait<00:02:58.379> let<00:02:58.620> me

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
broken it nope it is there wait let me

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.470 
broken it nope it is there wait let me
place<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.329> like<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.689> was<00:03:00.719> just<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.700> know<00:03:02.700> I'm<00:03:03.239> I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
place it like it was just I know I'm I

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.830 
place it like it was just I know I'm I
hope<00:03:03.659> it<00:03:03.810> works<00:03:03.959> actually<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:05.540> last<00:03:06.540> time<00:03:06.659> I

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
hope it works actually but I last time I

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.349 
hope it works actually but I last time I
tested<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.859> sixth<00:03:08.340> isn't<00:03:08.609> work<00:03:08.760> didn't<00:03:09.209> work

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
tested this sixth isn't work didn't work

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.809 
tested this sixth isn't work didn't work
but<00:03:09.599> oh<00:03:09.810> well<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.680> does<00:03:10.919> work<00:03:11.219> if<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.579> break

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
but oh well it does work if you break

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.369 
but oh well it does work if you break
the<00:03:12.000> block<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.389> front<00:03:12.419> of<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.930> which<00:03:13.109> is<00:03:13.230> kind

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
the block in front of it which is kind

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.170 
the block in front of it which is kind
of<00:03:13.530> weird<00:03:13.680> because<00:03:13.919> you're<00:03:14.639> still<00:03:14.909> at<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
of weird because you're still at the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.509 
of weird because you're still at the
same<00:03:15.510> length<00:03:15.810> away<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.349> cars<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.340> that's

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
same length away of the cars so that's

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.809 
same length away of the cars so that's
kind<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.849> strange<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:20.129> possible<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.729> is

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
kind of strange but it is possible it is

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.599 
kind of strange but it is possible it is
possible<00:03:21.169> so<00:03:22.169> you<00:03:22.199> can<00:03:22.440> teleport<00:03:23.129> to<00:03:23.310> six

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
possible so you can teleport to six

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.619 
possible so you can teleport to six
blocks<00:03:23.849> away<00:03:24.319> with<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:25.709> mind<00:03:26.310> card<00:03:26.699> glitchy

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
blocks away with this mind card glitchy

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.979 
blocks away with this mind card glitchy
system<00:03:28.439> thing<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.579> that's<00:03:30.269> really<00:03:30.720> really

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
system thing so that's really really

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
system thing so that's really really
cool<00:03:31.049> um<00:03:32.479> again<00:03:33.479> it's<00:03:33.900> really<00:03:34.109> cool<00:03:34.760> anyway
