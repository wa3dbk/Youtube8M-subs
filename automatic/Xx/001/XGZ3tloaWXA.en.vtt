part<00:00:22.640> of<00:00:22.699> this<00:00:22.849> series<00:00:23.409> and<00:00:24.409> it's<00:00:24.589> obviously

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:25.149 
part of this series and it's obviously

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.550 
part of this series and it's obviously
clear<00:00:26.149> that<00:00:26.479> there's<00:00:26.659> a<00:00:26.720> high<00:00:27.079> level<00:00:27.470> of

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
clear that there's a high level of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.259 
clear that there's a high level of
commitment<00:00:27.859> from<00:00:28.220> both<00:00:28.279> sides<00:00:28.759> there's<00:00:29.210> a

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
commitment from both sides there's a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.589 
commitment from both sides there's a
heavy<00:00:29.869> commitment<00:00:30.499> from<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.220> fim<00:00:31.789> from<00:00:32.180> Honda

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
heavy commitment from the fim from Honda

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.260 
heavy commitment from the fim from Honda
and<00:00:32.750> I<00:00:33.650> think<00:00:34.040> that's<00:00:34.250> been<00:00:34.400> recognized<00:00:34.940> by

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
and I think that's been recognized by

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.420 
and I think that's been recognized by
the<00:00:35.630> public<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.320> there's<00:00:36.830> some<00:00:37.010> very<00:00:37.160> good

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
the public and there's some very good

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.630 
the public and there's some very good
riders<00:00:37.850> here<00:00:38.170> I've<00:00:39.170> really<00:00:39.560> enjoyed<00:00:39.640> being

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640

refreshing for me to get to get back
into<00:00:51.320> this<00:00:51.620> scenario<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.970> I'm<00:00:53.240> really

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
into this scenario and I'm really

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.660 
into this scenario and I'm really
looking<00:00:53.870> forward<00:00:53.900> to<00:00:54.560> the<00:00:54.740> whole<00:00:54.920> season<00:00:55.250> but

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
looking forward to the whole season but

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.580 
looking forward to the whole season but
in<00:00:56.000> particular<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.690> I<00:00:56.780> we've<00:00:57.050> got<00:00:57.230> Holland

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
in particular and I we've got Holland

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.400 
in particular and I we've got Holland
for<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.489> first<00:00:58.730> run<00:00:58.910> coming<00:00:59.210> up<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.570> it's

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
for the first run coming up and it's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.979 
for the first run coming up and it's
going<00:01:00.560> to<00:01:00.620> be<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.770> completely<00:01:01.160> different

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
going to be a completely different

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.599 
going to be a completely different
setting<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.170> what<00:01:03.350> we've<00:01:03.500> had<00:01:03.680> here<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:04.309> all

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:04.609 
setting to what we've had here but all

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:06.730 
setting to what we've had here but all
the<00:01:04.939> same<00:01:05.089> people<00:01:05.329> so<00:01:05.719> it's<00:01:06.140> definitely<00:01:06.560> going

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
the same people so it's definitely going

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.609 
the same people so it's definitely going
to<00:01:06.829> be<00:01:07.179> going<00:01:08.179> to<00:01:08.539> be<00:01:08.630> exciting<00:01:08.899> once<00:01:09.380> we<00:01:09.499> get

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
to be going to be exciting once we get

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.319 
to be going to be exciting once we get
there<00:01:09.859> and<00:01:09.979> get<00:01:10.520> into<00:01:10.609> the<00:01:10.789> thick<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
there and get into the thick of the

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.419 
there and get into the thick of the
actual<00:01:11.630> racing<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:12.619> spoke<00:01:12.859> with<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.069> FIM

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
actual racing you spoke with the FIM

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.550 
actual racing you spoke with the FIM
there<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:13.880> how<00:01:14.479> important<00:01:14.929> will<00:01:15.079> their<00:01:15.259> input

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
there and how important will their input

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.770 
there and how important will their input
be<00:01:15.729> well<00:01:16.729> they're<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.999> governing<00:01:17.389> body<00:01:17.630> of

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
be well they're the governing body of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.410 
be well they're the governing body of
the<00:01:17.960> highest<00:01:18.439> level<00:01:18.829> of<00:01:18.889> racing<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:20.030> think

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
the highest level of racing and I think

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.219 
the highest level of racing and I think
that<00:01:21.159> they've<00:01:22.159> recognized<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.479> know<00:01:23.630> that

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
that they've recognized you know that

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.679 
that they've recognized you know that
we've<00:01:24.710> got<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:25.159> look<00:01:25.310> after<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:25.969> the<00:01:26.299> future

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
we've got to look after that the future

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.050 
we've got to look after that the future
riders<00:01:27.109> that<00:01:27.229> are<00:01:27.289> coming<00:01:27.649> through<00:01:27.679> and<00:01:28.189> you

races that i won so you know they were

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.140 
races that i won so you know they were
too<00:03:19.209> young<00:03:19.239> when<00:03:19.870> i<00:03:19.900> was<00:03:20.110> doing<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.150> on

too young when i was doing that and on

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.759 
too young when i was doing that and on
maybe<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.870> fact<00:03:23.049> that<00:03:23.200> i've<00:03:23.380> been<00:03:23.410> riding

maybe the fact that i've been riding
here<00:03:24.130> on<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.310> 150<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.180> they<00:03:25.269> can<00:03:25.450> say<00:03:25.660> oh<00:03:25.690> this

this all gaggin can ride a bike they

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.890 
this all gaggin can ride a bike they
might<00:03:29.530> actually<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:30.220> know<00:03:30.340> value<00:03:30.850> my<00:03:31.450> opinion

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
might actually you know value my opinion

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.220 
might actually you know value my opinion
on<00:03:32.230> my<00:03:32.500> advice<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.799> little<00:03:33.160> bit<00:03:33.280> higher<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:35.110> the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
on my advice a little bit higher and the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.800 
on my advice a little bit higher and the
fact<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.560> i<00:03:35.709> did<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:35.950> on<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.070> 150<00:03:36.730> as<00:03:36.850> well<00:03:37.090> i

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
fact that i did it on a 150 as well i

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.320 
fact that i did it on a 150 as well i
think<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:38.380> really<00:03:38.620> important<00:03:39.070> because<00:03:39.330> it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
think is really important because it

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.410 
think is really important because it
shows<00:03:40.360> them<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:42.100> know<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:43.000> can't<00:03:43.209> use

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
shows them you know that you can't use

shows them you know that you can't use
the<00:03:43.570> bike<00:03:43.720> as<00:03:43.870> an<00:03:43.989> excuse<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.650> can't<00:03:44.890> say<00:03:45.100> oh

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
the bike as an excuse you can't say oh

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.520 
the bike as an excuse you can't say oh

doesn't have par as suspense is too soft

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.530 
doesn't have par as suspense is too soft
I<00:03:49.780> mean<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.580> mean<00:03:51.580> every<00:03:51.850> jump<00:03:52.090> on<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.299> track

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
I mean I mean every jump on the track

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.030 
I mean I mean every jump on the track
and<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.780> even<00:03:52.930> was<00:03:53.170> doing<00:03:53.350> some<00:03:53.530> jumps<00:03:53.799> that<00:03:53.890> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
and I even was doing some jumps that the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.670 
and I even was doing some jumps that the
other<00:03:54.190> guys<00:03:54.370> weren't<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:56.019> know<00:03:56.140> being

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
other guys weren't so you know being

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.650 
other guys weren't so you know being
involved<00:03:56.980> in<00:03:57.160> not<00:03:57.370> nigh<00:03:57.850> at<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.269> beginning<00:03:58.600> of

involved in not nigh at the beginning of
the<00:03:58.810> season<00:03:59.019> I<00:03:59.350> think<00:03:59.950> is<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.400> good<00:04:01.090> thing<00:04:01.150> to

the season I think is a good thing to

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.170 
the season I think is a good thing to
get<00:04:01.600> out<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.930> way<00:04:02.049> early<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.820> I<00:04:03.910> hope<00:04:04.150> that

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
get out of the way early and I hope that

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.920 
get out of the way early and I hope that
the<00:04:04.720> kids<00:04:05.410> will<00:04:05.880> start<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.000> come<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.450> me<00:04:07.600> and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
the kids will start to come to me and

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.120 
the kids will start to come to me and
