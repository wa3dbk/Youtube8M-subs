00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
felt it was a great spot well one of the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.570 
felt it was a great spot well one of the
reasons<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.440> total<00:02:10.619> was<00:02:10.800> 185<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.489> go

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
reasons was the total was 185 you go

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.650 
reasons was the total was 185 you go
back<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.760> Game<00:02:11.940> one<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> series<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.599> was

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
back to Game one of the series it was

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.340 
back to Game one of the series it was
like<00:02:12.810> 180

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
like 180

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.870 
like 180
on<00:02:13.470> right<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:14.010> did<00:02:14.100> he<00:02:14.130> one<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.520> half<00:02:14.550> and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
on right what did he one and a half and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.820 
on right what did he one and a half and
I<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.090> thought<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:15.390> were<00:02:15.510> getting<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.990> couple

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
I just thought we were getting a couple

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.020 
I just thought we were getting a couple
of<00:02:16.920> teams<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.160> were<00:02:17.340> really<00:02:17.580> playing<00:02:17.790> above

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
of teams that were really playing above

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.160 
of teams that were really playing above
their<00:02:18.180> heads<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.540> far<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:18.750> their<00:02:18.870> offensive

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
their heads as far as their offensive

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.410 
their heads as far as their offensive
efficiency<00:02:19.610> ratings<00:02:20.610> were<00:02:20.760> concerned<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.300> I

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
efficiency ratings were concerned and I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.490 
efficiency ratings were concerned and I
thought<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> would<00:02:21.720> come<00:02:21.870> back<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.320> mean<00:02:22.470> a

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
thought it would come back to the mean a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.620 
thought it would come back to the mean a
little<00:02:22.710> bit<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.880> didn't<00:02:24.210> see<00:02:24.450> out<00:02:24.600> of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
little bit but I didn't see out of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.780 
little bit but I didn't see out of
LeBron<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.440> had<00:02:25.560> Miami<00:02:25.920> also<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:26.610> what<00:02:26.760> I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
LeBron and I had Miami also but what I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.890 
LeBron and I had Miami also but what I
was<00:02:26.910> watching<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.390> first<00:02:27.570> half<00:02:27.750> you're

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
was watching to the first half you're

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.540 
was watching to the first half you're
absolutely<00:02:28.290> right<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.830> took<00:02:28.950> him<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.160> while<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
absolutely right it took him a while and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.310 
absolutely right it took him a while and
I<00:02:30.090> didn't<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:30.690> what<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.840> thought<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.200> were

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
I didn't see what I thought we were

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.450 
I didn't see what I thought we were
gonna<00:02:31.440> see<00:02:31.650> out<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> start<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.310> game

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
gonna see out of the start of the game

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.120 
gonna see out of the start of the game
which<00:02:32.730> was<00:02:32.880> what<00:02:33.060> he<00:02:33.150> did<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.390> Game<00:02:33.540> three<00:02:33.570> he

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
which was what he did in Game three he

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.530 
which was what he did in Game three he
kept<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.190> rock<00:02:35.370> he's<00:02:35.850> driving<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.300> paint

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
kept the rock he's driving the paint

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.180 
kept the rock he's driving the paint
game<00:02:36.810> three<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.170> he<00:02:37.260> did<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> second<00:02:38.100> half

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
game three and he did it the second half

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.860 
game three and he did it the second half
of<00:02:38.280> game<00:02:38.310> 5<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.210> thought<00:02:39.420> we'd<00:02:39.600> see<00:02:39.780> it

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
of game 5 but I thought we'd see it

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.990 
of game 5 but I thought we'd see it
right<00:02:40.020> after<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> opening<00:02:40.710> temporary<00:02:41.160> puts

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
right after the opening temporary puts

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.520 
right after the opening temporary puts
Paul<00:02:42.210> George<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.690> his<00:02:42.720> heels<00:02:42.990> drives<00:02:43.350> them<00:02:43.500> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
Paul George on his heels drives them to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.890 
Paul George on his heels drives them to
the<00:02:43.680> bucket<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.520> either<00:02:44.670> help<00:02:44.940> out<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.510> LeBron

situation where Indiana knows what they

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.570 
situation where Indiana knows what they
have<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.080> do<00:03:31.200> which<00:03:31.830> is<00:03:31.860> keep<00:03:32.160> things<00:03:32.370> at<00:03:32.490> a

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
have to do which is keep things at a

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.950 
have to do which is keep things at a
half-court<00:03:33.000> mode<00:03:33.270> at<00:03:33.420> both<00:03:33.600> ends<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
half-court mode at both ends of the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.200 
half-court mode at both ends of the
court<00:03:34.020> they<00:03:34.380> can't<00:03:34.620> allow<00:03:34.800> Miami<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.910> get<00:03:36.030> into

court they can't allow Miami to get into
transition<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:36.990> think<00:03:37.050> you're<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.320> to

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
transition so I think you're going to

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.720 
transition so I think you're going to
see<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.680> out<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.920> Pacers<00:03:38.280> force<00:03:38.580> the

see that out of the Pacers force the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.420 
see that out of the Pacers force the
temple<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.120> bit<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.900> believe<00:03:40.350> unless<00:03:41.250> they

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
temple a bit and I believe unless they

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.740 
temple a bit and I believe unless they
come<00:03:41.670> out<00:03:41.730> flattened<00:03:42.240> I<00:03:42.270> don't<00:03:42.420> know<00:03:42.480> how<00:03:42.690> the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
come out flattened I don't know how the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.140 
come out flattened I don't know how the
heck<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.380> come<00:03:43.860> out<00:03:44.010> flat<00:03:44.250> any<00:03:44.490> game<00:03:44.670> six<00:03:45.000> but

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
heck you come out flat any game six but

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.940 
heck you come out flat any game six but
we<00:03:45.240> saw<00:03:45.420> him<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:45.870> Game<00:03:46.050> four<00:03:46.290> unless

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
we saw him do it in Game four unless

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.230 
we saw him do it in Game four unless
they<00:03:47.100> come<00:03:47.280> out<00:03:47.340> flat<00:03:47.670> they're<00:03:47.910> going<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.120> have

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
they come out flat they're going to have

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.450 
they come out flat they're going to have
to<00:03:48.360> have<00:03:48.480> LeBron<00:03:48.900> working<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.950> ball<00:03:50.220> around

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
to have LeBron working the ball around

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.790 
to have LeBron working the ball around
handling<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.540> rock<00:03:51.690> quite<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.020> bit<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.710> I

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
handling the rock quite a bit and I

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.870 
handling the rock quite a bit and I
think<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.070> means<00:03:53.160> it's<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.460> to<00:03:53.580> take<00:03:53.730> more

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
think it means it's going to take more

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.940 
think it means it's going to take more
time<00:03:54.150> off<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.450> shot<00:03:54.690> clock<00:03:54.960> on<00:03:55.140> most<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.800> their

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
time off the shot clock on most of their

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.440 
time off the shot clock on most of their
possessions<00:03:56.130> as<00:03:56.610> he<00:03:56.730> looks<00:03:56.940> for<00:03:57.000> openings

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450

either<00:03:57.630> taking<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:57.990> ball<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.320> hoop<00:03:58.440> or

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
either taking the ball to the hoop or

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.470 
either taking the ball to the hoop or
opening<00:03:59.250> up<00:03:59.340> other<00:03:59.490> guys<00:03:59.700> on<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> wing<00:04:00.240> like

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
opening up other guys on the wing like

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.360 
opening up other guys on the wing like
you<00:04:00.570> did<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.320> second<00:04:01.680> half<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.950> game<00:04:01.980> five

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
you did in the second half of game five

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.980 
you did in the second half of game five
and<00:04:02.550> for<00:04:02.670> those<00:04:02.760> reasons<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:03.450> think<00:04:03.810> were<00:04:03.870> going

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
and for those reasons I think were going

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.990 
and for those reasons I think were going
to<00:04:04.050> see<00:04:04.170> another<00:04:04.290> low<00:04:04.530> scoring<00:04:04.860> game<00:04:05.000> 169

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
to see another low scoring game 169

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.430 
to see another low scoring game 169
points<00:04:06.360> scored<00:04:06.660> between<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.050> two<00:04:07.230> on
