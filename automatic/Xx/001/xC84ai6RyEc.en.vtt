00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.890
 A clue to the channel here will be on it 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.240

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.300
 but new channel I will but to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.730
 retell everything it is like so me 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.119
 I lost the connection I give 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.340
 I like to have a little bit packed 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.380
 suddenly only every two days 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 upload video then hold what no 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 video more uploaded and now and then 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 I really have to spend a little bit of the year at the iza 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.260
 I'm really sorry I can 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.270
 it does not change anymore 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.430
 I now have a new channel 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.920
 created thereupon is already the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 first three uploaded 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 a new project started sniper 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 Elite Nazi Zombie Army I'll do that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.510
 simple description linked below 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.210
 or in the video no idea how it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.739
 I have such a small list there 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 I can do everything I say 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.549
 it has to be pretty handy yes I have 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.260
 currently there is still 15 minutes limit 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.510
 that means I can not on the new channel 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.040
 More over 15 minutes will upload 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.140
 but hopefully soon 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.729
 I know only in china but at 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.430
 now this one also made it from 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.400
 he somehow works out now 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.549
 the 508 special at the channel will not 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 come I've thought before noon 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.310
 I can not do that now 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.720
 just do not bring it I want 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.020
 I will be there again 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.640
 new battery specials do what sport 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 at 10 subscribers because I hope that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.140
 I do not know, I'm already here 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 That's why ten subscribers will actually be 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.009
 I will not intervene again 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.240
 pull into 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:48.329
 yes pokémon violet some i know 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.960
 Wanted to rest so the aare all the more 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.700
 pokémon violet is still in the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.439
 development therefore have me constantly 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.170
 which people asked about the game 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.610
 I would have explained that the game 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.020
 is not finished that means I can 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.030
 do not play yet 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.530
 I do not know when it's done because 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.659
 It really takes its time all 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 the bugs and to fix and it really 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.220
 is jan must give clean games 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.600
 I hope you understand that in case you 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.400
 Suggestions for the other 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.080
 why from pokémon or generally 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.160
 Something writes in the comments I 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.570
 I will be really happy 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
 I'll definitely something everyone 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.010
 maybe even next next 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.150
 because I currently only have one project 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.030
 yes, that's all 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.630
 What I have to say continues 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.120
 here 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.820
 because I have new recording equipment 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.910
 I also explain briefly 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.210
 brand new i cut now with adobe 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.890
 after effects adobe premiere cs 60 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.030
 Something I cut mine now 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.130
 videos i also do and take now 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.530
 Videos separately on better quali and 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.850
 so not here now is not synonymous 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.280
 theresia because i'm in for video still like that 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.570
 can make 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.670
 maybe I will also with the new 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.700
 channel the webcam ball turn on yes 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.200
 I'll see what the world goes down 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.540
 then exactly when it comes up again 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.920
 I'll just delete it again 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.920
 long i call the team then and so 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.220
 get there if you agree 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.930
 because it will not be me 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.630
 that's up to you I do not know 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.250
 Whether that's a good idea Dubai is 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.890
 shock to listeners and I will 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.180
 that will definitely do it 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.040
 yes, I'm just a little further mine 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.480
 list 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.400
 yes I would be really early and over 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.160
 any support because yes currently 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.350
 start again at zero actually that 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.180
 means I will my new new channel 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.510
 will also be linked ingo in the video 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.550
 or descriptions wherever would 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.740
 Glad if he does that a bit 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.450
 I could spread two olli colleagues 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.800
 white is a little glow to advertise and to 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.750
 shit really does not like that 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.570
 but I do not want to be back 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.010
 really start from scratch because yes me 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.420
 knows I'd everything in this video 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.130
 I do not know how many people see 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.660
 are still on my old channel and 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.010
 Just so you know I have new ones 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.140
 channel I start again 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.580
 that's all I'm too 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.460
 I know I forgot something 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.230
 the description comes as it is 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.300
 really really everything you put that 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.680
 blocks so then I would say 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.890
 see us again on my new channel 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.770
 I hope at least otherwise 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.569
 see you again or I will someday 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.329
 but a few hundred subscribers 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.190
 have 100 mia bean duck and then 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.040
 suddenly again 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.040
 that will settle everything until then 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.090
 I wish a nice life 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.500
 I hope we see each other someday 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.500
 again and see you soon
