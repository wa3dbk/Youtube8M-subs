utter concealer math so the only

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.810 
utter concealer math so the only
annoying<00:04:52.500> thing<00:04:52.680> is<00:04:52.979> that<00:04:53.100> you<00:04:53.190> can<00:04:53.220> only<00:04:53.550> buy

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
these as part of the set and i think at

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.659 
these as part of the set and i think at
the<00:04:55.530> moment<00:04:55.560> they're<00:04:55.949> sold<00:04:56.190> out<00:04:56.280> so<00:04:56.460> i'm<00:04:56.520> not

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
the moment they're sold out so i'm not

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:57.980 
the moment they're sold out so i'm not
even<00:04:56.789> sure<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.270> it's<00:04:57.300> not<00:04:57.449> even<00:04:57.720> like<00:04:57.810> you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
even sure so it's not even like you

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.420 
even sure so it's not even like you
could<00:04:58.139> just<00:04:58.289> buy<00:04:58.410> two<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.889> leave<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.280> one

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
could just buy two and leave that one

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.760 
could just buy two and leave that one
off<00:04:59.639> so<00:05:00.270> it's<00:05:00.479> either<00:05:00.600> three<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.169> them<00:05:01.380> or<00:05:01.620> not

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
off so it's either three of them or not

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.170 
off so it's either three of them or not
at<00:05:01.919> all<00:05:02.070> but<00:05:02.340> hopefully<00:05:02.729> maybe<00:05:02.910> they'll

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
at all but hopefully maybe they'll

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.180
