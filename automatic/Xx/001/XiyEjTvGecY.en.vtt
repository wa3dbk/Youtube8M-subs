00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.490
 well hello welcome on easy contact today an exclusive for 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.270
 fatten up and we'll introduce you to a keyboard parapers like 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.420
 you can see a big thank you to our partner for the gaming point 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.669
 fr which allowed us to get what it is in all before 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.480
 the preview almost 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.699
 this is the black widow 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.460
 So here is life and rase 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.870
 the part cordially again 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.900
 it's mostly the duo 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.570
 my keyboard happily 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.300
 I do not know if you hear but mechanics 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.290
 % we go back to the heart mention 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.630
 were the good old recipes of yesteryear to know how to raise mechanically 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.190
 plus the hideous membranes that make 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.340
 a pleasant strike so the blackwidow that act of the entry of 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.980
 range between May 10 and 1 since only one woman is a workshop that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400
 sells 79 euros 80 euros 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.500
 there is a bit more version of the high-end that moves and and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.750
 the blackwidow ultimate be son who will be entitled to the backlighting of the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.910
 little things like that 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.560
 so an important thing today about mechanics have now 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 found macros which is still quite rare 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.760
 on the back of the box we will explain the ten warheads 2 a keyboard 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.789
 mechanics that we knew 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.289
 for those who propose macros we also knew who also offers some 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.340
 profit names the country and some multimedia keys 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.490
 so we pulled out 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.030
 the beast 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.170
 two options embarrassed 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.160
 yesterday 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.960
 % 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 each time quite hard the bar 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.340
 a thing that is very beautiful and very clear immediately on the other hand the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.380
 showcase 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.160
 it's a keyboard 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.010
 foot the bear a very heavy like all mechanical keyboards in general 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.120
 that's what it's worth on those dates 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.350
 so 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 here nothing 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.969
 here the rider 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.969
 Why 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.969
 yet the one who was elected as not yet open 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.709
 hence the fact that I am a little 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.989
 in the end we can not compensate a little what we thought galley 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:31.059
 does not prevent a small pocket 11 hours is the same as Sunday is 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.749
 that we are going today very gently 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.899
 in which we will find fork 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.329
 the authenticity certificate of authenticity 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:48.679
 emmanuelle devos fast a manual longer stickers 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.389
 to make room at the time of the deposit of the megane 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.540
 create a catalog of products china coffee 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.349
 the treatment 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.579
 then the opportunity of the exam 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.579
 it is obviously 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.399
 the bear as I said 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.320
 very quickly does not appeal to a finish 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.980
 very friendly not necessarily 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.699
 for the user 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.189
 because it's about dollars of assets so obviously it goes necessarily 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.089
 leave traces 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.629
 so enhances keys 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.120
 or not at all the profile since these mechanics with the life that use it 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.849
 in fact its weight this Thursday 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.840
 strong of this name 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.219
 finally 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.959
 you have not found much except for a few small parts for more 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.249
 information to correct it 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.249
 so I do not know if you mean it 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.549
 but it just happened over there the same is not that the 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.329
 multimedia keys here here here 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.069
 the eu countries have avoided their slightly backlit silhouette 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.129
 in my opinion not with always the same he is the best 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.760
 but I guess the civil engineering the most profit 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.239
 so anyway 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.479
 we will discuss it in a much more complete text future very very 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.209
 soon on cowcotland offers in any case thank you to all levels 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.479
 see you soon android
