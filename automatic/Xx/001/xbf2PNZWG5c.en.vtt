00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:01.479
 the agent 

00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:03.430
 or 3d 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.830
 make another short and simple video lesson 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.669
 To archer some doubts 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.439
 that people have 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.689
 with respect to recording the iso image 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:20.089
 is the case of stumbling will generate an operating system with all life is 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.679
 a comedy 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.890
 1 - 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.069
 But it's in the format, that's right. 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.919
 that's what happens 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.329
 normally 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.329
 these people to dawn 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 I try to give more flavor to give the boat after the installation in the air 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.540
 Hehehe 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.010
 not only can not be considered the reason 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.460
 so what happens is the following 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 created the short story that told 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.080
 although teaching you as a whole 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.400
 was made open 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.180
 opening nero 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.550
 you'll see that here's an option called a record label 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.650
 very simple record label 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.650
 I got here oh the big picture 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.950
 and then click image 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.180
 Then you will direct your arm to the folder. 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.470
 audit 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.470
 the busion cities just in case my is here 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.770
 this is the world 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.290
 so you injured 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.470
 you may notice that down here with the file type it is the renÃª point 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.120
 rg the point that because the point its hi 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.250
 she opening up here 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.540
 now always keep in mind you have to record on the foot that you can choose 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.160
 velocity by remembering that the higher the speed of 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.890
 bigger or me too 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.010
 the greater the possibility they already caused some error during the recording 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.430
 here, if you do not need to touch anything else 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.930
 nothing here too 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.880
 just watch it here 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.540
 send and record was already 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.220
 it will be very simple it does not have much more secrecy 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.780
 unfortunately some of the saints then 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.849
 so that's it folks that beat the defense of you, fearing imposing 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.119
 the arrangement between the broker 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.209
 with Brazil talking
