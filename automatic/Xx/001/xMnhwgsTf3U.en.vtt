some<00:00:22.650> time<00:00:22.769> we're<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> go<00:00:23.160> over<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:24.529> but

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
some time we're going to go over it but

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.490 
some time we're going to go over it but
the<00:00:25.730> Space<00:00:26.730> Shuttle<00:00:26.760> mode<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.349> cool

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the Space Shuttle mode it's really cool

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.400 
the Space Shuttle mode it's really cool
I<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.429> if<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:30.420> does<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.750> landing

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
I would like it if it does have landing

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.240 
I would like it if it does have landing
gear<00:00:32.180> guess<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.480> flip<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.050> out<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
gear guess I can just flip this out it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.910 
gear guess I can just flip this out it
takes<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.610> long<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:35.969> gonna<00:00:36.120> bother<00:00:37.910> wait<00:00:39.920> see

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
takes a long I'm gonna bother wait see

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.770 
takes a long I'm gonna bother wait see
this<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.309> happens<00:00:41.370> when<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.660> go

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
this is what happens when there you go

this is what happens when there you go
all<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.280> go<00:00:44.370> he's<00:00:44.550> got<00:00:44.670> landing

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
all right there you go he's got landing

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.069 
all right there you go he's got landing
gear<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> he<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.180> roll<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.870> just

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
gear so he can not really roll they just

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
gear so he can not really roll they just
stay<00:00:49.320> still<00:00:50.239> yeah<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.800> shuttle<00:00:53.250> mold<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
stay still yeah so the shuttle mold is

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
stay still yeah so the shuttle mold is
pretty<00:00:54.120> cool<00:00:54.350> now<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.710> ahead<00:00:55.800> and

pretty cool now let's just go ahead and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.549 
pretty cool now let's just go ahead and
transform<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.550> into<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.879> second<00:00:57.510> mode<00:00:57.660> just

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
transform it into a second mode just

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.680 
transform it into a second mode just
remove<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.190> gun<00:00:59.609> put<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> down<00:01:01.370> alright

turn around like so take this and just

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.380 
turn around like so take this and just
breaking<00:01:22.530> apart<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.100> turn<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> around

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.749 

you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.860> put<00:01:28.860> these<00:01:29.100> together<00:01:29.810> like<00:01:30.810> so

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
you know put these together like so

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.060 
you know put these together like so
these<00:01:32.970> panels<00:01:33.479> down<00:01:33.750> flip<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> down<00:01:34.710> there

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
these panels down flip that down there

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.749 
these panels down flip that down there
you<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.549> here's<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.210> gun<00:01:36.479> plop<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.110> here

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
you go here's the gun plop it right here

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.660 
you go here's the gun plop it right here
and<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.060> astro<00:01:39.780> train<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.200> his

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
and here we have astro train in his

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.039 
and here we have astro train in his
bullet<00:01:41.670> train<00:01:42.060> mode<00:01:43.369> now<00:01:44.689> this<00:01:45.689> mode<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
bullet train mode now this mode is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.870 
bullet train mode now this mode is
definitely<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.280> weakest<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> three<00:01:48.860> as

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
definitely the weakest of the three as

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.530 
definitely the weakest of the three as
you<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:52.159> i'm<00:01:53.159> guessing<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.119> supposed<00:01:54.479> to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
you can see i'm guessing the supposed to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810 
you can see i'm guessing the supposed to
be<00:01:54.600> model<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.079> one<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> bullet<00:01:56.250> trains<00:01:56.549> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
be model at one of the bullet trains in

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.859 
be model at one of the bullet trains in
Japan<00:01:56.850> or<00:01:57.360> whatever<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:59.270> some<00:02:00.270> people<00:02:00.750> have

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
Japan or whatever right some people have

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.090 
Japan or whatever right some people have
probably<00:02:01.049> already<00:02:01.229> mentioned<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.920> this

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
probably already mentioned like this

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.850 
probably already mentioned like this
part<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.490> fine<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.990> part<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.500> not<00:02:05.540> yeah

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
part is fine but this part is not yeah

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.620 
part is fine but this part is not yeah
you<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.369> windows<00:02:08.819> there<00:02:09.119> but

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
you can see like windows there but

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.500 
you can see like windows there but
and<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.980> random<00:02:12.340> gun<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.360> top<00:02:14.140> yeah<00:02:15.510> so

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and the random gun on the top yeah so

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.080 
and the random gun on the top yeah so
yeah<00:02:16.750> it's<00:02:17.290> not<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.650> best<00:02:17.800> mole<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:18.490> what<00:02:18.940> can

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
yeah it's not the best mole but what can

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.150 
yeah it's not the best mole but what can
you<00:02:19.180> do<00:02:19.320> all<00:02:20.320> right<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.590> let's<00:02:20.710> just<00:02:20.980> go<00:02:21.130> ahead

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
you do all right so let's just go ahead

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.750 
you do all right so let's just go ahead
and<00:02:21.370> transform<00:02:22.120> him<00:02:22.270> into<00:02:22.330> his<00:02:22.710> robot<00:02:23.710> mode

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and transform him into his robot mode

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.650 
and transform him into his robot mode
once<00:02:24.760> again<00:02:25.030> we<00:02:25.210> move<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.660> good<00:02:27.000> thank<00:02:28.000> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.860 

step<00:02:31.660> what<00:02:32.010> let's<00:02:33.010> take<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.510> bring<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.660> all

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
step what let's take this bring it all

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.450 
step what let's take this bring it all
the<00:02:34.900> way<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.040> side<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:38.310> bring<00:02:39.310> this

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
the way to the side and just bring this

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:48.110 
the way to the side and just bring this
down<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.380> open<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.470> hands<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:43.650> yeah

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
