00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
bit just to get the process going a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.830 
bit just to get the process going a

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
or naan or with rice you know so and

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.890 
or naan or with rice you know so and
chicken<00:05:50.850> sometimes<00:05:51.060> if<00:05:51.510> you<00:05:51.600> keep<00:05:51.780> it

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
chicken sometimes if you keep it

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.960 
chicken sometimes if you keep it
overnight<00:05:52.320> it<00:05:52.560> tends<00:05:52.830> to<00:05:52.979> get<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.430> little<00:05:53.729> dry

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
overnight it tends to get a little dry

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.380 
overnight it tends to get a little dry
so<00:05:54.870> we're<00:05:55.800> going<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.040> be<00:05:56.100> using<00:05:56.430> evaporated

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
so we're going to be using evaporated

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.840 
so we're going to be using evaporated
low-fat<00:05:57.810> evaporated<00:05:58.470> milk<00:05:58.500> actually<00:05:59.190> it's<00:05:59.729> a

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
low-fat evaporated milk actually it's a

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.570 
low-fat evaporated milk actually it's a
lot<00:06:00.080> lower<00:06:01.080> in<00:06:01.290> calories<00:06:01.830> so<00:06:02.130> we<00:06:02.250> won't<00:06:02.430> feel

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
lot lower in calories so we won't feel

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.940 
lot lower in calories so we won't feel
guilty<00:06:02.790> about<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.380> but<00:06:04.380> if<00:06:04.530> you<00:06:04.590> don't<00:06:04.770> have

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
you know access to this you know cream

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.560 
you know access to this you know cream
is<00:06:07.860> great<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.610> sometimes<00:06:09.210> actually<00:06:09.330> people

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
is great and sometimes actually people

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.480 
is great and sometimes actually people
put<00:06:09.900> you<00:06:10.290> know<00:06:10.410> a<00:06:10.590> little<00:06:10.800> bit<00:06:10.919> of<00:06:11.010> milk<00:06:11.220> you

just want to give it that moisture so

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.900 
just want to give it that moisture so
that<00:06:13.200> the<00:06:13.320> chicken<00:06:13.500> retains<00:06:14.070> its<00:06:14.310> motion<00:06:14.729> to

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
that the chicken retains its motion to

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.320 
that the chicken retains its motion to
dry<00:06:15.300> up<00:06:15.479> the<00:06:15.510> next<00:06:15.930> day<00:06:16.130> so<00:06:17.130> you<00:06:17.820> can<00:06:17.940> put<00:06:18.120> as

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
dry up the next day so you can put as

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.840 
dry up the next day so you can put as
much<00:06:18.570> or<00:06:18.900> as<00:06:18.930> little<00:06:19.169> as<00:06:19.650> you<00:06:19.860> want<00:06:19.890> off<00:06:20.430> the

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
much or as little as you want off the

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.640 
much or as little as you want off the
evaporated<00:06:21.360> milk<00:06:21.390> so<00:06:22.229> you're<00:06:22.350> going<00:06:22.470> to<00:06:22.530> add

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
evaporated milk so you're going to add

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:32.210 
evaporated milk so you're going to add
it<00:06:22.800> in

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.430 

I'd<00:06:33.220> say<00:06:33.400> but<00:06:33.550> this<00:06:33.759> is<00:06:33.820> about<00:06:34.090> half<00:06:34.930> a<00:06:35.020> cup<00:06:35.139> and

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
I'd say but this is about half a cup and

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.629 
I'd say but this is about half a cup and
it<00:06:36.190> will<00:06:36.370> again<00:06:36.910> as<00:06:37.180> it<00:06:37.389> cools<00:06:37.630> down<00:06:37.690> to<00:06:37.870> so<00:06:38.639> can

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
it will again as it cools down to so can

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.760 
it will again as it cools down to so can
add<00:06:39.759> as<00:06:39.910> much<00:06:40.060> as<00:06:40.120> you<00:06:40.300> need<00:06:40.470> I'm<00:06:41.470> gonna<00:06:41.620> go

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
add as much as you need I'm gonna go

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.730 
add as much as you need I'm gonna go
with<00:06:41.889> a<00:06:41.919> little<00:06:42.070> bit<00:06:42.190> more<00:06:42.539> and<00:06:43.620> you<00:06:44.620> know<00:06:44.710> I

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
with a little bit more and you know I

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.529 
with a little bit more and you know I
was<00:06:44.860> just<00:06:44.949> pouring<00:06:45.639> it<00:06:45.789> a<00:06:45.820> little<00:06:46.120> little<00:06:46.360> time

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:46.539 
was just pouring it a little little time

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.330

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
and the balance of this you don't really

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.990 
and the balance of this you don't really
have<00:06:50.740> to<00:06:50.860> throw<00:06:51.009> it<00:06:51.160> away<00:06:51.250> you<00:06:51.520> can<00:06:51.639> just<00:06:51.669> put
