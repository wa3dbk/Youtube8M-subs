00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.150
 titan penis or corpse flower 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.889
 the countries 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.000
 the largest flower in the world had 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.070
 is a meter thirty she can ride 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.420
 up to 3 meters so it's a small 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.609
 baby first at the phallus but for a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.619
 little baby we already have a very beautiful 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.779
 flower of the family as Rome where 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.230
 recognize very well there the shape of the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:31.890
 arums with these two parties is fighting and spa 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.020
 10 it's quite simple corpse flower 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.520
 because it aims to attract 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.680
 the flies she would do once all 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.360
 the ten years and it has to happen to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 catch the flies from the area for a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.930
 24 hours in ten years and for that is going 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.280
 must attract them from far and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.989
 how to attract a fly 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.450
 we make believe the old rotten meat 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.579
 for that we are red red color of the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.530
 flower one is hot so to go up in 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.000
 temperature in the evening and then we feel a 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.370
 good smell of corpse and like that a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 fly right away by seeing these 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.219
 big red lips 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.079
 this smell plus temperature said 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.000
 for sure it's a good corpses and so 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.899
 to be decent and it allows him to attract 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.899
 at least one kilometer 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.580
 this plant naturally she pushed to 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.230
 sumatra so in indonesia in a whole 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.760
 small area I have the size of the countries of 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.260
 loire and I think this plant is 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.390
 the symbol really the symbol of 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.890
 botanical gardens and without reaching a 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.150
 educational role so here we see that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.650
 lots of people interested understand 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.930
 what is an inflorescence a flower 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.880
 families stop them and that's it 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.020
 first role teaching second role 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.100
 of experimentation yes it's a certain 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.680
 number of experiments are done on 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.790
 on the rise in temperature of the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.110
 plant is it could we 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.450
 serve tomorrow I not heat our 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.250
 houses how the temperature rise 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.900
 how she manages to release odors 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.670
 to detect everything the time at which he 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.130
 must clear the smells and then 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.869
 third axis for gardens 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.280
 botanicals and of course the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.170
 conservation of endangered species 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.970
 given the very small area 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.800
 original cayla and in addition a little bit of 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.440
 black market on these requests 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.060
 excessively rare nature and therefore the 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.580
 botanical garden of bonn which has us 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.800
 offered this plant is well tried to 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.020
 the x cuttings and finally they get there 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.460
 by the way and by grain and then after the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.690
 broadcast not to be the only ones to 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.009
 to have it today a big one 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.840
 fifty botanical garden in the 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.190
 world to have it so that if there is 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.080
 really an accident even in the garden 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.480
 botanical good or in nature 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.890
 we can imagine reintroducing the plant 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.959
 this titan penis like all flowers there 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.570
 are two things parameters in life 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.340
 nor to be there and know love 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.360
 in these cases she turns burying 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.120
 the apple blossom becomes an apple and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.709
 either at the ap knew the love so in 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.180
 these cases there the flower fans like the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.040
 flower that you have in your bouquet 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.500
 at home the flora of euros which ends 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.820
 by falling off the criminal she's going to a 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.239
 little miserably I was going to say 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.940
 collapse quietly but surely 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.620
 within two days 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.600
 amorphophallus titanum or titan penis 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.769
 it is I presentiment come all the beauty 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.930
 of the river of a flower but it's 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.400
 extraordinary is extraordinary 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.470
 the color the little drops that loses 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.580
 above the smell the fact that it attracts 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.720
 thousands of people are already in 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.580
 banging on the windows of the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.040
 greenhouse to be able to return is the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.380
 plant that makes its effect that is 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.820
 completely surreal a lot of 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.140
 world is wondering but it's really a 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.910
 real flowers so much it looks like 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.580
 nothing else that exist so that's the 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.580
 flower to extraordinary par excellence
