 to enjoy the first video of this 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.799
 title that I did a few years ago 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.210
 weeks 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.010

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.030

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.590

 so this time I did not have the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.949
 courage to wait for everything but how 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.880
 of stop good must say that there I received 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.590
 package letters 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.420
 I thought moore wait a month 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.910
 to receive the order 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.109
 okay but wait a month to open the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.820
 two years it was not possible 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.199
 that's what I can do is you 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.090
 film the opening of these first two 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.009

 the opening of the 3rd police here I am you 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.610
 we are going to say that we are losing and throwing 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.430
 my videos so that's it so I'm going 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 start first by this one so 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.059
 it's a package so it's not like you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.530
 did it say mohamed habibi sylvie dumas 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.239
 looks like nothing but hey there that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.120
 moment I have more memory you see 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.840
 more but they have bubble baths 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 extraordinary and I advise you 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.170
 it's a bottle like that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.360
 related to ylang ylang 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 they are super beautiful and color your or 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.320
 bath in blue face is a killing so 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 there is little more to buy but in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 revenge what I did is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.690
 order hair products 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.430
 so that's like so organic it was a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.990
 private sale and when there are sales 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.909
 private of this mark I make the stock 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.920
 for the year dishes which there is a first 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.689
 shampoo so that the chamomile of a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.210
 support to mr for everything and it's not for 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.040
 So I took him two since 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 seems she loves this brand is real 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.400
 2 after shampoo also they are 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.970
 really good 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.950
 I really like a lot 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.650
 then I also have shampoos 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.360
 since it's really the only ones who 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.250
 walk right now beyond this is the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.670
 shampoo to the money I never 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.079
 tried'm here it's nothing that's vitality 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.020
 oh yes it's really good lavender 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.149
 Anyway these super fun starts counter 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.549
 so there it is to have hair 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.890
 normal then my favorite of all 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.000
 time is it to the wild rose so 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.110
 its volumes and care and without hyper good 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.569
 the smell is really great people swim 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.579
 at least 10 so it's not my super 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.829
 discovery for me but and I believe 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.600
 same as I had taken a second I 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.709
 here I have three shampoo the second 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.979
 it's the same it's a second run 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.270
 wild reeds go to mahler had 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.619
 also took a third after 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.140
 shampoo robin it's good I'll think a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.789
 little shampoo here she has what to do 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.679
 so strangely she does not use anymore 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.759
 after shampoo shampoo then there 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.170
 it's the inverted which is more than 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.700
 champagne that the after shampoo I know 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.349
 not you but hey it's weird 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.910
 one of them learned that only one after 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.069
 shampoo for three dot fields and 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.510
 it's the one at the request then to the 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.220
 almond blossom oil almond blossoms 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.620
 of his loved ones the dry 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.940
 I love it turns the rsa 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.079
 last court I remind him since 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.400
 I ordered because actually when 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.110
 you order for those one month after 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.160
 so you have a little bit of forget about this 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.620
 what was in the order 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.660
 the last case excuse to ben voila I 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.980
 took a shower gel with the flower to round off 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.060
 you if she pushes that's it 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.739
 awesome 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.019
 so I bought it month by month 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.079
 format and in there the sale of bicycles 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.290

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.500
 the weather especially they have some 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.269
 synthetic characters that are really 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.220
 great if they do not lose hair 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.370
 by the way you know I used 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.400
 very very very often so there I received 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.689
 the new collection 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.939
 it's a pity it's the new 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.409
 collection two persos synthetic for 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.299
 the face of which there are four 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.950
 the bigger the box is usually there is 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.480
 no boxes like that they changed 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.890
 in a leopard box to terror 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.480
 brilliant with Senegalese writing 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.670

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.010

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.840
 so there is this brush so my at each 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.859
 time there is a project guy that's also 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.750
 great because when you wash them 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.209
 you can put back over that avoids 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.950
 that the monkey to 8 that your brush he 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.780
 it's hot there just like that and the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.790
 last so this is a version 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.220
 beveled so that for the blush with 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.689

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.250
 I'm going to stop there video is in 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.659
 did I only realize since the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.120
 early sent I made a bun to 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.530
 larache press or film that but the 206 in 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.909
 end of the day beige shoes and I 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.040
 realize that from the beginning I have 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.389
 a rebellious wick in fact that makes a 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.150
 hump I play on the side 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.650
 so it's absolutely horrible I you 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.819
 find tomorrow for the continuation and the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.359
 video so as I told you 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.010
 before I received my package make up 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.049
 for ever from home near the same 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.030
 change the boxes now that's it 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.079
 pink and just like it's going to see the postman 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.729
 at least that's what you asked for 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.650
 you did a month that I'm here but 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.320
 my void order francesca will arrive 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.760
 it takes me a long time to get to 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.949
 at least a month and a half short 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.090
 so here's the box is there so I'm going 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:35.900
 open it so if I get there so I 'll 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.900
 do it in front of 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.650
 that's it you can then with 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.500
 as usual there is ok fly to 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.870
 inside you can meet 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.960
 quickly so that's my order 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.160
 looks like that so we'll start everything 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.860
 right away at school holds the living room I 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.630
 learned that that so the first yes in 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.910
 the more I do not even know their son that's the 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.550
 whole box so the first one is the 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.320
 137 I ordered this color so I 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.030
 not sure if you're going to see here 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.920
 I ordered this color to go 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.610
 with my blog so I ordered two 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.610
 grape colors 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.150
 here are now dying ten times it serves 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 so I order and this eyeshadow 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.370
 for every day actually to have 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.900
 a little more violating tone could be 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.610
 my lipstick and you 'll want 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.820
 my new bluff at mac next 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.080
 so number 24 is an orange tree not 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.300
 so this one I will certainly 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.100
 use it in the summer party on the eyelid 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.390
 mobile 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.830
 good once tanned past when we 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.750
 is white as a stamp it's going to be 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.730
 terrible then 121 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.170
 what is it in my god knows 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.490
 manage will only solve a schedule of 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.470
 Advent admit it excitement every 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.030
 morning we have to sell his sail there 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.040
 it's a thing of faith yes so that's 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.750
 the second part of purple is therefore in 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.460
 done is the priest a little darker 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.930
 to put in the hollow since I 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.660
 taken both actually for associates 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.580
 together 164 stay the ton they 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.380
 called so-called milk coffee so 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.120
 this one is super it is a brown 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.470
 in fact 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.110
 wait and that's going to be great for 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.890
 smoky transition colors by 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.690
 too much hyper keller wants to be brief here is 166 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.150
 what do you not fall for 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.670
 hit his cappuccino so good to the saint 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.350
 maroon very dark or so these contracts 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.970
 site I do not know because I took a 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.520
 to return board to a grid in fact 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.540
 anthracite say again I do not know too much 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.190
 which is actually I took two 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.960
 very dark color ca I play it 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.180
 well their subject is too good it's 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.520
 a very pale pale pink you see that 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.170
 pale pink very very clear wrong for 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.530
 actually make the entire eyelid mobile 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.660
 when I want a makeup artist a little 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.270
 broken contrast we'll say but 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.920
 clear and matte not shiny and brief 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.620
 so I really needed it so the 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.790
 last to salute this contract if you 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.320
 know that before the last one is the 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.020
 sandstone so I'll put them next to you 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.660
 so yes good it's not fundamentally 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.910
 different mega 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.910
 she insults to eschau that one is cold 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.130
 I ordered two powders 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.980
 from the top evil to fion admire had here 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.450
 for me so it looks like that take 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.430
 a Cameroonian who is actually you are going 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.350
 especially the figure it hides well it moves 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.660
 not it avoids shining finally here 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.920
 it was really super produced 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.300
 gateway but four o'clock we are 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.420
 really very rarely in the last 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.790
 brushes this last product also so 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.820
 it's because of the heroes n it's this one 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.830
 I love this kind of brush especially 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.090
 to put that white on the 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.940
 eyebrow etc 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.440
 so that's the square brush like that 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.250
 I will be able to compare to the mac that 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.040
 I have the same 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.870
 here are the movies and videos baal boxing 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.250
 with all the orders and have finished 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.840
 seven times otherwise I hope it will be 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.190
 not too long in any case me I the 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.210
 really see yourself fully enjoying 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.980
 all these products 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.090
 I really have a lot to all 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.680
 to use the headlights make up for ever 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.330
 as for me I did everything very very 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.650
 big kisses as usual and your 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.950

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.950
