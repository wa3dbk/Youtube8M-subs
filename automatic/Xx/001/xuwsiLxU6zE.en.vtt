00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.889
 teach 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.549
 how to insert tricks in medieval 2 total 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.940
 war the tricks plus the tricks that are most 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.949
 they use in my opinion the side of those who 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.400
 more use me and those who can most serve 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:25.480
 you who are three in particular 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.119
 and see what you think to begin is 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.599
 Once you get any faction same vale 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:36.019
 I'm going to catch Spain 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.640
 we start a match, you do not have to 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.050
 you start game to put the tricks 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.160
 but this can be done in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.160
 counter or shared cop 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 ballet these tricks they will facilitate us 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 100% 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.170
 what is the great campaign if you want 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.410
 have large armies and conquer 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.850
 everyone in a few days 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.850
 you can use these tricks 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.610
 and you get bored with both are in crisis and 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.880
 all that you can do but my 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:16.659
 opinion is better to play it without tricks but 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:21.939
 first I'll show you a trick 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:24.880
 It is like raising money because it 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.539
 we open the cheat console that 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.560
 is the eÃ±e and let's say and we put with two 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:35.189
 of this low bar 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.790
 moody we need is everything we can together 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.119
 all we separate and we put a 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.090
 amount you do not use the normal 99 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.149
 while we arrive center 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.859
 and there as you see our gold has gone up what 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.189
 it's worth it then we put the trick on many 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.189
 times 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.680
 you see in the first turn we already have 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.670
 all this gold 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.229
 it's worth the next turn 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.790
 for the next one he had the following 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.649
 trick 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.900
 It will be like building 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.629
 everything from one 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.670
 population throughout the tour not worth it 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.709
 if we did everything we squeeze another 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.709
 time and we put the following 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.760
 process for dry low 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.760
 there is how it is 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:38.340
 r css for dry low 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.960
 pq sorry then 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.860
 here now we put 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.650
 the meals we can 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.550
 the population where you can in which 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.680
 we want to use this trick 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.700
 and obsess enter 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.670
 and as you see the row has reduced us 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.799
 we put the trick several times until 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.799
 all buildings are exhausted 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.299
 you see we already have a lot of troops 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.430
 we can do the same with other 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.050
 cities is an example, well, let's go 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.270
 we erase the population and put the 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.760
 name of the population as it is worth 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:34.720
 important accents 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.020
 but not selected the buildings and 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.570
 As you can see, this will help us 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.850
 very much what is the construction and already 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.280
 you will not have to wait so long 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.590
 OK 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.720
 now next trick 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.370
 I do not recommend this trick because 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.180
 if it does not make the game much easier 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:00.500
 but come on, you are free xeneize 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:06.590
 and again and you put double low bar 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:09.040
 or 3d hehe works fw and click there 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.040
 center 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.730
 As you can see what the whole map reveals, there is no 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.769
 fog 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.750
 and with this trick, you can follow 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.050
 all movements of the console without 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.060
 no problem so facilitating then if 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.160
 you have some enemy because you will already know 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.080
 when they are going to attack you and when 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.550
 intercept him why do not you 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.250
 I recommend because if there are no surprises 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.560
 in the game and it's fun to 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.650
 remove the trick the same thing we put double 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.580
 fire and it is deactivated 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.000
 the next trick will be to increase 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.000
 the population 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.240
 for this I put to again as 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.050
 before with the money 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.940
 population 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.940
 then now we put in quotes 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.430
 the population that we want to do the trick 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.969
 and now we put the amount of 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.830
 inhabitants that we want to add and we have 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.080
 the trick several times 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.810
 as you see an unlocked the wall of 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.660
 stone 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.350
 then for this you do the same 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.420
 automatic construction procedure 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.849
 dry process 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.389
 OK 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.389
 Y 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.289
 as you can see is what all the 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.289
 buildings 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.580
 available in the population number 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.580
 that we have put before 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.080
 As you can see there are already buildings up to eight 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.259
 construction shifts there are 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.440
 practically at the end of the period and 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:58.030
 all this in the first of the turn here 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.270
 we already have the great cathedral in the first 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.270
 turn 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.689
 taxes have gone up a lot already 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.149
 we have lots of available units 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:17.370
 what are the piqueros the measurements 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:21.210
 roller skates 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.990
 the great the Finns these here is 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.270
 the cathedral announced 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.710
 Now I'm going to do the same but with the 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.400
 castle 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.400
 what will it be 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.619
 population of the tribe 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.479
 population 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.699
 in this case the toledo 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.600
 and the number of inhabitants we want 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.760
 introduce we put it several times 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.620
 we select and go again to 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.880
 teak process 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.880
 process that is 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.790
 Toledo 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.300
 and here we already have what is the 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:14.110
 city was already in the first shift with 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.110
 all your improvements 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.620
 already what would be found with this already 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.410
 we could conquer then any 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.890
 population that presents itself to us and as 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.320
 you see 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.320
 we already have feudal knights in the 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.380
 First shift soldiers with backs 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.680

 nothing 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.990
 and well then and from here 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.240
 you start doing your missions 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.600
 you have a fun time massacring 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.600
 your enemies 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.770
