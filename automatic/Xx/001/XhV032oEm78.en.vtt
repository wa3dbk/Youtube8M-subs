00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 hello ana sons of bitches 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.660
 do not wait for you not 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.740
 that are my audience and they are going to put the stars 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.040
 Well today I'll give you reasons why you should shoot yourself if you have 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040
 a console or change to the pc 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.320
 in the PC you can modify the graphics of the games to your liking and not wait for 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.359
 see what the programmers say 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.270
 the pc has antialiasing for 16 and filtering antis tropic 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.109
 thing that consoles do not 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.340
 because the pc can have updates that not only improve the performance of the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.420
 game but also repair box and improve the gameplay 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.880
 by the mox in the apc you can modify your game as many times as you sing in 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.950
 change in the console this is not possible because its structure is crap 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.210
 the free expansions for pc like him the coas for the best saga of the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.730
 world 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.880
 alzola time 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.950
 6 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.400
 The advantage of having a keyboard which is easier to handle and allows 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 Set the keys to make you more comfortable 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.350
 the bad taste to shoot with total precision 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.340
 more comfortable and you do not have to walk around with those ugly crowns 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.730
 If you prefer you can put a I insisted katu pc 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.700
 You can tune the PC your way to make it more fun 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.000
 the pc will have direct x11 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.450
 and the consoles do not 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.420
 The structure of the PC makes it possible for you to get the most out of 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.270
 technology 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.990
 like the great processors of 80 cores instead 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.619
 the ps3 only has one core and 8 mini devices that help but are not 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.920
 nuclear and because of that the console does not even reach the speed of the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.570
 toaster with its 9 ghz 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.140
 the pc reaches 14 ghz with its quad-core processors of 3 or 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.310
 4 ghz of speed 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.159
 many complain about the laziness of installing the game but the people 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.320
 smart like me and a subscriber looked we know that that time makes it 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.069
 give faith in the game and that I enjoyed it more when you play it 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.440
 all the time that is lost when installing 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.109
 It is won in loading time 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.480
 also if you install it, you do not have to worry about the disc disappearing 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:22.259
 there are not like the powerful readers of the pc who do not hurt the PC or 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.259
 themselves unlike the one of the caÃ­ station 3 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.900
 Sorry that that escaped me that is broken only damages your console due to 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.899
 that makes you try too hard to read the disk 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:38.679
 PC games are cheap, not like console games that are always more expensive 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.330
 because sony and microsoft 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.419
 they put a tax on the game for the license and if you can not download the 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:46.549
 14 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.719
 you should not waste a bunch on an HD TV 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.709
 you should not have a black steamroller a white toaster in your house 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.039
 16 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.019
 the consoles break easily 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.919
 and they are very difficult to repair instead the pc can repair it yourself 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.209
 17 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.289
 Being close to the monitor means that you feel close to what you feel 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.429
 also generates the mauser and helps the excitement of games such as in 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:14.389
 to jubail 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:15.639
 18 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.939
 those who say that consoles are better because they are cheaper this is 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.349
 the answer that most makes me meet g 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.499
 My sons 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:27.599
 what guilt is bilingual and if they are poor vagabonds that do not reach them 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.249
 for a used chewing gum 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:33.680
 it is also worth it for the quality of the games and the extra activities that 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:34.719
 can you do 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:35.959
 19 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.519
 in the pc you can surf the internet in the easiest way and make videos with 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 I tell it and moby mater like me now 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.329
 in the apc you can play online with many more players than with the 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.309
 consoles 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:50.579
 twenty-one 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.099
 all the games look better I started and they are more fun 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:55.939
 22 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.400
 in the PC can play all the games with emulators or loading a system 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.359
 oldest virtual operating 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.090
 here I say goodbye and coherent
