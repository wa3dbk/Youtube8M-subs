00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.260
 quinté it will be the criterium of 5 years 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.420
 which brought together 17 participants and for 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
 talk about this pretty group 1 we have 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 with us at the michel bourgeois on the mount 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.769
 golden michel hello cédric is a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.840
 wonderful test 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 we have fun in all the best five 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.160
 years at the beginning there may be horses 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.420
 which seem to stand out clearly 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.940
 others in this event 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.380
 what will be your favorite michel then it's 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.790
 as I wanted to clarify also 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.770
 it's true we have some good horses 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.660
 that comes off the paper and we have the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.430
 luck the best gets really to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 best of their shape for this purpose it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.910
 no had any prep glitches are 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.620
 somehow in their wedding dress 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.660
 besides the first three of the price 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.000
 jockey to know a guy of heri 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 the pan universe as well as hull in the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.239
 lot there are exactly who are 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.190
 represented my favors will be universe 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.010
 two passes and protected from philippe 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.629
 daugeard philippe daugeard with a lot 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.670
 by the way the universe glade the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 time there is little jostled and it's true 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.299
 that we are going to have transformed these 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.290
 past seasons to climb among 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.119
 the best of his generation 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.890
 after a break in the winter it is 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.750
 income at best in the spring he has aligned 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 five successes including 3 semi-classical level 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.770
 there is good running in the price 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 jockey and he will this time be deferré 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.530
 four feet for the first time 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.960
 of her career 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.880
 so it's more exactly true to that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.560
 costs and artifices so for the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.180
 first time we try something and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.220
 the first time as we say it can 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 to be the right one 1 why not at the end 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.250
 of a course I want to say if he 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.990
 had the selective drive that awaits him at 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 close to the first and finish at the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.850
 wind speed 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.920
 exactly what you said it's a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.009
 horse that must absolutely run hidden 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 that they close to the other favorite a guy 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.610
 of heripré on the 15th that you have placed in 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.420
 second it's exactly this election 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.890
 he needs a hidden route the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.310
 small constraint but if it happens 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.710
 simply blue jay won this event 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.479
 now in a five safety criterium 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.040
 years on 3000 m there are often a lot of 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.899
 rhythm one can think that the test is going 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.820
 to be very selective so this not too much 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.500
 annoying to advanced world power 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.090
 hide he will have every opportunity to place his 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.220
 speed peak to finish on especially 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.629
 this first match is waiting to come back 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.340
 after my second favorite a guy 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.980
 of heripré as both just cited to 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.040
 the moment it's cooked can go ahead 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.959
 if the need for riot games jean michel 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.209
 bazire waited waited behind the 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.260
 first in the shelter then he shifted it 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.090
 at the entrance of the straight line and it is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.590
 come to surely take the advantage 5 1 a 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.879
 choice that is able to go ahead 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.129
 had seen it in continental twitter 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.959
 sylla guermantes exactly push button 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.549
 up and a ten offenses what is 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.170
 not nothing he can do everything and well 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.760
 cleared of the four exactly and the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.170
 modes exactly been unfeathered from the four 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.580
 feet for the first time it will be 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.349
 this time a new way so 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.849
 why not the second time it was at 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.590
 price of america it's a little hurts 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.239
 past and the valette has further corrected 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.220
 rhythm there exactly was competitive 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.910
 before being disqualified but it's true 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.170
 that we will find the weight 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.730
 of his career will be that I was one of 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.349
 four feet and why not been part 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.150
 of course low then and power of 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.500
 this criterium 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.599
 we can also add that jean michel 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.280
 bazire announced in our columns that he 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.640
 would not hesitate the front if he 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.720
 needed with them with rhythms 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.670
 so do you have a favorite 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.780
 to detach in this word a favorite 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.040
 so it can be a choice 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.660
 which will be very played but it will be the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.609
 number 3 1 up the queen 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.170
 it's a horse that still has to pump 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.840
 and serious progress in recent months 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.220
 will develop attempt quite so 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.620
 some show two cases of several 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.519
 floors it's going to be easier than that will go 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.919
 run in jockey prize 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.250
 even though he was no longer dangerous 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.389
 these behaviors or the name radware 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.829
 exactly how hard it is to effort 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.970
 three bins to suit him that's 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.560
 true that he is not always very frank 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.940
 departure it loses it's not big 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.709
 pain but after he can return 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.470
 over 3000 m and why not start 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.730
 like surprises and for a 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.230
 fifth place it's not a 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.760
 impossibility like others elsewhere 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.859
 it is often only in the criterium of 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.359
 5 years has often seen surprises and 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.340
 even sometimes surprise laureates 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.130
 to win an odds outsider outsider 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.269
 on Saturday it would surprise me who is when 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.590
 even an outsider who impose themselves but 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.319
 in the top five why if that's 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.239
 true it is unclear decide a given case 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.410
 shock we can detach before duval ago 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.239
 little quick also who was following the 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.579
 first cited it is hard to see how the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.400
 word to escape them so when you have 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.870
 quoted the 3rd the green as a favorite 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.340
 but it's also a surprise 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.109
 so what would you also have a 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.940
 second surprise then I have a cloud 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.290
 of osmosis also a it's true he 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.540
 will be deferré all four feet for the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.190
 first time to the key he has already been told 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.859
 in the past but up there this time 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.329
 this is the first time 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.979
 in the key it can also do the 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.810
 difference it will be hard to effort the 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.860
 3-bet debré had to agree is not 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.240
 always very simple at first but 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.310
 able to make pretty 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.930
 back if everything goes well if he decides 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.129
 and is also able to take a 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.270
 very beautiful place to beautiful cote 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.039
 what to do bretons we had seen 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.169
 by the way in May 2012 in 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.669
 Criterium of 4 years he had taken the 6th 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.710
 place yet been very far in the 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.389
 course and cholet beautiful final effort 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.800
 exactly and even in the spring on guard 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.969
 carefully guarded by a horde and 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.379
 you will see exactly lots of good 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.699
 compounds it can be also a very 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.710
 good surprise for quality lovers 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.520
 you have to include it in a ticket 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.469
 quite his place 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.569
 so we will resume your selection 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.159
 in order then after you have place in 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.930
 third position the 14 draws in 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:05:00.460
 devaluing dubalen exactly him it's 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.960
 also l 3 2 m to renew the truce a 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.520
 sensitive guy exactly in price 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.229
 jockey and waited behind 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.330
 animator an exact love life but the 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.340
 horse ended well close to both 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.110
 favorites that placed him at the top of our 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.310
 selection it's true he gave me 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.830
 four feet as in clinton 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.210
 continental why not a TV 4 he 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.680
 can also be of the test 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.009
 insects as you said it's very 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.750
 just 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.060
 he can now finish in vo 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.949
 we then his return to the cape 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.930
 detainees finish very well to take the 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.580
 first three it's true that even in 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.039
 waiting he can be very very 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.050
 dangerous and so the fourth base so 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.879
 we did not talk about it made the fourth 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.770
 place of this quinté will be lé 16 human 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.360
 kpan koui that a protected franck 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.229
 leblanc is always present at this level 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.699
 of the competition 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.500
 good logic or if he should do that 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.990
 recourse that's why not how to say 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.819
 in group tail in team meets 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.400
 always present so why not for 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.750
 the slaughterhouse prepared with care and déferré 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.370
 when these patients is less successful 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.710
 this time directly if we listen to 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.089
 to do only c in the grandfather 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.400
 also starts from open quick it's 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:59.680
 maybe a tone below in class 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.900
 pure of the other three but during 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.270
 a stretcher directly visible one can 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.129
 not do without me and in sixth 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.080
 position you placed the treasure us to be 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.969
 used to be these annoying boarder of 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.500
 jean etienne dubois when he places a 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.639
 tone below the first 4 but they 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.680
 answer always present in the 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.139
 semi- classics still at the head of 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.490
 beaten behind these four 4 horses 1 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.080
 logically it will be deferrée of 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.699
 later as often and he has his 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.259
 place of course in a quinté 1st sense 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.490
 as the 12th a love girl you placed 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.630
 in eighth position then we saw it 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.540
 run in the price 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.190
 the joker is barred by the sick and 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.580
 guarantor and day there these are his real 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.690
 racing 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.220
 exactly it was not theirs 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.350
 very active but still after the 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:43.990
 runs very well for a place also 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:46.420
 a song very well so I'm going 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.010
 summarize your selection say it this 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.680
 universe of pan le 15 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.680
 a guy of heri the 14th at the ball the 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.540
 June 16th since August 3rd the green which 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.810
 will be your favorite recalls the 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.640
 13th annual use me to Leucate osmosis and 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.200
 finally the 12th a love girl is this 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.210
 that there are some forbidden in his 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.280
 plans so yes I scratched the number had 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.190
 a lot I find on previous solo 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.140
 as well as a list of rabary also 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.570
 the buick a hull is what we 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.920
 unfortunately show will stay ironed that me 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.480
 seems still complicated to wancourt to 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.740
 As successful as they melody 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.150
 are completed by those played 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.260
 higher-performance melodies than by 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.300
 the past is a pity 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.250
 four owls that should not 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.200
 appear on arrival who have trouble to 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.030
 to appear on arrival before the stroke then 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.320
 what advice would I give to you ? 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.900
 wait then it's true that there are four 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.550
 bazin the 17 the 15 14 and the crm 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.260
 expect 'strokes if this report 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.340
 the four are the art not expect to 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.380
 big reports I'll take a 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.850
 small risk possibly by proposing 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.950
 just a multi by taking my two 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.960
 first in base say this universe of 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.090
 ban with the 15 with herério to play 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 to multi in reduced field in flexi followed 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.660
 from 14 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.050
 a horror of the val du 16 open quid du 3 

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:55.260
 us needs the treasure to me of cloud 4-1 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.790
