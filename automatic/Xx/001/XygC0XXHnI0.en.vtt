00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.090

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.090
 here 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.580

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.630
 milan we do ourselves actually on 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.630
 of the questions you showed me 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.710
 Oh yes 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.090
 to 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.090
 handle 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.950
 there was no Sicily 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.950
 no 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.830
 thing 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.830
 Mamma Mia 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.640
 so 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.780
 single auctions 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:45.020
 and this does not deserve 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.020
 from messina pistoia pescara 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.150
 but the legs 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.220
 no 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.330
 the text 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.330
 but if the first one 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.080
 or not 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.900
 too little 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.870
 now 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.200
 all d 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.710
 all 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.480
 are david mornings 22 years old and I manage 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.280
 and official spaces of the little mixes 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.980
 together two other girls yasmin e 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.700
 camilla and we started managing them 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.260
 already since they had won at xfactor e 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.660
 we continue to follow them because we believe 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.849
 whether they are an original group or not 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.400
 still exists in the global level 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.620
 in the music well for me the little mixes 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.319
 I am like I said before a group that 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.910
 it does not exist ie it is not there I am not type 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.040
 equal to the expenses charged to the race 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.200
 the car others are therefore original for 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.750
 this and then I think the music that 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.220
 make is a music that comes straight to the 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.769
 heart of fans and people anyway 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.950

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.110

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.729
