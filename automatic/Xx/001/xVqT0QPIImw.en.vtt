00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
engine years ago I don't even know that

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.989 
engine years ago I don't even know that
you<00:01:12.630> could<00:01:12.659> find<00:01:13.109> a<00:01:13.289> feature<00:01:13.889> where<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.789> had

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
you could find a feature where you had

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.719 
you could find a feature where you had
to<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.240> no<00:01:15.889> cold-start<00:01:16.889> enrichment<00:01:17.459> of<00:01:17.549> any

to do no cold-start enrichment of any

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.940 
to do no cold-start enrichment of any
kind<00:01:17.969> whether<00:01:18.179> it<00:01:18.359> be<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> prime<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> choke<00:01:19.560> my

kind whether it be a prime or a choke my

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.139 
kind whether it be a prime or a choke my
understanding<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.429> that<00:01:20.459> they<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.819> had<00:01:21.030> at

within<00:01:32.789> the<00:01:32.850> company<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.299> will<00:01:33.840> prototype

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
within the company that will prototype

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.929 
within the company that will prototype
different<00:01:34.619> designs<00:01:34.889> like<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.819> then

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
different designs like this one and then

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.249 
different designs like this one and then
we'll<00:01:36.090> bring<00:01:36.299> customers<00:01:36.569> in<00:01:36.959> and<00:01:37.139> we'll<00:01:37.229> have

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we'll bring customers in and we'll have

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.749 
we'll bring customers in and we'll have
them<00:01:37.499> vote<00:01:37.709> on<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.100> feels<00:01:38.340> most<00:01:38.609> comfortable

them vote on what feels most comfortable
to<00:01:39.090> them<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:40.259> idea<00:01:40.289> is<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.159> good

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:41.639 
to them the idea is you know good

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.029 
to them the idea is you know good
ergonomics<00:01:42.299> good<00:01:42.569> aesthetics<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.829> want<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
be able to grab onto it and it's got to

feel good to you well you know we in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.069 
feel good to you well you know we in
engineering<00:01:47.999> we<00:01:48.090> talk<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.479> different<00:01:48.630> kinds

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
engineering we talk to different kinds

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
engineering we talk to different kinds
of<00:01:49.170> posers<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.520> don't<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.789> is

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
of posers and I don't this is

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.370 
of posers and I don't this is
politically<00:01:51.149> correct<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.659> grandma<00:01:51.959> pole<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
politically correct the grandma pole and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.499 
politically correct the grandma pole and
then<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.560> he-man<00:01:52.740> pole<00:01:53.099> and<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.399> try<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.389> make

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
then the he-man pole and we try and make

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.370 
then the he-man pole and we try and make
it<00:01:54.539> so<00:01:54.779> it<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.049> takes<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.289> cram<00:01:55.469> before

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 

the<00:02:02.280> last<00:02:02.700> more<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.030> were<00:02:03.090> looking<00:02:03.330> at<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> had

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the last more we were looking at it had

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.660 
the last more we were looking at it had
a<00:02:03.659> recoil<00:02:04.050> style<00:02:04.409> starter<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.310> particular

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
a recoil style starter this particular

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
a recoil style starter this particular
one<00:02:05.970> has<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.360> electric<00:02:06.690> start<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.200> we're<00:02:07.530> then

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
one has the electric start so we're then

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.279 
one has the electric start so we're then
one<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.369> step<00:02:08.700> closer<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.300> an<00:02:09.390> automobile<00:02:09.660> we

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
one one step closer to an automobile we

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.990 
one one step closer to an automobile we
have<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.440> push-button<00:02:10.679> start<00:02:11.100> switch<00:02:11.730> right

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
have a push-button start switch right

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.970 
have a push-button start switch right
here<00:02:12.209> which<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.020> very<00:02:13.080> nice<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.620> convenient

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
here which is very nice and convenient

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.800 
here which is very nice and convenient
and<00:02:14.280> really<00:02:15.030> we're<00:02:15.150> kind<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.360> proud<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.720> this

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and really we're kind of proud of this

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.630 
and really we're kind of proud of this
mower<00:02:16.260> because<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.680> kind<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.010> speaks<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
mower because it kind of speaks to the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.430 
mower because it kind of speaks to the
21st<00:02:18.060> century<00:02:18.390> it's<00:02:18.540> got<00:02:18.720> some<00:02:18.930> new<00:02:19.050> styling
