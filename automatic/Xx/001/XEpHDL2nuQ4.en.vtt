00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.980
 I hate flying tails the agglomerations 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.160

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.730
 often continuously the truth 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.490

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.570
 I'm going to throw a passenger on the plane 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.520
 every 20 minutes someone who is on board 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.740
 threatens to kill one passenger every 20 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.369
 minutes if you do not transfer 150 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.990
 millions of dollars to this account 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.460
 we are in the middle of the Atlantic as 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.090
 be stopped 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.420
 they will pay attention 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.100

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.009

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.700

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.680
 lr and the white house and interpol confirmed 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.360
 in the reports that an agent 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.750

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.750
