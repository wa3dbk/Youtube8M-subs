00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.610
 on 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.639
 m 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.639
 Yes 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.630
 a topic that keeps us especially long 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.500
 the water was frustrating 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.869
 kept free 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.270
 the problem will be with many of you 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.310
 security we had that 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.829
 huge problem that we have here in november 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.119
 are retired in this stall and 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.190
 nothing was prepared at all 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.399
 we went for the classic 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.180
 Method decided a bathtub so 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:46.370
 strictly speaking, a cast-iron 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.170
 bathtub the whole converts and one 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.620
 Burner put in so that the water 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.170
 frost-free remains the principle is relative 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 Simply explain the bathtub 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.999
 put it down as hard as we can 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.809
 for that gems taken around them 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.809
 stabilize 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.690
 then the whole thing would be completely packed 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.390
 with non-combustible insulating wool and outside 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.280
 I have a protection from wood I have in 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.440
 this case for cost reasons easy 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.050
 probably taken out of laminate 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.860
 but only one or two years stops 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.229
 for the time being the purpose is fulfilled 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.049
 on the back a small opening 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.210
 leave with a door and here 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.020
 into it you can then the paraffin 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.110
 burners make a paraffin burner 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.640
 you can imagine like a big one 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.100
 kerosene lamp in the end really 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.880
 nothing else just that the backbone 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.920
 Made of sheet metal, you work that 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.850
 just as it just simply has it 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.229
 a wick soaked continuously 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.820
 is through the tank with paraffin and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.420
 but it is infected and burns 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.659
 continuously the paraffin is nothing 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.329
 other than liquid candle wax the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.490
 The big advantage of this is that such a 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.079
 filling so at least ten days stops 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.649
 means you have to really ten days 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.810
 Do not worry if the flame is still burning 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.060
 we have as an alternative for us 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.760
 petroleum discovers the paraffin 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.100
 really so piggy is cost 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.910
 five liters canister I think so 50 60 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.260
 euro and petroleum gets the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.150
 actual every supermarket 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.190
 aftertaste 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.460
 only the disadvantage of petroleum 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.070
 the upper one sees the cover of this 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.400
 burner quickly sooty and thereby the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.610
 Flame erase can best cover off 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.620
 just let it go under your legs 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.470
 put 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.530
 These cast iron baths are momentary 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.850
 really become a rarity 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.260
 but you can have a look if we 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.600
 maybe walk with their horses 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.980
 goes or even walk applies if 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.960
 maybe some farmer one 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.640
 bathtub has to stand on the pasture 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.800
 Her meat is no longer needed 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.010
 have the experience that the 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.430
 bathtub with this race underneath 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.640
 So at least at minus five degrees 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.820
 so far frost-free remains that the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.740
 horses can drink without problems 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.110
 should it get colder you can always 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.600
 put another one underneath and 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.770
 so you get the water supply 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.770
 security guaranteed
