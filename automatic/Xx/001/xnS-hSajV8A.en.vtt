00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
right there around the middle of the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.410 
right there around the middle of the
bike<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.130> lets<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.340> wheels<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.299> front

wheel be able to turn and then this part

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.460 
wheel be able to turn and then this part
moves<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.160> little<00:02:11.340> bit<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:12.300> where<00:02:12.870> his<00:02:13.020> swords

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
moves a little bit for where his swords

a really nice bike really cool very
heavy<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.500> very<00:02:31.830> accurate<00:02:32.400> looks<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.240> like

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
heavy but very accurate looks just like

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.810 
heavy but very accurate looks just like

to<00:03:00.510> hear

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to hear

he's<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.260> sword<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.860> has<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.340> clip<00:03:03.050> it

he's the sword it has a little clip it

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.440 
he's the sword it has a little clip it
goes<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.530> end<00:03:04.680> but<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.459> lost<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.120> too

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
goes on the end but I lost that too

goes on the end but I lost that too
should<00:03:07.080> really<00:03:07.290> start<00:03:07.500> keeping<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
should really start keeping the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.070 
should really start keeping the
diffracted<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.520> stuff<00:03:08.730> slides<00:03:09.600> in<00:03:09.780> his<00:03:09.870> hand

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
diffracted of stuff slides in his hand

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.320 
diffracted of stuff slides in his hand
very<00:03:10.320> nicely<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.940> hand<00:03:12.209> twists<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:14.239> where<00:03:15.239> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
very nicely the hand twists on where the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.250 
very nicely the hand twists on where the
glove<00:03:15.570> starts<00:03:16.080> up<00:03:16.470> there<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.820> elbow<00:03:21.260> it's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
glove starts up there and the elbow it's

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.710 
glove starts up there and the elbow it's
about<00:03:22.440> 90<00:03:22.830> degrees<00:03:22.920> as<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:24.000> does<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.510> leg

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
about 90 degrees as it does the leg

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.530 
about 90 degrees as it does the leg
maybe<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.260> little<00:03:25.410> bit<00:03:25.590> more<00:03:27.830> twists<00:03:28.830> right

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
maybe a little bit more twists right

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.970 
maybe a little bit more twists right
there<00:03:30.680> there<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.950> also<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.519> shoulder<00:03:33.360> joint

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
there there is also a shoulder joint

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.310 
there there is also a shoulder joint
it's<00:03:34.980> very<00:03:35.280> full<00:03:35.580> range<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.299> our<00:03:36.480> movement

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
it's very full range of our movement

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.280 
it's very full range of our movement
I<00:03:37.350> think<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.640> hair<00:03:38.850> looks<00:03:39.390> just<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.870> little<00:03:39.900> bit

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
I think the hair looks just a little bit

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.940 
I think the hair looks just a little bit
weird<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.830> think<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.280> little<00:03:41.370> bit<00:03:41.580> darker

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
weird I think it's a little bit darker

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.080 
weird I think it's a little bit darker
that's<00:03:43.950> pretty<00:03:44.310> much<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.580> only<00:03:44.610> complaint

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
that's pretty much the only complaint

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.710 
that's pretty much the only complaint
then<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.170> arm<00:03:47.209> there's<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.299> lot<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.540> movement

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
then this arm there's a lot of movement

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.930 
then this arm there's a lot of movement
that's<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.769> first<00:03:49.980> time<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.549> happened

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's the first time that is happened

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.660 
that's the first time that is happened
well<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.049> guess<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.650> shoulder<00:03:52.980> pad<00:03:53.280> can<00:03:53.549> come

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
well I guess the shoulder pad can come

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.620 
well I guess the shoulder pad can come
off<00:03:53.850> as<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.989> can<00:03:55.019> see<00:03:55.350> there's<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.650> little<00:03:56.630> spot

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
off as you can see there's a little spot

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.199 
off as you can see there's a little spot
that<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.959> clips<00:03:58.560> on<00:03:58.739> right<00:03:58.950> there<00:03:59.570> does<00:04:00.570> move

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
that it clips on right there does move

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.340 
that it clips on right there does move
very<00:04:03.209> nice<00:04:03.480> lion<00:04:04.130> detail<00:04:05.390> or<00:04:06.390> dragon<00:04:07.049> whatever

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
very nice lion detail or dragon whatever

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.780 
very nice lion detail or dragon whatever
eyes<00:04:09.110> moves<00:04:10.110> right<00:04:10.440> there<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.070> twist<00:04:11.370> just

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
eyes moves right there and twist just

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.199 
eyes moves right there and twist just
like<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.120> other<00:04:12.269> arm<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.980> hand<00:04:14.340> gets<00:04:14.790> full

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
like the other arm the hand gets full

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.379 
like the other arm the hand gets full
movement

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.399 

this<00:04:18.599> part<00:04:18.959> can<00:04:19.889> come<00:04:20.249> off<00:04:20.599> it<00:04:21.599> clips<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:22.109> right

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
this part can come off it clips in right

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.929 
this part can come off it clips in right
there<00:04:22.680> kind<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.400> like<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.520> belt<00:04:23.930> multiple<00:04:24.930> loops

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:25.939 
there kind of like a belt multiple loops

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.019 
there kind of like a belt multiple loops
and<00:04:26.939> it's<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.419> same<00:04:27.629> right<00:04:27.840> there<00:04:28.849> it's<00:04:29.849> made

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:30.029 
and it's the same right there it's made

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.059 
and it's the same right there it's made
of<00:04:30.150> rubber<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.449> it's<00:04:30.870> not<00:04:30.990> very<00:04:31.289> constricting

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
of rubber so it's not very constricting

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.929 
of rubber so it's not very constricting
to<00:04:32.189> the<00:04:32.279> figure<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:34.590> figure<00:04:34.770> has<00:04:35.189> a<00:04:35.550> waist

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
to the figure the figure has a waist

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:42.320 
to the figure the figure has a waist
joint<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:39.120> legs<00:04:40.249> get<00:04:41.249> pretty<00:04:41.580> good<00:04:41.789> range<00:04:42.029> but

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
joint the legs get pretty good range but

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.820 
joint the legs get pretty good range but
they<00:04:42.509> don't<00:04:42.689> go<00:04:42.810> all<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:42.990> way<00:04:43.110> back

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
they don't go all the way back

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.239 
they don't go all the way back
it's<00:04:44.460> about<00:04:44.669> all<00:04:44.879> they<00:04:45.029> get<00:04:45.240> right<00:04:45.449> there<00:04:46.249> they

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:47.249 
it's about all they get right there they

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.429 
it's about all they get right there they
don't<00:04:47.370> have<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.699> twisting<00:04:48.419> joint<00:04:48.689> right<00:04:49.379> there

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
don't have a twisting joint right there

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.529 
don't have a twisting joint right there
like<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> lot<00:04:50.069> of<00:04:50.189> Clarets<00:04:50.580> figures<00:04:51.029> have<00:04:51.270> I

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
like a lot of Clarets figures have I

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.999 
like a lot of Clarets figures have I
don't<00:04:51.719> really<00:04:51.840> like<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:53.250> ankles<00:04:55.009> feet

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
don't really like that the ankles feet

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.869 
don't really like that the ankles feet
move<00:04:56.279> side<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.639> side<00:04:57.949> they<00:04:58.949> also<00:04:59.129> move<00:04:59.430> up<00:04:59.610> and

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
move side to side they also move up and

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.730 
move side to side they also move up and
down<00:05:00.029> but<00:05:00.599> it's<00:05:00.779> a<00:05:00.870> little<00:05:00.990> bit<00:05:01.110> constricting

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
down but it's a little bit constricting

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.269 
down but it's a little bit constricting
because<00:05:02.069> of<00:05:02.189> his<00:05:02.279> pant<00:05:02.550> leg<00:05:02.789> folding<00:05:03.270> over<00:05:03.389> and

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:04.279 
because of his pant leg folding over and

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:11.869 
because of his pant leg folding over and
of<00:05:05.279> course<00:05:05.550> they<00:05:08.330> twist<00:05:10.250> over<00:05:11.250> although<00:05:11.460> it's

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
of course they twist over although it's

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.480 
of course they twist over although it's
a<00:05:12.000> very<00:05:12.029> nice<00:05:12.509> figure<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:13.199> really<00:05:13.830> like<00:05:14.039> it<00:05:14.250> I'm

with it because play-offs figures are
