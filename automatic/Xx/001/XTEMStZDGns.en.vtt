about<00:02:22.510> its<00:02:22.810> ascent<00:02:23.080> defense<00:02:23.320> me<00:02:23.440> because<00:02:23.680> I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
about its ascent defense me because I

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.070 
about its ascent defense me because I
think<00:02:23.740> it's<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> sin<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.250> mid<00:02:24.490> role<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.090> he

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
think it's a sin to mid role that and he

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.280 
think it's a sin to mid role that and he
was<00:02:26.230> 750<00:02:26.680> coins<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:28.510> think<00:02:28.930> he<00:02:29.020> sells<00:02:29.200> for

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
was 750 coins and I think he sells for

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.630 
was 750 coins and I think he sells for
about<00:02:29.380> one<00:02:29.620> thousand<00:02:30.100> three<00:02:30.130> hundred<00:02:30.280> four

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
about one thousand three hundred four

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.940 
about one thousand three hundred four
hundred<00:02:30.700> maybe<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.780> bit<00:02:31.960> more<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.500> obviously

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
hundred maybe a bit more so obviously

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.340 
hundred maybe a bit more so obviously
double<00:02:33.310> my<00:02:33.400> profit<00:02:33.760> again<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.870> that's<00:02:35.170> quite

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
double my profit again so that's quite

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.470 
double my profit again so that's quite
good<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.770> then<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.490> come<00:02:36.610> on<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.820> dos<00:02:37.000> Santos
