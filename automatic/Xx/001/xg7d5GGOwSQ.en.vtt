one<00:00:04.980> driver<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.700> all<00:00:06.060> smaller<00:00:06.359> devices

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
one driver that all smaller devices

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.360 
one driver that all smaller devices
today<00:00:08.849> we<00:00:09.179> announce<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.960> we're<00:00:10.200> adding<00:00:10.440> work

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
today we announce that we're adding work

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.870 
today we announce that we're adding work
backwards<00:00:11.929> adding<00:00:12.929> other<00:00:13.490> products<00:00:14.490> that

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
backwards adding other products that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.860 
backwards adding other products that
matters<00:00:15.450> now<00:00:15.660> part<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:18.870 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.920 

you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.860> see<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.280> by<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.180> controlling

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
you can see here by now it's controlling

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.890 
you can see here by now it's controlling
the<00:00:22.020> blade<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.500> i<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.740> send<00:00:23.420> runs<00:00:24.420> too<00:00:24.630> late

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the blade so i can send runs too late

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.600 
the blade so i can send runs too late
and<00:00:25.440> then<00:00:25.590> i<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.800> search<00:00:26.010> over<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.370> the<00:00:26.430> house

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
and then i can search over to the house

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.460 
and then i can search over to the house
within<00:00:27.540> that<00:00:27.720> same<00:00:27.930> driver<00:00:28.280> configure<00:00:29.280> that

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
within that same driver configure that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
within that same driver configure that
so<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.620> the<00:00:31.680> Mouser<00:00:32.040> special<00:00:32.730> thing<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:32.910> we

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
so for the Mouser special thing that we

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.080 
so for the Mouser special thing that we
did<00:00:33.240> is<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.870> Greek<00:00:34.790> reloaded<00:00:35.790> three

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
did is we Greek reloaded three

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.880 
did is we Greek reloaded three
calibrations<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.260> razer<00:00:37.560> mouse

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
calibrations for all razer mouse

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.030 
calibrations for all razer mouse
comparison<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.239> example<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.830> i'm

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
comparison so for example right now i'm

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.160 
comparison so for example right now i'm
using<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.430> battlefields<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.140> raised<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
using the battlefields we raised a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.250 
using the battlefields we raised a
scarab<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:44.760> i<00:00:44.970> have<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> different<00:00:46.140> mouse

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
scarab but if i have a different mouse

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.890 
scarab but if i have a different mouse
mat<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.830> example<00:00:47.220> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.030> course<00:00:48.750> up

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
mat for example you can go to course up

mat for example you can go to course up
the<00:00:49.080> cloth<00:00:49.620> mouth<00:00:49.890> original<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the cloth mouth original at this the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.160 
the cloth mouth original at this the
center<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.519> then<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.940> adapted<00:00:54.570> specifically

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
center will then be adapted specifically

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.590 
center will then be adapted specifically
to<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.350> boss<00:00:55.680> man<00:00:55.949> wow<00:00:56.580> that's<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.510> cool

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to that boss man wow that's really cool

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.360 
to that boss man wow that's really cool
and<00:00:58.080> if<00:00:58.170> you're<00:00:58.290> not<00:00:58.440> using<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.860> reasonable

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and if you're not using a reasonable

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.790 
and if you're not using a reasonable
threat<00:00:59.640> that's<00:01:00.540> also<00:01:00.720> possible<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.470> can<00:01:01.589> just

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
threat that's also possible you can just

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.130 
threat that's also possible you can just
select<00:01:02.370> others<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.780> actively

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
select others and then you can actively

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
select others and then you can actively
calibrate<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.040> whatever<00:01:05.489> other<00:01:05.760> surface

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
calibrate it to whatever other surface

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.420 
calibrate it to whatever other surface
hospital<00:01:07.080> using<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.800> you're<00:01:07.980> not<00:01:08.100> using<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
hospital using so you're not using a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.300 
hospital using so you're not using a
mosfet<00:01:08.730> at<00:01:08.850> all<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.710> actively<00:01:10.710> calibrate

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
mosfet at all you can actively calibrate

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
mosfet at all you can actively calibrate
the<00:01:11.430> sensor<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.300> table<00:01:12.600> surface<00:01:13.080> for

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the sensor to the table surface for

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.800 
the sensor to the table surface for
example

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.050 

so<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:18.530> do<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:18.740> like<00:01:19.189> how<00:01:19.640> do<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.909> mean

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
so to do that like how do you mean

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.300 
so to do that like how do you mean
calibrate<00:01:20.539> like<00:01:20.689> what<00:01:20.899> like<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.710> it<00:01:21.740> more

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
calibrate like what like is it more

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.840 
calibrate like what like is it more
towards<00:01:22.640> how<00:01:23.329> I<00:01:23.600> like<00:01:23.990> or<00:01:24.259> is<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:25.070> giving

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
towards how I like or is it giving

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.210 
towards how I like or is it giving
optimal<00:01:26.570> ultimately<00:01:27.259> lower<00:01:27.679> can<00:01:28.100> be

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
optimal ultimately lower can be

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.160 
optimal ultimately lower can be
optimized<00:01:28.700> for<00:01:28.850> that<00:01:29.090> service<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:29.630> if<00:01:29.960> you're

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
optimized for that service so if you're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.840 
optimized for that service so if you're

for<00:01:45.030> Cory<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.020> line<00:01:46.050> for<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> game<00:01:46.980> we<00:01:47.850> went<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
for Cory on line for the game we went to

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.300 
for Cory on line for the game we went to
head<00:01:48.390> together<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.960> piranha<00:01:49.350> games<00:01:49.470> the

head together with piranha games the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.360 
head together with piranha games the
publisher<00:01:50.730> for<00:01:50.910> warrior<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.070> we<00:01:53.070> have

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
publisher for warrior and we have

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.820 
publisher for warrior and we have
envisioned<00:01:53.760> how<00:01:54.600> would<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.560> your

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
envisioned how would it be like if your

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.590 
envisioned how would it be like if your
ex<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.100> sitting<00:01:56.400> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> mac<00:01:56.820> itself<00:01:57.300> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
ex is sitting in the mac itself and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.780 
ex is sitting in the mac itself and
controlling<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.230> so<00:01:59.160> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.550> we<00:01:59.670> came

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
controlling it so this is what we came

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.080 
controlling it so this is what we came
up<00:01:59.910> with<00:02:00.740> obviously<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.940> joystick<00:02:02.940> on

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
up with obviously have a joystick on

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.610 
up with obviously have a joystick on
your<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.390> side<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.500> actually

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
your right side and it's actually

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.220 
your right side and it's actually
modular<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.550> here<00:02:05.760> left<00:02:06.000> angry<00:02:06.360> exists<00:02:06.870> outer

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
modular so here left angry exists outer

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.840 
modular so here left angry exists outer
