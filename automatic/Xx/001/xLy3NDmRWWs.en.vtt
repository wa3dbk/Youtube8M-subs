hopefully you can see all this and again
I'll<00:04:05.000> probably<00:04:05.510> I'll<00:04:06.579> probably<00:04:07.579> show<00:04:07.879> it

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
I'll probably I'll probably show it

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
I'll probably I'll probably show it
either<00:04:09.200> I'll<00:04:09.379> make<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.560> video<00:04:09.769> while<00:04:10.129> I'm

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
either I'll make a video while I'm

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.119 
either I'll make a video while I'm
assembling<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:10.970> or<00:04:11.269> I'll<00:04:11.780> make<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.019> video<00:04:12.260> after

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
assembling it or I'll make a video after

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.090 
assembling it or I'll make a video after
I've<00:04:13.220> assembled<00:04:13.549> it<00:04:13.879> I<00:04:14.890> mean<00:04:15.890> there's<00:04:16.009> not

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
I've assembled it I mean there's not

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.499 
I've assembled it I mean there's not
much<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:16.639> anyway<00:04:17.030> they're<00:04:17.209> just<00:04:17.329> going<00:04:17.449> to

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
much to it anyway they're just going to

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.060 
much to it anyway they're just going to
put<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.720> front<00:04:17.930> tire<00:04:18.289> on<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.709> then<00:04:18.829> put<00:04:18.979> the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
put the front tire on and then put the

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.620 
put the front tire on and then put the
handlebars<00:04:19.519> on<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:20.000> seat

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
handlebars on the seat

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:32.650 
handlebars on the seat
basically<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:29.320> here's<00:04:31.090> what<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.210> bike<00:04:32.389> looks

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
basically it here's what the bike looks

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.610 
basically it here's what the bike looks
like<00:04:32.900> says<00:04:33.729> Cranbrook<00:04:34.729> right<00:04:34.970> there<00:04:35.530> puffy<00:04:36.530> in

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
the front

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.080 
the front
huffy<00:04:37.460> on<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.669> fork<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:39.639> that's<00:04:40.639> pretty<00:04:40.910> much

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
huffy on the fork and that's pretty much

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:52.689 
huffy on the fork and that's pretty much
it<00:04:41.360> actually<00:04:47.229> this<00:04:48.229> video<00:04:51.610> got<00:04:52.610> an

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
it actually this video got an

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.680 
it actually this video got an
instruction<00:04:53.240> manual<00:04:54.020> here<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:55.539> then<00:04:56.539> your

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
instruction manual here and then your

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.589 
instruction manual here and then your
giant<00:04:57.110> seat<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.970> don't<00:04:58.970> know<00:04:59.090> if<00:04:59.180> I<00:04:59.270> use<00:04:59.449> this

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
giant seat I don't know if I use this

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:00.939 
giant seat I don't know if I use this
seat<00:04:59.810> I<00:04:59.840> don't<00:05:00.080> know<00:05:00.139> I<00:05:00.199> like<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.800> it's

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
seat I don't know I like that it's

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:07.260 
seat I don't know I like that it's
spring<00:05:02.949> but<00:05:03.949> we'll<00:05:04.190> see

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.270 

and<00:05:07.509> then<00:05:07.630> last<00:05:07.900> but<00:05:08.050> not<00:05:08.139> least<00:05:08.470> I<00:05:08.770> already

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
and then last but not least I already

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.590 
and then last but not least I already
showed<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.550> pedals<00:05:09.850> but<00:05:09.970> here<00:05:10.090> they<00:05:10.210> are<00:05:10.240> out

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
showed the pedals but here they are out

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.059 
showed the pedals but here they are out
of<00:05:10.630> the<00:05:10.780> packaging

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.189 

pretty<00:05:15.069> flat<00:05:15.389> these<00:05:16.389> are<00:05:16.569> good<00:05:16.750> pedals<00:05:17.080> that

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
pretty flat these are good pedals that

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.620 
pretty flat these are good pedals that
won't<00:05:17.470> tear<00:05:17.770> your<00:05:17.919> shoes<00:05:18.190> up<00:05:18.220> at<00:05:18.520> least<00:05:18.699> they

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
won't tear your shoes up at least they

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.260 
won't tear your shoes up at least they
might<00:05:19.780> have<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.020> best<00:05:20.169> grip<00:05:20.680> but<00:05:21.090> like<00:05:22.090> my

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
might have the best grip but like my

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.640 
might have the best grip but like my
road<00:05:22.479> bike<00:05:22.509> they<00:05:23.130> tear<00:05:24.130> my<00:05:24.280> shoes<00:05:24.610> up<00:05:24.789> so<00:05:25.650> these

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
road bike they tear my shoes up so these

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.080 
road bike they tear my shoes up so these
won't<00:05:26.830> be<00:05:26.919> tearing<00:05:27.190> my<00:05:27.280> shoes<00:05:27.490> up<00:05:27.669> but<00:05:27.910> I

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
won't be tearing my shoes up but I

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.670 
won't be tearing my shoes up but I
probably<00:05:28.240> be<00:05:28.509> pedaling<00:05:28.930> very<00:05:29.110> much<00:05:29.259> if<00:05:29.410> I<00:05:29.500> put

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
probably be pedaling very much if I put

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.610 
probably be pedaling very much if I put
an<00:05:29.770> engine<00:05:30.009> on<00:05:30.099> this<00:05:30.250> bike<00:05:30.430> anyways<00:05:30.819> so

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
an engine on this bike anyways so

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.450 
an engine on this bike anyways so
whatever<00:05:32.849> that's<00:05:33.849> pretty<00:05:34.180> much<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:35.460> that's

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
whatever that's pretty much it that's

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.740
