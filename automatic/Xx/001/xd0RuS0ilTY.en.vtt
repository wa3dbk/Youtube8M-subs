fly<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.260> plane<00:01:42.500> with<00:01:43.100> only<00:01:43.130> one<00:01:43.580> engine<00:01:43.850> of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
fly a plane with only one engine of

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.100 
fly a plane with only one engine of
course<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.300> mean<00:01:44.420> there's<00:01:44.570> sort<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.810> fight<00:01:44.990> to

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
course I mean there's sort of fight to

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.600 
course I mean there's sort of fight to
be<00:01:45.200> able<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.380> fly<00:01:45.560> one<00:01:45.770> engine<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.130> pilots<00:01:46.520> are

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
be able to fly one engine the pilots are

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.040 
be able to fly one engine the pilots are
supposed<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.880> be<00:01:47.000> trained<00:01:47.300> as<00:01:47.480> they<00:01:47.660> should<00:01:47.720> be

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
supposed to be trained as they should be

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.080 
supposed to be trained as they should be
to<00:01:48.860> deal<00:01:49.010> with<00:01:49.130> an<00:01:49.250> engine<00:01:49.430> failure<00:01:49.610> directly

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
to deal with an engine failure directly

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.430 
to deal with an engine failure directly
after<00:01:50.300> rotation<00:01:50.630> which<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:50.930> when<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.260> lift

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
after rotation which is when you lift

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.290 
after rotation which is when you lift
off<00:01:51.650> or<00:01:51.830> take<00:01:51.979> off<00:01:52.190> or<00:01:52.610> deal<00:01:52.910> with<00:01:53.030> an<00:01:53.120> engine

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
off or take off or deal with an engine

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.120 
off or take off or deal with an engine
failure<00:01:53.510> in<00:01:53.720> flight<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.200> think<00:01:54.620> this<00:01:54.740> video<00:01:54.860> is

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
failure in flight I think this video is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.530 
failure in flight I think this video is
very<00:01:55.190> instrumental<00:01:55.910> if<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.090> look<00:01:56.240> at<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.450> from

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
very instrumental if you look at it from

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.570 
very instrumental if you look at it from
a<00:01:56.660> forensic<00:01:56.890> perspective<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.220> know<00:01:58.310> which<00:01:58.460> I

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
a forensic perspective you know which I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.940 
a forensic perspective you know which I
do<00:01:58.640> my<00:01:58.880> practice<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.390> look<00:01:59.510> at<00:01:59.630> cases<00:01:59.840> is<00:02:00.229> you

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
do my practice to look at cases is you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.250 
do my practice to look at cases is you
see<00:02:01.190> his<00:02:01.690> nonchalant<00:02:02.690> honest<00:02:02.930> with<00:02:03.140> this

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
see his nonchalant honest with this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.080 
see his nonchalant honest with this
video<00:02:03.560> he<00:02:03.830> fails<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.250> motor<00:02:04.460> on<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.729> co-pilot

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
video he fails a motor on the co-pilot

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.210 
video he fails a motor on the co-pilot
he<00:02:05.780> remarks<00:02:06.110> about<00:02:06.229> how<00:02:06.440> ease<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:06.890> even<00:02:07.130> go

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
he remarks about how ease it is even go

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.560 
he remarks about how ease it is even go
so<00:02:07.370> far<00:02:07.400> as<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.729> say<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:07.940> auto<00:02:08.209> pot<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:08.540> not

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
so far as to say the auto pot it's not

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.090 
so far as to say the auto pot it's not
even<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.140> look<00:02:09.260> everybody<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.860> very

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
even on and look everybody this is very

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.530 
even on and look everybody this is very
easy<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.369> handle<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.090> seems<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
easy to handle and it seems that the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.060 
easy to handle and it seems that the
plane<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.780> kind<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.080> continuing<00:02:12.620> its<00:02:12.770> course

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
plane is kind of continuing its course

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.250 
plane is kind of continuing its course
it's<00:02:13.520> doing<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.570> just<00:02:14.750> moving<00:02:14.900> forward

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
it's doing it's just moving forward

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.140 
it's doing it's just moving forward
while<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.770> pilot<00:02:16.070> then<00:02:16.190> takes<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.550> steps<00:02:16.820> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
while the pilot then takes the steps to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.880 
while the pilot then takes the steps to
get<00:02:17.540> things<00:02:17.750> back<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.110> control<00:02:18.350> that's<00:02:18.650> true

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
get things back in control that's true

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.440 
get things back in control that's true
he<00:02:19.010> disarmed<00:02:19.430> some<00:02:19.580> master<00:02:19.910> Carson's<00:02:20.300> and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
he disarmed some master Carson's and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.820 
he disarmed some master Carson's and
alarms<00:02:20.750> are<00:02:20.930> likely<00:02:21.230> related<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.560> low<00:02:21.800> oil

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
alarms are likely related to low oil

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.860 
alarms are likely related to low oil
pressure<00:02:22.250> or<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.640> low<00:02:22.850> rotation<00:02:23.480> within<00:02:23.660> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
pressure or a low rotation within the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.960 
pressure or a low rotation within the
turbine<00:02:24.290> itself<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:25.370> if<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.640> look<00:02:25.820> real

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
turbine itself but if you look real

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.240 
turbine itself but if you look real
close<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.300> video<00:02:26.510> you'll<00:02:26.720> see<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.620> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
close to the video you'll see the the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.620 
close to the video you'll see the the
picture<00:02:28.550> outside<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.970> frame<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.420> y'all

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
picture outside the frame that y'all

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.979 
picture outside the frame that y'all
yeah<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.530> barely<00:02:30.770> moves<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:32.330> does<00:02:32.570> it<00:02:32.690> matter

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
yeah just barely moves so does it matter

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.810 
yeah just barely moves so does it matter
that<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.620> plane<00:02:33.830> had<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.040> taken<00:02:34.250> off<00:02:34.519> a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
that this plane had just taken off a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.550 
that this plane had just taken off a
couple<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.390> minutes<00:02:35.720> before<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.170> happened

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
couple of minutes before this happened

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.880 
couple of minutes before this happened
well<00:02:37.480> good<00:02:38.480> point<00:02:38.510> two<00:02:39.050> critical<00:02:39.470> phases<00:02:39.650> of

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
well good point two critical phases of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.979 
well good point two critical phases of
flight<00:02:39.920> for<00:02:40.489> pilots<00:02:40.880> when<00:02:41.150> an<00:02:41.510> emergency<00:02:41.660> is

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
flight for pilots when an emergency is

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.180 
flight for pilots when an emergency is
going<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.170> come<00:02:42.290> up<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.709> be<00:02:42.769> takeoff

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
going to come up is going to be takeoff

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.729 
going to come up is going to be takeoff
and<00:02:43.340> landing<00:02:43.820> sure<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.600> yes<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.230> plays<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.410> part

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
and landing sure so yes it plays a part

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:46.960 
and landing sure so yes it plays a part
but<00:02:45.920> if<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.100> look<00:02:46.250> at<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.400> video<00:02:46.640> closely

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
but if you look at the video closely

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.180 
but if you look at the video closely
that<00:02:47.330> Steve<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.690> played<00:02:47.930> you'll<00:02:48.860> see<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
that Steve just played you'll see the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.220 
that Steve just played you'll see the
aircraft<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.610> configured<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
aircraft is configured in and the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.080 
aircraft is configured in and the
landing<00:02:51.950> gear<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.160> up<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.610> flaps<00:02:52.820> are

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
landing gear is up and the flaps are

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.220 
landing gear is up and the flaps are
almost<00:02:53.269> here<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.900> what<00:02:54.050> you're<00:02:54.140> just

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
almost here it is what you're just

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.320 
almost here it is what you're just
talking<00:02:54.530> about<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:55.370> probably<00:02:55.790> loop<00:02:56.120> back

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
talking about it probably loop back

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.820 
talking about it probably loop back
around<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:56.870> we<00:02:56.959> can<00:02:57.080> kind<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.260> see<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.530> then<00:02:57.680> go

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
around so we can kind of see it then go

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.130 
around so we can kind of see it then go
over<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.100> this<00:02:58.700> highway<00:02:59.030> once<00:02:59.209> again<00:02:59.510> okay

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
over this this highway once again okay

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.270 
over this this highway once again okay
so<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.350> engine<00:03:00.620> that's<00:03:00.709> out<00:03:00.890> that's<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
so the engine that's out that's the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.920 
so the engine that's out that's the
engine<00:03:01.640> on<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.850> left<00:03:02.060> right<00:03:02.570> from<00:03:02.720> what<00:03:02.840> we

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
engine on the left right from what we

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.270 
engine on the left right from what we
can<00:03:03.019> tell<00:03:03.080> from<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.380> video<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.980> engine<00:03:04.220> on

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
can tell from this video the engine on

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.920 
can tell from this video the engine on
the<00:03:04.340> left<00:03:04.580> is<00:03:04.790> wind<00:03:05.060> milling<00:03:05.269> which<00:03:05.570> tells<00:03:05.840> me

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
the left is wind milling which tells me

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.570 
the left is wind milling which tells me
that<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.410> propeller<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.220> not<00:03:07.340> fully

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
that the propeller was not fully

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.979 
that the propeller was not fully
feathered<00:03:07.880> which<00:03:08.209> means<00:03:08.450> it's<00:03:08.630> creating<00:03:08.930> a

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
feathered which means it's creating a

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.050 
feathered which means it's creating a
lot<00:03:09.110> of<00:03:09.140> drag<00:03:09.320> on<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.739> aircraft<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.910> this

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
lot of drag on that aircraft so this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.300 
lot of drag on that aircraft so this
pilot<00:03:11.420> had<00:03:11.630> five<00:03:12.110> thousand<00:03:12.530> hours<00:03:13.010> that's

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
pilot had five thousand hours that's

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.370 
pilot had five thousand hours that's
true<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> lot<00:03:14.180> I'd<00:03:14.959> say<00:03:15.110> that's<00:03:15.230> about

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
true that a lot I'd say that's about

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.690 
true that a lot I'd say that's about
average<00:03:15.830> for<00:03:15.860> an<00:03:16.040> operator<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.519> type<00:03:16.670> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
average for an operator of this type of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.030 
average for an operator of this type of
aircraft<00:03:16.940> should<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.050> pilot<00:03:18.410> no<00:03:18.530> judgment

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
aircraft should that pilot no judgment

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.080 
aircraft should that pilot no judgment
because<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.400> don't<00:03:19.519> know<00:03:19.580> what<00:03:19.670> was<00:03:19.730> going<00:03:19.970> on

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
because we don't know what was going on

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
because we don't know what was going on
we'll<00:03:20.450> find<00:03:20.690> out

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
we'll find out

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.690 
we'll find out
you<00:03:21.650> know<00:03:21.739> when<00:03:21.860> we<00:03:21.950> hear<00:03:22.310> everything<00:03:22.550> on<00:03:22.640> the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
you know when we hear everything on the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.220 
you know when we hear everything on the
black<00:03:22.850> boxes<00:03:23.239> should<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.630> pilot<00:03:23.959> have<00:03:24.079> been

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
black boxes should that pilot have been

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.900 
black boxes should that pilot have been
able<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> handle<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.920> situation<00:03:25.040> yes<00:03:25.639> it<00:03:25.820> was

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
able to handle the situation yes it was

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.539 
able to handle the situation yes it was
human<00:03:26.750> error<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.530> know<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.680> wasn't<00:03:27.920> there<00:03:28.280> but

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
human error you know I wasn't there but

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.840 
human error you know I wasn't there but
the<00:03:28.639> pilots<00:03:28.970> are<00:03:29.060> trained<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.329> be<00:03:29.450> able<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.660> him

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
the pilots are trained to be able to him

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.790 
the pilots are trained to be able to him
and<00:03:30.240> what<00:03:30.390> we<00:03:30.480> see<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.870> video<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.650> get

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
and what we see in this video is we get

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.950 
and what we see in this video is we get
to<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.010> last<00:03:32.190> moments<00:03:32.760> or<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.570> pilot<00:03:33.900> I

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
to the last moments or the pilot I

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.300 
to the last moments or the pilot I
believe<00:03:34.230> tries<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.650> avoid<00:03:34.830> some<00:03:35.040> building

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
believe tries to avoid some building

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.570 
believe tries to avoid some building
gosh<00:03:35.490> this<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.300> just<00:03:36.740> incredible<00:03:37.740> picture<00:03:38.310> it

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
gosh this is just incredible picture it

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.190 
gosh this is just incredible picture it
tried<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.850> avoid<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.150> building<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.720> he<00:03:40.020> gets

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
tried to avoid the building and he gets

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.420 
tried to avoid the building and he gets
the<00:03:40.350> final<00:03:40.620> moment<00:03:40.890> right<00:03:41.010> when<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.220> left

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
the final moment right when that left

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.220 
the final moment right when that left
wing<00:03:41.640> dips<00:03:41.910> which<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.510> sign<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.900> what<00:03:43.170> we

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
wing dips which is the sign of what we

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.770 
wing dips which is the sign of what we
call<00:03:43.380> full<00:03:43.620> stall<00:03:43.980> or<00:03:44.310> there's<00:03:44.490> no<00:03:44.580> more<00:03:44.790> lift

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
call full stall or there's no more lift

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.570 
call full stall or there's no more lift
over<00:03:46.020> that<00:03:46.230> wing<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.770> support<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.400> goes

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
over that wing to support it and goes

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.860 
over that wing to support it and goes
down<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.880> think<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.270> pilot<00:03:48.540> was<00:03:48.630> dealing<00:03:48.840> with

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
down I think the pilot was dealing with

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.150 
down I think the pilot was dealing with
some<00:03:49.020> really<00:03:49.200> hard<00:03:49.350> decisions<00:03:49.380> including

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
some really hard decisions including

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.190 
some really hard decisions including
does<00:03:51.030> he<00:03:51.150> ditch<00:03:51.330> this<00:03:51.480> thing<00:03:51.540> into<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.960> building

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
does he ditch this thing into a building

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.540 
does he ditch this thing into a building
does<00:03:52.500> he<00:03:52.590> go<00:03:52.710> into<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.950> road<00:03:53.100> does<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.400> try<00:03:53.490> to

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
does he go into the road does it try to

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.580 
does he go into the road does it try to
make<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.820> river<00:03:54.050> but<00:03:55.050> at<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:55.260> point<00:03:55.440> the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
get the cockpit voice recorder and we

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.500 
get the cockpit voice recorder and we
figure<00:04:13.890> out<00:04:14.070> where<00:04:14.700> things<00:04:14.910> went<00:04:15.150> wrong<00:04:15.210> with

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
figure out where things went wrong with

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.610 
figure out where things went wrong with
this<00:04:15.600> chain<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.900> events<00:04:15.990> because<00:04:16.350> after<00:04:16.590> all

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
this chain of events because after all

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.590 
this chain of events because after all
these<00:04:16.830> aviation<00:04:17.510> accidents<00:04:18.510> and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
these aviation accidents and

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.910 
these aviation accidents and
catastrophes<00:04:18.690> are<00:04:19.260> always<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> chain<00:04:19.830> of

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
catastrophes are always a chain of

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.270 
catastrophes are always a chain of
events

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
events

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.740 
events
so<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.820> mentioned<00:04:21.090> accidents<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
so you mentioned accidents and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.100 
so you mentioned accidents and
catastrophes<00:04:22.040> been<00:04:23.040> quite<00:04:23.790> a<00:04:23.820> few<00:04:24.180> in<00:04:24.450> this

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
catastrophes been quite a few in this

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.810 
catastrophes been quite a few in this
part<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.710> world<00:04:25.920> lately<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.400> particular

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
part of the world lately this particular

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.970 
part of the world lately this particular
airline<00:04:27.000> what<00:04:27.420> -<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.230> just<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.500> last<00:04:28.620> seven

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
airline what - in just the last seven

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.290 
airline what - in just the last seven
months<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.310> think<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.520> last<00:04:29.670> one<00:04:29.760> was<00:04:29.850> in<00:04:29.970> July

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
months I think the last one was in July

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.550 
months I think the last one was in July
that's<00:04:30.690> right<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.960> last<00:04:31.080> one<00:04:31.230> where<00:04:31.500> this

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
that's right the last one where this

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.350 
that's right the last one where this
particular<00:04:31.680> airline<00:04:32.010> was<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:32.430> July<00:04:32.760> of<00:04:32.790> 2014

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
particular airline was in July of 2014

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.060 
particular airline was in July of 2014
and<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.200> think<00:04:34.560> it's<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.770> great<00:04:34.950> question

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
and I think it's a great question

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.590 
and I think it's a great question
Heather<00:04:35.430> your<00:04:35.610> audience<00:04:35.970> probably<00:04:36.150> wants<00:04:36.540> to

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
Heather your audience probably wants to

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.360 
Heather your audience probably wants to
connect<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.990> dots<00:04:37.110> sure<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.890> look<00:04:38.130> at<00:04:38.220> all

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
connect the dots sure and look at all

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.440 
connect the dots sure and look at all
the<00:04:38.520> events<00:04:38.790> that<00:04:38.880> have<00:04:38.970> happened<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.300> Asia

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
the events that have happened in Asia

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.820 
the events that have happened in Asia
recently<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.140> you've<00:04:40.260> got<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.500> think<00:04:40.650> about

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
recently but you've got to think about

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.920 
recently but you've got to think about
two<00:04:41.010> things<00:04:41.040> there<00:04:41.490> one<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.840> most

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
two things there one is this is the most

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.570 
two things there one is this is the most
rapidly<00:04:43.380> growing<00:04:43.470> segment<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.190> commercial

rapidly growing segment of commercial

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.310 
rapidly growing segment of commercial
aviation<00:04:44.670> in<00:04:45.240> just<00:04:45.450> about<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.780> entire<00:04:46.050> world

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
aviation in just about the entire world

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.750 
aviation in just about the entire world
because<00:04:46.470> their<00:04:46.740> economy's<00:04:47.190> doing<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:47.580> well

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
because their economy's doing so well

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.840 
because their economy's doing so well
the<00:04:47.910> populations<00:04:48.480> booming<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.080> you've<00:04:50.070> got<00:04:50.340> a

the populations booming and you've got a

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.820 
the populations booming and you've got a
situation<00:04:51.360> over<00:04:51.930> there<00:04:52.020> with<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.500> governing

authorities<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.490> should<00:04:53.670> be<00:04:53.760> looking<00:04:54.000> over

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
authorities that should be looking over

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.300 
authorities that should be looking over
these<00:04:54.270> pilots<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:54.990> from<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.650> United<00:04:56.070> States

really<00:04:57.960> know<00:04:58.140> what<00:04:58.320> they're<00:04:58.470> doing

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
really know what they're doing

necessarily<00:04:59.370> can<00:04:59.910> we<00:05:00.060> find<00:05:00.360> out<00:05:00.540> should<00:05:00.810> we

necessarily can we find out should we
find<00:05:01.440> out<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:02.250> think<00:05:02.610> we<00:05:02.880> will<00:05:03.000> find<00:05:03.240> out<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.420> lot

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
find out I think we will find out a lot

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.200 
find out I think we will find out a lot
of<00:05:03.750> times<00:05:03.930> other<00:05:04.650> countries<00:05:05.640> will<00:05:05.820> call<00:05:06.030> in

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
Safety Board to come in and help them so

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.210 
Safety Board to come in and help them so
they<00:05:09.960> should<00:05:10.110> be<00:05:10.140> following<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.800> standards

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
they should be following the standards

they should be following the standards
that<00:05:11.310> we've<00:05:11.460> got<00:05:11.820> set<00:05:12.060> up<00:05:12.180> through<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.720> NTSB

that we've got set up through the NTSB

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.250 
that we've got set up through the NTSB
but<00:05:14.100> then<00:05:14.220> I<00:05:14.280> guess<00:05:14.430> it's<00:05:14.610> enforcing<00:05:15.420> the

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
but then I guess it's enforcing the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.930 
but then I guess it's enforcing the
safety<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:16.920> the<00:05:16.980> regulations<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:17.700> sort

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
safety and the regulations and that sort

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.790 
safety and the regulations and that sort
of<00:05:17.970> things<00:05:18.270> well<00:05:18.540> enforcing<00:05:19.230> this<00:05:19.350> of<00:05:19.590> course

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
of things well enforcing this of course

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.860 
of things well enforcing this of course
and<00:05:20.100> you<00:05:20.490> got<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.730> look<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:20.910> and<00:05:21.450> everything

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
and you got to look to and everything

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.390
