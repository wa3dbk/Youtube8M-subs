00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.030 
to instead use a map so just cut the map
into<00:02:09.450> really<00:02:09.660> thin<00:02:09.750> strips<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:10.770> glue

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
into really thin strips and then glue

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.500 
into really thin strips and then glue
them<00:02:11.250> onto<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.580> pumpkin<00:02:11.880> until<00:02:12.240> it<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
them onto the pumpkin until it is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.390 
them onto the pumpkin until it is
completely<00:02:13.020> covered<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.800> then<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.130> end<00:02:14.280> up

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
completely covered and then you end up

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.550 
completely covered and then you end up
with<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:15.120> cool<00:02:15.480> paper<00:02:15.960> patterned

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
with this really cool paper patterned

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.630 
with this really cool paper patterned
pumpkin<00:02:17.070> try<00:02:17.790> saying<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.450> three<00:02:18.480> times<00:02:18.780> fast

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.420 

and<00:02:22.180> finally<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.780> had<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.260> make<00:02:23.440> one<00:02:23.740> design<00:02:24.070> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
and finally I had to make one design of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.820 
and finally I had to make one design of
my<00:02:24.640> own<00:02:24.910> for<00:02:25.270> this<00:02:25.450> one<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.660> run<00:02:25.990> in<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.380> devil

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
my own for this one I run in the devil

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.760 
my own for this one I run in the devil
of<00:02:27.070> prop<00:02:27.370> supplies<00:02:27.790> glitter<00:02:28.630> I'm<00:02:29.320> probably

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
of prop supplies glitter I'm probably

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.530 
of prop supplies glitter I'm probably
still<00:02:30.160> gonna<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.430> finding<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> stuff<00:02:31.240> in<00:02:31.390> my

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
still gonna be finding the stuff in my

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.050 
still gonna be finding the stuff in my
room<00:02:31.600> next<00:02:32.500> Halloween<00:02:32.950> but<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.310> really<00:02:33.820> wanted

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
room next Halloween but I really wanted

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.330 
room next Halloween but I really wanted
to<00:02:34.120> try<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.750> design<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.590> used<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.130> glue<00:02:36.310> to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
to try this design so I used the glue to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.520 
to try this design so I used the glue to
paint<00:02:36.790> every<00:02:37.150> other<00:02:37.270> section<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.140> pumpkin

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
paint every other section of the pumpkin

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.800 
paint every other section of the pumpkin
and<00:02:38.770> then<00:02:38.920> sprinkled<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.640> glare<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:39.940> once<00:02:40.690> it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
and then sprinkled the glare on once it

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.510 
and then sprinkled the glare on once it
all<00:02:40.870> dried<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.440> brushed<00:02:41.710> off<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:41.950> excess

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
all dried I brushed off the excess

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.010 
all dried I brushed off the excess
glitter<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.060> then<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.270> ended<00:02:43.510> up<00:02:43.660> with<00:02:43.870> this

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
glitter and then I ended up with this

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.470 
glitter and then I ended up with this
super-cute<00:02:44.530> pumpkin<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.760> perfect<00:02:46.240> for<00:02:46.450> a
