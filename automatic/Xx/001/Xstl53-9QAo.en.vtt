when I'm out melon grows like this I'll

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.729 
when I'm out melon grows like this I'll
get<00:00:40.140> broken<00:00:40.440> these<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.050> hoppers<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.620> are

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
get broken these and hoppers if they are

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.000

pick up items and I make it travel along
and<00:00:47.309> into<00:00:47.579> their<00:00:47.670> chest<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.840> got

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and into their chest so you see you got

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.920 
and into their chest so you see you got
6443<00:00:50.300> put<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> rundown<00:00:52.579> give<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.670> second<00:00:54.270> there

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
6443 put the rundown give a second there

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.099 
6443 put the rundown give a second there
you<00:00:54.989> go<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> every<00:00:57.600> time<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you go it's going up so every time a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.150 
you go it's going up so every time a
mountain<00:00:58.620> grows<00:01:00.320> automatically<00:01:01.320> harvest<00:01:01.949> all

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
mountain grows automatically harvest all

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.299 
mountain grows automatically harvest all
the<00:01:02.280> seeds<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:03.110> one<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.860> weird<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the seeds that one was a bit weird and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.000 
the seeds that one was a bit weird and
then<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.850> properly<00:01:06.530> usually<00:01:07.530> they'll<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.860> into

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
then go properly usually they'll go into

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.270 
then go properly usually they'll go into
the<00:01:08.220> hoppers<00:01:09.680> probably<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:10.890> time<00:01:11.100> you're

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the hoppers probably all time you're

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.179 
the hoppers probably all time you're
doing<00:01:11.600> anyway<00:01:12.600> let's<00:01:13.170> show<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> build

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
doing anyway let's show you how to build

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.609 
doing anyway let's show you how to build
this<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.549> I'm<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> 1<00:01:18.210> modulo<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.439> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
this so I'm going to 1 modulo you can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.859 
this so I'm going to 1 modulo you can
add<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.580> many<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.030> these<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:21.659> i'll
