00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.720
 when I have everything 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.240
 hello to all the videos I bring a hack 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.830
 to talk to all the zombies in the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.140
 map earth and if in this game I was 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.390
 with fence mind 10 we are using a 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.460
 ps3 in decks is to say that this hack only 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.560
 goes in decks worth and for those who do not 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.689
 know go mete 10 to have the tool 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.669
 tool is worth a kind of 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.590
 program on your computer can activate and 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.720
 deactivate some of the options that 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.100
 does not give us the game in itself not in this 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.320
 case I had put the good mode me 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.450
 I had put the money down and now I 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.340
 put the is qualifier you can assign me 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.079
 the weapon he wants is worth not 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.399
 to be improved the weapon does not need neither 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.920
 mount it or anything you have already seen the 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.090
 round 1 you already have it good and good 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.070
 you can also put that super 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.000
 speed super jump can blade the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.070
 distance that more zero gravity and 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.620
 enough little things not here just 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.780
 Skip badly you will return but having no 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.089
 seriousness because I do not fall into a vacuum and can 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.350
 get quietly to the other part is 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.300
 say that we already teach this in a 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.060
 direct what there are people who got lost to 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.200
 than the video and when a 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.820
 direct there are people who maybe no longer 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.650
 he sees it through laziness, not because it's a long time 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.940
 better one hour and a half hour 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.150
 so then it was a bit then for 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 summarize a bit what we did not 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.190
 in the good video it was much longer 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.190
 it is clear what happens that good me that 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.570
 took more or less the best moments 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.210
 because we throw ourselves in the direct as 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.530
 half an hour like this trying to get to the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.690
 doctor chongo because the people asked 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.550
 we know that you can not get there okay no 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.380
 you can before you ask me 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.490
 in the comments there is a kind 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.750
 of transparent panel and you can not 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.100
 get in 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.080
 and well we were trying 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.430
 trying to prove that it does not 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.590
 could people see him that he does not know 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.910
 can and well in the video because I have not 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.340
 put because we throw ourselves quite a while 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.540
 and that it seemed more interesting not 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.740
 what was it about zero gravity the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.390
 and to be floating above 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 of the map without touching any of the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.260
 barriers of death and being able to go to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.810
 where you want no or we can go 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.300
 where we want now you will see that I'm going to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.010
 your tony then I come back and little else no 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.020
 good has any other option 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.790
 also in plan so to troll not you 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.800
 you can leave it fixed on the ground not you 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.140
 you can move you can only jump but not 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.820
 you can walk or run and some of 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.050
 these little things that is good then it is 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.760
 funny to hang out with the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.800
 colleagues and such and simply to Nestor 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.330
 ok I just wanted to show this hack that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.730
 the truth that is pretty handsome is 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.780
 interesting and it was just this so 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.010
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.420
 video if you liked to vote I like it 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.500
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.500
 video greetings to all
