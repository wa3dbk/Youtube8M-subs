each curl up from the middle down to the
root<00:00:41.719> and<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:42.899> add<00:00:43.170> more<00:00:43.530> hair<00:00:43.559> moving<00:00:44.399> out

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
root and then add more hair moving out

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.930 
root and then add more hair moving out
to<00:00:44.969> include<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.539> ends<00:00:46.399> this<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
to include the ends this is because the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.709 
to include the ends this is because the
hair<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.120> thicker<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.809> stronger<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> root

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
hair is thicker and stronger at the root

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.209 
hair is thicker and stronger at the root
at<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> ends<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.410> little<00:00:52.620> more<00:00:52.739> delicate

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
at the ends it's a little more delicate

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.450 
at the ends it's a little more delicate
and<00:00:53.989> doesn't<00:00:54.989> need<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.410> can't<00:00:55.739> take<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.219> much

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and doesn't need or can't take as much

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.830 
and doesn't need or can't take as much
heat<00:01:01.460> once<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.609> remove<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> iron<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
heat once you remove the iron from the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.500 
heat once you remove the iron from the
curl<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> hold<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.790> place<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
curl you want to hold it in place and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.590 
curl you want to hold it in place and
pin<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.490> allow<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> curl<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.330> pool

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
pin it this will allow the curl to pool

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.539 
pin it this will allow the curl to pool
into<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.200> shape<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.250> help<00:01:11.369> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
into that shape and that will help it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
into that shape and that will help it
hold<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:12.570> Joyce<00:01:12.869> head<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.619> covered

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
hold so now Joyce head is covered

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.800 
hold so now Joyce head is covered
entirely<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.479> curls<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.799> want<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.310> remove

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
entirely in curls now you want to remove

each clip just letting the curl drop as

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.980 
each clip just letting the curl drop as
