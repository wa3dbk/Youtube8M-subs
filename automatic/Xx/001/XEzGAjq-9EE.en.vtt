them neutered neutering is important for

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.749 
them neutered neutering is important for
a<00:00:12.540> number<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.929> different<00:00:13.320> reasons<00:00:13.759> certainly

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
a number of different reasons certainly

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.340 
a number of different reasons certainly
one<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> most<00:00:15.299> important<00:00:15.750> reasons<00:00:15.929> is

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
one of the most important reasons is

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.900 
one of the most important reasons is
neutering<00:00:16.770> will<00:00:16.890> prevent<00:00:17.190> your<00:00:17.369> sugar<00:00:17.609> glider

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
neutering will prevent your sugar glider

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.240 
neutering will prevent your sugar glider
from<00:00:18.119> ever<00:00:18.359> being<00:00:18.600> able<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.960> breed<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:20.130> will

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
from ever being able to breed it will

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.220 
from ever being able to breed it will
also<00:00:20.580> remove<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.119> desire<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.539> them<00:00:21.990> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
also remove the desire for them to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.140 
also remove the desire for them to
exhibit<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> those<00:00:23.250> normal<00:00:23.880> male

hormonal tendencies the other reason

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.460 
hormonal tendencies the other reason
that<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.210> recommend<00:00:27.689> neutering<00:00:28.050> male<00:00:28.199> sugar

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that we recommend neutering male sugar

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.220 
that we recommend neutering male sugar
gliders<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.000> surgical<00:00:30.750> procedure

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
gliders is that the surgical procedure

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.370 
gliders is that the surgical procedure
is<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> routine<00:00:32.550> procedure<00:00:33.079> fairly<00:00:34.079> safe

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
is as a routine procedure fairly safe

fairly uncomplicated as long as the
person<00:00:36.780> performing<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> surgery<00:00:37.680> knows<00:00:38.070> how

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
person performing the surgery knows how

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.790 
person performing the surgery knows how
to<00:00:38.430> neuter<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> sugar<00:00:39.390> glider<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> also

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
to neuter a sugar glider but it also

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.799 
to neuter a sugar glider but it also
enables<00:00:41.399> them<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.610> most<00:00:42.000> likely<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.540> along

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
enables them to most likely get along

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
enables them to most likely get along
better<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:43.890> sugar<00:00:44.100> gliders<00:00:44.550> live<00:00:44.820> in

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
better when sugar gliders live in

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060 
better when sugar gliders live in
community<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.559> live<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.860> other

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
community when they live with other

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.860 
community when they live with other
sugar<00:00:47.370> gliders<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.940> especially<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.539> males

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
sugar gliders and especially if males

sugar gliders and especially if males
are<00:00:49.200> living<00:00:49.469> together<00:00:49.879> neutering<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.030> does

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
are living together neutering them does

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
are living together neutering them does
often<00:00:51.960> allow<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> more<00:00:53.399> amicable

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
often allow them to have a more amicable

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
often allow them to have a more amicable
type<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.809> relationship<00:00:55.500> together<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> for

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
type of relationship together so for

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.189 
type of relationship together so for
those<00:00:57.120> reasons<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.690> usually<00:00:58.050> recommend

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
those reasons we usually recommend

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.189 
those reasons we usually recommend
having<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:59.010> neutered<00:00:59.370> sugar<00:01:00.329> gliders<00:01:00.870> have

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
having them neutered sugar gliders have

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.590 
having them neutered sugar gliders have
a<00:01:01.230> unique<00:01:01.649> testicular<00:01:02.219> anatomy<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
a unique testicular anatomy in that

on<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> lower<00:01:09.270> abdomen<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.080> will

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
on the lower abdomen and will

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
on the lower abdomen and will
demonstrate<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.790> mo<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.840> looks

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
demonstrate here in mo what that looks

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.800 
demonstrate here in mo what that looks
like<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> male<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
like so you can see in this male this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.890 
like so you can see in this male this
small<00:01:16.229> area<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.950> tissue<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.729> thats<00:01:18.240> hanging

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
small area of tissue here thats hanging

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.289 
small area of tissue here thats hanging
away<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> body<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.430> actually<00:01:21.030> what

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
away from the body is actually what

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.960 
away from the body is actually what
houses<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.990> testicles<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.759> how

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
houses the testicles and you can see how

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.420 
houses the testicles and you can see how
surgery<00:01:24.750> wise<00:01:25.049> you'd<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.070> able<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
surgery wise you'd have to be able to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.780 
surgery wise you'd have to be able to
remove<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.860> able<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> remove<00:01:29.490> both

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
remove that and be able to remove both

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.780 
remove that and be able to remove both
of<00:01:29.820> these<00:01:29.970> testes<00:01:30.509> completely<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.610> it's

of these testes completely so it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.760
