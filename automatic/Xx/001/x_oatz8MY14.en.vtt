00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.569 
great and now the pre-chorus we're going
to<00:03:01.069> use<00:03:01.159> this<00:03:01.310> rhythm<00:03:01.670> down<00:03:02.680> down<00:03:03.680> down<00:03:04.129> up<00:03:04.159> up

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
to use this rhythm down down down up up

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.970 
to use this rhythm down down down up up
down<00:03:04.670> down<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:06.290> rhythm<00:03:06.650> we're<00:03:06.799> going<00:03:06.920> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
down down this rhythm we're going to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.759 
down down this rhythm we're going to
split<00:03:07.159> split<00:03:07.939> it<00:03:08.060> between<00:03:08.180> two<00:03:08.870> chords<00:03:09.409> okay

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
split split it between two chords okay

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.899 
split split it between two chords okay
so<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.609> first<00:03:10.760> half<00:03:10.999> is<00:03:11.209> gonna<00:03:11.359> go<00:03:12.040> down<00:03:13.040> down

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
so the first half is gonna go down down

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:14.920 
so the first half is gonna go down down
down<00:03:14.269> up

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
down up

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.679 
down up
that's<00:03:15.349> only<00:03:15.469> one<00:03:15.920> chord<00:03:16.310> up<00:03:16.790> down<00:03:17.269> down

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
that's only one chord up down down

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.360 
that's only one chord up down down
another<00:03:18.409> chord<00:03:18.709> okay

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
another chord okay

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.539 
another chord okay
so<00:03:20.090> for<00:03:20.719> example<00:03:20.950> let's<00:03:21.950> begin<00:03:22.099> with<00:03:22.340> G<00:03:22.730> down

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
so for example let's begin with G down

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.470 
so for example let's begin with G down
and<00:03:25.549> then<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.849> next<00:03:26.120> half<00:03:26.889> film<00:03:27.889> down<00:03:28.340> with<00:03:29.000> B

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
and then the next half film down with B

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.920 
and then the next half film down with B
minor

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
minor

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.990 
minor

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
okay that's pretty much how this whole

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.839 
okay that's pretty much how this whole
section<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.930> pakoras<00:03:33.230> goes<00:03:33.949> it<00:03:34.790> is
