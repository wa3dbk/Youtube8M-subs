00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 as many of you will know 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.799
 exactly two days the program 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.280
 contact was conducting an investigation 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.559
 call online games passion or addiction 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 in which was narrated the world of the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.400
 video games and esport and with a great 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 focus on our dear mobile lyico 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.510
 play ens after the broadcast of this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.580
 said program began to generate 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.400
 various flips over objectivity 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.830
 of it or as it leaves the public image 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.050
 the concept of being a gamer or player 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.760
 licop legends today but before 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.820
 continue if you are from mexico argentina 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.950
 Venezuela or Spain is probably not 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.110
 you've seen this report so you 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.050
 I invite you to pause this video and if you 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.210
 interesting to see this quotes reportage you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.160
 direct to the description of my video and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.960
 see it and after that listen to me 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 opinion about him and so that you too 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.780
 you can form an opinion about this 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 reportage 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.600
 I would like us to talk about this in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.789
 the comments and I will try to answer 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.649
 all your doubts or understand all your 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.899
 points of view on this topic so 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.850
 let's start first with the good things about this 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.410
 report the first time in chile and I 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 I think in Latin America that a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.519
 TV show dedicates him so much 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.900
 time to the ies so in such a 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.970
 professional 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.650
 everything that this world encompasses in this 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 case in the report was reflected with the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.400
 effort of the boys of cause latin 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.800
 gamer k the shaft through his manager 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.020
 king see where he showed how they train 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.640
 these guys to do what they are 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.890
 today the champions of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.540
 Latin America and this undoubtedly for me and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.040
 I believe that in general for all 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.140
 community is something incredibly 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.450
 positive because this is shown 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.370
 much beyond a hobby but as a 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.230
 possible career that if taken with 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.510
 professionalism and seriousness as is the 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.580
 case here the shaft can give very good 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.650
 results also this is good because 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.420
 when showing them is because sports 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.729
 electronic as an activity that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 moves a lot of people it would not be strange that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.690
 the shaft falls I can choose to new 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.030
 sponsors and in general all 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.310
 sport in chile could add new 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.080
 sponsors new brands of chile or 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.820
 from anywhere in the world that 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.619
 interest in investing in them for 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.540
 support your sports charges and 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.369
 position your brands this is undoubtedly 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.320
 a great benefit for all the gamer 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.940
 national so that's fine for that without 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.500
 doubt to me this was the best thing about 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.959
 report now let's move on with what 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.670
 sure you want to hear the bad for 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.440
 contextualize in the report it 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.750
 presents the story of matías a young 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.640
 he apparently has a liquor addiction 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.010
 legends and that does nothing but play 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.530
 since he left school after repeating 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.510
 course and so on poor matias will be 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.280
 they add so many negative adjectives that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.020
 it is likely that they are not true but 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.640
 It seems a man consumed 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.320
 specifically by the game league of 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.340
 legends and take people out where I 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.350
 began to stop liking the story to 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.030
 bother the report because as it is 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.520
 possible that a program that is at 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.860
 community service society 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.900
 be able to plant similar 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.060
 stereotype to public opinion about 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.390
 the players of the code play jones on 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.850
 you about me about everyone in general I'm 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.460
 100% sure matías does not represent nor 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.380
 5% of players ego players 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.480
 the average player of lol as they say 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.420
 in the report he has about 15 to 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.430
 25 years and most of them study in 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.140
 the secondary or the lyceum and those that already 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.750
 they came out of those duties in general 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.250
 work or have university duties 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.630
 studying some career 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.190
 ethnic players legends 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.320
 generally they fulfill their duties 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.330
 like any other young person of our 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.770
 society come to their homes you share 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.780
 with their families and before 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.310
 sleep play a couple of games or 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.410
 when they have free time in the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.260
 course of the day and mostly not 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.180
 we leave school we are not playing 8 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.070
 hours a day although there are exceptions 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.110
 maybe once a month or at your end of 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 week when you have your free time you 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.640
 you spend more time but this is not 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.650
 means that you are an addict because 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.540
 singh we get addicts based on 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.460
 that concept we would have a country of 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.500
 addicted to soccer addicts to the 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.630
 Turkish teleseries the programs of 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.490
 entertainment and so on but nobody 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.260
 questioned that what bothers me to 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.450
 my subscribers is that it showed a 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.880
 just case as if it were all reality 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.100
 of the lic of legends and that is not what 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.740
 missing that report is objectivity 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.510
 because most of it was only shown what 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.070
 bad of the lol players because no 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.230
 they talked about people like the player 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.330
 Chilean vendetta which is a streamer a 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.830
 professional player who competes in the 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.570
 league of legends professional league 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.490
 that we have and also studies advertising 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.230
 If I'm not wrong and able to 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.910
 answer in a good way in those three 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.709
 areas and what I wonder is why 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.840
 what not to show that kind of player that 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.670
 it leaves us standing up because it will not show 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.260
 those certain people who see it as 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.340
 an escape route to this world so 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.470
 stressed 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.150
 we release tensions and 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.190
 we download our energies in the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.110
 game and in general the society needs 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.479
 this many practice sports like the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.820
 soccer to release tensions others read 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.990
 a good book others go jogging and 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.330
 now young people are preferring 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.310
 download those tensions and that energy to 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.970
 through the ico players what's wrong 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.500
 in that 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.449
 Matías sure is an equal person 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.889
 than us but they showed it as a 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.449
 addict to the level of the 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.460
 people who have problems with drugs 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.320
 and alcohol and in my opinion there is no point 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.389
 of comparison between these league of 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.460
 legends is popular because many 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.020
 like it or not is a sport not 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.210
 conventional since we perform 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.500
 physical activity but if we perform a 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.840
 great mental effort 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.330
 we need concentration skills 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.800
 Leadership group management among others 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.690
 skills to be able to have a good 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.760
 performance in this game but this is 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.440
 in quotation marks reports are not shown 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.560
 because apparently it's the editorial line 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.450
 of channel 13 these 90 does not cause controversy 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.310
 and you can tell me with good reason 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.380
 what's wrong with having done this 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.090
 type of stereotype of the report in my 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.770
 opinion if there is something wrong that happens with 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.930
 those young people that now their parents are 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.500
 thinking about banning them the game or 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.810
 thinking about the lic or playing 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.460
 The lole is the new base paste in the 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.660
 world that I do not like since there 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.490
 many people trying 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.500
 professionalize this because this looks 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.210
 as a healthy hobby and in this report 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.340
 nothing is done but to put a 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.140
 dangerous to the league of legends poster 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.820
 in front of the whole society and with this 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.860
 I'm not saying there are not people who do not 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.690
 they know how to control their desire to play lol 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.190
 and even sacrifice performance 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.950
 academic interpersonal relationships 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.470
 among other things but it is not the majority 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.230
 and if this will be considered a report 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.360
 serious should have shown both 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.780
 realities that of a normal player of 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.310
 legends lay and a quotes 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.110
 addicts so good people wanted a lot 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.120
 do this video because I really do not 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.530
 really liked that the story I 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.270
 I would love for you to leave your opinion in the 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.620
 comments if they agree or not or 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.600
 if they have a different opinion than mine 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.100
 try to answer all the comments 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.990
 or all questions that made me 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.160
 so we can talk about this topic and 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.140
 before I say goodbye I want to ask 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.820
 apologies for having been inactive a 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.530
 so much this last week but I was 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.880
 away from my computer and I did not have a 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.680
 good internet connection so the 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.480
 content will return to normalize in 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.310
 this week so this is all for today 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.900
 I'm the pic and see you in a couple of 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.900
 days with a new video bye bye
