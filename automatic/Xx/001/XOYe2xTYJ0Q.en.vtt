can do this for a video that you've shot
in<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> past<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.120> video

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
in the past and it's not just for video

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
in the past and it's not just for video
that<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.719> plan<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> shoot<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.440> future<00:00:40.829> but

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
that you plan to shoot in the future but

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.400

there<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.000> some<00:00:42.210> limitations<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.050> I'll<00:00:43.200> get

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
there are some limitations and I'll get

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.529 
there are some limitations and I'll get
into<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> later<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> could<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.390> from

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
into that later so you could see from

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.790 
into that later so you could see from
the<00:00:45.690> example<00:00:45.780> videos<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the example videos that the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.340 
the example videos that the
stabilization<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> pretty<00:00:48.120> amazing<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
stabilization is pretty amazing and the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
stabilization is pretty amazing and the
way<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.920> stabilize<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> videos

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
way we're going to stabilize the videos

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.110 
way we're going to stabilize the videos
is<00:00:51.239> through<00:00:51.539> something<00:00:51.719> called<00:00:52.879> YouTube<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
is through something called YouTube and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.479 
is through something called YouTube and
the<00:00:54.809> reason<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> suggest<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> do

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the reason I want to suggest that you do

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
the reason I want to suggest that you do
this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.059> YouTube<00:00:57.660> provides<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
this is because YouTube provides the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.110 
this is because YouTube provides the
top-of-the-line<00:00:58.980> software<00:00:59.879> video

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
top-of-the-line software video

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080 
top-of-the-line software video

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
stabilization for free and it is pretty

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
stabilization for free and it is pretty
much<00:01:03.239> identical<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> warp<00:01:04.470> stabilizer

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
much identical to the warp stabilizer

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.280 
much identical to the warp stabilizer

that's<00:02:15.650> happening<00:02:15.860> let's<00:02:16.310> talk<00:02:16.520> about<00:02:16.700> how<00:02:16.970> it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
that's happening let's talk about how it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.020 
that's happening let's talk about how it

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
works and the limitations for this so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.120 
works and the limitations for this so
when<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.330> comes<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.690> processing<00:02:21.500> based<00:02:21.680> video

when it comes to processing based video
stabilization<00:02:22.840> your<00:02:23.840> video<00:02:24.260> will<00:02:24.440> become<00:02:24.800> a

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
stabilization your video will become a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.980 
stabilization your video will become a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
little cropped at the edges because the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.900 
little cropped at the edges because the
computer<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.560> comparing<00:02:28.070> each<00:02:28.280> frame<00:02:28.670> or

are not present in all of the frames
this<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.690> how<00:02:38.840> YouTube<00:02:39.380> video<00:02:39.709> stabilization

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
this is how YouTube video stabilization

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.640 
this is how YouTube video stabilization
works<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.750> how<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:41.989> anti<00:02:42.410> shake

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
works and this is how the anti shake

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.979 
works and this is how the anti shake
feature<00:02:42.950> works<00:02:43.489> as<00:02:43.700> well<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.450> expect<00:02:44.870> your

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
feature works as well so expect your

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.470 
feature works as well so expect your
video<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.560> be<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.739> little<00:02:46.040> cropped<00:02:46.480> so

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
video to be a little cropped so

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.330 
video to be a little cropped so

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
problems and solutions for better video

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.490 
problems and solutions for better video
stabilization<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:53.150> one<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:54.140> see<00:02:54.320> that

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
stabilization for one you can see that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.259 
stabilization for one you can see that
all<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.860> examples<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.550> showed<00:02:56.000> our

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
all the examples that I showed our

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.199 
all the examples that I showed our
videos<00:02:57.080> I've<00:02:57.350> taken<00:02:57.620> outside<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:58.790> because

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
videos I've taken outside it is because

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.210 
videos I've taken outside it is because
the<00:02:59.390> lines<00:02:59.660> need<00:02:59.930> to<00:02:59.959> be<00:03:00.110> crisp<00:03:00.650> along<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
the lines need to be crisp along the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.520 
the lines need to be crisp along the
edges<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.610> your<00:03:01.760> video<00:03:02.180> for<00:03:02.510> stabilization<00:03:03.019> to

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
edges of your video for stabilization to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.400 
edges of your video for stabilization to
work<00:03:03.739> well<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.190> find<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.060> video<00:03:05.330> shot<00:03:05.840> indoors

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
work well I find that video shot indoors

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.080 
work well I find that video shot indoors
don't<00:03:06.739> have<00:03:06.920> crisp<00:03:07.280> lines<00:03:07.610> around<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
don't have crisp lines around the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.330 
don't have crisp lines around the
objects<00:03:08.570> for<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.900> variety<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.470> reasons<00:03:09.680> such<00:03:10.310> as

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
objects for a variety of reasons such as

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.970 
objects for a variety of reasons such as
aperture<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.299> noise<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:12.590> leads<00:03:12.860> to

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
aperture and noise and that leads to

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.130 
aperture and noise and that leads to
video<00:03:13.370> stabilization<00:03:13.850> not<00:03:14.450> producing<00:03:14.989> a

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
video stabilization not producing a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.560 
video stabilization not producing a
clean<00:03:15.410> result<00:03:15.769> although<00:03:16.549> I'm<00:03:17.000> sure<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.450> will

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
clean result although I'm sure it will

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.539 
clean result although I'm sure it will
be<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.780> lot<00:03:18.260> better<00:03:18.470> than<00:03:18.890> what<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.190> started

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
be a lot better than what you started

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.780 
be a lot better than what you started
off<00:03:19.730> with<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.660> won't<00:03:20.959> be<00:03:21.079> that<00:03:21.110> great<00:03:21.560> either

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
off with it won't be that great either

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.520 
off with it won't be that great either
so<00:03:22.790> with<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.150> in<00:03:23.360> mind<00:03:23.390> shoot<00:03:23.840> video<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:24.500> a

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
so with that in mind shoot video in a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.319 
so with that in mind shoot video in a
well-lit<00:03:24.799> settings<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.489> minimize<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.120> shake

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
well-lit settings and minimize the shake

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.170 
well-lit settings and minimize the shake
for<00:03:26.570> even<00:03:26.870> better<00:03:27.110> results<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.910> just<00:03:28.910> because

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
for even better results and just because

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.539 
for even better results and just because
you<00:03:29.329> can<00:03:29.480> stabilize<00:03:29.959> video<00:03:30.170> later<00:03:30.590> that

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
you can stabilize video later that

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.160 
you can stabilize video later that
doesn't<00:03:31.940> mean<00:03:32.030> at<00:03:32.239> all<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.720> shouldn't

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
doesn't mean at all that you shouldn't

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.960 
doesn't mean at all that you shouldn't
make<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.500> best<00:03:33.739> effort<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.370> hold<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.700> camera

make the best effort to hold the camera

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.509 
make the best effort to hold the camera
as<00:03:35.299> steady<00:03:35.630> as<00:03:35.720> possible<00:03:36.350> your<00:03:36.920> efforts<00:03:37.430> will

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
as steady as possible your efforts will

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.300 
as steady as possible your efforts will
all<00:03:37.910> add<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.420> better<00:03:38.630> video<00:03:38.989> at<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.350> end<00:03:39.380> this

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
all add to better video at the end this

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.979 
all add to better video at the end this
also<00:03:40.610> means<00:03:40.940> if<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.209> shoot<00:03:41.390> video<00:03:41.780> on<00:03:41.870> the

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
also means if you shoot video on the
