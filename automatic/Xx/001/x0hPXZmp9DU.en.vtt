00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
you're putting on size or one your
highest<00:01:26.790> macros<00:01:27.150> or<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.470> most<00:01:28.619> people

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
highest macros or if not for most people

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.760 
highest macros or if not for most people
in<00:01:29.130> most<00:01:29.280> goals<00:01:29.610> they<00:01:29.820> should<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:31.380> think

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
in most goals they should be and I think

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.899 
in most goals they should be and I think
it's<00:01:31.890> important<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.280> things<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.579> digest

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
it's important to get things that digest

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.300 
it's important to get things that digest
well<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.299> example<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.200> lot<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.070> people

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
well for example for me a lot of people

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
well for example for me a lot of people
like<00:01:35.430> brown<00:01:35.579> rice<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.659> there's<00:01:36.810> white

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
like brown rice and then there's white

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.480 
like brown rice and then there's white
rice<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.890> lot<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.100> people<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
rice right and a lot of people have the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.039 
rice right and a lot of people have the
idea<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.850> man<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> gotta<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.630> brown<00:01:39.840> rice

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
idea that man you gotta have brown rice

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.270 
idea that man you gotta have brown rice
because<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> complex<00:01:40.710> carbs<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.100> better

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
because it's a complex carbs it's better

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.800 
because it's a complex carbs it's better
you're<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.549> from<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.420> that's<00:01:42.600> actually

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you're like from and that's actually

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.410 
you're like from and that's actually
really<00:01:43.320> false<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> most<00:01:44.549> part<00:01:44.759> without

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
really false for the most part without

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
really false for the most part without
getting<00:01:45.630> into<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.899> white<00:01:46.409> rice<00:01:46.619> digests

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
getting into that white rice digests

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.120 
getting into that white rice digests
better<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.490> me<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.970> fits<00:01:48.329> better<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.869> me

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
better with me it fits better with me

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
better with me it fits better with me
you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.280> things<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.880> potatoes<00:01:51.360> go

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you know things like that potatoes go

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
you know things like that potatoes go
but<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.079> white<00:01:52.290> potato<00:01:52.590> goes<00:01:53.130> better<00:01:53.399> with

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
but like white potato goes better with

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910 
but like white potato goes better with
