00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.460
 or the people welcome to another video from 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.319
 yes, and it is that we are brought here a new 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.110
 minecraft video and it's a video 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.430
 analysis review and installation of a motorcycle 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.850
 that just came out available for the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.170
 version 1.6 2.1 new in minecraft a 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.690
 second let's end this damn 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.820
 kripper dies dies dies dies already 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.230
 is dead until the clipper as that a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.750
 new that you just have available for the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 1.6 point 1 called better sprint 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.740
 map that translated into Spanish so 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.810
 march way would be a better way to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.400
 sprint in agreement and good in what 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.630
 consists this mode guys you will be me 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.300
 asking the comments so very 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.550
 simple is to be able to sprint from 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 unlimited way and be able to go like this in 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.720
 plans or who plan lentito as a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 ninja also unlimitedly guys 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.010
 that's right so let's make a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.420
 show to access the menu of the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 we would have to give options a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 once it's installed in controls and here 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 we would see an option that makes better 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.380
 sprint we give you and here as you can see 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 are the controls with the control 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.969
 left we can sprint in agreement 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.809
 no need to give it twice as 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.309
 we said before with the w with the g 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.869
 we would have a sprint tool of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.970
 I agree that this would basically be if 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.700
 we give 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.110
 sprint we would do unlimitedly of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.970
 agreement and never for closers 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.670
 sprint until we gave the g of 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.440
 new and him and if we give him to and we would go 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.750
 all the time in plan lentito like a 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.790
 ninja unlimitedly also up 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.440
 that we removed the y and the zero is 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.120
 basically a button to access this 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.620
 menu directly then here you have the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.840
 option that puts of whatsapp in that it puts 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.250
 disable that is not activated and if 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.780
 what activates is basically you go back to 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.270
 enable the option to give it twice 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.730
 to vw to explicitly agree and this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.560
 it would be another option that is disabled 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.600
 that puts running in all directions 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.250
 you can enable it or it's not for running 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.690
 in all directions I have it 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.430
 disabled as it came but 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.260
 good for that it serves and this from here that 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.020
 It puts flying boost that basically 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.550
 translate as turbo to fly I think that 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.110
 consists of the speed of the sprint that 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.759
 neither has it improved much but good 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.970
 let's do an example myself right now 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.430
 I said it right and I'm not giving it anymore 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.530
 to nothing, I'm just painting 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.229
 unlimited way of agreement now I leave 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.729
 unpainted and I give it again now w 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.320
 once only that is my button to 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.880
 go ahead and follow is painting so 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.670
 unlimited agreement no longer normal 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.750
 I do not walk standards I'm going it is painting and I 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.670
 tired as 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.590
 but nevertheless I can go explaining 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.020
 unlimited way until I gave it to g of 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.310
 new and I stop or if not I can also 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.170
 give the left control and this 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.240
 so well I can also run 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.950
 unlimitedly as long as you keep 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.810
 the shaft pressed in accordance instead 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.700
 rather the control pressed cow 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.130
 that you die instead of having to give 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.230
 twice to the w that is what I was 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.090
 accustomed and then the and the same with 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.070
 the same function and as you can see I'm going 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.780
 very slow if now I quit and stopped walking 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.150
 and again I do the same I keep going 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.440
 slow until he removes the me again 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.180
 if it can not be done with the shift of 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.410
 all life good guys I hope you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.850

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.790
 way because to this cow the cow that laughs 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.959
 he has loved that yes more and good 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.310

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.900
 part of the video in which I teach you

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.710

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.270
 lavrov 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.740
 Well, guys, we've already reached the 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.300
 part of the video in which I show you how 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.800
 install this mode of agreement since 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.090
 many people apparently are having 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.720
 many problems with this new version 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.830
 of minecraft 1.6 point 1 as they look 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.180
 with many problems when it comes to 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.100
 install a mobile that is now made of 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.350
 different way so let's get 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.060
 with it to the grain and to see how it is done 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.560
 guys well then once you have is 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.730
 downloaded what is the mode that 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.900
 obviously you have the link to the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.730
 description of the video as you know 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.660
 you will have this folder of agreement when 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.840
 you see it is the mod 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.460
 vettel sprinter 1.6 point 1 of agreement and 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.720
 here you would have the 4 files of the mont 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.850
 According now I'll teach you how 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.290
 how it is installed and nothing you know that 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.790
 it could be that you can not see the mouse of 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.170
 my computer and it's because of the program that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.300
 I'm using to record in agreement that 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.740
 if I do it then it is a whole 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.570
 story but maybe if it looks but 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.540
 let's not continue with the subject as being of 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.650
 This mode is very easy to do well 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.480
 the only thing we need is obviously 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.340
 download us and now we would have to 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.330
 go to our minecraft folder for 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.190
 the only thing you have to do is 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.420
 give start to the windows button here 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.550
 down to the left and there you can 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.880
 write if you do not know where it is and 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.910
 you can the app percentage the data and another 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.960
 once percentage of agreement and once 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.430
 you do this you should leave this 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.440
 folder called roaming valente 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.000
 you the island folder roaming and 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.829
 here is point minecraft here is where 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.840
 is your minecraft you dais pointed 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.600
 main I believe in agreement and you go here to this 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.789
 folder that is called version or versions 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.199
 a second here is this folder of 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.509
 versions of agreement here you have it 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.930
 and here guys you have to copy the 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.940
 folder 1.6 point one agree so 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.729
 I'm going to eliminate this copy and you do 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.160
 ce control or right click and copy 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.440
 go back to paste here agree let's go 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.110
 to hit again and now we have to 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.509
 rename and this folder is call 1.6 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.060
 point 1 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.789
 sprint of agreement it is important that what 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.870
 you call it sprint you have to call it 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.789
 exactly as I am 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.139
 doing in the video so now we're going 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.639
 inside the folder with all the 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.470
 copied files as you can see these 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.880
 they are backup copies of me that is not 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.860
 of these winrar you do not have why 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.539
 have you agree and we are going to 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.990
 rename these two files, that is the 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.389
 1.6 point 1 and 1.6 point 1 point j are 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.530
 Ok then we are going to regulate 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.380
 the first and the only thing that we have to 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.470
 to do is call it 1.6 point 1 low bar 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.300
 sprint in agreement and we already left it and in 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.610
 the next one we're going to call him 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.030
 as it is only with the same 1.6 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.620
 points one low sprint also of 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.389
 agreement is worth this exit the first 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.710
 part of the installation of the mole 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.699
 following is very simple the only thing that 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.919
 we would have to do is basically 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.530
 go to our file 1.6 point 1 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.199
 sprint and open it in agreement I open with 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.970
 winrar and here we would come out let's say what 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.129
 is the part of the agreement mode that is 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.590
 all better said forgive me those 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.729
 files in this 1.6 point folder 1 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.199
 now all you have to do 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.479
 is basically to catch the files of the 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.330
 mod in question this is the time 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.490
 restrict you catch them the four and the 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.710
 drag to the 1.6 point folder 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.479
 1 low sprint bar in selection eyes 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.190
 is the replacement method that is 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.599
 add and replace the jce accept from 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.430
 agreement and this would already be installed 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.440
 part and the only thing you would have to do 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.629
 is to delete this folder called meta 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.520
 and do not agree to work and you can already 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.840
 close this file according to 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.490
 next you have to do and already 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.430
 last is the last process is 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.669
 basically go to this one called 1.6 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.289
 point 1 to lower sprint point j are what 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.909
 April also agree we open it 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.289
 is going to say that no no has not found 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:29.330
 no program to open it you have it 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.169
 to select the option to open with 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.060
 a 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.979
 that you have installed in this case is the 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.080
 notebook of agreement you open it with the 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.259
 notebook and I would have to leave here 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.319
 the option in id 1.6 point 1 is worth 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:44.449
 here where it puts 1 points 6.1 we go to 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.659
 give low bar and let's put 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.699
 sprint also the same as with all the 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:51.020
 written more sprint according once 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.430
 done this the only thing that remains is 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.169
 give it to save it 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.729
 agree and the only thing that we have left now 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.409
 Follow our launcher and enjoy 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.150
 of the mod in agreement we give the launcher 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.439
 of minecraft and this is the last step 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.830
 you will have to give this box that 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:06.770
 put edit profile and select is 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.569
 release 1 points 6.1 low sprint bar 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.339
 then you give to follow profile and what 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.949
 The only thing you have to do now is to give 

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:15.620
 play is what loads what is the 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:18.319
 screen and suddenly bullock download 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.999
 minecraft and you get inside to play 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:22.610
 agree and now if for example we give 

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:23.839
 the skate options and controls you can 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.550
 see that here is the option of the better 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:27.080
 spring in agreement and here are the 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.080
 controls of the mod that we have already seen 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.580
 before g and agree and nothing and no longer 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.110
 would have installed without problems if 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.360
 you have the first way for you to see 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.909
 how the hell 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.099
 improve this in minecraft okay in agreement 

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:41.689

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:43.969
