00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.920 
benefits I think so we're going to try
to<00:00:42.960> make<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.379> at<00:00:43.620> home<00:00:43.829> today<00:00:44.420> after<00:00:45.420> doing

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to make this at home today after doing

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.799 
to make this at home today after doing
some<00:00:46.140> research<00:00:46.320> online<00:00:47.390> we're<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> try

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
some research online we're going to try

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
some research online we're going to try
making<00:00:49.109> at<00:00:49.379> home<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.859> then<00:00:49.949> this<00:00:50.160> video<00:00:50.399> will

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
making at home and then this video will

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.540 
making at home and then this video will
show<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.899> beginning<00:00:52.530> process<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.519> way

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
show the beginning process all the way

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
show the beginning process all the way
to<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.879> end<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> take<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> whole

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
to the end so it's going to take a whole

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.160 
to the end so it's going to take a whole
month<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.519> is<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:57.059> step<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.510> we've

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.710 

doesn't<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.549> soaking<00:01:54.119> wet<00:01:54.479> or

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
doesn't have to be soaking wet or

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
doesn't have to be soaking wet or
anything<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.080> that<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.650> really

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
anything like that so I'm just really

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.749 
anything like that so I'm just really
just<00:01:56.490> drizzling<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:58.470> beer<00:01:58.740> over<00:01:58.770> randomly

just drizzling the beer over randomly

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:12.370 
just drizzling the beer over randomly
here

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.360 

I<00:02:13.930> think<00:02:14.930> that's<00:02:15.290> good<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:18.380> this<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.220> race

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
I think that's good so this is the race

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.830 
I think that's good so this is the race
culture<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.820> can<00:02:19.970> use<00:02:20.090> any<00:02:20.270> type<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.540> rice

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
culture you can use any type of rice

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.290 
culture you can use any type of rice
cooker<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.350> long<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.800> as<00:02:22.070> long<00:02:22.550> as<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.910> has<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
cooker as long and as long as it has the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.960 
cooker as long and as long as it has the
warm<00:02:23.630> setting<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.980> need<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.400> put<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
warm setting and you need to put the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.990 
warm setting and you need to put the
vegetable<00:02:26.810> steamer<00:02:27.050> rack<00:02:28.010> at<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.370> bottom<00:02:28.790> of
