about<00:00:15.469> this<00:00:15.710> fishing<00:00:16.070> thing<00:00:16.330> today<00:00:17.330> we're

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
about this fishing thing today we're

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.290 
about this fishing thing today we're
going<00:00:17.930> to<00:00:18.080> be<00:00:18.170> demonstrating<00:00:18.580> how<00:00:19.580> to<00:00:19.610> do<00:00:20.090> a

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
going to be demonstrating how to do a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.350 
going to be demonstrating how to do a
Bimini<00:00:20.990> twist<00:00:21.290> now<00:00:22.250> this<00:00:22.430> particular<00:00:22.610> Bimini

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
Bimini twist now this particular Bimini

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.510 
Bimini twist now this particular Bimini
twist<00:00:23.930> we're<00:00:24.170> going<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.380> be<00:00:24.439> doing<00:00:24.590> using

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
twist we're going to be doing using

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.970 
twist we're going to be doing using
braided<00:00:26.000> line<00:00:26.450> in<00:00:27.170> this<00:00:27.349> case<00:00:27.410> it's<00:00:27.770> going<00:00:27.890> to

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
braided line in this case it's going to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.890 
braided line in this case it's going to
be<00:00:28.040> 80<00:00:28.220> pound<00:00:28.579> braided<00:00:28.820> line<00:00:29.090> that<00:00:29.689> you<00:00:29.750> can

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
be 80 pound braided line that you can

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.290 
be 80 pound braided line that you can
typically<00:00:30.259> use<00:00:30.560> for<00:00:31.250> reading<00:00:31.460> purposes<00:00:32.119> of

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
typically use for reading purposes of

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.080 
typically use for reading purposes of
kingfish<00:00:32.829> GTS<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.070> other<00:00:34.550> hard<00:00:34.820> pulling

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
kingfish GTS and other hard pulling

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.720 
kingfish GTS and other hard pulling
species<00:00:35.770> so<00:00:36.770> basically<00:00:37.190> you<00:00:37.370> want<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.610> make

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
species so basically you want to make

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.490 
species so basically you want to make
sure<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.239> rod<00:00:38.480> is<00:00:38.720> in<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:38.989> rod<00:00:39.170> holder

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
sure that the rod is in the rod holder

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.420 
sure that the rod is in the rod holder
because<00:00:39.559> you're<00:00:39.770> going<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:39.980> need<00:00:40.100> to<00:00:40.250> pull

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
because you're going to need to pull

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.069 
because you're going to need to pull
tension<00:00:40.700> on<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.360> form<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.899> particular

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
tension on it to form this particular

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.380 
tension on it to form this particular
knot<00:00:42.940> so<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.840> grab<00:00:45.079> u-n-d<00:00:45.500> alive<00:00:45.949> and<00:00:46.390> you

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
knot so you grab u-n-d alive and you

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:58.150 
knot so you grab u-n-d alive and you
form<00:00:47.690> 43<00:00:48.530> turns<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.489> we<00:00:49.579> go<00:00:49.670> through<00:00:49.730> it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.860 

41<00:00:59.160> 42<00:00:59.730> 43<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:02.040> we<00:01:02.220> basically<00:01:02.730> grab<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.660> loot

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
41 42 43 and we basically grab the loot

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.540 
41 42 43 and we basically grab the loot
that<00:01:03.899> we've<00:01:04.229> created<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.710> again<00:01:05.010> put<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
that we've created it again put it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.570 
that we've created it again put it
around<00:01:05.640> something<00:01:06.119> solid<00:01:07.130> we<00:01:08.130> ensure<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
around something solid we ensure that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
around something solid we ensure that
the<00:01:08.729> rod<00:01:08.940> is<00:01:09.180> nice<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> sold<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> other

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the rod is nice and sold on the other

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.370 
the rod is nice and sold on the other
end<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.130> nice<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.400> tight<00:01:12.110> then<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.260> get

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
end so it's nice and tight then we get

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.130 
end so it's nice and tight then we get
the<00:01:13.500> legs<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.520> braid<00:01:14.759> and<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.750> split<00:01:16.020> them

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the legs of the braid and we split them

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.320 
the legs of the braid and we split them
and<00:01:16.350> pull<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.800> in<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.759> meantime<00:01:17.909> this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and pull them up in the meantime this

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
and pull them up in the meantime this
should<00:01:18.509> stay<00:01:18.720> perpendicular<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.710> them<00:01:19.860> for

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
should stay perpendicular to them for

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.300 
should stay perpendicular to them for
the<00:01:20.190> main<00:01:20.400> brain<00:01:21.110> as<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.590> starts<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> bunch

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the main brain as it all starts to bunch

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
the main brain as it all starts to bunch
up<00:01:23.520> together<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.690> it's<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:24.960> nice<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
up together and it's all nice and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.070 
up together and it's all nice and
bunched<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.399> then<00:01:27.300> we<00:01:27.450> turn<00:01:27.720> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
bunched up like so then we turn this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.510 
bunched up like so then we turn this
down<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.759> keep<00:01:29.940> going<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.420> pull<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.520> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
down and keep going and pull it and that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.999 
down and keep going and pull it and that
will<00:01:32.610> spin<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.000> back<00:01:33.210> down<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> braid<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:37.009> once

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
will spin it back down the braid so once

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.940 
will spin it back down the braid so once
it<00:01:38.160> comes<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> end<00:01:39.259> we<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.410> half<00:01:40.679> hitch

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it comes to the end we do a half hitch

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.400 
it comes to the end we do a half hitch
around<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.429> leg<00:01:42.619> like<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.310> pull<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:44.670> up

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
around one leg like so and pull it up

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.249 
around one leg like so and pull it up
half<00:01:46.410> hitch<00:01:46.679> around<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.100> other<00:01:47.190> leg<00:01:47.929> right<00:01:48.929> so

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
half hitch around the other leg right so

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830 
half hitch around the other leg right so
pull<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.910> then<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> half<00:01:51.300> hitch<00:01:51.539> around

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pull it up and then a half hitch around

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.030 
pull it up and then a half hitch around
both<00:01:52.050> together

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:10.540 

there<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.689> just<00:02:00.689> trim<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.080> tag<00:02:01.320> off

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.380 

and<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:11.660> retains<00:02:12.230> pretty<00:02:12.530> much<00:02:12.740> 100%<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.850> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
and that retains pretty much 100% of the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.600 
and that retains pretty much 100% of the
brain<00:02:14.540> strength<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.170> great<00:02:15.410> night<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.830> ready

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
brain strength a great night and ready

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:27.570 
brain strength a great night and ready
to<00:02:16.700> go

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.640
