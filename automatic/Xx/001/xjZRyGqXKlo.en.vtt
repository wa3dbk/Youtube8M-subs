 year of other natural disasters 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.689
 intentional but also of 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.700
 Celebrations and victories 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.740
 of course they did not miss the appointment to the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.980
 video games and they did it with force 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.619
 we played with xbox and gamecube play 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.169
 station2 game boy advance and as not 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.509
 our fish the online was in their 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.000
 beginnings there was no tlc is nor high 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.510
 resolution for not having there was not even three 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.510
 of games 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.980
 however they were twelve full months 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.129
 of strong releases large sequels 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.620
 and also sagas that premiered and 2004 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.620
 an unrepeatable year we remind you 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 we started with a lot of speed to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 overcome the January slope 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.070
 mario kart beauty broke conventions 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 in the legendary driving saga of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 nintendo while sonny turns us 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.030
 I discovered that the union was strength 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.250
 in between he got final fantasy x 2 and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 its magic jay pop although it is clear that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.030
 this beginning of the year was for the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.890
 understand the arrival of snake to the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.649
 cube-shaped console was a whole 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.899
 Celebration far cry was no less 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.820
 became the king of the moment and not 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.619
 it's said by pandora tomorrow of the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.759
 darkness had never come so 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.759
 well in a video game 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.289
 it was an exciting year we had a 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.570
 ciro true classic like metroid 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.850
 mission extreme violence from the hand of 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.189
 driving sleeve of the good with the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.990
 second part of playing brain driver the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.570
 fear got us into the body with the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.429
 Blissful camera of Project Hero 2 and 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 there was the main course of spring 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.780
 a ninja gaiden that had everything from 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.460
 blood the stars agreed 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.560
 so that the second part of kill bill 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.929
 that year will also come to the billboards 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.569
 Of course, it did not seem like coincidence 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.250
 Tarantino Itagaki would have done well 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.250
 couple geniuses and figures 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.280
 June arrived and was approaching our 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.750
 great annual appointment the e3 but we're 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.240
 sure that many missed it 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.370
 when half life sort went on sale and 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.070
 if they were not already there, fit and red dead 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.140
 stir to justify the absence the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.700
 fair angelina discovered us things like 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.870
 the love of Peter Moore for the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.640
 Tattoos 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.519
 everything strong that came king and in 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.170
 scene we saw the witcher for the first time 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.450
 when nobody knew what was going to 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.000
 become we found out that it was that 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.190
 trust the people scolded with the new 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.250
 Zelda 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.530
 and already many remained a star 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.560
 and the new dsi seemed like something to us 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.560
 impossible 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.829
 that event was history as they were 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.810
 the games that came later 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.209
 dunn 3 kept the good name of the saga 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.010
 after so many years of the chronicles 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.569
 of riddick became an example of 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.090
 video game that honored a 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.489
 license 'burn out' 3 led to the popular 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.810
 saga up to some quality dimensions 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.290
 unknown the sims 2 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.780
 final fantasy 11 silent hill 43 and of 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.889
 outbreak level we imagine a little 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.049
 what was the situation 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.939
 found with my money although there was a 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.430
 game that truly deserved our 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.650
 money is the wars battlefront was a 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.349
 indispensable and that without making less 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.400
 a town of war block total word or the 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.400
 great katamari damacy 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.590
 it was the year we discovered that no 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.510
 it did not matter what time you put 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.120
 play titles like animal crossing 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.250
 we also take out the skateboard we gave 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.500
 a few kicks we captured some 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.840
 how many pokemon do we assign orders to 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.090
 our ping and we even play the bongos 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.040
 but the best was to come first 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.260
 with the great facebook that we 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.150
 fascinated with his universe and then with 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.890
 gta san andreas wearing the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.960
 franchise to a point that we never 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.700
 we could have imagined what 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.860
 they had a playstation 2 by that 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.860
 so they were literally like that 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.489
 arrived in November the 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.500
 Christmas and video games went out 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.660
 from the earth the first person 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.430
 imposed with killzone and a set of 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.170
 second parties that destroyed the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.170
 classic said in the two 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.140
 metroid prime 2 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.350
 and the great half life 2 that would mark a 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.600
 before and after in the history of the 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.730
 shooters and the pce was like to turn 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.800
 absolutely crazy less bad than 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.870
 we had a minis cap to change 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.970
 record a paper mario to throw us 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.310
 some laughs or the fucking 3 kite for 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.140
 to let off steam and if there was not always 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.690
 make us affect lit and deadly halo 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.580
 kombat 'disappointment' or better convert us 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.040
 in pirates with the new sid meier 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.440
 for the bravest was to enjoy 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.840
 other games like vampire the masque 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.800
 break or the soul of the warrior that either 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.360
 it was wrong 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.670
 and we must not forget that world of 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.590
 warcraft was released in America by 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.330
 true now we finally know why 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.760
 he was so successful 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.760
 I'm chuck norris and I approve this game 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.450
 2004 was one of the most complete years 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.820
 in terms of events and 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.680
 releases that we remember unrepeatable 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.840
 it could not be otherwise with the 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.910
 amount of things that we experienced was 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.980
 a year of many characters and news 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.720
 important for them to then say that the 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.520
 video game industry has little 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.890
 history what happens is that it is very 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.690
 concentrated and you know what is the best 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.790
 the history of video games can be 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.410
 revive so you dust off your 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.950
 controls and you have lost some of 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.950
 these games
