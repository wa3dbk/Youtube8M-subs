of<00:02:11.549> went<00:02:11.730> into<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.000> little<00:02:12.030> bit<00:02:12.299> of<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.450> dark<00:02:12.660> zone

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
of went into a little bit of a dark zone

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.140 
of went into a little bit of a dark zone
with<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.709> media<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.310> went<00:02:14.489> into<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.790> shadows

with the media you went into the shadows
a<00:02:15.299> little<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.290> think<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.500> shadow<00:02:16.709> is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
a little is that I think the shadow is

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
a little is that I think the shadow is
just<00:02:17.130> because<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.459> him<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.849> do<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.840> apart

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
just because of him to do it but apart

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.080 
just because of him to do it but apart
from<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.560> think<00:02:19.860> after<00:02:20.549> every<00:02:20.880> film
