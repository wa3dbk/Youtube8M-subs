00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello very good everyone I'm image between 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.700
 ex I distracted a new video and good 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.430
 Well, some news is distracted but 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.890
 that very interesting and it is that it turns out that 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.120
 it may be that in the not too distant future 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:20.310
 take out a pack of flashback maps like this 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.520
 how it happened in gears of war 2 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 software 3 that drew maps of 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.750
 previous 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.530
 gears because it can also be that they happen 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.900
 this 9 in guijo guards and is not 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.960
 100% confirmed but yes it is 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.020
 confirmed at 90 percent is worth it because 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.750
 it's like that because jean brown the designer 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.470
 gears of war diament map manager 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.890
 he has put a tweet in which he tells us that 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.830
 let's not forget to vote in the forums 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.890
 of epic games to choose our maps 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.310
 favorites from previous installments of 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.470
 gears of war 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.170
 I do not know why but it is excluded that the 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.479
 software 1 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.000
 I really do not know why but in a tweet 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.580
 braun of what 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.300
 kiss of war 3 maps of gears of war 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.880
 3 was likely to be put by the 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.550
 course war 2 was also likely but 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.729
 those of software clips 1 was not likely 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.560
 that they chose it to do those 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.690
 maps not the truth I do not know why because 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.210
 I loved kirk maps 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.160
 software 1 as you know I said 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.490
 always for me the best maps of 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.100
 gears of war have been those of 1 and 2 and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.420
 now they only let us choose those of 2 and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.950
 the 3 but good better than nothing is 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.229
 so good in the description I'm going to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.119
 leave the thread that will take the post to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.860
 this thread where you are trying this 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.350
 matter for you to choose 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.289
 your favorite maps and such 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.650
 you can choose up to a maximum of 10 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.920
 maps 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.110
 between software 2 and war 3 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.350
 you have 10 votes to vote on the maps 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.220
 of course I keep gears of war 3 either 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.600
 both original and those of the dlc 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.430
 ok you can vote 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.329
 those that are from the f and not from the f 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.739
 Which maps are winning right now? 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:34.099
 for now is leading the map of River 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.370
 gears of war 2 that is one of my maps 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.340
 favorites not to mention the favorite the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.280
 I really loved playing there the way 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.260
 guard when the leaders were hiding 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.930
 in the houses of xalisco that the mortar 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.250
 to try to kill him with the bow 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.530
 also the truth is that this map 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.889
 love as you said, I think it's my 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.480
 favorite and that is the one that goes first 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:01.579
 position with 358 votes for now in 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.609
 second position goes the channel map 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:08.239
 this map is to say software 1 but 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.359
 appears in gears of war 2 so if 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:16.189
 you can vote and go in second position 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:19.340
 for only 350 points is worth 8 for 8 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.829
 points less by 8 votes less than the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 the first river position is worth 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.120
 third position 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.310
 vasek out or software shopping 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.000
 3 with 343 votes 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.410
 and things are very just in fourth 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.920
 position was the debut that will be deposit 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.200
 gasoline is , a gas station 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.180
 system for I do not know if that is software 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.360
 one that appears in gears of war 2 the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.590
 I do not remember, I remember yes 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.230
 that there was a map if from a 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.819
 gas station but I do not know which one to be 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.040
 referential of the gir software one that 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.040
 appear and software 2 also or to that of 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.819
 kings of war 2 that there is another that is another 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.209
 Gas station the truth, I do not know very well 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.719
 but good and in fifth position goes 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.900
 war machine war machine with 272 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:14.060
 votes this is on that go software 1 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.120
 then they also put it wanted war 2 and 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.380
 Well now they also want to put 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.750
 these are the top 5 is worth the top 5 of 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.449
 the maps that people are choosing 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.690
 which I guess will be the ones that would come out 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:33.349
 ok I guess they are not going they will not do 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.590
 more than five maps so remake is not going to 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.720
 make more than five maps because I guess 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.300
 that will be free since done that they have 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.240
 repeated I suppose they will put it free 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.490
 not although I pretend to know with people 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.180
 is the big game 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.180
 good 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.710
 you know I leave the thread of the page 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.810
 is from the forum of epic games so 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.930
 you can vote and if our maps 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.169
 favorites 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.990
 in the description and I of course that 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.660
 I will also vote for a new all in 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.289
 My vote is for those who want to know 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.169
 are going to be in the first place for river like 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.900
 I already said before going software 2 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.110
 second place for gears of channels 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.870
 war 1 that also appear and howard 2 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.520
 no place this map is from gears of 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.250
 war 2 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.169
 in third place in fourth place sorry 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:38.749
 it's going to be for the dry dock 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:43.330
 and in fifth place the truth I do not know which one 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:43.330
 I'm going to vote, I have to think about it 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.290
 but hey surely it is some of 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.020
 software two because of gears of war 3 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.900
 so I really like not to be a dam 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.210
 dry and maybe mercy but I prefer 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.220
 someone else from gears of war 2 since 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.129
 jaguar I have it too much to repeat 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.629
 repeated 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:06.369
 and I do not know are not very votes 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.169
 so nothing you already know in the description 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:10.479
 I leave the page 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.999
 I hope you vote and I do not expect anything 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.979
 have liked the video of a like for 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:18.839
 continue supporting the channel and see you in 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.839
 the next video see you later
