Johnny Candido saw the video none of
them<00:01:11.159> saw<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> problem<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
them saw a problem with it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.730 
them saw a problem with it
in<00:01:12.270> fact<00:01:14.299> they<00:01:15.299> generally<00:01:15.810> agree<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.590> my

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
in fact they generally agree with my

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.620 
in fact they generally agree with my
stance<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.549> most<00:01:17.939> back<00:01:18.210> injuries

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
stance on it is that most back injuries

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.190 
stance on it is that most back injuries
from<00:01:18.869> squatting<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.590> caused<00:01:19.860> by<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
from squatting are not caused by that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.920 
from squatting are not caused by that
now<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.259> could<00:01:22.619> argue<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:24.240> maximum

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
now we could argue that with maximum

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.890 
now we could argue that with maximum
loads<00:01:25.259> having<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.830> go<00:01:25.950> super<00:01:26.280> deep<00:01:26.460> because

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
loads having to go super deep because

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
loads having to go super deep because
posterior<00:01:27.900> pelvic<00:01:28.080> tilt<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.890> worse<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
posterior pelvic tilt will get worse the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.280 
posterior pelvic tilt will get worse the
deeper<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.119> go<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> squat<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> some

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
deeper you go on a squat and some

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980 
deeper you go on a squat and some
federations<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.520> require<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.689> strict

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
federations do require very very strict

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.620 
federations do require very very strict
steps<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.409> powerlifting<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:36.060> expect

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
steps and powerlifting and they expect

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
steps and powerlifting and they expect
you<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:36.900> inches<00:01:37.320> deeper<00:01:37.650> than<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:37.920> really

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you to go inches deeper than what really

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.440 
you to go inches deeper than what really
should<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.549> requiring<00:01:38.909> by<00:01:39.210> their<00:01:39.360> own

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
should be requiring by their own

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.350 
should be requiring by their own
rulebook<00:01:39.750> sometimes<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> when<00:01:42.000> you're<00:01:42.150> using

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
rulebook sometimes and when you're using

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.499 
rulebook sometimes and when you're using
true<00:01:42.960> competition<00:01:43.920> max<00:01:44.490> loads<00:01:44.820> yeah<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.329> can

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
true competition max loads yeah that can

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.880 
true competition max loads yeah that can
definitely<00:01:45.659> put<00:01:46.049> stress<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.590> lower<00:01:46.649> back

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
definitely put stress on your lower back

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.190 
definitely put stress on your lower back
that<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.310> may<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.729> want<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.899> they're

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that you may not want because they're

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.719 
that you may not want because they're
forcing<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.130> deep<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.430> it's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
forcing you to go so deep that it's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.730 
forcing you to go so deep that it's
causing<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.299> happen<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> most

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
causing it to happen but for the most

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740 
causing it to happen but for the most
part<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> sort<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.329> thing<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.540> really

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
part it's the sort of thing is really

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.929 
part it's the sort of thing is really
only<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.079> concern<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> novice<00:01:56.159> lifter<00:01:56.610> for

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
only a concern for the novice lifter for

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.399 
only a concern for the novice lifter for
people<00:01:57.180> who<00:01:57.270> don't<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.719> take<00:01:57.960> me<00:01:58.110> down

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
people who don't have to take me down

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
people who don't have to take me down
they<00:01:58.680> don't<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:58.920> how<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.070> squat<00:01:59.460> correctly

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
they don't know how to squat correctly

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.389 
they don't know how to squat correctly
and<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:01.290> people<00:02:01.409> who<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.619> weak<00:02:01.890> cores<00:02:02.189> but

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and for people who have weak cores but

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.399 
and for people who have weak cores but
if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> strong<00:02:03.390> well-developed<00:02:03.930> core

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
if you have a strong well-developed core

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
if you have a strong well-developed core
that's<00:02:04.649> why<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> throw<00:02:05.520> an<00:02:05.670> extra<00:02:05.820> core<00:02:06.240> work

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that's why I throw an extra core work

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.449 
that's why I throw an extra core work
it's<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.750> much<00:02:06.899> focus<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.469> core<00:02:07.740> working<00:02:08.160> like

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it's so much focus on core working like

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.730 
it's so much focus on core working like
the<00:02:08.580> novice<00:02:08.879> program<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.330> have

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
the novice program I have

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.650 
the novice program I have
and<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.490> put<00:02:10.670> such<00:02:10.820> an<00:02:10.970> emphasis<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.480> these

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
and I put such an emphasis on these

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.590 
and I put such an emphasis on these
things<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.860> because<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:13.940> what<00:02:14.270> protects

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
things is because that is what protects

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.090 
things is because that is what protects
your<00:02:14.750> lower<00:02:14.810> back<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.410> squat<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:15.770> as<00:02:15.920> long
