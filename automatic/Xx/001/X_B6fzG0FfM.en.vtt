00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 all this ready welcome i wish 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.530
 today talk about how to 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.630
 prepare wiring for fixtures 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.400
 currently took one wire as if 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.120
 Now we will cook in the initial 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.330
 position 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.430
 as he is in fact this wire 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.199
 let's say we have prepared lights on 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 ceiling and now we need to prepare 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.610
 wire to pull it up 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.370
 ceiling and in the future already connect to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.559
 This light show will use 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.129
 here is such a simple block 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.590
 the pad is most likely 10 amps on and here 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.239
 there is such a miracle thing not scissors 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.700
 know called work a long time ago 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.800
 very easy to work for yourself 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.809
 as if in two movements all this is done 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 I'll take here a little more show 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.239
 exactly how am i doing maybe someone 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:09.920

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.920
 experience so at this stage here we are 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.479
 prepared the two wires themselves saw 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.540
 very simple 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:26.729
 I put the scissors until I no longer 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:31.079
 come in handy and take it so look with 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.159
 I hit the road this side here and so on 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.189
 and from this side we wind the same way 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.079
 way to look everything 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:47.790
 neatly I would like of course scissors 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:52.790
 there is no metal to take from them 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.790
