00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
video that I did I was requested to go

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.560 
video that I did I was requested to go
out<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.350> find<00:00:07.649> some<00:00:07.980> stem<00:00:08.280> cell<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.970> peptide

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
out and find some stem cell and peptide

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.330 
out and find some stem cell and peptide
serums<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.230> were<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> lot<00:00:10.830> less<00:00:11.040> expensive

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
serums that were a lot less expensive

serums that were a lot less expensive
than<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> gym<00:00:12.240> request<00:00:12.570> peptide<00:00:13.110> line

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
than the gym request peptide line

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.279

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
either peptides or stem cells or some

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.460 
either peptides or stem cells or some
sort<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.250> growth<00:00:23.460> factor<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.090> them<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:25.350> gave

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
sort of growth factor in them and I gave

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.429 
sort of growth factor in them and I gave
them<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> try<00:00:26.250> now<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> love<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:27.960> stem

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
them a try now what I love about stem

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
them a try now what I love about stem
cells<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> peptides<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.820> they<00:00:30.060> help<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
cells and peptides is they help to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.780 
cells and peptides is they help to
stimulate<00:00:30.630> collagen<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.590> elastin<00:00:32.189> they're

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
stimulate collagen and elastin they're

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
stimulate collagen and elastin they're
really<00:00:33.149> amazing<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.960> helping<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.590> repair<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.619 
ingredients out there on this skincare
market<00:00:46.170> right<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:46.829> now<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.420> stem

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
market right now now one thing with stem

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
market right now now one thing with stem
cells<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.079> peptides<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
cells and peptides is you have to be a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
cells and peptides is you have to be a
little<00:00:50.820> bit<00:00:50.969> patient<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.020> takes

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
little bit patient because it takes

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260 
little bit patient because it takes
about<00:00:52.620> two<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> three<00:00:53.399> months<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.940> really

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
about two to three months to really

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
about two to three months to really
start<00:00:54.750> seeing<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.230> results<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.160> always

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
start seeing the results and I always

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
start seeing the results and I always
like<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> make<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> analogy<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
like to make the analogy with going to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
like to make the analogy with going to
the<00:00:59.039> gym<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.550> start<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.059> fitness<00:01:00.420> program<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the gym you start a fitness program and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
the gym you start a fitness program and
at<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.949> might<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.280> see<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> results

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
at first you might not see the results

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.910 
at first you might not see the results
but<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.780> continue<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> gym

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
but as you continue to go to the gym

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.580 
but as you continue to go to the gym
your<00:01:05.309> body<00:01:05.580> changes<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.750> lose<00:01:06.990> weight<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
your body changes or you lose weight and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.260 
your body changes or you lose weight and
you<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:08.070> start<00:01:08.340> seeing<00:01:08.369> those<00:01:08.760> results

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you really start seeing those results

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
you really start seeing those results
now<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> same<00:01:10.170> thing<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> gym<00:01:11.010> also

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
now the same thing with the gym also

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.969 
now the same thing with the gym also
goes<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.510> skin<00:01:12.780> care<00:01:12.960> program<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.590> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
goes for your skin care program if you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
goes for your skin care program if you
stop<00:01:14.250> doing<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> over<00:01:15.060> time<00:01:15.600> you're<00:01:15.960> gonna

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
stop doing it over time you're gonna
