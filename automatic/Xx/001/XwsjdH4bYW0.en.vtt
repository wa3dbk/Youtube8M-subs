00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.660

 I say in the company of all of them and good 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 one thing I want to say is also that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.310
 in this when the Christmas date arrives 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.629
 everyone says hey that beware of 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.340
 the binges and such 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.200
 I will say just the opposite eats 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.550
 everything you can fuck that is that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.110
 now at the Christmas Eve tables and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 Christmas when things are more 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.020
 rich you eat throughout the year then 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 to death there is knife in the knife by 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.609
 for the Christmas Eve dinner the food of 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 Christmas in order all these days because 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.260
 eat to enjoy and then already during the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.109
 already there will be time to reduce all that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.000
 so I do not want to tell you also that 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.859
 I have made a small gift is a 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.359
 foolishness not having the best there will be people 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.129
 I want to put a good bullshit 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.330
 I did it with enthusiasm and good for if 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.460
 some of you 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.180
 better than better today I'm going to leave the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.370
 video information the link to an mp3 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 that recorded for all of you with the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.030
 electric guitar is silly 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.910
 it's just a good interpretation 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.940
 of the song is of peace night worth 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.460
 silent night and well he has recorded 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.020
 in a while I have not put much 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.940
 commitment because he has come to work at 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.080
 noon what it is true that has 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.930
 tried that guitar sound 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.580
 was cool because it's a little magical not 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.370
 the holiday season because there is a sound 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.630
 to take it a sound because I have 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.190
 been looking for a little and more or 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.590
 less has left what I wanted then 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.270
 Well, I've already recorded that little fragment 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.370
 musical so I'm going to leave it here the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.710
 video information as small 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.600
 detail is silly but in itself 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.050
 someone makes illusion because there there you 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.440
 you have and above all, because what is said 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.240
