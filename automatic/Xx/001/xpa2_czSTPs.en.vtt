you<00:02:58.110> see<00:02:58.320> it's<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:59.010> exploiting<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.790> timer

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
you see it's just exploiting the timer

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.449 
you see it's just exploiting the timer
it's<00:03:00.360> efficient<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.140> then<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.860> probably

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
it's efficient and then it's probably

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.760 
it's efficient and then it's probably
the<00:03:02.640> lazy<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.360> laziest<00:03:03.690> way<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.959> play<00:03:04.410> any

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
the lazy the laziest way to play any

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.060 
the lazy the laziest way to play any
game<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.670> uh<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.570> works<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.950> only

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
game but uh it's it works so the only

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.350 
game but uh it's it works so the only
problem<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.550> you're<00:03:08.970> gonna<00:03:09.120> need<00:03:09.239> a

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
problem is that you're gonna need a

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.880 
problem is that you're gonna need a
whole<00:03:09.660> lot<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.959> life<00:03:10.230> per<00:03:10.440> second<00:03:10.770> is

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
whole lot of life per second is

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.740 
whole lot of life per second is
