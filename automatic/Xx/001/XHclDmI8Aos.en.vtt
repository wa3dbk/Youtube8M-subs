I don't really know why I mean it's not
a<00:00:33.489> great<00:00:33.850> figure<00:00:34.270> but<00:00:34.300> it's<00:00:34.660> certainly<00:00:34.960> not

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
a great figure but it's certainly not

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.280

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
horrible and this one you know to be

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.369 
horrible and this one you know to be
completely<00:00:38.710> honest<00:00:39.219> I<00:00:40.050> don't<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.140> don't<00:00:41.200> really

bullet<00:00:52.060> doesn't<00:00:52.390> have<00:00:52.630> that<00:00:53.100> oops

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
bullet doesn't have that oops

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.280 
bullet doesn't have that oops
black<00:00:55.120> bullet<00:00:55.420> doesn't<00:00:55.720> have<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.670> happening

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
black bullet doesn't have this happening

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.750 
black bullet doesn't have this happening
that<00:00:59.290> I<00:00:59.320> don't<00:00:59.800> understand<00:01:00.250> why<00:01:00.370> they<00:01:00.550> went

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
that I don't understand why they went

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.819 
that I don't understand why they went
this<00:01:00.970> route<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.750> only<00:01:02.140> way<00:01:02.290> this<00:01:02.530> figure

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
this route the only way this figure

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.859 
this route the only way this figure
looks<00:01:03.130> decent<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.820> when<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.089> do<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.449> and

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
looks decent is when you do that and

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.630 
looks decent is when you do that and
then<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:06.100> still<00:01:06.430> can<00:01:07.030> only<00:01:07.180> raise<00:01:07.420> his<00:01:07.659> arms

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
then you still can only raise his arms

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.359 
then you still can only raise his arms
that<00:01:09.640> much<00:01:09.909> so<00:01:10.810> he<00:01:11.170> can<00:01:11.380> never<00:01:11.560> raise<00:01:11.860> his<00:01:12.070> arms

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
that much so he can never raise his arms

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.039 
that much so he can never raise his arms
completely<00:01:12.939> you<00:01:13.090> go<00:01:13.240> like<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:13.659> it<00:01:13.869> looks

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
completely you go like this it looks

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.770 
completely you go like this it looks
stupid<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.710> looks<00:01:14.890> stupid<00:01:15.159> in<00:01:15.460> any<00:01:15.760> pose<00:01:16.150> other

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
stupid it looks stupid in any pose other

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.090 
stupid it looks stupid in any pose other
than<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:19.299> whole<00:01:19.510> sculpted<00:01:20.260> in<00:01:20.530> wing

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
than that so the whole sculpted in wing

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.490 
than that so the whole sculpted in wing
G<00:01:21.280> think<00:01:21.610> he's<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.090> flying<00:01:22.360> squirrel<00:01:22.780> skin

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.240 
G think he's the flying squirrel skin

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
talk to solid fists hands which I guess

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.960 
talk to solid fists hands which I guess
are<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.530> same<00:02:17.709> ones<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.189> were<00:02:18.280> used<00:02:18.610> on

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
are the same ones that were used on

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.550 
are the same ones that were used on
Cyclops<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.690> maybe<00:02:19.870> they're<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.230> only<00:02:20.349> two

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
Cyclops so maybe they're the only two

though the wings have a lot of black
spots<00:03:20.420> throughout<00:03:20.900> them<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.970> not<00:03:23.360> very<00:03:23.960> well

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
spots throughout them just not very well

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
no shading or anything so it's a very

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.590 
no shading or anything so it's a very
mediocre<00:03:30.950> figure<00:03:31.550> especially<00:03:31.790> coming<00:03:32.300> out<00:03:32.450> of

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
mediocre figure especially coming out of

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.740 
mediocre figure especially coming out of
an<00:03:32.690> SDCC<00:03:34.180> exclusive<00:03:35.210> box<00:03:36.140> set<00:03:36.560> it's<00:03:36.980> just

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
an SDCC exclusive box set it's just

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.010 
an SDCC exclusive box set it's just
really<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:39.130> very<00:03:40.130> very<00:03:40.280> mediocre<00:03:41.150> figure<00:03:41.780> and

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
really a very very mediocre figure and

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.930 
really a very very mediocre figure and
they<00:03:42.380> use<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.710> soft<00:03:42.980> plastic<00:03:43.430> again<00:03:43.670> it's<00:03:43.820> not

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
they use the soft plastic again it's not

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.550 
they use the soft plastic again it's not
horribly<00:03:44.450> soft<00:03:44.810> but<00:03:45.200> it's<00:03:45.380> it's<00:03:46.280> fairly<00:03:46.730> soft

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
horribly soft but it's it's fairly soft

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.260 
horribly soft but it's it's fairly soft
so<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:49.070> just<00:03:49.370> very<00:03:50.770> okay<00:03:51.770> I<00:03:52.070> mean<00:03:52.340> it'll<00:03:52.550> do
