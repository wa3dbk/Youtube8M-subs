also need to be non GMO seeds
non-genetically<00:00:49.110> modified<00:00:49.289> seeds<00:00:50.250> why<00:00:51.120> not

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
non-genetically modified seeds why not

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.990 
non-genetically modified seeds why not
buy<00:00:51.510> hybrids<00:00:52.079> well<00:00:52.590> hybrid<00:00:53.039> seeds<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.670> not

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
buy hybrids well hybrid seeds do not

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.689 
buy hybrids well hybrid seeds do not
reproduce<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.960> seeds<00:00:55.289> at<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.250> well<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
reproduce the seeds at all or well and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.150 
reproduce the seeds at all or well and
the<00:00:57.360> results<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.930> highly<00:00:58.559> varied<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.010> you

traditional packaging they don't do as
well<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.420> their<00:02:06.860> yields<00:02:07.860> drop<00:02:08.369> dramatically

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209

a couple of resources that i have

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.580 
a couple of resources that i have
actually<00:06:10.430> tested<00:06:10.970> out<00:06:11.090> that<00:06:11.690> I<00:06:11.720> think<00:06:12.020> are<00:06:12.200> a

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
actually tested out that I think are a

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.590 
actually tested out that I think are a
good<00:06:12.860> value<00:06:13.600> they<00:06:14.600> are<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:15.200> lot<00:06:15.500> more<00:06:15.560> expensive

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
good value they are a lot more expensive

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.960 
good value they are a lot more expensive
mylar<00:06:17.600> ones<00:06:17.930> will<00:06:18.230> keep<00:06:18.620> anywhere<00:06:19.190> from<00:06:19.400> 10<00:06:19.760> to

mylar ones will keep anywhere from 10 to

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.320 
mylar ones will keep anywhere from 10 to
25<00:06:20.480> years<00:06:20.540> to<00:06:20.840> seeds<00:06:21.200> and<00:06:21.760> freezing<00:06:22.760> those<00:06:23.120> in

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
25 years to seeds and freezing those in

your deep freeze the foil package of

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.790 
your deep freeze the foil package of
seeds<00:06:26.000> will<00:06:26.300> keep<00:06:26.510> it<00:06:26.660> even<00:06:26.780> much<00:06:27.230> longer

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
seeds will keep it even much longer

to have on hand but know that they are
more<00:06:35.930> expensive<00:06:36.289> because<00:06:36.830> of<00:06:37.190> the<00:06:37.310> way<00:06:37.460> they

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
more expensive because of the way they
