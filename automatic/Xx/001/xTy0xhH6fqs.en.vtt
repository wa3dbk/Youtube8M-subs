addition<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.820> features<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.630> just

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
addition to the features that I just

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.920 
addition to the features that I just
mentioned<00:02:40.790> camera<00:02:41.790> systems<00:02:42.270> are<00:02:42.420> now<00:02:42.600> being

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
mentioned camera systems are now being

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320 
mentioned camera systems are now being
specifically<00:02:43.710> developed<00:02:44.160> for<00:02:44.430> cardiac<00:02:44.970> pet

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
specifically developed for cardiac pet

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.960 
specifically developed for cardiac pet
perfusion<00:02:46.020> imaging<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.760> an

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
perfusion imaging this I think is an

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.060 
perfusion imaging this I think is an
important<00:02:48.630> change<00:02:48.930> from<00:02:49.200> several<00:02:49.620> years<00:02:49.890> ago

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
important change from several years ago

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.570 
important change from several years ago
and<00:02:50.490> finally<00:02:51.620> new<00:02:52.620> tracers<00:02:53.190> are<00:02:53.370> being

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
and finally new tracers are being

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.060 
and finally new tracers are being
developed<00:02:53.910> which<00:02:54.360> will<00:02:54.600> provide<00:02:55.070> information

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
developed which will provide information

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.580 
developed which will provide information
beyond<00:02:56.520> cardiac<00:02:57.150> path<00:02:57.420> perfusion<00:02:58.080> such<00:02:58.350> as

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
beyond cardiac path perfusion such as

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.730 
beyond cardiac path perfusion such as
neuronal<00:02:59.070> imaging
