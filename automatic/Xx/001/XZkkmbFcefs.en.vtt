00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
walk right into place in the case there

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.570 
walk right into place in the case there
we<00:05:55.180> go

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.950 

next<00:06:00.580> we'll<00:06:00.670> install<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:01.150> power<00:06:01.450> supply

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
next we'll install the power supply

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.440 
next we'll install the power supply
which<00:06:02.290> is<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.650> I<00:06:02.680> will<00:06:02.950> check<00:06:03.160> 501<00:06:06.450> basic

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
which is the I will check 501 basic

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.600 
which is the I will check 501 basic
power<00:06:07.720> supply<00:06:08.170> more<00:06:08.620> than<00:06:08.770> adequate<00:06:09.250> to<00:06:09.280> power

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
power supply more than adequate to power

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.250 
power supply more than adequate to power

let's get that voted in okay got the

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.850 
let's get that voted in okay got the
power<00:06:32.800> supply<00:06:33.160> in<00:06:33.400> we<00:06:33.580> got<00:06:33.730> the<00:06:33.850> wires<00:06:34.060> Rand

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
power supply in we got the wires Rand

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.200 
power supply in we got the wires Rand
normally<00:06:35.860> I<00:06:35.920> like<00:06:36.040> to<00:06:36.100> run<00:06:36.370> these<00:06:36.520> behind<00:06:37.030> the

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
normally I like to run these behind the

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.440 
normally I like to run these behind the
case<00:06:37.560> but<00:06:38.560> in<00:06:39.070> Diablo<00:06:39.580> the<00:06:39.730> wire<00:06:39.910> isn't<00:06:40.090> long

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
case but in Diablo the wire isn't long

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.300 
case but in Diablo the wire isn't long
enough<00:06:40.780> to<00:06:41.140> run<00:06:41.350> behind<00:06:41.500> so<00:06:41.890> we'll<00:06:42.010> run<00:06:42.190> it

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
enough to run behind so we'll run it

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.430 
enough to run behind so we'll run it
straight<00:06:42.520> up

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
straight up

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.140 
straight up
fortunately<00:06:44.440> there<00:06:44.770> is<00:06:44.890> enough<00:06:45.220> on<00:06:45.820> there

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
fortunately there is enough on there

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.270 
fortunately there is enough on there
that<00:06:46.300> it's<00:06:46.450> not<00:06:46.510> running<00:06:46.930> straight<00:06:47.380> up<00:06:47.650> the

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
that it's not running straight up the

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.500 
that it's not running straight up the
middle<00:06:48.430> like<00:06:48.580> you<00:06:48.790> see<00:06:48.970> some<00:06:49.210> of<00:06:49.240> them<00:06:49.420> where

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
middle like you see some of them where

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.840 
middle like you see some of them where
they're<00:06:49.660> super<00:06:50.380> tight<00:06:50.410> running<00:06:51.160> to<00:06:51.280> the<00:06:51.370> ATX

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
they're super tight running to the ATX

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.950 
they're super tight running to the ATX
power<00:06:52.060> cord<00:06:53.730> this<00:06:54.730> does<00:06:55.120> have<00:06:55.330> enough<00:06:55.570> to<00:06:55.810> it

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
power cord this does have enough to it

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.840 
power cord this does have enough to it
so<00:06:56.230> you<00:06:56.290> can<00:06:56.590> install<00:06:56.860> a<00:06:56.920> video<00:06:57.100> car<00:06:57.520> without

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
so you can install a video car without
