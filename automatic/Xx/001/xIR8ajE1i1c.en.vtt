00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.400
 points multiples of three plus two points 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.170
 necessary for the sample to come out 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.280
 how are you watching 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.740
 here are 217 points that are 15 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.960
 that multiples of 3 plus 2 points 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.150
 necessary for the stitch to remain 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.970
 how are you seeing it after having 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.730
 mounted the 17 points start the stitch 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.970
 of one these salts only by the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 right is not reversible the needle the law 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.910
 in the wool it is rather thick and gives 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.670
 as more body to the tissue the first 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.829
 Career is made as follows 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.429
 a right 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.260
 two rights all races so that 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.910
 you memorize on the wrong side 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.790
 they are always done in a backhand 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.960
 then the stitch has in total the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.500
 Design has 6 races of which 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.690
 the 3 of the reverse is in reverse point and 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.090
 that they only have to memorize 3 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.940
 careers we are doing the first one that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.100
 we started it with two rights now 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.420
 let's repeat the following here 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:31.090
 forwards it repeats constantly 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:34.399
 a loop a point left a point 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.869
 I return the nonwoven point on the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:42.070
 knitted stitch and I make a right up there 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:47.840
 it's the one a design says let's repeat it 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:51.170
 a loop I pass a point a right 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.220
 I return the nonwoven point on the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.150
 weave knit and I make one at a point 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.760
 straight 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:04.760
 lazada step a point left a point 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:08.330
 I return the nonwoven point on the 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.680
 tissue and I make a right 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.150
 there the stitch goes 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.019
 I pass a point 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.099
 I missed the loop a loop 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:27.310
 point left a point I return the point no 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.310
 tissue over the tissue and a right 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.120
 we go for the third race for the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.579
 front by the right side of the fabric 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.830
 we start with three points at a point 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.700
 right one 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.950
 2 and 3 and then we're going to start repeating 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.000
 the same as the first race one 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.110
 lazada step a point I leave a point 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.650
 I pass the nonwoven over the fabric and a 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.489
 straight 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.060
 I remind you again a loop step 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.220
 a point left a point I return the no 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.790
 tissue 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.670
 over the tissue and 1 right point 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.730
 a loop I pass a point putting the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.730
 needle through the middle of the point I pass a 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.849
 point I leave a point I return the no 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.069
 tissue on the fabric and a knit 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.069
 right the entire race is done 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.230
 exactly the same and in the reverse that 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.700
 we have then everything is done in 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.950
 a reverse point 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.340
 I already finished the whole race the other way around 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.380
 a reverse point we're going to the fifth race 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.020
 I start with a right 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.100
 and I repeat again the same as 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:53.120
 we had seen a right lazada passed a 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.910
 point yew a point spent the nonwoven 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.390
 over the knitting 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:03.610
 and a right I repeat again a 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:07.430
 lazada step a point left a point 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.850
 I return the nonwoven on the fabric and 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.910
 a right point like that is leaving me all 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.660
 the stitch on the reverse as I told you 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.760
 does the whole 1 point backwards by finishing 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.970
 well the design that serves us for many 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.360
 things a quilt for a vest for 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.940
 a scarf what they want is a point 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.690
 very nice very elegant very easy to 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.640
 do 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.070
 register in the channel write me 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.440
 tell me how you thought it is targeted 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.440
