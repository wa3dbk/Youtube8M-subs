00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.990
 on teams I will teach you how to write 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.330
 such a mod with my this lesson you 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.929
 you can write some here 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:26.810
 commands show the function itself is called 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:33.030
 function we sign therefore we write rock smd 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:44.510
 how many and brackets we write this function itself 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:44.510

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.109
 I'll write the words the day the children will protect 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:14.369

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.620
