got a very cool new bike from pacific
cycles<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.130> one<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.639> called<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.450> if'<00:00:09.960> move

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
cycles this one is called the if' move

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.530 
cycles this one is called the if' move
and<00:00:11.010> as<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.880> see<00:00:12.030> it's<00:00:12.179> got<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> little

is<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> little<00:00:21.000> kickstand<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.660> bike<00:00:21.810> so

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
is a little kickstand for the bike so

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
is a little kickstand for the bike so
what<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> very<00:00:24.029> kind<00:00:24.660> of

you<00:00:32.369> might<00:00:32.520> say<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.480> way<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> unfolds<00:00:34.200> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
you might say the way it unfolds is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.930 
you might say the way it unfolds is
pretty<00:00:34.530> incredible<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.280> basically<00:00:35.760> just

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
pretty incredible you basically just

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.000 
pretty incredible you basically just
push<00:00:36.899> these<00:00:37.050> handlebars<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:39.590> raise<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.800> seat

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
push these handlebars in raise the seat

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.360 
push these handlebars in raise the seat
up<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.410> then<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> pop<00:00:44.160> this

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
up and then I'm just going to pop this

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.830 
up and then I'm just going to pop this
out<00:00:44.579> all<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.780> motion

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.650 

just<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.600> can

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
just like that so you know as you can

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.240 
just like that so you know as you can
see<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.080> probably<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.560> bike<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.070> little

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
see it's probably a bike that's a little

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.070 
see it's probably a bike that's a little
bit<00:00:53.400> better<00:00:53.520> fit<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:53.880> people<00:00:54.420> under<00:00:54.750> six<00:00:54.990> feet

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
bit better fit for people under six feet

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.350 
bit better fit for people under six feet
although<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.220> seat<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.790> come<00:00:57.060> up<00:00:57.180> high

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
although the seat can come up high

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.690 
although the seat can come up high
enough<00:00:57.540> for<00:00:57.750> me<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.290> just<00:00:58.559> becomes<00:00:58.950> a<00:00:59.190> much

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
enough for me it just becomes a much

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.880 
enough for me it just becomes a much
more<00:00:59.970> you<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.330> over<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.020> bike<00:01:01.200> handlebars

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
more you know over the bike handlebars

more you know over the bike handlebars
kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.220> ride<00:01:02.400> there<00:01:03.150> is<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.330> larger<00:01:03.780> cousin<00:01:04.050> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
kind of ride there is a larger cousin of

one has 26 inch wheels like a regular
mountain<00:01:08.040> bike<00:01:08.190> it's<00:01:08.670> got<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:09.000> pretty<00:01:09.180> neat

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
mountain bike it's got some pretty neat

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.790 
mountain bike it's got some pretty neat
features<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> first<00:01:10.470> thing<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
features like the first thing I want to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.960 
features like the first thing I want to
show<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.369> single<00:01:12.270> sided<00:01:12.570> fork<00:01:12.990> and

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
show you is this single sided fork and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.340 
show you is this single sided fork and
disc<00:01:14.970> brakes<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.690> you<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.050> really

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
disc brakes so you get a really

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.310 
disc brakes so you get a really
excellent<00:01:16.650> stopping<00:01:17.160> power<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.320> then

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
excellent stopping power here and then

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
excellent stopping power here and then
in<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.500> back<00:01:19.680> we've<00:01:20.250> got<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.729> bunch<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> gears

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
in the back we've got a bunch of gears

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
in the back we've got a bunch of gears
we've<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.259> about<00:01:22.500> nine<00:01:22.800> gears<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
we've got about nine gears actually and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.280 
we've got about nine gears actually and
what's<00:01:24.420> pretty<00:01:24.630> cool<00:01:24.690> is<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.140> they've

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
what's pretty cool is that they've

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.290 
what's pretty cool is that they've
mounted<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.740> disc<00:01:25.950> break<00:01:26.160> behind<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.060> frame

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
mounted the disc break behind the frame

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.969 
mounted the disc break behind the frame
so<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> engineering<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.440> this<00:01:28.530> bike<00:01:28.800> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
so the engineering on this bike is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
so the engineering on this bike is
pretty<00:01:29.160> incredible<00:01:29.540> again<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> single<00:01:30.990> sided

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
pretty incredible again a single sided

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.570 
pretty incredible again a single sided
fork<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.399> back<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.910> like<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> front

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
fork in the back just like in the front

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.980 
fork in the back just like in the front
so<00:01:35.580> in<00:01:35.729> terms<00:01:35.910> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> ride<00:01:36.300> I'd<00:01:36.600> say<00:01:36.810> if

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so in terms of the ride I'd say if

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.389 
so in terms of the ride I'd say if
you're<00:01:37.140> over<00:01:37.500> six<00:01:37.740> feet<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> be

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
you're over six feet it's going to be

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.450 
you're over six feet it's going to be
pretty<00:01:38.610> sporty<00:01:39.200> still<00:01:40.200> fun<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.860> sporty<00:01:41.190> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
pretty sporty still fun but sporty and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.200 
pretty sporty still fun but sporty and
if<00:01:41.970> you're<00:01:42.119> more<00:01:42.330> like<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.289> know<00:01:43.380> 5<00:01:43.649> foot<00:01:43.920> 2

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
if you're more like you know 5 foot 2

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
if you're more like you know 5 foot 2
