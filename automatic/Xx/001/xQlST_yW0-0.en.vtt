doubt<00:01:04.860> Activision<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.700> because<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
doubt Activision it's not because of

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
doubt Activision it's not because of
doubt<00:01:06.180> Bungie<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.540> idea<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.229> game

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
doubt Bungie or the the idea of the game

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.160 
doubt Bungie or the the idea of the game
is<00:01:10.760> because<00:01:11.760> shooters<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.780> been<00:01:12.900> done

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is because shooters have been done

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.990 
is because shooters have been done
they've<00:01:13.830> been<00:01:14.010> done<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.580> well<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
they've been done by a lot of developers

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.840 
they've been done by a lot of developers
so<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> company<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.540> come<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.670> kind<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
do shooters to the point where it makes

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.200 
do shooters to the point where it makes
you<00:01:22.920> go<00:01:23.070> wow<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
you go wow this is you know this is

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.050 
you go wow this is you know this is
redefining<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.540> genre<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:29.060> wasn't

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
redefining the genre and I wasn't

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.510 
redefining the genre and I wasn't
expecting<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.140> happen<00:01:31.350> now<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> can

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
expecting that to happen now you can

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.010 
expecting that to happen now you can
kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> probably<00:01:33.270> tell<00:01:33.509> by<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> tone<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
kind of probably tell by the tone of

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.039 
kind of probably tell by the tone of
voice<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:35.130> actually<00:01:35.600> my<00:01:36.600> socks<00:01:36.840> were

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
voice that I was actually my socks were

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.630 
voice that I was actually my socks were
blown<00:01:37.380> off<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> reason<00:01:38.310> why<00:01:38.400> they<00:01:38.549> were

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
blown off and the reason why they were

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
blown off and the reason why they were
blown<00:01:38.880> off<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.750> isn't<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
blown off is because this isn't a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.889 
blown off is because this isn't a
shooter<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.070> mean<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.729> am<00:01:41.909> shooting<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.840> do

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
shooter I mean I am shooting and I do

in<00:02:56.739> games<00:02:56.920> i<00:02:57.070> think<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> really<00:02:57.660> underrated

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
in games i think is a really underrated

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.170 
in games i think is a really underrated
feature<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.500> game<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.400> audio<00:03:00.730> for<00:03:01.060> this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
feature in a game and the audio for this

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.390 
feature in a game and the audio for this
is<00:03:01.390> just<00:03:01.750> mind-blowing<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.500> i<00:03:02.739> mean<00:03:03.070> i<00:03:03.100> can't

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
is just mind-blowing so i mean i can't

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.620 
is just mind-blowing so i mean i can't
wait<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.640> get<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> soundtrack<00:03:04.239> i<00:03:04.360> know<00:03:04.480> that

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
wait to get the soundtrack i know that

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.960 
wait to get the soundtrack i know that
sounds<00:03:04.780> really<00:03:05.140> sad<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.709> nerdy<00:03:06.370> but<00:03:06.760> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
sounds really sad and nerdy but the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.150 
sounds really sad and nerdy but the
soundtrack<00:03:07.390> will<00:03:07.570> be<00:03:07.600> awesome<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.200> graphic

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
soundtrack will be awesome and graphic

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.729 
soundtrack will be awesome and graphic
lucky<00:03:09.400> group<00:03:09.880> can't<00:03:10.720> even<00:03:10.900> talk<00:03:11.019> graphically

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
lucky group can't even talk graphically

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.949 
lucky group can't even talk graphically
the<00:03:12.489> graphics<00:03:13.480> are<00:03:13.840> really<00:03:14.580> really<00:03:15.580> good

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
the graphics are really really good

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.300 
the graphics are really really good
which<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:16.989> surprising<00:03:17.709> because<00:03:17.739> it's<00:03:18.160> also

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
which is surprising because it's also

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.070 
which is surprising because it's also
going<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.610> be<00:03:18.700> on<00:03:18.940> previous<00:03:19.390> generation<00:03:19.900> and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
going to be on previous generation and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.080 
going to be on previous generation and
usually<00:03:20.860> what<00:03:21.040> happens<00:03:21.100> when<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:21.700> get<00:03:21.820> games

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
usually what happens when you get games

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.180 
usually what happens when you get games
that<00:03:22.269> are<00:03:22.360> cross-platform<00:03:22.630> all<00:03:23.320> across

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
that are cross-platform all across

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.880 
that are cross-platform all across
generation<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.150> their<00:03:25.810> kind<00:03:26.049> of<00:03:26.260> held<00:03:26.650> back<00:03:26.860> a

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
generation is their kind of held back a
