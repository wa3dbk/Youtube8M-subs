 spectacular trailer of Kirby and the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.340
 Rainbow brush good spectacular no 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.500
 because the milk is graphically because 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.560
 Well, it's simple, it's simple, but it's 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.090
 nice to is a world 5 site of 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.790
 plasticine the truth is that it is very 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.620
 cool the gameplay of this game by 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.750
 true, I liked it a lot 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.340
 although it is true that the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.690
 television is useless or is it 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.490
 better than turning off the TV and playing 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.030
 directly on the gamepad unless 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.300
 you play with others with friends is worth in mode 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.860
 multiplayer in which obviously the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.660
 TV screen is necessary but 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.370
 good 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.710
 there you have a gameplay with the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.180
 I recommend you also put a touch 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.580
 protector to the screen because if you do not 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.510
 you're going to end up scratching because it's 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.480
 continuously with the pencil touching the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.420
 touch panel of the wii or gamepad no and 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.910
