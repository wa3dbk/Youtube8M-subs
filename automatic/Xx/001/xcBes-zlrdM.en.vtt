stroke okay firstly the rest of the
Metro<00:00:24.480> involves<00:00:25.170> plucking<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> string

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
Metro involves plucking the string

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.349 
Metro involves plucking the string
pushing<00:00:27.449> pushing<00:00:27.930> inwards<00:00:28.849> into<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> guitar

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
pushing pushing inwards into the guitar

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.139 
pushing pushing inwards into the guitar
itself<00:00:30.630> into<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> sound<00:00:31.529> basically<00:00:32.130> yeah<00:00:32.880> and

then<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.570> your<00:00:34.260> finger<00:00:34.620> must<00:00:34.940> your<00:00:35.940> plucking

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
then your your finger must your plucking

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.200 
then your your finger must your plucking
finger<00:00:36.540> must<00:00:37.320> come<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.920> rest<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
finger must come up and rest on the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.319 
finger must come up and rest on the
string<00:00:39.629> above<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.379> shown<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.850> video

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
string above it and shown in this video

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.330 
string above it and shown in this video
yes<00:00:43.200> okay<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:44.010> produce<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.870> deeper<00:00:45.870> tone

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
yes okay this will produce a deeper tone

stroke<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.980> involves<00:00:56.910> basically<00:00:57.170> plucking

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
stroke which involves basically plucking

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.790 
stroke which involves basically plucking
the<00:00:58.260> string<00:00:59.840> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.620> confused

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the string this is not to be confused

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920 
the string this is not to be confused
with<00:01:02.039> poppy<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.730> sense<00:01:03.090> they're<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.690> string

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
with poppy in sense they're the string

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.250 
with poppy in sense they're the string
is<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.080> plump<00:01:04.559> outwards<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:06.390> mice

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
is not plump outwards like this mice

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.910 
is not plump outwards like this mice
instead<00:01:07.560> simply<00:01:08.369> plus<00:01:09.210> sideways<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.320> we're

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
instead simply plus sideways and we're

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.950 
instead simply plus sideways and we're
just<00:01:11.040> produces<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.820> thinner<00:01:12.060> sound<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
just produces a thinner sound then the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.469 
just produces a thinner sound then the
restaurant<00:01:14.180> yeah

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
restaurant yeah

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.819 
restaurant yeah

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
and if you notice there was a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.010 
and if you notice there was a
alternation<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.940> technique<00:03:00.300> in<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.720> sense<00:03:00.930> that

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
alternation of technique in a sense that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.860 
alternation of technique in a sense that
the<00:03:01.650> e<00:03:01.980> string<00:03:02.640> which<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.970> highest<00:03:03.210> main

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the e string which is the highest main

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.060 
the e string which is the highest main
melody<00:03:04.080> shifting<00:03:04.770> sound<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.690> caused<00:03:06.690> by

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
melody shifting sound is caused by

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.760 
melody shifting sound is caused by
restaurant<00:03:08.070> but<00:03:08.700> other<00:03:09.140> two<00:03:10.140> strings<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
restaurant but other two strings and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.130 
restaurant but other two strings and
first<00:03:11.610> string<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.820> first<00:03:12.060> EBA<00:03:12.420> string<00:03:12.660> they

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
first string the first EBA string they

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.230 
first string the first EBA string they
are<00:03:13.230> played<00:03:13.440> using<00:03:13.590> free<00:03:13.890> stroke<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.880> notice

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
are played using free stroke so notice

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.540 
are played using free stroke so notice
this<00:03:15.450> alternating<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.350> tone<00:03:16.590> will<00:03:17.040> create<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
this alternating of tone will create a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.050 
this alternating of tone will create a
very<00:03:18.210> distinct<00:03:18.630> sound<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.410> melody<00:03:19.740> line

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
very distinct sound for the melody line

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.810
