Lux<00:03:02.910> version<00:03:03.239> even<00:03:03.359> more<00:03:03.660> than<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.989> Voyager<00:03:04.470> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.170 
head sculpt is pretty accurate could be
a<00:03:07.680> little<00:03:07.890> bit<00:03:08.069> better<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.549> still<00:03:08.670> very<00:03:09.000> nice

look really nice there were more
skinnier<00:03:21.959> than<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.470> Voyager<00:03:23.280> one<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
skinnier than the Voyager one and the

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.390 
skinnier than the Voyager one and the
amount<00:03:24.599> of<00:03:24.690> detail<00:03:24.840> his<00:03:25.260> robot<00:03:25.680> mode<00:03:25.709> looks

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
amount of detail his robot mode looks

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.180 
amount of detail his robot mode looks
way<00:03:26.790> more<00:03:26.959> movie<00:03:27.959> accurate<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.500> are<00:03:28.769> really

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
way more movie accurate I are really

digging a lot you can definitely see the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.409 
digging a lot you can definitely see the
differences<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.400> deluxe<00:03:32.669> ratchet<00:03:32.910> and

the Voyager 1 even though I got the
rescue<00:03:35.489> etching<00:03:35.880> definitely<00:03:36.720> his<00:03:36.840> legs<00:03:37.139> are<00:03:37.380> a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
rescue etching definitely his legs are a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.759 
rescue etching definitely his legs are a
lot<00:03:37.620> skinnier<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.430> his<00:03:39.090> arms<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.900> now<00:03:40.500> he<00:03:40.560> has

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
lot skinnier and his arms and now he has

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.920 
lot skinnier and his arms and now he has
six<00:03:41.040> more<00:03:41.400> articulation<00:03:42.060> all<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.480> way<00:03:42.569> around

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
six more articulation all the way around

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.990 
six more articulation all the way around
and<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:44.040> other<00:03:44.130> thing<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.400> like<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
and the other thing I just like the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.120 
and the other thing I just like the
looks<00:03:45.269> one<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.930> robot<00:03:46.260> mode<00:03:46.290> if<00:03:46.739> they<00:03:46.950> made

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
looks one in the robot mode if they made

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.009 
looks one in the robot mode if they made
a<00:03:47.160> Voyager<00:03:47.639> one<00:03:47.910> out<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.389> one<00:03:48.599> it<00:03:48.870> would

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
a Voyager one out of this one it would

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.440 
a Voyager one out of this one it would
have<00:03:49.109> been<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.889> perfect<00:03:50.220> ratchet<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.030> of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
have been the perfect ratchet and of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.190 
have been the perfect ratchet and of
course<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.870> became<00:03:52.109> what<00:03:52.410> his<00:03:52.680> blade<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.700> his

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
course it became what his blade and his

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.110 
course it became what his blade and his
more<00:03:55.200> accurate<00:03:55.560> blaster<00:03:56.040> but<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.760> last<00:03:56.940> one

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
more accurate blaster but the last one

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.830 
more accurate blaster but the last one
does<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.419> pretty<00:03:57.599> good

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
does it pretty good

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.960 
does it pretty good
well<00:03:58.079> ratchet<00:03:58.500> did<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.769> get<00:03:58.919> smaller<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.639> that

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
well ratchet did you get smaller is that

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.610 
well ratchet did you get smaller is that
what<00:04:00.180> Michaela<00:04:00.720> said<00:04:00.959> when<00:04:01.169> she<00:04:01.200> saw<00:04:01.560> you

whoa<00:04:03.500> snap<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.799> just<00:04:05.040> got<00:04:05.220> pwned<00:04:05.489> by<00:04:05.730> an<00:04:05.849> alien

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
whoa snap I just got pwned by an alien

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.539 
whoa snap I just got pwned by an alien
robot<00:04:06.359> you<00:04:07.109> sure<00:04:07.379> did<00:04:07.739> full<00:04:08.069> articulation

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
robot you sure did full articulation

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.729 
robot you sure did full articulation
ratchets<00:04:09.299> head<00:04:09.540> can<00:04:09.840> kind<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.230> move<00:04:10.410> less

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
ratchets head can kind of move less

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.339 
ratchets head can kind of move less
right<00:04:11.040> but<00:04:11.310> it's<00:04:11.669> kind<00:04:11.879> of<00:04:11.910> hindered<00:04:12.269> by<00:04:12.540> his

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
part of the arm his wrists there you go

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.040 
part of the arm his wrists there you go
in<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.610> out<00:04:25.699> always<00:04:26.000> articulation<00:04:26.900> Buzz

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
in and out always articulation Buzz

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.080 
in and out always articulation Buzz
likes<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.380> go<00:04:27.530> forward<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.070> back<00:04:28.460> in<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:28.970> out

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
likes to go forward and back in and out

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.850 
likes to go forward and back in and out
they<00:04:29.570> rotate<00:04:29.960> that<00:04:30.139> part<00:04:30.410> like<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.800> he

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
they rotate that part like and he

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.040 
they rotate that part like and he
actually<00:04:31.040> has<00:04:31.430> MEC<00:04:31.850> alive<00:04:32.180> gimmick<00:04:32.780> right

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
actually has MEC alive gimmick right

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.750 
actually has MEC alive gimmick right
there<00:04:33.229> which<00:04:33.410> is<00:04:33.560> pretty<00:04:33.770> cool<00:04:34.010> bend<00:04:34.580> at<00:04:34.729> the

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
there which is pretty cool bend at the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.030 
there which is pretty cool bend at the
knee<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.180> his<00:04:35.270> ankles<00:04:36.139> can<00:04:36.380> pivot<00:04:36.650> forward

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
knee and his ankles can pivot forward

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.770 
knee and his ankles can pivot forward
and<00:04:37.310> back<00:04:37.460> as<00:04:37.729> well<00:04:37.940> as<00:04:38.030> rotate<00:04:38.449> all<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.660> way

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
and back as well as rotate all the way

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.900 
and back as well as rotate all the way
around<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.320> quite<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.860> bit<00:04:40.100> of<00:04:40.190> articulation

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
around so quite a bit of articulation

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.939 
around so quite a bit of articulation
she<00:04:41.180> comes<00:04:41.479> with<00:04:41.750> his<00:04:42.020> low<00:04:42.199> blaster<00:04:42.770> which

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
she comes with his low blaster which

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.920 
she comes with his low blaster which
actually<00:04:43.370> looks<00:04:43.520> more<00:04:43.910> movie<00:04:44.270> accurate<00:04:44.419> than

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
actually looks more movie accurate than

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.840 
actually looks more movie accurate than
that<00:04:45.560> weird

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
that weird

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.360 
that weird
Laster<00:04:47.810> we<00:04:47.840> kind<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:48.229> got<00:04:48.320> in<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.770> Voyager<00:04:49.220> one

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
Laster we kind of got in the Voyager one

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.770 
Laster we kind of got in the Voyager one
which<00:04:49.580> wasn't<00:04:49.820> really<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.120> blaster<00:04:50.510> always

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
which wasn't really a blaster always

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.659 
which wasn't really a blaster always
like<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:50.960> claw<00:04:51.289> and<00:04:51.590> then<00:04:52.220> you<00:04:52.310> know<00:04:52.430> shoot

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
like a claw and then you know shoot

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.250 
like a claw and then you know shoot
sounds<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.180> silt<00:04:53.419> which<00:04:53.539> fire<00:04:53.750> is<00:04:53.900> really

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
sounds and the silt which fire is really

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.960 
sounds and the silt which fire is really
good<00:04:54.440> what's<00:04:54.830> really<00:04:55.130> cool<00:04:55.370> he<00:04:55.490> has<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.669> little
