00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:14.160
 hey you see I'm straight the hair 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.080
 pink dyeing tones and me 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240
 did not want to show because 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.949
 I do a self- experiment again 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.750
 if that somehow did not mean anything 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 will that make me out of it 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.029
 leave and yes I 've got something 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.809
 offer had 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:37.829
 the looks like flushing of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.660
 albert without silicone and I have 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.120
 now with one I had by chance still 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.760
 to use as a spoon 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.399
 I just got it from that 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.100
 rabbit pink from directions i have 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.390
 just a small spoonful halt 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.280
 complete amount so it was as good are 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.600
 I've got that in here before 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.890
 mixed and then after washing up 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.989
 sun wore dry hair and then spread 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.110
 20 minutes impression 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.250
 that is already better of the color 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.460
 been as my apartment by the hairdresser 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.970
 that was a bit more intense and 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.210
 but now I have my old one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.740
 herbal essences feel my old here 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.659
 that stood so eternally long in the cabinet 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.430
 and I believe that, of course 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.920
 silicones in there but I wanted anyway 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.619
 Try that for just as long 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.659
 stops and that I touched with 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.130
 a bit more 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.829
 I'll go out and look like this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.659
 I filled in there again because 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.009
 because you can also good to 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.380
 Keep hair color longer 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.509
 just after a normal hair washing 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 that you have a few minutes while showering 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.430
 you can do it again 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.360
 to do the quasi in a wash yes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.799
 and then I touched that and got it 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.049
 of it made photos because I'm only 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.619
 I did not want to film and I'm blind 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.619
 now first one 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.060
 yes and there as you can see I have that 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:31.189
 just normal on the head 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.889
 distributed to the so from the installation time 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.019
 that's already over, I will 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.400
 now wash out and then 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.680
 I'll show you how it got 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.760
 so I washed it out now 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.319
 and it looks like it already has 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.700
 the color is pretty well accepted so 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.010
 much better than what I am today 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.379
 So it was done tomorrow 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.950
 not harmful as well because 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.560
 I understood from the direction the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.549
 Pigments are just outside 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.069
 and that's why if they already stop 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.750
 feel the fast amecke look 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.030
 how did that become so the color the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.730
 I find fear me presented 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.730
 it was really so beautiful was committed 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.709
 pink sees itself still wet I 've got 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.159
 not yet styled I just wanted 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.040
 just look yes I'll show you everyone 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.150
 case graf from behind because I myself have 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.250
 I have not seen that yet 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:30.530
 the same video as the color 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:31.900
 Back then it was true 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.870
 exactly 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.909
 At least we have to get closer to it 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.909
 you can see exactly the shade 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.609
 really nice pink yes and then I show 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.829
 of course you still like it 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.599
 looks like if I shared it like that 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.519
 Now I have dried the hair and 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.409
 I thought so then I can tell you 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.889
 show my hair anyway anyway 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:04.540
 style and yes I hope I can do it 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:07.219
 now here with the display so out 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.870
 Yes, I'll just start today 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.689
 namely, I have different ones 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.120
 take styling creams and pastes today 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:20.150
 I'm here from goldwell 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.900
 super egos partly 1 is there or something 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.520
 similar to the strength number four 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.520
 and I have that on the possen exactly 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.259
 white heads are completely so in the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.729
 hands 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.360
 and then I actually have it at the beginning 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.130
 the bunny is always up like that 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.150
 and then I'll watch it like this 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.509
 a little bit that way 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.330
 to make even 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:54.860
 then you are too i see i now 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.860
 Reality for display not so good 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.150
 forward and backward to such a 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:11.909
 Bit through and pull that easy 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.349
 here his medium high I still watch that 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:18.000
 half way behind looks reasonably 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.729
 that's what it's supposed to do 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.710
 totally easy is not much can 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.150
 behind it 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.389
 yes and then I find the whole 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.039
 actually still needs to spray 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.210
 just look if you also like that 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.159
 Sometimes I share here like that 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.219
 unruly jibes and this one 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:40.669
 just then this just good that 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:44.909
 that a bit yes from the carers on 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:47.039
 and yes then you could if you too 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.050
 you can already stutter 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.180
 if you also have the hairstyle 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.310
 stylt and you want to show me that 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.740
 how you look like or what you look like 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.990
 then take for styling products 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.840
 Your video will be happy to do that below 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.639
 Linked me like that 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.960

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.800
 I do not have styling products yet 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.099

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.630

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.430
 in between, give an update once 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.819
 from here for how long 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.500
 and because that's me now 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.419
 next time after the sound 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.490
 I am becoming more or less sure now 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:27.060
 First let wash out so I 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:32.219
 just know how long it takes 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.680
 he that is the word balances al 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:36.070

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.680
 banal today 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.450
 in the hot with and yes not so 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.990

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.840
 stop is less and then 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.030
 I cut my pink again here 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.730
 Rinse it and then I have to go back 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.190

 Here my wise short hair can be 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.650
 not really doing much wrong either 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.920
