00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.630
 we must hit the ball of capacity 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.820
 to charge a like equal never 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.230
 he is an excellent collector of the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.900
 flamengo whose fault at the entrance of the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.180
 I already celebrated what I knew with him 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.770
 now inside is doing with the service of the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.630
 his ground beat a lot on my team. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.350
 young player kill team player 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.640
 warrior 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 I already hit the barefoot in the barefoot. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 and with the arrival in the Flemish 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.370
 I mean I was tweaking me in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.470
 I did not train as much as I did 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.449
 now when I went up when I went 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.230
 Professional So I started to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.390
 hone 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 he insists he stays beating until 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.800
 darken and a beautiful day of your galloping 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.040
 already darkened car lives enough to beat 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.870
 I do not need to wrap up that whole field 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 by the hard ground of the gÃ¡vea 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.800
 Then he told me if I did not expect 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 the jockey club that through the ascend 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.810
 students will enjoy a little but not 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.290
 here is another half hour there was 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.509
 after the hour and inter- wave for each 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.909
 side of the right or left side in the middle 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.469
 training an average of 30 to 40 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.469
 absences on each side 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.240
 often did not and did not have 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.259
 conditions of the goalkeeper the coach who 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.250
 they had to make the kind of 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.080
 training 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.380
 that's where I used 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.230
 the wwf grandpa shirt was at every angle 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.560
 put it on a T-shirt and stood there 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.780
 directing the ball with the two shirts 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.540
 later it was built each neighborhood had 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.880
 barrier and I think this helped 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.210
 enough because the more you 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.880
 train more you win goes improving 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.150
 the biggest way to beat the speed 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.490
 distance is the musician who will play what 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.890
 guitar piano that has to stay there the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 time of the times when you go 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.550
 touch things come out with much more 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.730
 ease much more naturalness 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.440
 then became a deadly weapon and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.700
 which I also spent taking advantage of 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.560
 to know that the staff had been 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.290
 afraid to be missed there sometimes 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.900
 left the fear of taking the picture is the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.640
 bravo eee end up doing a goal of 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.230
 ball rolling over why the guy had 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.230
 recipe make a mistake
