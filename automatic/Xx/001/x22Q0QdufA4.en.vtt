00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.000
 Welcome 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.000
 In a presentation that we want to introduce to you, 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.000
 we will show you how fast you can order our album directly from our album program. 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.000
 We are very happy that you will spend a little time and read the information, 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 which we will pass to you in a moment. 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.000
 The order of our album is possible only from our album program. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.000
 After completing the project, you can order our album stored on the disc. 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.000
 The "Order Product" button is used for this purpose. 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.000
 After pressing this button, our album will check the prepared project for an angle 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.000
 correctness of composition and will try to detect potential dangers. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.000
 Emerging messages and explanation of their meaning can be found on the website 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:04.000
 nasz-album.pl in the help under the slogan "Verification messages" or in the manual that you can download from this site. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.000
 There are no significant problems in our album. We can go to the next stage. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.000
 Our album program proposes sending our album. 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000
 We choose the "Send" button. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.000
 At this point, if we are already a customer, we have to log in. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.000
 If we order our album for the first time, we have to register. 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.000
 In this presentation we will show how the registration process proceeds. We choose "I want to register". 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.000
 The fields to which we must enter information are marked with an asterisk. 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.000

 After logging in, the program will start preparing our album for uploading. 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.000
 The first stage is the export of the document, 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.000
 during which preparation for sending will take place. 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.000
 The second stage is sent via the Internet. 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.000
 In the course of these operations, the progress of activities is constantly visible. 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.000

 When we started designing our album, we have already chosen these options, 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.000
 here we have to confirm them or we can change them. 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.000

 We can enter a promotional code if we have it. 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.000

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.000
