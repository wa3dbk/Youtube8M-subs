00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
smart for 950 it's a real a simple

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.460 
smart for 950 it's a real a simple
method<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.350> i<00:02:07.409> recommend<00:02:07.799> doing

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
method that i recommend doing

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.680 
method that i recommend doing
and<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:09.220> can<00:02:09.430> do<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:09.729> bronze<00:02:10.000> but<00:02:10.360> bronze

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
and you can do it with bronze but bronze

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.930 
and you can do it with bronze but bronze
or<00:02:11.020> like<00:02:11.230> go<00:02:11.440> for<00:02:11.590> seven<00:02:12.040> hours<00:02:12.130> but<00:02:12.760> they're

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
or like go for seven hours but they're

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.760 
or like go for seven hours but they're
very<00:02:13.150> hard<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.690> get<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.140> don't<00:02:14.350> think<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.680> I'd

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
very hard to get I don't think that I'd

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.980 
very hard to get I don't think that I'd
one<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.640> give<00:02:15.970> bronze<00:02:16.270> ago<00:02:16.540> may<00:02:16.630> be<00:02:16.690> up<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.930> a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
one so give bronze ago may be up in a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.630 
one so give bronze ago may be up in a
few<00:02:17.020> bronze<00:02:17.440> cuts<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.160> get<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.490> of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
few bronze cuts and if you get one of

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.540 
few bronze cuts and if you get one of
them<00:02:18.790> you'll<00:02:19.360> be<00:02:19.570> in<00:02:19.990> look<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.860> I'm<00:02:21.340> going<00:02:21.400> to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
them you'll be in look so I'm going to

basically what you do I normally put 700

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.280 
basically what you do I normally put 700
because<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.190> never<00:02:27.430> know<00:02:27.580> then<00:02:28.300> 900<00:02:28.900> months

see these for 900 you could pick them up

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.710 
see these for 900 you could pick them up
for<00:02:36.100> Landrum<00:02:36.520> 50<00:02:37.180> but<00:02:37.330> you're<00:02:37.420> gonna<00:02:37.510> lose
