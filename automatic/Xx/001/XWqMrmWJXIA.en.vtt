00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 very good I am diego galilea and today we are going 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.710
 to talk about the best camera in each range 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.710
 of canon 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.980
 i 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.809
 for starters I'll explain that to 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.060
 differentiate between better and worse 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.740
 cameras this of better and worse is 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.070
 relative but to differentiate those that 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.689
 they have better and worse specifications 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.520
 canon is governed by the numbers that 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.009
 accompany the first number ie 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.230
 how many more antics or zeros 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.870
 worst features will have the camera 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.700
 that is to say of smaller range will be by the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.410
 contrary how many less of them or have 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.110
 even if it does not have any zero like the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.540
 5 of March 3 the camera will have better 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.940
 specifications having said that I'm going 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.650
 to share with you the cameras that 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.660
 I think they are better within each range 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.550
 let's start with range cameras 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.650
 low ie with the one you 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.260
 they have and in my case I prefer 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.450
 the 600 of yes it is true that the 600 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.340
 of is a bit old it still has 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.170
 some characteristics and gives us some 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.000
 totally valid options for the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.770
 content that we will need to produce is 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.079
 a camera that does not have a sensor 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.150
 complete is not full frame and the 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.149
 iso values that this sensor supports 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.740
 they range from 100 to 12,800 mi 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.720
 personal experience tells me that if the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.300
 iso the force is more than 1600 is going to 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.340
 make noise 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.200
 this camera is great for car 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 occur is to say is very very 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.980
 recommended for bloggers since their 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.930
 flip-up screen allows you to see 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.600
 what are you recording the body of the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.820
 600 d is tiny and plastic but 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.040
 offers access to all controls 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.230
 that we need more usually from a 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.390
 Very fast and easy way you can install 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.340
 on your memory card the firmware of 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.870
 Lanter magic to gain access to 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.030
 many more adjustments and more 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.460
 characteristics that those offered by the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.070
 canon firmware the price of the 600 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.700
 of round the 400 euros with the objective 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.320
 of the 1855 kit included surely many 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.510
 of you disagree with me 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.050
 and you think that the best camera for 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.840
 low range of canon is the 550 of and not os 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.060
 may lack reason because it is true 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.100
 that the 600 of the point in favor that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.500
 has is the flip-up screen that is 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.080
 for bloggers for example it 's great and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.000
 the 550 of the good good that it has is 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.530
 than with the magic lantern installed by 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.230
 ellis monitor the audio 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.940
 you can hear the audio with headphones 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.680
 that is entering the camera so I 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.520
 I think to decide which you should 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.290
 to choose 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.270
 you will have to value those two things or the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.730
 folding screen or being able to monitor the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.220
 audio within the mid-range I would 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.530
 Decadence for the 70's until canon says 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.450
 which is a specially designed camera 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.790
 for videographers and is that the sensor that 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.800
 has allows to do a auto focus on 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.800
 video physically has a lot more 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.380
 controls that the 600 's and again 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.630
 has a flip-up and touch screen is 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.130
 saying is again recommended for 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.900
 bloggers or people that author produces 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.700
 content although it is true that the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.500
 touch screen in my case I have not 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.180
 widely used is a good option as 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.310
 allows you to adjust things very 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.230
 quickly and in a very easy way is 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.210
 of a plastic a little better than that of 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.980
 the 600 but it does not stop being plastic 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.130
 currently you can not install the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.770
 magic land terela 70 of but is in 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.720
 development phase and by various forums 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.520
 and various websites are 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.830
 promising that because of its great 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.630
 processor you will be able to record in raw in 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.820
 1080 this means that you will be able to 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.550
 adjust exposure color temperature 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.810
 and many more features 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.120
 directly in post-production you can 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.760
 adjust the iso from 100 to 25 thousand 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.709
 600 but if you go up to 3200 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.870
 the price jump will appear noise 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.129
 compared to 600 d is quite strong 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.709
 since with the objective 18 135 the price 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.599
 of 70 is worth 1,300 euros not 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.819
 forget that the 70's is also not pull 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.280
 frame that is to say with the aim of the kit 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.739
 you will have vocal distances of 30 to 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.110
 220 more or less and finally and of the 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.030
 high range I decide by the five of sea 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.799
 three although it is true that it is somewhat 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.209
 old and currently not suitable 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.859
 buy it because it's around the corner 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.810
 the corner the presentation of the seven 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.519
 of sea 2 is still a very good 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.470
 camera one of the main advantages 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.120
 that have the five of March 3 is that you 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.889
 allows you to record the content that you are 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.959
 generating on two memory cards 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.720
 simultaneously that is, you can record 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.120
 in a compact the and in a sd card to 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.889
 I find it really dangerous and 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.989
 really risky carry and record 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.090
 all your content only on one card 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.400
 body is magnesium and is somewhat 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.830
 heavy and what it's full frame can 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.930
 be an advantage or a drawback already 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.300
 that only supports objectives 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.010
 efe the magic lander is available and 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.260
 this makes the characteristics of the 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.610
 camera triggers and can record in raw 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.469
 to 720 can 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.479
 monitor the audio directly with the 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:40.379
 Minijack output of the camera and its price 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.449
 with the objective 24 105 4 l are about 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.219
 2,700 euros for nothing until here the 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.020
 video I hope you have been useful if 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.060
 so do not forget to leave your like and 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.770
 share it for your social networks a 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.770
 greeting and thank you very much until then
