the oceans through doorways near accra

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.180 
the oceans through doorways near accra
and<00:03:56.730> Dakar<00:03:59.130> such<00:04:00.130> was<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.580> consequence<00:04:01.300> of

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
and Dakar such was the consequence of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.750 
and Dakar such was the consequence of
what<00:04:03.190> happened<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:05.080> us

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.839 

and<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.540> when<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:08.810> think<00:04:08.959> about<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:10.340> Belanger

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
and so when I think about the Belanger

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.599 
and so when I think about the Belanger
Center<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:12.400> see<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.610> as<00:04:13.909> a<00:04:14.530> bridge<00:04:15.530> of<00:04:15.860> 30<00:04:16.220> years

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
Center I see it as a bridge of 30 years

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.300 
Center I see it as a bridge of 30 years
with<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:17.419> many<00:04:17.620> possibilities<00:04:19.840> infinite

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
with so many possibilities infinite

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.270 
with so many possibilities infinite
capacities<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.760> build<00:04:23.090> bridges<00:04:24.040> for<00:04:25.040> young

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
capacities to build bridges for young

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.469 
capacities to build bridges for young
african-american<00:04:26.350> students<00:04:27.610> back<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.060> past

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
african-american students back to a past

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:40.360 
african-american students back to a past
that<00:04:30.110> they<00:04:30.500> need<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:31.479> discover

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.430
