people's lives and I actually generated

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
people's lives and I actually generated
a<00:01:02.850> bit<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> fan<00:01:03.600> base<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a bit of a fan base and from that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.460 
a bit of a fan base and from that
spawned<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.430> team<00:01:05.640> oh<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.570> when<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> was

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
not just like sitting there account in

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
not just like sitting there account in
their<00:01:26.070> reps<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.430> mean<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.909> everything<00:01:27.540> I

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
their reps I mean it's like everything I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
their reps I mean it's like everything I
have<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.110> me<00:01:28.259> into<00:01:28.650> them<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> found<00:01:29.280> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
have in me into them and I found that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
have in me into them and I found that
the<00:01:30.000> hip-hop<00:01:30.420> industry<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.500> kind<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the hip-hop industry we do kind of

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.200 
the hip-hop industry we do kind of
gravitate<00:01:32.310> towards<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.729> another<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.030> don't

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
gravitate towards one another I don't

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
gravitate towards one another I don't
know<00:01:33.270> maybe<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> energy<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.619> one

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
know maybe it's just the energy but one

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.520 
know maybe it's just the energy but one
