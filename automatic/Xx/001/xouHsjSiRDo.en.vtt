 place where you have water can fish 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 This party here is a little different than 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.050
 little more advanced is the following galera 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.500
 for you to get those big tits ctt 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.390
 necessary these items here have to have

 a fish-shaped jewelry sound and 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.850
 green at auction 5 of it costs three goals 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.739
 at least of all kinds of things I 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.580
 catch the type of fish 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 the green yellow the red the blue

 so people they can also be 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.430
 affected but it is a bit expensive because 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.390
 need to use gemstones to make 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.790
 he 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.970
 on another item that is required you use 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.680
 there are also buckets with bait 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.820
 with them you can not get the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.380
 fish also gains now in fishing 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 Then look who has fishing for the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.439
 chelsea that great in using a radar 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.210
 and a radar indicate where the fish are 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.220

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 found gull in case who does not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.890
 you have to look for 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.820
 back to play around you think 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.670

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.030
 we got here on the spot I'm going to start 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.030
 fishing 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.470
 It is this crowd the fishing is 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.660
 a more profitable 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.630
 risk you may suffer sinning you 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.190
 can take charge of another faction is 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.190
 very profitable but very dangerous 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.980
 also start fishing 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.600
 You have to throw a bucket at a ball in the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:36.090
 water in this way that only one 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:37.980
 with my colleague and asked earlier then 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:50.600

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:50.600

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:03.900

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.209
 new skill besides r 390 tt clicks on it 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.330
 who starts fishing 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.190
 it is a little time consuming for normal fishing 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.770
 have to wait for gays to get big 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.770

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.680
 take your place 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:23.930

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:39.360

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:41.070

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:48.480
 Nothing but for what I did here. 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.920
