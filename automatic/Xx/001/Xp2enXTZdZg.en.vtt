 about 90 minutes your hard drive keeps the information for a long time 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.599
 that they transmit to him the head of reading reads the information is 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.889
 extremely accurate the space between the read head and the hard disk is 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.629
 as thin as a hair 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.369
 the hard drive is installed in its place inside the ackerman computer 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.550
 there are two other units that protect the information 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.579
 the detachable actor of 3-inch discs and the cd rom player that 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.579
 allows you to read and execute programs recorded on compact discs 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.550
 kim jong nam mum in guk kum jong - the central bank 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.790
 these units are put 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.210
 instead franck buckles the spine of the computer is this board 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.160
 main the other elements of the computer are connected to this unit 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.920
 from cooler dissipates the heat generated by the chewing gum set 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.990
 some sound cards are integrated directly to the board 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.420
 main these connections in sequences are the audio input their output and the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.870
 microphone port 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.840
 these travel retainer rings you ensure the video card during the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.030
 transport 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.869
 This thermal unit measures the temperature emitted between the processor and the board 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:15.930
 principal 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.210
 tucker the processor is the brain of the system 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.640
 the interpreter to the calculation and executed the instructions I received 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.870
 the processor has several million transistors and their lack of speed 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 of operation reaches the level of arrivals 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.490
 the processor rests on this basis 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.890
 the creator of the processor visits the intense heat its efficiency depends on the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.180
 type of material used and the conductive material that ensures a better 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.500
 cooling answer

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.660
 RAM stores short-term information 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.510
 but the board when the current is disconnected 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.560
 this memory is faster than the hard drive the cd rom 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.229
 You 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.450
 now everything is integrated into the field 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.450
 It protects the internal elements of the external elements etc 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.290
 this stage the electronic components are installed in the box 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.349
 Hahaha 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.049
 Several rectors of the box are connected to the main board such 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.539
 like the switch and the various light indicators 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.289

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.209
 no government 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.940
 is the output connection of the video card that joins the computer to 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:30.949
 monitor 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:34.309
 we also see the video chip that creates images in two and three dimensions 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.829
 this is the video memory the more and its capacity increases more clearly 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.829
 it will be the image displayed on the monitor 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.479
 on the video card exposed in its place 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.229
 the modem allows two computers to communicate with the capacitors 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.659
 generate a totally clean telephone signal to facilitate 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.309
 communications 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.180
 these manifolds of the modem chip control the information circulating 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.209
 between the two computers 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.049
 the fax modem is installed 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.739
 the power supply transform the electricity according to the score 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.739
 required by the different components 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.889
 renamed as an alternative to installing the internal wiring of the 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.529
 This allows the information to travel between the 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:26.159
 different media and the main board then connect the cable and the cd 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.009
 rom 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.009
 one 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:49.039
 The last electrical cables are connected to the different components 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.039
 from the rock band computer 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.699

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.029
 the lawyers of the 30 components of the computer is already finished 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.879
 just before closing the box each computer is tested to verify the good 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.150
 operation of peripherals 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.549
 Orjuela close if they proceed with the tie 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.169
 This company produces more than 300 road computers 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.120
 although it is capricious 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.439

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.400
 the field the governor 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.400
