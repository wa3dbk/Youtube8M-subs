00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
has since long long since more run out

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.149 
has since long long since more run out
and<00:01:26.310> Landers<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.119> Ferrari<00:01:27.570> has<00:01:28.159> dissolved

and Landers and Ferrari has dissolved

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.059 
and Landers and Ferrari has dissolved
they<00:01:29.729> dissolved<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.569> back<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.810> their<00:01:31.140> 70s

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
they dissolved I think back in their 70s

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.139 
they dissolved I think back in their 70s
but<00:01:33.060> anyway<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:34.439> basic<00:01:35.039> design<00:01:35.249> is<00:01:35.490> being

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
but anyway the basic design is being

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.069 
but anyway the basic design is being
carried<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.780> by<00:01:37.079> various<00:01:37.130> manufacturers<00:01:38.130> in

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
carried on by various manufacturers in

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.609 
carried on by various manufacturers in
South<00:01:40.079> America<00:01:40.649> where<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.490> made<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
South America where this one is made in

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.809 
South America where this one is made in
China<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.280> other<00:01:44.520> places<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.380> anyway<00:01:46.380> this

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
China and other places but anyway this

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.160 
China and other places but anyway this
this<00:01:47.819> mill<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.229> used<00:01:49.499> to<00:01:49.770> make<00:01:49.979> oatmeal<00:01:51.170> so

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
this mill can be used to make oatmeal so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.190 
this mill can be used to make oatmeal so
what<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.039> take<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.670> oats<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.240> dump<00:01:55.079> them

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
what I do is I take the oats I dump them

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.020 
what I do is I take the oats I dump them
in<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.499> hopper<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.630> here

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
in the hopper right here

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:11.460 
in the hopper right here
and<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:59.020> adjust<00:01:59.800> the<00:02:00.220> center<00:02:02.430> thumbscrew

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.700 

as<00:02:12.460> you<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.820> see<00:02:13.030> there's<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.390> thumbscrew<00:02:13.810> with

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
as you can see there's a thumbscrew with

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.520 
as you can see there's a thumbscrew with
a<00:02:14.740> locking<00:02:15.340> wing<00:02:16.210> nut<00:02:16.450> behind<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:17.500> you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
a locking wing nut behind it so you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.010 
a locking wing nut behind it so you
loosen<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.190> all<00:02:18.430> up<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.480> back<00:02:19.720> that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
loosen that all up and you back that

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.370 
loosen that all up and you back that
thumb<00:02:20.590> screw<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.220> at<00:02:21.970> quarter<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.690> quarter

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
thumb screw out at quarter it quarter

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.980 
thumb screw out at quarter it quarter
turn<00:02:23.620> intervals<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:25.210> grind<00:02:25.480> your<00:02:25.750> grain

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
turn intervals and you grind your grain

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.550 
turn intervals and you grind your grain
and<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:28.030> some<00:02:28.360> point<00:02:28.630> you'll<00:02:28.810> find<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.320> it's

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and at some point you'll find that it's

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.810 
and at some point you'll find that it's
it<00:02:30.160> makes<00:02:30.550> what<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.030> call<00:02:31.450> Irish<00:02:32.370> oatmeal<00:02:33.370> or

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
it makes what you call Irish oatmeal or

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.480 
it makes what you call Irish oatmeal or
steel-cut<00:02:34.480> oats<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.080> what<00:02:36.040> you're<00:02:36.190> doing

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
steel-cut oats and what you're doing

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.630 
steel-cut oats and what you're doing
basically<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:37.060> cracking<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.900> oat<00:02:38.050> grain<00:02:38.640> at

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
basically is cracking the oat grain at

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.630 
basically is cracking the oat grain at
in<00:02:40.090> pieces<00:02:40.600> so<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.350> will<00:02:41.560> cook<00:02:41.740> quicker

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
in pieces so that it will cook quicker

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.800 
in pieces so that it will cook quicker
and<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.690> will<00:02:43.840> create<00:02:44.140> an<00:02:44.560> oatmeal<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.810> that's

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and it will create an oatmeal so that's

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.050 
and it will create an oatmeal so that's
what<00:02:47.020> that's<00:02:47.290> how<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.530> make<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.490> steel<00:02:48.760> cut

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
what that's how I make the steel cut

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
lid on like this and then let let the

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.190 
lid on like this and then let let the
oats<00:05:34.750> cool<00:05:35.110> down<00:05:35.910> all<00:05:36.910> right<00:05:37.090> if<00:05:37.600> you<00:05:37.810> put<00:05:38.020> the

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
oats cool down all right if you put the

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.820 
oats cool down all right if you put the
lid<00:05:39.130> on<00:05:39.160> tight<00:05:39.640> at<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.480> point<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:41.560> will

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
lid on tight at that point it will

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.650 
lid on tight at that point it will
continue<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.550> boil<00:05:43.800> because<00:05:44.800> it's

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
continue to boil because it's

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.420 
continue to boil because it's
essentially<00:05:46.660> out<00:05:46.810> still<00:05:47.110> under<00:05:47.380> pressure<00:05:47.560> so

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
essentially out still under pressure so

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.030 
essentially out still under pressure so
you<00:05:48.460> want<00:05:48.790> that<00:05:48.970> really<00:05:49.810> to<00:05:50.050> calm<00:05:50.500> down<00:05:50.530> and

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
you want that really to calm down and

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.060 
you want that really to calm down and
stop<00:05:51.310> boiling<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:52.260> within<00:05:53.260> about<00:05:53.440> 30<00:05:53.830> seconds

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
stop boiling and within about 30 seconds

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.600 
stop boiling and within about 30 seconds
remembering<00:05:57.070> to<00:05:57.310> put<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.780> fire<00:05:59.050> on<00:05:59.410> low<00:05:59.920> or

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
remembering to put the fire on low or

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.780 
remembering to put the fire on low or
your<00:06:00.940> electric<00:06:01.060> burner<00:06:01.630> on<00:06:02.110> low<00:06:02.170> and<00:06:02.680> then

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
your electric burner on low and then

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.180 
your electric burner on low and then
plonk<00:06:03.790> your<00:06:03.880> top<00:06:04.750> on<00:06:04.990> and<00:06:05.260> then<00:06:05.860> check<00:06:06.160> it

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
plonk your top on and then check it

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.010 
plonk your top on and then check it
every<00:06:06.520> 10<00:06:06.730> minutes<00:06:06.970> maybe<00:06:07.270> give<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:07.600> a<00:06:07.750> stir

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
every 10 minutes maybe give it a stir

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.620 
every 10 minutes maybe give it a stir
and<00:06:08.550> so<00:06:09.550> that<00:06:09.760> it<00:06:09.880> doesn't<00:06:10.210> stick<00:06:10.450> to<00:06:10.600> the

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
and so that it doesn't stick to the

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.150 
and so that it doesn't stick to the
bottom<00:06:10.810> of<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.170> pot<00:06:11.350> and

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
bottom of the pot and

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.430 
bottom of the pot and
within<00:06:13.430> I'd<00:06:14.090> say<00:06:14.120> 20<00:06:14.630> minutes<00:06:14.780> or<00:06:15.020> a<00:06:15.050> half<00:06:15.140> an

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
within I'd say 20 minutes or a half an

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.940 
within I'd say 20 minutes or a half an
hour<00:06:15.820> it<00:06:16.820> should<00:06:17.210> have<00:06:17.750> absorbed<00:06:18.710> all<00:06:18.920> the

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
hour it should have absorbed all the

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.420 
hour it should have absorbed all the
water<00:06:19.100> and<00:06:19.700> at<00:06:20.510> that<00:06:20.690> point<00:06:21.020> you'll<00:06:21.260> have<00:06:22.100> some

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
water and at that point you'll have some

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.060 
water and at that point you'll have some
delicious<00:06:23.210> oatmeal<00:06:23.390> so<00:06:23.900> I<00:06:24.140> hope<00:06:24.590> you<00:06:24.710> enjoyed
