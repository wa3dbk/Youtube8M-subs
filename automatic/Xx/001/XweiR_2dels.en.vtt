you try to do it straight so just get
the<00:02:00.119> Bucks<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.660> wire<00:02:00.990> cutters<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:02.869> wire

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the Bucks the wire cutters are a wire

cutters or wrench and you just spend the
end<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.929> if<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.050> doesn't<00:02:10.110> bend<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.740> enough<00:02:11.009> you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
end and if it doesn't bend it enough you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.140 
end and if it doesn't bend it enough you
could<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.710> use<00:02:14.010> your<00:02:14.040> fingers<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:15.000> it's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
could just use your fingers but it's

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.190 
could just use your fingers but it's
pretty<00:02:15.330> hard<00:02:15.600> with<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.840> fingers<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:18.200> like

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
pretty hard with the fingers and like

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.180 
pretty hard with the fingers and like
you<00:02:19.350> saw<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.770> my<00:02:19.800> bobby<00:02:20.130> pin<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.520> split<00:02:20.850> so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
you saw with my bobby pin it split so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.260 
you saw with my bobby pin it split so
never<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:23.520> never<00:02:23.730> happened<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.120> me<00:02:24.180> before

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
never that's never happened to me before

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.690 
never that's never happened to me before
so<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.580> Ben<00:02:26.580> might<00:02:26.610> actually<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:28.490> put<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.580> back

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
so this Ben might actually I put it back

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.960 
so this Ben might actually I put it back
together<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.490> doesn't<00:02:32.640> go<00:02:32.819> back

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970

together but if it doesn't go back
together<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.390> tape<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.960> with<00:02:34.380> some<00:02:35.100> paper

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
together just tape it with some paper

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.880 
together just tape it with some paper
what's<00:02:36.180> your<00:02:36.360> tape<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.350> best<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> my<00:02:40.590> wire

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
what's your tape for the best so my wire

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.750

force might have to put a little for so

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.020 
force might have to put a little for so
that's<00:03:07.230> what<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.440> looks<00:03:08.370> good<00:03:08.819> good
