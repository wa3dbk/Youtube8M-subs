00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.030
 this video is about being one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.010
 I know how much you know 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.179
 Safety you know dozens of videos 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.580
 who tell how much protein 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.970
 you need dozens of articles 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.949
 read and you know 14 to two grams 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 protein is thus the direction around muscles 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.170
 to build up his definition well 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 keep etc 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 What occurred to me recently it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.170
 or what I unfortunately 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.940
 I realized that while I know 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.739
 how much protein do I take and that I 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.480
 tried again and again protein 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.059
 source of the meal 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.399
 but I have found it enough 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.780
 not if I'm 100 grams of meat it is 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.360
 Not enough if I 100 grams 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.420
 beans is i have to look that up 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.489
 this amount of say 150 grams 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.489
 consume protein during the day 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.410
 in meat form that's about 750 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.800
 Gramm meat if I only eat meat 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.870
 just for info so what i got you in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.739
 this video wants to say you can do it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.990
 it really enough protein over days 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.430
 to eat weeks or months or do you have 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.799
 once done and then have it again 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.720
 but right now a lot is forgotten 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.909
 too little protein and wonder why 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 The results may be his muscles 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.080
 not as soon as they should be 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.140
 You should not go back to the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.549
 know basics and control what 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.009
 you may have heard a hundred times 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.960
 I read so many comments about 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.329
 the topics maybe the people already 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.070
 ill and they say that flavio 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.960
 I already know everything I know that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.640
 which I know that with the albumen 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.750
 training the problem is the people 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 do not use it 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.520
 So if you want to build muscle 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.810
 if you really are a figure 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.340
 want to revolutionize when you are in the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.560
 next few weeks months and years 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.930
 looking back on the day today 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.420
 and say yes I have my life 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.850
 Now finally changed then look 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.820
 that you master the simple rules 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.710
 and the simple rule is 1.4 to 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.090
 two grams of protein per kilo of body weight 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.610
 did you have your food to install when 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.920
 you do it, you're on a good way 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.470
 if you do not try it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.280
 make my progress around the time 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.010
 invest again in the gym 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.290
 to use it completely honestly there is 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.420
 Thousands in the hundreds 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.030
 to run a race to the gym 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.420
 we idiots the home and eat 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.780
 Pizza 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.430
 I do not say anything against a pizza just me 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.489
 do not invest for hours 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.140
 training over weeks and months around 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.239
 then feed me and me wrong 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.810
 then to annoy that I have no muscles 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.450
 build up 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.760
 Be smart also followed the simple ones 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.330
 settle and you will notice that it with 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.019
