00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.810
welcome to italian cuisine
at home today how to cleanse

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.960
whole prawns and tails, you
can mail  inquiries

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.039
about whatevever of you interest
to italian cuisine at home,

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.449
so cleansing prawns is quite easy,
the most important is to try

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.599
not to damage their tails

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.800
so we staat from the
central part of the prawn

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.330
remove the shell

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.690
trying to preserve,
if not yet broken,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.860
the tail top because in many
recipes it could be a nice garnish

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.840
as soon as the shell is removed

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.410
start

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.400
with the most important but less
funny part of the tails cleansing

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.970
cut

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.960
the upper part

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.640
using a jagged knife

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.890
very easy to do

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190
and look for the
intestin

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.620
the black vein

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.470
which I don' want
to find in my dish

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.760
we remove it using a sharp knife

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.090
now the prawn tail is
ready to be rinsed

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.360
dried and cooked

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.390
cleansing a prawns tail is
very easy, it is also very easy

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.630
to cleanse a whole
prawn, pay only attention

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.079
it not to break, if possible,

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.980
so it is better to cut

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.900
always with a jagged knife
or a sharp knife

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.260
as this one

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.810
the lower part of the shell, so
you will be sure to remove it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.840
without problems,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.000
in the same way we cleanse
prawns, we cleanse also shrimps

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.680
we remove tail and shell

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.570
then we separe tail from shell

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.070
paying attention

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.219
it not to break

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.119
if

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:16.709
the prawn is without tail as now

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.799
we can also press it
until out of the shell

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.129
as soon as shelled

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.739
at first we cut

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.669
and remove

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.189
the intestin

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.159
that here, we are lucky,

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:36.989
is empty
