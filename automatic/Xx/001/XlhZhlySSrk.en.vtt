00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.330
 hello everyone here we see a new 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.800
 delivery of trying trailers space 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.450
 in which we take the images that the 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.250
 developers have been presenting us 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.350
 and we look for the secrets that can 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.940
 hide in this case we have a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.330
 update on the new zelda of 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.280
 3ds confirmed will be called a link between 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.560
 words and will pass after the 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.940
 events of 'la into the past la 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.099
 amount of information has not increased 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.749
 too much but yes they have confirmed 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.219
 and denied some theories have been 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:37.170
 made changes regarding what 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.870
 we had seen before so 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.399
 let's start near the beginning of the video I 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.679
 this counter is striking 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.569
 Blondes did not see such a thing in the trailer 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.940
 previous I have to admit that I did not 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.139
 enthuses its very bulky design for 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.699
 my taste especially if you will be 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:53.399
 appearing and disappearing if every time 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.989
 that you get rupees your presence could 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.670
 indicate that the screen below does not 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.049
 is going to have an accountant is to say that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 is going to be destined to that kind of 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:03.030
 information but I see it extremely 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 unlikely as it disappears 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 and in cells you can always see how many 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.940
 rupees you have would not leave you without a data 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.010
 so basic and less in a console with 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.950
 two screens that has already tradition of 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.119
 devote one of them to maps and menu is 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 because there is no need to fear for a 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.479
 touch control on the screen can be 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.979
 select options and objects with the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.649
 stylus but the movements are 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 will make with the buttons more changes 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.040
 that are obvious when you start 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.020
 see the trailer are those of the new meter 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.970
 just as I said in the previous video that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.440
 could happen has changed form and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.299
 color in addition to regenerate 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.039
 apparently faster though it could 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.630
 be an optical effect derived from that 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.940
 Now do it small jumps and before 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 softer way nothing has been said 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.920
 about him so we still do not know 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.659
 what exactly does it mark and what 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.490
 recognize that logic you can 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.020
 use escapes me since we see that 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.240
 use the fire stick in the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.970
 meter while the pegasus boots 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.190
 although fortunately they do not do so 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.960
 that you can not say is a bar 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.060
 use of objects because several 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.460
 objects do not spend it or try 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.710
 explain it with a fire bar to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.760
 magical objects because the boots me 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.770
 they seem pretty magical 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.020
 another thing that I recognize that has taken me 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.330
 by surprise is that this is not the same 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.010
 the intellect of peace if we had already 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.840
 treated as it does not look at all like 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.340
 spray to link to the past and how did the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.920
 impression of being a child in a young 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.780
 adult but still think it would be a 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.780
 direct sequel and not as they have said a 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.250
 story that happens many years later 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.960
 we go that the relation between games no 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.910
 It will be as higher as more with a 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.340
 canine of time but like twilight 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.720
 princess as gun and of time is confirmed 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.220
 also that although the provision of 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.110
 the USA will remain faithful to the version 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.520
 original except for the dungeons the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.020
 world of darkness will have changed 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.000
 considerably as he has done 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.680
 the way of going from one to the other no longer 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.090
 you need the mirror and probably 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.770
 neither the pearl that allowed you 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.900
 keep your human form in that world 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.670
 the contraption that could replace both 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.080
 elements is the bracelet that carries the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.810
 link in the left hand easier to 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.280
 see when you are facing or acting 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.050
 this is just an assumption by me 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.550
 part and the fact that the first 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.020
 trailer did not see such thing could 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.000
 indicate that it is another function object 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.590
 different as to replace the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.640
 gauntlets to lift weights or something 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.470
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.020
 and get the color of the meter change 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.120
 not now seriously I do not finish giving myself 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.560
 realize that it is but there is something and that 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.080
 bracelet that makes me think that it has 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.850
 those functions are also presented to us 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.500
 several new mechanics related to 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.180
 the power to get into the walls like 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.770
 pick up objects painted on them or 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.690
 take advantage of the movement of them 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.070
 although they were things that we expected to see and 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.460
 sure they are still keeping to what 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.740
 better in the inkwell 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.000
 in short this has been my brief review and 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.190
 Enlargement about the conclusions 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.840
 extracted from the first trailer follow 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.700
 informed to see what else they have though 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.680
 these heights continuing to come out in autumn 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.080
 we are probably seeing the version 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.400
 definitive in any case happening well that 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.400
 that's what videogames are for
