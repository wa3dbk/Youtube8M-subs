who<00:00:00.390> I<00:00:00.930> know<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.560> did<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.040> same<00:00:02.250> video<00:00:02.429> the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
who I know I did the same video the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.210 
who I know I did the same video the
other<00:00:03.149> night<00:00:03.360> but<00:00:03.540> it's<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.899> little<00:00:04.740> less<00:00:04.920> dark

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
other night but it's a little less dark

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.909 
other night but it's a little less dark
out<00:00:05.430> now<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:07.020> have<00:00:07.259> some<00:00:07.440> more<00:00:07.470> time<00:00:07.770> on

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
out now and I have some more time on

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.669 
out now and I have some more time on
this<00:00:08.069> so<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:09.080> go<00:00:10.080> into<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.320> little<00:00:10.440> bit

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
this so I can go into a little bit

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.589 
this so I can go into a little bit
greater<00:00:11.130> detail<00:00:11.610> as<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.030> needs<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> be

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
greater detail as to what needs to be

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.430 
greater detail as to what needs to be
done<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.929> make<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.170> modification<00:00:14.120> first<00:00:15.120> off

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
done to make this modification first off

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.400 
done to make this modification first off
the<00:00:16.440> series<00:00:16.980> three<00:00:17.720> l26<00:00:18.720> intake<00:00:19.109> has<00:00:19.380> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the series three l26 intake has a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.929 
the series three l26 intake has a
different<00:00:19.830> throttle<00:00:20.490> body<00:00:20.670> bolt<00:00:21.000> pattern

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
different throttle body bolt pattern

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.220 
different throttle body bolt pattern
then<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.300> series<00:00:25.230> two<00:00:26.599> one<00:00:27.599> other<00:00:27.900> thing<00:00:28.199> that

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
then the series two one other thing that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
then the series two one other thing that
i<00:00:28.380> did<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.710> i<00:00:28.800> upgraded<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> l67

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
i did is i upgraded to a l67

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.970 
i did is i upgraded to a l67
supercharged<00:00:30.689> throttle<00:00:31.109> body<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> little

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
supercharged throttle body it's a little

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.200 
supercharged throttle body it's a little
bit<00:00:32.099> bigger<00:00:32.250> bore<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.630> fits<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.020> better

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
bit bigger bore and it fits this better

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.490 
bit bigger bore and it fits this better
but<00:00:36.210> anyway<00:00:36.540> either<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.899> either<00:00:37.110> event<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
but anyway either in either event you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.709 
but anyway either in either event you
need<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.309> adapter<00:00:39.270> which<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> right

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
need to get this adapter which is right

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.150 
need to get this adapter which is right
here<00:00:39.930> here's<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> throttle<00:00:40.620> body<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:40.980> see

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
here here's the throttle body here see

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.530 
here here's the throttle body here see
it<00:00:41.219> after<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.610> then<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> intake<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it after and then the intake it's on the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.639 
it after and then the intake it's on the
back<00:00:44.149> it's<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> hundred<00:00:45.480> dollars<00:00:45.899> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
back it's about a hundred dollars it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.510 
back it's about a hundred dollars it
fits<00:00:46.980> excellent<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.280> comes

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
fits excellent and you know it comes

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.340 
fits excellent and you know it comes
with<00:00:50.640> everything<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.969> need<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.930> does

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
with everything you need well it does

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.229 
with everything you need well it does
bear<00:00:52.559> repeating<00:00:52.590> those<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.940> lose<00:00:54.210> your

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
bear repeating those that you lose your

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
bear repeating those that you lose your
throttle<00:00:54.989> body<00:00:56.600> heat<00:00:57.600> from<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> coolant<00:00:58.980> the

throttle body heat from the coolant the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
throttle body heat from the coolant the
passages<00:01:00.510> aren't<00:01:00.840> aren't<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> same<00:01:01.489> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
passages aren't aren't the same it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.889 
passages aren't aren't the same it
doesn't<00:01:02.789> bother<00:01:02.879> me<00:01:03.030> even<00:01:03.390> off<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.840> in

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
doesn't bother me even off here in

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
doesn't bother me even off here in
Michigan<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.979> cold<00:01:05.369> enough<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> really

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
Michigan it's not cold enough to really

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.210 
Michigan it's not cold enough to really
be<00:01:06.299> useful<00:01:07.670> second<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.420> need<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.920 

this<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:15.409> evap<00:01:16.460> port<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.479> series

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
this this in evap port on the series

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.030 
this this in evap port on the series
three<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:20.189> actually<00:01:21.770> plumbed<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
series two so that needs to be plugged

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.160 
series two so that needs to be plugged
with<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> pipe<00:01:29.460> plug<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.840> had<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> tap

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
with a pipe plug which you had to tap

a none metered air leak
this<00:02:01.860> has<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.250> plumbed<00:02:03.180> into<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> bottom

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
this has to be plumbed into the bottom

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.590 
this has to be plumbed into the bottom
of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> throttle<00:02:04.229> body<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> vacuum

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
of the throttle body and with a vacuum

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.740 
of the throttle body and with a vacuum
hose<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.740> drill<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:09.500> hole<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
hose so you have to drill a hole and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.020 
hose so you have to drill a hole and
use<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.320> brass<00:02:12.620> fitting<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:13.850> too

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
use a brass fitting it's not too

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.290 
use a brass fitting it's not too
difficult<00:02:16.720> also<00:02:17.720> there<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.980> aluminum<00:02:19.970> intake

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
difficult also there the aluminum intake
