he thought that I won to beef put it a
little<00:02:49.760> bit<00:02:50.060> later<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.930> actually<00:02:51.170> go

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
little bit later so that you actually go

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.870 
little bit later so that you actually go

I<00:02:59.770> was<00:03:00.770> surprised<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.640> dynamicism<00:03:02.330> of

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
I was surprised that the dynamicism of

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.080 
I was surprised that the dynamicism of
hearing<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.800> worker<00:03:03.980> in<00:03:04.220> PAL<00:03:04.459> Hall

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.390 

I've<00:03:11.090> never<00:03:11.329> heard<00:03:11.629> recording<00:03:12.439> that<00:03:13.159> comes

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
I've never heard recording that comes

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.330 
I've never heard recording that comes
close<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:14.120> capturing<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:15.290> essence<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.890> what

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
close to capturing the essence of what

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.399 
close to capturing the essence of what
music<00:03:16.489> really<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.390> like<00:03:17.659> when<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.079> hear<00:03:18.290> it

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
music really is like when you hear it

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.020 
music really is like when you hear it
performed<00:03:18.769> by<00:03:18.859> living<00:03:19.219> human<00:03:19.489> beings<00:03:19.790> in<00:03:19.969> a

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
performed by living human beings in a

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:28.460 
performed by living human beings in a
space<00:03:20.239> like<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:20.599> at<00:03:20.810> palcohol

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.940

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
it was just such a powerful sound it can

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.530 
it was just such a powerful sound it can
become<00:03:32.280> like<00:03:32.490> rock'n'roll

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540

Pawel hall has one of the best acoustics
in<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.019> United<00:03:42.379> States

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.179 

people<00:03:52.209> don't<00:03:52.420> realize<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.680> place<00:03:53.920> you

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
people don't realize that the place you

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.360 
people don't realize that the place you
play<00:03:54.430> music<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:55.120> as<00:03:55.359> important<00:03:55.930> as<00:03:56.219> the<00:03:57.219> actual

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
play music is as important as the actual

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.009 
play music is as important as the actual
instruments<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.359> use<00:03:58.569> to<00:03:58.750> play<00:03:58.900> the

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
instruments that you use to play the

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.080 
instruments that you use to play the
music<00:04:00.870> we<00:04:01.870> use<00:04:02.049> Powell<00:04:02.349> Symphony<00:04:02.859> Hall<00:04:03.010> as<00:04:03.370> an

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
music we use Powell Symphony Hall as an

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.910 
music we use Powell Symphony Hall as an
instrument<00:04:07.019> there's<00:04:08.019> really<00:04:08.290> nothing<00:04:08.859> else

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
instrument there's really nothing else

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.920 
instrument there's really nothing else
like<00:04:09.220> being<00:04:09.489> at<00:04:09.579> Powell<00:04:09.790> Hall<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.450> being<00:04:10.780> with

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
like being at Powell Hall and being with

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.170 
like being at Powell Hall and being with
the<00:04:11.049> musicians<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:11.680> hearing<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.310> sound<00:04:12.579> live

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
the musicians and hearing the sound live

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.479 
the musicians and hearing the sound live
and<00:04:13.390> in<00:04:13.450> person<00:04:13.480> it's<00:04:14.260> it's<00:04:14.680> hard<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.010> match

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
and in person it's it's hard to match

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.390 
and in person it's it's hard to match
really<00:04:19.530> there<00:04:20.530> is<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.650> different<00:04:21.070> kind<00:04:21.310> of

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
really there is a different kind of

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.330 
really there is a different kind of
energy<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:22.000> stage<00:04:22.180> when<00:04:22.570> everybody<00:04:23.050> is<00:04:23.349> really

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
energy on stage when everybody is really

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.390 
energy on stage when everybody is really
focused<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:25.300> can<00:04:25.330> really<00:04:25.750> feel<00:04:26.289> something<00:04:27.039> on

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
focused you can really feel something on

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.370 
focused you can really feel something on
stage<00:04:27.729> that's<00:04:28.060> palpable

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.200 

in<00:04:32.890> order<00:04:33.130> for<00:04:33.160> someone<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.030> really

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
in order for someone to really

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.120 
in order for someone to really
understand<00:04:34.960> what<00:04:35.200> we<00:04:35.320> do<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.680> have<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:35.980> hear

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
understand what we do you have to hear

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.850 
understand what we do you have to hear
it<00:04:36.160> live

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.250 

when<00:04:44.730> music<00:04:45.240> starts<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.720> vibrate

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
when music starts to vibrate

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.430 
when music starts to vibrate
we<00:04:47.830> start<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.220> vibrate<00:04:48.370> as<00:04:48.760> well

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.779 

listening<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.470> a<00:04:53.650> concert<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.220> having<00:04:54.729> a

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
listening to a concert and having a

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.790 
listening to a concert and having a
moment<00:04:55.090> like<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.199> reason<00:04:56.620> to

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
moment like that this is a reason to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.189 
moment like that this is a reason to
live

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.870 

see<00:05:03.199> what<00:05:03.380> happens<00:05:03.770> when<00:05:04.039> you<00:05:04.250> are<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:04.610> the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
see what happens when you are in the

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.950 
see what happens when you are in the
equation

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.620 

completely<00:05:11.590> energized<00:05:12.220> by<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.580> performance

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.730 

I<00:05:15.720> fell<00:05:16.230> a<00:05:16.260> flood<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.800> emotions

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.900 

the<00:05:22.100> programming<00:05:22.670> is<00:05:22.790> fantastic<00:05:23.450> incredible

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
the programming is fantastic incredible

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.630 
the programming is fantastic incredible
there<00:05:25.910> was<00:05:26.060> phenomenal
