just<00:02:46.599> I<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:46.750> do<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.230> wonder<00:02:48.099> if<00:02:48.250> there's<00:02:48.459> any

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
just I just do I wonder if there's any

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.250 
just I just do I wonder if there's any
correlation<00:02:48.850> between<00:02:49.180> how<00:02:49.600> good<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.080> are<00:02:50.230> at

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
correlation between how good you are at

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.620 
correlation between how good you are at
these<00:02:50.530> games<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.130> if<00:02:51.760> you're<00:02:51.940> ready<00:02:52.150> or<00:02:52.299> Lefty

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
these games and if you're ready or Lefty

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.590 
these games and if you're ready or Lefty
I'm<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.680> righty<00:02:53.920> just<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.430> know<00:02:54.519> I'm<00:02:55.480> gonna

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
I'm a righty just so you know I'm gonna

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.809 
I'm a righty just so you know I'm gonna
go<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.440> my<00:02:56.470> classic<00:02:57.100> because<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
go and do my classic because this is the

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.309 
go and do my classic because this is the
one<00:02:57.940> I'm<00:02:58.030> best<00:02:58.209> at<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.660> this<00:02:58.780> one<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.140> actually

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
one I'm best at and this one is actually

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.470 
one I'm best at and this one is actually
a<00:02:59.530> lot<00:02:59.620> harder<00:02:59.680> as<00:03:00.010> well<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.549> just<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:01.390> just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
a lot harder as well it's just it's just

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.509 
a lot harder as well it's just it's just
a<00:03:01.630> slower<00:03:02.019> one<00:03:02.440> because<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.920> have<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.310> click

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
a slower one because you have to click

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.360 
a slower one because you have to click
the<00:03:03.580> tile<00:03:03.970> exactly<00:03:04.810> right<00:03:05.019> or<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.560> doesn't<00:03:05.769> it

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
the tile exactly right or it doesn't it

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.759 
the tile exactly right or it doesn't it
doesn't<00:03:06.430> reward<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.269> with<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.480> jump<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.500> it's

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
doesn't reward you with the jump so it's

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.110 
doesn't reward you with the jump so it's
much<00:03:09.040> more<00:03:09.069> difficult<00:03:09.280> there<00:03:09.760> when<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:09.940> got

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
much more difficult there when I got

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.820 
much more difficult there when I got
seven<00:03:10.540> seconds<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.019> one<00:03:11.230> if<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.560> can<00:03:11.650> get

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
seven seconds this one if you can get

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.320 
seven seconds this one if you can get
under<00:03:12.010> 10<00:03:12.220> seconds<00:03:12.610> that's<00:03:12.790> pretty<00:03:13.000> freakin

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330
