it's basically double the size on a 360
as<00:00:26.900> these<00:00:27.900> two<00:00:28.140> pictures<00:00:28.910> demonstrate<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> as

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you can see on 360 you can see a little

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.729 
you can see on 360 you can see a little
bit<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> mountain<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.320> back<00:00:34.500> just

bit of the mountain in the back just
like<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> very<00:00:35.219> beginning<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.119 
like the very beginning of it and a
little<00:00:36.600> bit<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> second<00:00:37.500> jungle<00:00:37.800> temple

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
on the left side of it but on the Xbox

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280 
on the left side of it but on the Xbox
one<00:00:40.829> version<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.000> definitely<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.660> way

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
one version you can definitely see way

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.660 
one version you can definitely see way
way<00:00:43.469> WAY<00:00:43.620> farther<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
way WAY farther you can see like the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.330 
way WAY farther you can see like the
mountain<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.440> kinds<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:47.070> stuff

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
mountain you can see all kinds of stuff

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.279 
mountain you can see all kinds of stuff
so<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.730> basically<00:00:48.059> double<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.140> it's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
so it's basically double it and it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.549 
so it's basically double it and it's
really<00:00:49.590> nice<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.250> cool<00:00:50.550> now<00:00:51.059> basically

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
really nice really cool now basically

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.709 
really nice really cool now basically
what<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:52.980> want<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> talk<00:00:53.370> about<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.850> what

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
what I really want to talk about is what

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.040 
what I really want to talk about is what
feature<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.620> Xbox<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.550> will<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
feature the Xbox one will have that I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.150 
feature the Xbox one will have that I
think<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.829> great

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
think will be great

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
think will be great
while<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.730> half<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> should<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.840> what's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
while not half but it should have what's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650 
while not half but it should have what's
most<00:01:01.920> likely<00:01:02.280> well<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> smart

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
most likely well and that is the smart

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.250 
most likely well and that is the smart
glass<00:01:03.930> application<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:06.119> basically<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.140> I

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
glass application so basically what I

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.710 
glass application so basically what I
think<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.280> should<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.520> able<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
think that you should be able to do is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.190 
think that you should be able to do is
basically<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.520> load<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.540> smart<00:01:12.810> glass<00:01:13.020> on

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
basically you load up the smart glass on

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
basically you load up the smart glass on
Xbox<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.310> basically<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.450> see

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
Xbox one and basically you can see

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.649 
Xbox one and basically you can see
minecraft<00:01:16.350> okay<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.310> you'll<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.360> able<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.570> see

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
minecraft okay so you'll be able to see

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.960 
minecraft okay so you'll be able to see
the<00:01:18.750> world<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.320> playing<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the world that you are playing on so you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
the world that you are playing on so you
barely<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.420> set<00:01:21.659> waypoints<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
barely like set waypoints so like if you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
barely like set waypoints so like if you
want<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.759> where<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.390> spawn<00:01:24.689> in

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
want to go to like where you spawn in

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.690 
want to go to like where you spawn in
like<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.320> say<00:01:25.500> rate<00:01:25.740> point<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> Waypoint

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
like you say rate point and the Waypoint

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.190 
like you say rate point and the Waypoint
will<00:01:26.850> pop<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.210> screen<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.810> show<00:01:28.049> like

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
will pop up on the screen and show like

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
will pop up on the screen and show like
a<00:01:28.229> little<00:01:28.500> arrow<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.950> show<00:01:29.280> how<00:01:29.460> many<00:01:29.520> meters

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
a little arrow and show how many meters

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.300 
a little arrow and show how many meters
away<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:30.750> from<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.229> right<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.130> then

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
away you are from it right now so then

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.679 
away you are from it right now so then
no<00:01:32.460> matter<00:01:32.610> what<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.030> won't<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.420> able<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.600> get

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
no matter what you won't be able to get

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.020 
no matter what you won't be able to get
lost<00:01:33.930> now<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.890> very<00:01:35.189> very<00:01:35.520> useful

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
lost now that would be very very useful

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.490 
lost now that would be very very useful
so<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.240> won't<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.810> able<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> lose<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.320> house

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
so you won't be able to lose your house

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.370 
so you won't be able to lose your house
because<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.400> world<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:39.060> gonna<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.750> least

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
because the world are gonna be at least

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.560 
because the world are gonna be at least
36<00:01:41.310> times<00:01:41.610> bigger<00:01:42.000> they're<00:01:42.299> currently

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
36 times bigger they're currently

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.020 
36 times bigger they're currently
working<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:43.079> making<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.799> 36<00:01:44.159> times<00:01:44.430> bigger<00:01:44.700> so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
working on making it 36 times bigger so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.999 
working on making it 36 times bigger so
hopefully<00:01:45.450> they'll<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.049> able<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> finalize<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
hopefully they'll be able to finalize it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
hopefully they'll be able to finalize it
and<00:01:47.220> make<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.579> 36<00:01:48.240> times<00:01:48.540> bigger<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:48.840> even

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and make it 36 times bigger or even

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
and make it 36 times bigger or even
bigger<00:01:49.439> because<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.790> never<00:01:50.880> said<00:01:51.180> they

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
bigger because it never said they

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.999 
bigger because it never said they
weren't<00:01:51.420> gonna<00:01:51.570> make<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> bigger<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.590> is

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
weren't gonna make it bigger so that is

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.380 
weren't gonna make it bigger so that is
pretty<00:01:53.340> cool<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.970> gonna<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.240> three

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
pretty cool that it's gonna be three

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.319 
pretty cool that it's gonna be three
times<00:01:54.600> bigger<00:01:55.350> at<00:01:55.619> least<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.549> far<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.060> know

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
times bigger at least as far as we know

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.359 
times bigger at least as far as we know
now<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.140> other<00:01:58.380> thing<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.009> when<00:01:59.280> you're

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
now the other thing is when you're

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.709 
now the other thing is when you're
mining<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.350> basically<00:02:01.820> in<00:02:02.820> mining<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.509> then

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
mining so basically in mining and then

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.560 
mining so basically in mining and then
your<00:02:03.930> inventory<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.770> full<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.790> basically<00:02:06.270> what

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
your inventory is full so basically what

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.600 
your inventory is full so basically what
you<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.500> open<00:02:07.649> up<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> app<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.129> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you do is you open up the app and you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.059 
you do is you open up the app and you
can<00:02:08.759> access<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.840> new<00:02:10.140> chest<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.860> have

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
can access you a new chest that you have

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.130 
can access you a new chest that you have
if<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.879> one<00:02:12.150> created<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.959> don't

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
if you have one created if you don't

if you have one created if you don't
have<00:02:13.260> one<00:02:13.440> create

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
have one create

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.550 
have one create
then<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:13.970> won't<00:02:14.120> be<00:02:14.180> able<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.360> use<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.659> but<00:02:15.379> if

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
then you won't be able to use it but if

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.199 
then you won't be able to use it but if
you<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.040> one<00:02:16.069> created<00:02:16.489> then<00:02:16.849> you'll<00:02:17.030> be

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
you do have one created then you'll be

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.289 
you do have one created then you'll be
able<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.629> access<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.379> on<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> smart<00:02:18.890> phone<00:02:19.299> the

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
able to access it on the smart phone the

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.420 
able to access it on the smart phone the
smart<00:02:20.540> glass<00:02:20.720> app<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.470> be<00:02:21.829> able<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.040> switch

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
smart glass app and be able to switch

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.860 
smart glass app and be able to switch
your<00:02:22.640> inventory<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> can<00:02:23.599> put<00:02:23.840> your

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
your inventory so you can put your

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.530 
your inventory so you can put your
inventory<00:02:24.620> away<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.340> end<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:26.090> chess<00:02:26.299> so

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
inventory away in the end of chess so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.569 
inventory away in the end of chess so
then<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:26.959> keep<00:02:27.290> mining<00:02:27.590> now<00:02:28.340> that's

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
then you can keep mining now that's

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.699 
then you can keep mining now that's
basically<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:29.329> I<00:02:29.599> think<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.349> could<00:02:30.500> do

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
basically it I think that you could do

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.770 
basically it I think that you could do
this<00:02:31.010> probably<00:02:31.220> more<00:02:31.430> possibility<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.329> what

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
this probably more possibility so what

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.420 
this probably more possibility so what
you<00:02:32.900> guys<00:02:33.049> think<00:02:33.379> about<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.829> I<00:02:34.040> would<00:02:34.099> leave

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
you guys think about this I would leave

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.580 
you guys think about this I would leave
a<00:02:34.670> comment<00:02:35.239> on<00:02:35.390> what<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:36.049> think<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.470> they

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
could do for the smart glass application

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.500 
could do for the smart glass application
as<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.680> know<00:02:39.829> for<00:02:40.069> ps4<00:02:40.519> they<00:02:40.819> said<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.180> the
