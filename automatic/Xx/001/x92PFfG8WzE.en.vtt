what<00:02:03.490> it's<00:02:03.640> snow<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.150> probably<00:02:04.450> like<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.810> most

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
what it's snow is probably like the most

what it's snow is probably like the most
overplayed<00:02:05.590> one<00:02:06.330> because<00:02:07.330> snow<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.630> such<00:02:08.020> an

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
overplayed one because snow is such an

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.090 
overplayed one because snow is such an
easy<00:02:08.350> thing<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.740> like<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.770> less<00:02:11.770> talked

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
easy thing to like think is less talked

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.970 
easy thing to like think is less talked

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
the one I saw when I first came in the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.750 
the one I saw when I first came in the
room<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.830> how<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.010> progress<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.730> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
room this is how you progress in the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.540 
room this is how you progress in the
temple<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:05.110> only<00:03:05.320> reason<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.770> would<00:03:05.890> well

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
temple the only reason you would well

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.830 
temple the only reason you would well
you<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.910> use<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.180> other<00:03:07.209> ones<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.750> get

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
you have to use the other ones to get

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.090 
you have to use the other ones to get
the<00:03:07.959> switch<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.620> can<00:03:08.739> get<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> water

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
the switch so you can get the water

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.590 
the switch so you can get the water
flowing<00:03:09.310> through<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.670> green<00:03:10.000> pipe<00:03:10.239> which<00:03:10.480> I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
flowing through the green pipe which I

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.530 
flowing through the green pipe which I
just<00:03:10.810> did<00:03:11.130> so<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:13.360> solves<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.930> few<00:03:14.110> things

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.820 

and<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.690> course<00:03:19.870> this<00:03:19.990> takes<00:03:20.290> us<00:03:20.440> back<00:03:20.470> out

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
and of course this takes us back out

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.800 
and of course this takes us back out
here<00:03:21.040> again

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
here again

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.390 
here again
but<00:03:22.810> since<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.590> water<00:03:23.740> is<00:03:23.890> turning<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.310> other

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
but since the water is turning the other

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.820 
but since the water is turning the other
way<00:03:24.520> that<00:03:25.000> means<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:26.140> might<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.530> go<00:03:26.650> out<00:03:26.680> a

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
way that means we might have to go out a

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.820 
way that means we might have to go out a
different<00:03:27.040> way<00:03:27.280> which<00:03:27.520> means<00:03:28.530> sink<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.220> swim

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
different way which means sink and swim

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.900 
different way which means sink and swim
that's<00:03:32.830> right<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.130> have<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.310> go<00:03:33.430> out<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.670> way<00:03:33.760> we

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
that's right I have to go out the way we

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.480 
that's right I have to go out the way we
normally<00:03:34.030> come<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:35.650> we<00:03:35.710> go<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.370> room

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
normally come in now we go to the room

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.250 
normally come in now we go to the room
on<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.730> bottom<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.600> where<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.080> fun

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
on the bottom and this is where the fun

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.940 
on the bottom and this is where the fun
begins

be pretty close there yeah I didn't have

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.260 
be pretty close there yeah I didn't have
to<00:03:59.920> do<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.040> they're<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:00.400> far<00:04:00.610> back<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:01.030> don't

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
to do that they're so far back I don't

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.720 
to do that they're so far back I don't
have<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.510> do<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.720> from<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.050> far<00:04:02.230> back<00:04:02.730> but

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
have to do that from so far back but

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.130 
have to do that from so far back but
once<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:04.000> swim<00:04:04.270> in<00:04:04.420> there<00:04:04.600> you're<00:04:04.930> going<00:04:05.050> to

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
once you swim in there you're going to

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.920 
once you swim in there you're going to
get<00:04:05.260> stuck<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.100> current<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.840> chances<00:04:07.840> are

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
get stuck in the current and chances are

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.270 
get stuck in the current and chances are
you're<00:04:08.050> going<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.260> swim<00:04:08.470> right<00:04:08.500> past<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.130> so

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
you're going to swim right past it so

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.250 
you're going to swim right past it so
what<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.430> like<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> do<00:04:09.910> is<00:04:10.660> back<00:04:10.900> up<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:11.110> the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
what I like to do is back up to the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.600 
what I like to do is back up to the
other<00:04:11.410> corner<00:04:11.680> of<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.890> room<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.340> can<00:04:12.490> get

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
other corner of the room so you can get

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.000 
other corner of the room so you can get
a<00:04:12.670> sense<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:14.560> know<00:04:14.590> which<00:04:14.860> direction

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
a sense of you know which direction

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.229 
a sense of you know which direction
you're<00:04:15.310> swimming<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.820> then<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.000> can<00:04:16.120> just

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
you're swimming and then you can just

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.270 
you're swimming and then you can just
nail<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:16.510> right<00:04:16.840> on<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.020> way<00:04:17.110> in<00:04:17.320> there<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.160> go

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
nail it right on the way in there you go

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.520 
nail it right on the way in there you go
just<00:04:19.000> like<00:04:19.090> that

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
just like that

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.580 
just like that
now<00:04:20.530> we<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:20.770> have<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:20.980> go<00:04:21.070> back<00:04:21.220> in<00:04:21.400> there<00:04:22.590> so

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
now we just have to go back in there so

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.250 
now we just have to go back in there so
just<00:04:23.680> make<00:04:23.890> a<00:04:23.920> giant<00:04:24.160> u-turn<00:04:24.670> they're<00:04:24.970> whoop

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
just make a giant u-turn they're whoop

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.390 
just make a giant u-turn they're whoop
it's<00:04:26.260> not<00:04:26.410> what<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:26.560> meant<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.860> do

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.870
