on this so what I want to do is I want

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.090 
on this so what I want to do is I want
to<00:00:48.309> mount<00:00:48.550> these<00:00:48.789> here<00:00:49.449> or<00:00:49.690> here<00:00:50.379> somewhere

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
to mount these here or here somewhere

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.189 
to mount these here or here somewhere
but<00:00:52.000> you'll<00:00:52.120> notice<00:00:52.359> that<00:00:52.480> everything<00:00:52.930> is

but you'll notice that everything is

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.319 
but you'll notice that everything is
curved<00:00:53.770> on<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.250> best<00:00:54.430> spot<00:00:54.730> so<00:00:55.090> there's

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
curved on the best spot so there's

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.349 
curved on the best spot so there's
really<00:00:55.600> no<00:00:55.930> way<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.199> mount<00:00:56.710> it<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:58.059> what<00:00:58.239> I've

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
really no way to mount it so what I've

to a machine shop and it's got a top ten
quarter<00:01:06.910> inch<00:01:07.060> for<00:01:07.840> bolting<00:01:08.619> through<00:01:09.040> this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
quarter inch for bolting through this

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.210 
quarter inch for bolting through this
plastic<00:01:09.909> I<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:12.580> then<00:01:13.140> basically<00:01:14.140> stick<00:01:15.040> this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
plastic I can then basically stick this

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:23.550 
plastic I can then basically stick this
through<00:01:15.520> here<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:19.020> mount<00:01:20.020> this<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.659> this

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
and I still have a bolt so the bullets

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.180 
and I still have a bolt so the bullets
gonna<00:01:49.300> hold<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.690> on<00:01:49.810> really<00:01:50.230> securely<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.070> the

gonna hold it on really securely and the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.040 
gonna hold it on really securely and the
tape<00:01:51.430> will<00:01:51.460> stop<00:01:51.940> it<00:01:52.150> from<00:01:52.180> moving<00:01:52.510> up<00:01:52.870> and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
tape will stop it from moving up and

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:01.190 
tape will stop it from moving up and
down<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.980> I<00:01:54.310> think<00:01:54.370> I'm<00:01:54.640> going<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.880> have<00:01:55.060> it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
color as that but it would cost me a

hardly<00:02:31.690> notice<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.350> when<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.340> black<00:02:33.640> and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
hardly notice it when it's black and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.320 
hardly notice it when it's black and
that's<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:37.320> then<00:02:38.320> this<00:02:38.680> fairing<00:02:39.340> we'll

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
that's that so then this fairing we'll

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.580 
that's that so then this fairing we'll
see<00:02:40.600> later

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
see later

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.240 
see later
hang<00:02:42.519> on<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> sec<00:02:43.030> I'll<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.420> move<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.750> camp

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.340 

okay<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.840> once<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.470> mounted<00:02:53.769> here

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
okay so once we have this mounted here

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.030 
okay so once we have this mounted here
with<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.590> light<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:58.350> wire<00:02:59.350> will<00:02:59.739> go<00:02:59.769> up

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
with this light the wire will go up

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.060 
with this light the wire will go up
inside<00:03:00.820> this<00:03:01.060> fairing<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.650> piece<00:03:03.040> is

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
inside this fairing and this piece is

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.490 
inside this fairing and this piece is
one<00:03:03.370> plastic<00:03:03.910> thing<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:04.870> gonna<00:03:05.019> come<00:03:05.350> off

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
one plastic thing so it's gonna come off

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.590 
one plastic thing so it's gonna come off
and<00:03:05.890> my<00:03:06.160> electrical<00:03:06.700> connection<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.390> right

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
and my electrical connection is right

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.310 
and my electrical connection is right
over<00:03:07.750> here

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
over here

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.350 
over here
so<00:03:08.860> I'll<00:03:09.010> be<00:03:09.190> able<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.489> bring<00:03:09.760> one<00:03:10.000> on<00:03:10.180> each

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
so I'll be able to bring one on each

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.830 
so I'll be able to bring one on each
side<00:03:11.519> bring<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.549> wires<00:03:12.880> up<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.480> tuck<00:03:13.660> them

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
side bring the wires up and tuck them

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.250 
side bring the wires up and tuck them
under<00:03:14.140> here<00:03:14.500> bring<00:03:15.340> them<00:03:15.489> over<00:03:15.549> there<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.260> tap

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
under here bring them over there and tap

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.229 
under here bring them over there and tap
into<00:03:18.330> my<00:03:19.330> power<00:03:19.780> plug<00:03:20.290> here<00:03:20.700> which<00:03:21.700> goes<00:03:21.970> on

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
into my power plug here which goes on

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.150 
into my power plug here which goes on
when<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.690> turn<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.140> power<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.830> they'll<00:03:24.010> be

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
when I turn the power on so they'll be

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.370 
when I turn the power on so they'll be
constantly<00:03:24.820> on<00:03:24.910> they<00:03:25.299> draw<00:03:25.540> hardly<00:03:25.930> any<00:03:26.080> power

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
constantly on they draw hardly any power

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.750 
constantly on they draw hardly any power
anyways<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.970> that's<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.900> plan<00:03:29.459> I'll<00:03:30.459> show<00:03:30.670> you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
anyways so that's the plan I'll show you

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.660 
anyways so that's the plan I'll show you
the<00:03:30.880> positive<00:03:31.360> track<00:03:31.860> posi<00:03:32.860> cops<00:03:33.130> are<00:03:33.400> really

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
the positive track posi cops are really

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.539 
the positive track posi cops are really
cool<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:35.230> don't<00:03:35.620> know<00:03:35.709> if<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:35.890> can<00:03:36.070> see<00:03:36.310> this

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
cool I don't know if you can see this

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.039 
cool I don't know if you can see this
but<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.830> basically<00:03:38.830> run<00:03:39.400> tap<00:03:40.030> right<00:03:40.360> into<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
but you basically run tap right into the

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.760 
but you basically run tap right into the
power<00:03:41.620> now<00:03:41.980> this<00:03:42.160> is<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.370> big<00:03:42.670> one

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.910 

a<00:03:45.800> smaller<00:03:46.430> one<00:03:46.720> for<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:47.960> job<00:03:48.290> but<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.710> show

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
a smaller one for this job but to show

00:03:48.920 --> 00:04:01.470 
a smaller one for this job but to show
you<00:03:48.980> how<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.880> insider<00:03:50.600> deposit<00:03:51.260> app<00:03:51.500> was

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.240 

power<00:04:02.480> wire<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.230> don't<00:04:03.410> destroy<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.010> wire

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
power wire so I don't destroy the wire

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.360 
power wire so I don't destroy the wire
and<00:04:04.580> what's<00:04:05.360> also<00:04:05.569> nice<00:04:05.900> about<00:04:05.959> this<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:06.800> this

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
and what's also nice about this is this

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.490 
and what's also nice about this is this
on<00:04:07.640> screws<00:04:08.650> with<00:04:09.650> my<00:04:09.950> wire<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:10.880> goes<00:04:10.940> inside

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
on screws with my wire that goes inside

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.340 
on screws with my wire that goes inside
okay<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.700> if<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.150> have<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.510> remove<00:04:14.840> this<00:04:15.140> in

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
okay so that if I have to remove this in

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.370 
okay so that if I have to remove this in
the<00:04:15.470> future<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:16.220> can<00:04:16.850> just<00:04:17.269> unscrew<00:04:17.690> this<00:04:18.049> from

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
the future I can just unscrew this from

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.830 
the future I can just unscrew this from
my<00:04:18.560> electrical<00:04:19.190> without<00:04:19.910> having<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.660> worry

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
my electrical without having to worry

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.900 
my electrical without having to worry
about<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.200> solder<00:04:21.500> wire<00:04:22.040> that<00:04:22.400> won't<00:04:22.669> come

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
about the solder wire that won't come

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.700 
about the solder wire that won't come
off<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.389> allow<00:04:23.600> me<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.780> take<00:04:24.050> this<00:04:24.260> off<00:04:24.500> to

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
off and allow me to take this off to

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:34.070 
off and allow me to take this off to
work<00:04:24.889> on<00:04:25.100> at<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.400> later<00:04:25.700> date

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.730 

so<00:04:34.620> that's<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.039> plan<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.900> I'll<00:04:36.900> get<00:04:37.199> back<00:04:37.229> to

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
so that's the plan and I'll get back to

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.369 
so that's the plan and I'll get back to
you<00:04:37.889> after<00:04:38.220> this<00:04:38.789> is<00:04:39.000> painted<00:04:39.539> and<00:04:39.810> we'll<00:04:40.110> film

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
you after this is painted and we'll film

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.680 
you after this is painted and we'll film
the<00:04:40.560> installation<00:04:41.220> itself<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:42.330> we'll<00:04:42.539> have

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
the installation itself and we'll have

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.240 
the installation itself and we'll have
two<00:04:42.960> running<00:04:43.319> lights<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.770> then<00:04:43.889> we<00:04:43.979> got<00:04:44.159> to

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
two running lights and then we got to

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.690 
two running lights and then we got to
figure<00:04:44.370> out<00:04:44.550> what<00:04:44.759> to<00:04:44.879> do<00:04:45.000> with<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> backwards
