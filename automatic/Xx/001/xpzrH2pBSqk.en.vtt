you know I had to send the highest

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920 
you know I had to send the highest
setting<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.489> might<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.849> better<00:02:39.150> if<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.510> borrowed

think<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.650> does<00:03:28.829> jitter<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.310> home<00:03:29.430> which

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
think this does jitter the home which

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.949 
think this does jitter the home which
who<00:03:29.760> cares<00:03:30.650> jitter<00:03:31.650> mod<00:03:31.829> honestly<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.959> just

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
who cares jitter mod honestly is just

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.240 
who cares jitter mod honestly is just
for<00:03:34.109> Shelby's<00:03:34.500> jitter<00:03:34.709> mode<00:03:34.859> once<00:03:35.129> you

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
for Shelby's jitter mode once you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.949 
for Shelby's jitter mode once you
actually<00:03:35.430> when<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:35.970> do<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.329> in<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.480> rink<00:03:36.720> game

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
actually when you do it in a rink game

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.720 
actually when you do it in a rink game
when<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.709> actually<00:03:37.799> didn't<00:03:38.129> apply<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.370> can't

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
when you actually didn't apply you can't

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.430 
when you actually didn't apply you can't
a<00:03:38.879> min<00:03:39.150> which<00:03:39.329> basically<00:03:39.629> means<00:03:39.870> you're<00:03:40.139> going

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
a min which basically means you're going

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
do a Kimbo near the end near the end I

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.439 
do a Kimbo near the end near the end I
didn't<00:04:18.579> want<00:04:18.639> to<00:04:18.729> put<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:18.940> down<00:04:19.000> because<00:04:19.180> when

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
didn't want to put it down because when

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.699 
didn't want to put it down because when
you<00:04:19.539> have<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.750> Kimmel<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.229> obviously<00:04:20.620> you

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
you have a Kimmel and obviously you

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.400 
you have a Kimmel and obviously you
can't<00:04:21.009> zoom<00:04:21.430> in<00:04:21.609> because<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.660> turbo<00:04:23.020> fire<00:04:23.199> is

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
can't zoom in because the turbo fire is

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.240 
can't zoom in because the turbo fire is
on<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.620> secondary<00:04:24.720> trigger<00:04:25.919> so<00:04:26.919> you<00:04:27.009> can't

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
on the secondary trigger so you can't

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.710 
on the secondary trigger so you can't
zoom<00:04:27.490> in<00:04:27.669> when<00:04:27.850> you're<00:04:27.970> on<00:04:28.120> like<00:04:28.300> it's<00:04:28.449> like

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
zoom in when you're on like it's like

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.320 
zoom in when you're on like it's like
this<00:04:29.080> gun<00:04:29.259> you<00:04:29.380> couldn't<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.710> zoomed<00:04:29.919> in<00:04:30.330> but

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.939 
like a rechargeable battery pack and
like<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.380> charger<00:05:30.039> like<00:05:30.720> 1529<00:05:31.720> his<00:05:31.900> $30<00:05:32.349> not

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
like the charger like 1529 his $30 not

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.760 
like the charger like 1529 his $30 not
that<00:05:33.130> much<00:05:33.310> um<00:05:33.599> so<00:05:34.599> I'm<00:05:34.840> trying<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:35.229> die<00:05:35.440> on<00:05:35.590> the

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
that much um so I'm trying to die on the

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.170 
that much um so I'm trying to die on the
speed<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.190> this<00:05:36.310> right<00:05:36.550> now<00:05:36.729> and<00:05:36.760> as<00:05:36.970> you<00:05:37.030> can

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
speed of this right now and as you can

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.000 
speed of this right now and as you can
see<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.449> that's<00:05:37.570> how<00:05:38.199> fast<00:05:38.470> as<00:05:38.620> I<00:05:38.710> think<00:05:38.919> I'm

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
see it that's how fast as I think I'm

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.490 
see it that's how fast as I think I'm
hopefully<00:05:39.610> fast<00:05:40.150> now<00:05:41.139> right<00:05:41.320> now<00:05:41.470> I'm

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
hopefully fast now right now I'm

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.990 
hopefully fast now right now I'm
borrowing<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.250> speed<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.490> little<00:05:42.639> bit<00:05:42.789> and<00:05:42.940> I

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
borrowing the speed a little bit and I

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.560 
borrowing the speed a little bit and I
can't<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.479> don't<00:05:43.780> know<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:45.610> striker<00:05:46.090> is<00:05:46.330> one<00:05:46.510> of

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
can't I don't know the striker is one of

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.930 
can't I don't know the striker is one of
those<00:05:46.630> guns<00:05:46.900> that<00:05:47.080> don't<00:05:47.500> shoot<00:05:47.800> as<00:05:47.949> fast<00:05:47.979> when

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
those guns that don't shoot as fast when

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.700 
those guns that don't shoot as fast when
they're<00:05:49.060> on<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.389> highest<00:05:49.570> speed<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.229> when

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
they're on the highest speed and when

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.950 
they're on the highest speed and when
you<00:05:50.830> Mara<00:05:51.070> makes<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.430> way<00:05:51.610> faster<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:52.750> that's

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
you Mara makes you way faster and that's

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.560 
you Mara makes you way faster and that's
what<00:05:53.080> I<00:05:53.110> was<00:05:53.199> trying<00:05:53.260> to<00:05:53.380> do<00:05:53.560> here<00:05:54.120> but<00:05:55.120> I<00:05:55.180> yes

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
what I was trying to do here but I yes

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.570 
what I was trying to do here but I yes
so<00:05:55.840> again<00:05:56.080> I<00:05:56.110> give<00:05:56.289> it<00:05:56.380> 4<00:05:56.889> out<00:05:56.919> of<00:05:57.039> 5<00:05:57.250> only

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
so again I give it 4 out of 5 only

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.310 
so again I give it 4 out of 5 only
dislike<00:05:58.120> I<00:05:58.240> don't<00:05:58.510> like<00:05:58.780> about<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.289> the

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
dislike I don't like about it is the

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.500 
dislike I don't like about it is the
battery<00:05:59.979> pack<00:06:00.190> cannot<00:06:00.760> be<00:06:00.909> a<00:06:00.940> play<00:06:01.180> in<00:06:01.240> charge

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
battery pack cannot be a play in charge

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.830 
battery pack cannot be a play in charge
pack<00:06:01.810> and<00:06:02.460> as<00:06:03.460> far<00:06:03.699> as<00:06:03.820> speed<00:06:04.030> I<00:06:04.090> would<00:06:04.389> say

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
pack and as far as speed I would say

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.719 
pack and as far as speed I would say
it's<00:06:04.930> pretty<00:06:05.050> good<00:06:05.320> I<00:06:05.590> did<00:06:06.010> not<00:06:06.159> promote<00:06:06.370> using

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
it's pretty good I did not promote using

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.110 
it's pretty good I did not promote using
magic<00:06:06.940> controls<00:06:07.210> online<00:06:08.190> um<00:06:09.190> though<00:06:09.820> I<00:06:09.849> don't

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
magic controls online um though I don't

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.700 
magic controls online um though I don't
think<00:06:10.240> any<00:06:10.360> would<00:06:10.599> care<00:06:10.810> so<00:06:11.409> I'll<00:06:11.530> see<00:06:11.560> you

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
think any would care so I'll see you

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.360 
think any would care so I'll see you
guys<00:06:11.800> next<00:06:11.889> time<00:06:12.220> Joey<00:06:12.520> comes<00:06:12.729> 94<00:06:13.150> out
