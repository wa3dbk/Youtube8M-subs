00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
i received it and i just pretty much I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.949 
i received it and i just pretty much I
just<00:01:10.280> took<00:01:10.340> my<00:01:10.429> hands<00:01:10.729> my<00:01:10.969> fingers<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.539> just

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:11.959 
just took my hands my fingers and just

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.499 
just took my hands my fingers and just
ran<00:01:12.259> them<00:01:12.469> through<00:01:12.499> all<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.789> curls<00:01:14.240> that

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
ran them through all of the curls that

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.139 
ran them through all of the curls that
were<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.259> twirl<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.740> Waverly<00:01:16.399> that<00:01:16.579> was<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:16.909> it

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
were in twirl the Waverly that was in it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.410 
were in twirl the Waverly that was in it
so<00:01:18.049> it's<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:19.039> natural<00:01:19.249> color<00:01:19.609> so<00:01:19.909> when<00:01:20.179> this<00:01:20.299> is

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
so it's a natural color so when this is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.910 
so it's a natural color so when this is
a<00:01:20.450> natural<00:01:20.689> color<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.229> usually<00:01:21.560> means<00:01:21.740> that

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
a natural color it usually means that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.209 
a natural color it usually means that
it's<00:01:22.069> a<00:01:22.459> 1<00:01:22.969> V<00:01:23.149> which<00:01:23.749> almost<00:01:24.590> certain<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.009> is

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
it's a 1 V which almost certain this is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.609 
it's a 1 V which almost certain this is
it's<00:01:25.579> not<00:01:25.759> black<00:01:26.299> I<00:01:26.479> mean<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:26.749> not<00:01:26.840> jet<00:01:27.289> black

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
it's not black I mean it's not jet black

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.069 
it's not black I mean it's not jet black
but<00:01:27.649> you<00:01:27.979> can<00:01:28.100> see<00:01:28.219> is<00:01:28.340> browner<00:01:28.729> as<00:01:29.179> I<00:01:29.899> get

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
but you can see is browner as I get

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.719 
but you can see is browner as I get
closer<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:30.770> they<00:01:30.889> let<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.189> know<00:01:31.219> that<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.609> has

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
closer so they let you know that it has

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.199 
closer so they let you know that it has
more<00:01:32.060> of<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.329> natural<00:01:33.609> unnatural<00:01:34.609> color<00:01:34.789> to<00:01:35.029> it

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
more of a natural unnatural color to it

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.230 
more of a natural unnatural color to it
and<00:01:35.359> this<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.899> a<00:01:35.929> deep<00:01:36.349> body<00:01:36.799> wave<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.999> well

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
and this is a deep body wave so well

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.120 
and this is a deep body wave so well
there<00:01:38.420> was<00:01:38.569> a<00:01:38.599> deep<00:01:38.899> body<00:01:39.139> weight<00:01:39.380> before<00:01:39.619> I

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
there was a deep body weight before I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.309 
there was a deep body weight before I
ran<00:01:41.029> my<00:01:41.179> fingers<00:01:41.240> through<00:01:41.539> all<00:01:41.840> of<00:01:41.869> these<00:01:42.079> so

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
ran my fingers through all of these so

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.779 
ran my fingers through all of these so
of<00:01:42.529> course<00:01:42.709> when<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.039> receive<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.520> she<00:01:43.639> was

of course when you receive and she was

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.849 
of course when you receive and she was
not<00:01:43.999> wearing<00:01:44.270> like<00:01:44.959> it<00:01:45.109> came<00:01:45.289> out<00:01:45.499> of<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.679> pack

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
not wearing like it came out of the pack

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.679 
not wearing like it came out of the pack
it's<00:01:46.009> just<00:01:46.130> not<00:01:46.279> a<00:01:46.310> really<00:01:46.789> attractive<00:01:46.909> look

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689

there<00:05:40.090> and<00:05:40.360> it<00:05:40.450> was<00:05:40.539> being<00:05:40.750> shuffled<00:05:40.990> around

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
there and it was being shuffled around

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.590 
there and it was being shuffled around
but<00:05:41.530> as<00:05:41.620> soon<00:05:41.770> as<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:42.039> some<00:05:42.640> water<00:05:42.910> hit<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.390> and

but as soon as I some water hit it and

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.810 
but as soon as I some water hit it and
then<00:05:44.140> I<00:05:44.229> let<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.440> air<00:05:44.680> dry<00:05:44.979> it<00:05:45.280> went<00:05:45.490> right<00:05:45.700> back

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
then I let it air dry it went right back

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.580 
then I let it air dry it went right back
to<00:05:46.000> this<00:05:46.180> they<00:05:46.360> say<00:05:46.539> it's<00:05:46.690> 24<00:05:47.200> inches<00:05:47.530> and

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
to this they say it's 24 inches and

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.469 
to this they say it's 24 inches and
because<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:48.160> has<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:48.430> texture<00:05:48.940> to<00:05:49.060> it<00:05:49.090> I<00:05:49.390> would

hair I think this would be actually very
perfect<00:06:48.310> and<00:06:48.430> it's<00:06:48.520> realistic<00:06:49.000> because<00:06:49.120> of

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
perfect and it's realistic because of

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.850 
perfect and it's realistic because of
the<00:06:49.419> length<00:06:49.629> it's<00:06:49.810> not<00:06:49.990> as<00:06:50.169> long<00:06:50.379> as<00:06:50.560> my<00:06:50.710> other

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
the length it's not as long as my other

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.140 
the length it's not as long as my other
one<00:06:51.069> so<00:06:51.400> my<00:06:51.490> other<00:06:51.580> one<00:06:51.729> was<00:06:51.819> a<00:06:51.879> little<00:06:52.060> bit

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
one so my other one was a little bit

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.119 
one so my other one was a little bit
bigger<00:06:52.360> but<00:06:52.930> I<00:06:52.960> do<00:06:53.110> like<00:06:53.409> this<00:06:53.560> one<00:06:53.770> too<00:06:53.919> as<00:06:54.099> a

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:54.129 
bigger but I do like this one too as a

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.510 
bigger but I do like this one too as a
nice<00:06:54.969> alternative<00:06:55.319> so<00:06:56.319> I'll<00:06:56.919> talk<00:06:57.189> to<00:06:57.370> y'all

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
nice alternative so I'll talk to y'all

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.330 
nice alternative so I'll talk to y'all
in<00:06:57.669> the<00:06:57.759> next<00:06:58.120> one
