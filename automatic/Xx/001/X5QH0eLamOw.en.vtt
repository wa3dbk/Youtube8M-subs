00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to grow or maybe just the nubs of roots

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.180 
to grow or maybe just the nubs of roots
then<00:01:00.239> poking<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.870> few<00:01:01.079> toothpicks<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.829> put<00:01:02.100> it

then poking a few toothpicks and put it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.270 
then poking a few toothpicks and put it
into<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> glass<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:03.030> water<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.890> good<00:01:04.890> trick<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
really get those roots going is to just

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
really get those roots going is to just
add<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> tiniest<00:01:07.530> bit<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> plant<00:01:08.280> fertilizer

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
add the tiniest bit of plant fertilizer

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.880 
add the tiniest bit of plant fertilizer
to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> water<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.049> should<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.590> nice

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
