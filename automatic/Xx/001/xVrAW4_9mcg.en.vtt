accept money orders cash and paypal I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.779 
accept money orders cash and paypal I
would<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:48.629> wary<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.530> cash<00:00:50.190> though<00:00:50.489> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
would be very wary of cash though just

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.720 
would be very wary of cash though just
because<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> lot<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.989> money<00:00:52.020> i<00:00:52.730> have

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because that is a lot of money i have

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.630 
because that is a lot of money i have
sold<00:00:54.149> large<00:00:54.809> amounts<00:00:55.289> through<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.340> cash

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
sold large amounts through like cash

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.970 
sold large amounts through like cash
through<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.910> mail<00:00:57.000> before<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.260> i<00:00:58.289> found<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
through the mail before but i found the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
through the mail before but i found the
best<00:00:59.160> way<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> split<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.719> up

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
best way to do that was to split it up

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.529 
best way to do that was to split it up
and<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:02.100> disguise<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.300> know<00:01:03.420> your

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and then disguise it so you know your

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
and then disguise it so you know your
mails<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.260> searched<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:05.610> um

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
mails not going to be searched but um

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.929 
mails not going to be searched but um

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
yeah money order or paypal is definitely

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.649 
yeah money order or paypal is definitely
the<00:01:09.090> safer<00:01:09.420> option<00:01:10.040> shipping<00:01:11.119> will<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.150> uh

the safer option shipping will be uh
yeah<00:01:13.470> shipping<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> not<00:01:14.400> necessarily

yeah shipping is not necessarily

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.390

I<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.640> least<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.659> I've

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
I know I have at least two that I've

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
I know I have at least two that I've
been<00:01:22.320> asked<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> sell<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.250> other<00:01:23.340> people

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
been asked to sell for other people

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
been asked to sell for other people
however<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.110> find<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> I'm<00:01:25.619> getting<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> lot

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
however if I find that I'm getting a lot

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.060 
however if I find that I'm getting a lot
of<00:01:26.159> good<00:01:26.400> offers<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.000> could<00:01:27.450> possibly<00:01:28.040> sell<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
of good offers I could possibly sell a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.340 
of good offers I could possibly sell a
third<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.610> well<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.780> depends<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.200> what

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
third as well so it just depends on what

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.429 
third as well so it just depends on what
we<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.720> what<00:01:33.720> sort<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> offers<00:01:34.259> come

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
we get in and what sort of offers come

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.310 
we get in and what sort of offers come
in<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.970> shipping<00:01:36.270> costs<00:01:36.780> probably<00:01:37.200> going

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
in so just shipping costs probably going

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.649 
in so just shipping costs probably going
to<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.560> maybe<00:01:38.100> around<00:01:38.340> five<00:01:38.610> bucks<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.329> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to be maybe around five bucks or so so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
to be maybe around five bucks or so so
just<00:01:39.840> keep<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.200> mind<00:01:40.470> when<00:01:40.680> making<00:01:40.829> your
