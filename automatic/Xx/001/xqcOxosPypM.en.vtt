00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:14.759
 um hi with you freaks and you know what I 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:17.039
 trap lover today i'm 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.350
 still decided to make a trap show 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.300
 she's pretty old version works 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.359
 not only 15 but also below well emerald 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.199
 replace the block with your own ie trap 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.210
 Itâ€™s possible to keep June 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.950
 to pass to us at least how to love this 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.070
 block but if we go from here to the entrance to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.460
 this tunnel we just won't get it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.980
 block and since this happens we 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.980
 cut down the block and fall low 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:58.329
 what is the basis of the trap 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:05.009
 she stands porsche 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:07.920
 we push it and put this piston 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.189
 nameplate 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.520
 For example, I put up so the signs and in 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.520
 this side 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.940
 sand is attached to them 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.180
 as soon as the signal from the piston disappears 1 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:33.060
 the piston is moving up these signs 1 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 with a sign she seemed to fall she falls 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.380
 just like that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.990
 main tablets so how to say 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.990
 attached to her they fall too 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.590
 we take rain 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.160
 on this i'm an elephant all mechanism let's 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.160
 show how it works 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.660
 What is the advantage of this mechanism? 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
 come up with many developments that is not 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:09.420
 just cut down the block but also step on 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:11.090
 cooker and buy a lot of things form 10 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.140
 blocks 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.140
 Depth need four blocks must still 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.140
 to put 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.010
 I have this depth of the world less than 4 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.890
 block when i created this world it was 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.820
 very well, not so long ago, but if 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.420
 the goods of this world even before it began 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.090
 record video recording 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.610
 oh well, you understand so tutorial 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.590
 then I have created this world and 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.660
 but I was just too lazy to create 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.730
 so I left this world but now 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.470
 somehow I do not know, so it will be our floor 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:00.140
 hence one sprinkle one block on top 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:06.810
 and example here here here for 2 blocks on we 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:10.940
 remove and put here our porsche 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.940
 on for we carry out a signal to him 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.790
 let it be like this 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.909
 not 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.599
 the signal must be and how to be through this 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.599
 the very reason 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.690
 again so it looks like this right here 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.610
 riston and here we put our i put 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.740
 Emerald diamond can be possible 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.540
 nothing at all becomes me well 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.480
 normal block because cutting it down 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.640
 anyone would have to go well, I do not know 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.830
 would have made for a map on passing in 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.860
 In principle, it is such a spoon to avoid it 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.600
 basically impossible that is it 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:54.830
 inevitable and if you are a map creator and 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.480
 put it on the one hand it's good 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.180
 that the person was extra 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.130
 stocks on the other hand this is not very 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.790
 good because if he doesn't have them then 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.710
 he will lose 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.990
 actually all that he had 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.690
 but so we put one plate but 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.740
 extended piston and from it in all 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.740
 parties themselves others 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.320
 well building walls i think i need 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.100
 you can handle it all without me 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.550
 it remains to pour our glory on this 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.380
 all the space why here should 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.530
 be two blocks lava days for example not 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.080
 one i will explain so how on top we 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.040
 put the sand if it is 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.910
 lava one in one block depth even 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.910
 now on edge 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.790
 so like this 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.830
 and example 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:01.430
 here we will have sand here and 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.430
 if i start to become sand then you just 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.860
 log in and you fall into the sand they are in 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.250
 lava 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.250
 so need 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.930
 lawu need to become like two blocks 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.500
 depth or nothing nothing 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.500
 will turn out 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.800
 and here we put 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.260
 our sand 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.080
 and 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.960
 you do not worry at all but this thing 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.280
 redstone if we put it over there 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.280
 so iron block 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.710
 an example like this 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:50.100
 so and so can run on it 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:55.400
 fakie streams can't be seen in the corridor 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:06:00.120
 quite and we cut down this block and one shaft 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.560
 all hope so this trap you 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.150
 like maybe you will 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:11.490
 use well good ear for 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:15.080
 protection griferstvo griferstvo's not 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.080
 I know you can use different purposes 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.550
