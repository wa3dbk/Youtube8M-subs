that's<00:02:11.890> really<00:02:12.849> what<00:02:13.120> builds<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.569> torque

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
that's really what builds the torque

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.040 
that's really what builds the torque
longer<00:02:15.340> intake<00:02:15.700> runner<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.270> more<00:02:16.780> torque

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
longer intake runner for more torque

cover<00:05:11.370> here<00:05:13.100> our<00:05:14.100> inner<00:05:14.340> coolers<00:05:14.700> are<00:05:14.850> sitting

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
cover here our inner coolers are sitting

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.510 
cover here our inner coolers are sitting
behind<00:05:15.390> actually<00:05:16.230> under<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.740> headlamps<00:05:17.340> but

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
behind actually under the headlamps but

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.730 
behind actually under the headlamps but
in<00:05:17.640> front<00:05:17.910> of<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.090> front<00:05:18.270> wheel<00:05:18.590> so<00:05:19.590> that

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
in front of the front wheel so that

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.560 
in front of the front wheel so that
gives<00:05:19.920> us<00:05:20.010> some<00:05:20.070> vacuum<00:05:20.790> on<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.000> backside<00:05:21.540> of

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
gives us some vacuum on the backside of

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.110 
gives us some vacuum on the backside of
the<00:05:22.070> intercooler<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.220> then<00:05:23.430> we<00:05:23.520> get<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:23.820> food

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
the intercooler and then we get the food

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.790 
the intercooler and then we get the food
get<00:05:24.390> the<00:05:24.480> pressure<00:05:24.780> off<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.200> road<00:05:25.410> here

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
get the pressure off the road here

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.740 
get the pressure off the road here
through<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.640> intercooler<00:05:27.030> so<00:05:27.330> we<00:05:27.420> get<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.570> lot

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
through the intercooler so we get a lot

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.120 
through the intercooler so we get a lot
of<00:05:27.870> ambient<00:05:28.260> air<00:05:28.350> flow<00:05:28.560> through<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:28.860> charge

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
of ambient air flow through the charge

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.910 
of ambient air flow through the charge
cooler<00:05:30.920> those<00:05:31.920> pipes<00:05:32.280> are<00:05:32.520> then<00:05:32.700> routed

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
cooler those pipes are then routed

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.180 
cooler those pipes are then routed
through<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.040> inner<00:05:35.310> fender<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:37.620> it's<00:05:37.890> a<00:05:37.980> very

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
through the inner fender and it's a very

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.360 
through the inner fender and it's a very
simple<00:05:38.700> modification<00:05:40.790> on<00:05:41.790> either<00:05:42.060> side<00:05:42.450> and

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
simple modification on either side and

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.100 
simple modification on either side and
then<00:05:44.370> back<00:05:44.669> around<00:05:44.940> to<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.600> back<00:05:45.780> of<00:05:46.020> the

air cleaner was we have our plenum
joiner<00:05:50.940> box<00:05:51.410> and<00:05:52.410> then<00:05:53.340> down<00:05:53.610> into<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:53.970> mass

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
joiner box and then down into the mass

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.610 
joiner box and then down into the mass
airflow<00:05:54.450> so<00:05:55.080> we've<00:05:55.290> retained<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.890> lot<00:05:56.040> of<00:05:56.220> the

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
airflow so we've retained a lot of the

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.990 
airflow so we've retained a lot of the
the<00:05:58.620> nice<00:05:58.800> aesthetic<00:05:59.160> appeal<00:05:59.640> that<00:05:59.850> the

the nice aesthetic appeal that the

engine bay had from the factory
obviously<00:06:04.860> doesn't<00:06:05.190> look<00:06:05.370> hacked<00:06:05.640> up<00:06:05.880> or

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
obviously doesn't look hacked up or

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.890 
obviously doesn't look hacked up or
halfway<00:06:06.930> thought<00:06:07.440> through<00:06:08.090> it's<00:06:09.090> just<00:06:09.180> a<00:06:09.630> lot

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
halfway thought through it's just a lot

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.610 
silver that's called a Porsche silver
and<00:07:19.800> that's<00:07:19.889> actually<00:07:20.460> matches<00:07:21.180> the

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.620 
and that's actually matches the

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.260 
and that's actually matches the
forced-induction<00:07:22.699> plumbing<00:07:23.699> as<00:07:23.849> well<00:07:24.060> to

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 
forced-induction plumbing as well to

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.809 
forced-induction plumbing as well to
steel<00:07:24.509> piping<00:07:27.020> so<00:07:28.020> we<00:07:28.439> will<00:07:28.620> be<00:07:28.830> taking<00:07:29.400> the

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 
steel piping so we will be taking the

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:35.679 
steel piping so we will be taking the
black<00:07:30.300> car<00:07:30.659> from<00:07:32.900> looking<00:07:33.900> as<00:07:34.080> it<00:07:34.229> does<00:07:34.409> there

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:35.689 
black car from looking as it does there

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:43.310 
black car from looking as it does there
and<00:07:38.240> converting<00:07:39.240> it<00:07:39.360> to<00:07:39.589> look<00:07:40.589> just<00:07:40.620> like<00:07:41.069> this
