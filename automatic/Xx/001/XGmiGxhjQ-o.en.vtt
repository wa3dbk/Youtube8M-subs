 talk to the people at the table and let's go 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.759
 to choose the type of customer Maria River 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.440
 January when you access the link from many 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.320
 Wonderful machine that we are going to see 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.969

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.920
 chose and you can do the same 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.500
 However, the game needs to access the link 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.090
 of the ship that is in the description 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.160
 choose the piece by play the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.289

 source for the configuration to abandon 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.090
 sonic 750 was to modulate this source and 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.400
 quietly holds the configuration 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.900
