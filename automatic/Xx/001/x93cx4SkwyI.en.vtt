00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
this realm is latency you know how is it

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.979 
this realm is latency you know how is it
handled<00:03:17.879> how<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.239> eliminated<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.870> guys

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989

sound to tape but because it works with
the<00:03:29.489> pod<00:03:29.639> farm<00:03:29.790> plug-in<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.359> have<00:03:30.510> our<00:03:30.780> you

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
the pod farm plug-in you have our you

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.650 
the pod farm plug-in you have our you
know<00:03:31.260> tone<00:03:31.709> direct<00:03:32.040> zero<00:03:32.790> latency<00:03:33.000> monitoring

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
know tone direct zero latency monitoring

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.750 
know tone direct zero latency monitoring
so<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:33.989> can<00:03:34.139> fire<00:03:34.739> up<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:35.069> pod<00:03:35.519> farm
