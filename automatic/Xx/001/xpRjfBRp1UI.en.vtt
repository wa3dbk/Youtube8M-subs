00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
struggling with some very bad decisions
early<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.250> think<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.609> biggest<00:00:17.820> thing<00:00:17.970> that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
early on I think the biggest thing that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.810 
early on I think the biggest thing that
snowball<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.320> Lane<00:00:19.500> has<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.400> obviously

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
snowball that Lane has to be obviously

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.730 
snowball that Lane has to be obviously
the<00:00:20.939> level<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.330> lease<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.900> gank<00:00:22.140> from<00:00:22.320> insect

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the level to lease and gank from insect

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.529 
the level to lease and gank from insect
now<00:00:22.890> what<00:00:23.369> happened<00:00:23.760> was<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.939> lane<00:00:24.269> swap

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
now what happened was a lane swap

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.450 
now what happened was a lane swap
scenario<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> bot<00:00:25.830> lanes<00:00:26.099> ended

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
scenario that with the bot lanes ended

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
scenario that with the bot lanes ended
up<00:00:26.550> top<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.630> junglers<00:00:28.199> ended<00:00:28.619> up

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
up top but the junglers ended up

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.859 
up top but the junglers ended up
splitting<00:00:28.980> size<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> map<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.060> TPA<00:00:30.570> fail

don't<00:04:33.880> let<00:04:34.060> cause<00:04:34.270> it's<00:04:34.389> very<00:04:34.539> much<00:04:34.660> in

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
don't let cause it's very much in

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.809 
don't let cause it's very much in
personally<00:04:35.470> when<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:35.889> watch<00:04:36.130> these<00:04:36.370> games<00:04:36.610> he

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
personally when I watch these games he

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.309 
personally when I watch these games he
doesn't<00:04:37.060> seem<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.479> do<00:04:37.660> very<00:04:37.690> much<00:04:38.050> whereas

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
doesn't seem to do very much whereas

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.749 
doesn't seem to do very much whereas
Lisa<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.919> all<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.069> other<00:04:39.220> early<00:04:39.610> game

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
Lisa and all the other early game

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.120 
Lisa and all the other early game
junglers<00:04:40.180> seem<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.930> set<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.380> game's<00:04:41.620> up<00:04:41.889> to

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
junglers seem to set the game's up to

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.770 
junglers seem to set the game's up to
let<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.430> game<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:42.759> be<00:04:42.940> one<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.360> think<00:04:43.630> another

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
let the game just be one I think another

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.689 
let the game just be one I think another
important<00:04:44.319> thing<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:44.530> royal<00:04:45.099> can<00:04:45.280> take<00:04:45.430> away

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
important thing that royal can take away

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.540 
important thing that royal can take away
from<00:04:46.060> these<00:04:46.300> games<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.590> mid<00:04:47.949> lane<00:04:48.220> pick

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
from these games is the mid lane pick

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.689 
from these games is the mid lane pick
because<00:04:49.180> against<00:04:50.110> TSM<00:04:50.259> they<00:04:50.889> picked<00:04:51.190> fizz<00:04:51.460> and

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
because against TSM they picked fizz and

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.700 
because against TSM they picked fizz and
that<00:04:51.880> did<00:04:52.060> not<00:04:52.180> go<00:04:52.389> well<00:04:52.419> this<00:04:53.050> time<00:04:53.289> around<00:04:53.440> we

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
that did not go well this time around we

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.010 
that did not go well this time around we
saw<00:04:53.860> them<00:04:54.009> take<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.280> Oriana<00:04:54.759> against<00:04:55.360> fizz<00:04:55.569> so

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
saw them take the Oriana against fizz so

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.870 
saw them take the Oriana against fizz so
they<00:04:56.110> took<00:04:56.259> the<00:04:56.380> mirror<00:04:56.650> match<00:04:56.889> and<00:04:57.220> if<00:04:57.610> they

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
they took the mirror match and if they

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.089 
they took the mirror match and if they
go<00:04:58.000> for<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.270> more<00:04:58.479> control<00:04:58.990> oriented<00:04:59.680> mid<00:04:59.889> lane

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
go for a more control oriented mid lane

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.360 
go for a more control oriented mid lane
against<00:05:00.699> TSM<00:05:00.849> if<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.710> rematch<00:05:02.710> is<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:03.039> happen

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
against TSM if the rematch is to happen

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.189 
against TSM if the rematch is to happen
I<00:05:03.520> think<00:05:03.970> they'll<00:05:04.150> they'll<00:05:04.570> look<00:05:04.690> better<00:05:04.870> it's

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
I think they'll they'll look better it's

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.960 
I think they'll they'll look better it's
good<00:05:05.410> final<00:05:05.680> social<00:05:05.919> Monty<00:05:06.160> yeah<00:05:06.430> I'm<00:05:06.669> still

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.370 
good final social Monty yeah I'm still
concerned<00:05:07.300> about<00:05:07.449> starborn<00:05:07.990> because<00:05:08.139> we<00:05:08.229> saw

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
concerned about starborn because we saw

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.409 
concerned about starborn because we saw
another<00:05:08.680> another<00:05:09.130> Nidalee<00:05:09.669> band<00:05:09.910> coming<00:05:10.180> into

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
another another Nidalee band coming into

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.689 
another another Nidalee band coming into
that<00:05:10.570> game<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:11.020> TPA<00:05:11.349> is<00:05:11.440> not<00:05:11.770> an<00:05:12.009> Italy<00:05:12.460> team

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
that game and TPA is not an Italy team

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.300 
that game and TPA is not an Italy team
so<00:05:12.940> I<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.180> have<00:05:13.509> some<00:05:13.690> questions<00:05:14.259> about<00:05:14.410> whether

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
so I I have some questions about whether

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.189 
so I I have some questions about whether
or<00:05:15.460> not<00:05:15.699> this<00:05:15.910> team<00:05:16.150> does<00:05:16.360> its<00:05:16.539> homework<00:05:16.960> and

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
or not this team does its homework and

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.350 
or not this team does its homework and
if<00:05:17.349> we<00:05:17.470> roll<00:05:17.800> back<00:05:18.099> to<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.400> DSM<00:05:18.789> games<00:05:19.030> weldon

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
if we roll back to the DSM games weldon

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.810 
if we roll back to the DSM games weldon
Italy<00:05:19.630> ban<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:19.990> then<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.169> elise<00:05:20.470> ban<00:05:20.820> not

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
Italy ban and then the elise ban not

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.339 
Italy ban and then the elise ban not
probably<00:05:22.180> necessary<00:05:22.389> but<00:05:22.930> I<00:05:23.080> don't<00:05:23.259> think

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
probably necessary but I don't think

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.990 
probably necessary but I don't think
we're<00:05:23.500> going<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.680> see<00:05:23.710> dyrus<00:05:24.310> on<00:05:24.460> rumble<00:05:24.820> for

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
we're going to see dyrus on rumble for

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.370 
we're going to see dyrus on rumble for
the<00:05:25.060> rest<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:25.449> tournament<00:05:25.840> I<00:05:26.080> think<00:05:26.259> that

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
the rest of this tournament I think that

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.950 
the rest of this tournament I think that
is<00:05:26.500> incredibly<00:05:26.949> bad<00:05:27.190> move<00:05:27.460> but<00:05:27.699> if<00:05:27.940> star<00:05:28.659> horn

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
is incredibly bad move but if star horn

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.110 
is incredibly bad move but if star horn
can<00:05:29.199> give<00:05:29.680> their<00:05:29.889> draft<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.430> little<00:05:30.669> more<00:05:30.880> love

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
can give their draft a little more love

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.370 
can give their draft a little more love
I<00:05:31.419> think<00:05:31.720> they<00:05:31.810> should<00:05:31.990> be<00:05:32.110> in<00:05:32.199> good<00:05:32.229> shape

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
I think they should be in good shape

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.589 
I think they should be in good shape
we'll<00:05:32.650> find<00:05:32.860> out<00:05:32.979> SK<00:05:33.430> take<00:05:33.639> on<00:05:33.789> TSM<00:05:34.240> later<00:05:34.449> in

we'll find out SK take on TSM later in

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:35.820 
we'll find out SK take on TSM later in
