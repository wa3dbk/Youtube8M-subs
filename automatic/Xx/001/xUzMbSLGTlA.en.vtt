00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi people i show you today like me 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.140
 made this blue cake with pulling 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.090
 have and homemade biscuit soil 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.559
 is very simple has super delicious 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.450
 tasted and it also pretty easy 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.610
 when it is so warm 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 what you have to do first 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.240
 is three egg whites open her let 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.570
 now the whole time please the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.220
 mixer and then add two tablespoons 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:31.369
 Add water then come three yolks 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.770
 then it looks like that 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.110
 then come 120 grams of sugar and 1 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300
 add vanilla sugar in the whole package 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.190
 Finally , 120 grams honor and one 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.600
 half packet of baking powder that led 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.070
 but not so long, please 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.390
 because otherwise the mass goes back in so 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.260
 together we want it so 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 have fluffy 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.480
 that's it, that's the dough 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 I would now my ring shape 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.120
 just melted with a little bit 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.219
 butter i had in the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.910
 Microwave and brush now easy 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.100
 be alone 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.199
 I'm both down there and as well 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.449
 on the edge just everywhere where the dough 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.100
 also comes after and now follows 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 my favorite scene of the dough again 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
 is poured around and then sees 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.780
 again as beautiful as that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.030
 flows yes I like that the whole pack 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.750
 Then you heat up at 180 degrees 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.159
 for about 20 minutes in the oven 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.840
 then just say the chopsticks sample and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.000
 if the stick comes out clean 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.340
 the part is good and looks best like this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 I like the floor here so about 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.420
 Allow to cool for ten minutes and then 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.310
 taken out of shape and placed on a grid 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.259
 done with the help of his 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.090
 I have pies saviors on the grid 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.860
 then let the floor cool down completely 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.750
 and in the meantime I already have 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.280
 I made my pudding 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.960
 now just taken a packet 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.399
 for time reasons, however, you can 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.290
 Of course, make your own pudding 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.270
 if you would like to know me 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.710
 pudding maker then just tell me that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.299
 I do because even a video to 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 Here you see here is in pudding 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.840
 just after packing instruction I have 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.000
 you done now and I lead but 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.549
 keep going so he does not get so tight 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
 but cools down and in anyway 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.900
 In the meantime, I also cut 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.040
 ever 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.299
 I 've cut too much 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.950
 I somehow thought so 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.810
 need more I do not need that 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.429
 many and always in between I have 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.200
 then it does not touch anyone 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.520
 skin forms and does not become too firm 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.440
 I have my bottom back in now 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.730
 packed this ring shape and you see there 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.530
 is a country that is actually 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.270
 very good because then there's the same 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.010
 pudding flow in as you see guilty 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.300
 the now just so spread that already 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.489
 a little so after that 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.750
 have easier with the elapse and 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.550
 then just let it go again 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.800
 complete with a flat spoon and 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.209
 pack everything nicely in the cracks 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.400
 so that everything runs in and nothing 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.870
 air holes fair the whole bowl I 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.300
 then again, really no 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.650
 Air holes are more there and then you can 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.049
 I already prove I have now 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.569
 just put my little pieces all around 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.310
 from the plauer and have that up to 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.230
 Center continues and then sees 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.209
 In the end, I'll have it 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.390
 just packed in the fridge for 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.000
 So about 3 hours and then it is 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.860
 nice by chilled and it is best 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.209
 of course if it is in the night 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.790
 but you do not have to be a fridge 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.440
 but then it will stop 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.170
 times right yes and so then the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.609
 cake finished off really got it right 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.980
 tasted good but I'm curious 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.780
 As it tastes I am normal pudding 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.060
 So use homemade because you 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.220
 already noticed that the finished pudding was 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.320
 I think so I'm happy if you have it 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.820
 after power and as always more pictures 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.280

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.930

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.810
