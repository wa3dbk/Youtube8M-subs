00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
get a little virtual keyboard for thumb

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.459 
get a little virtual keyboard for thumb
typing<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.149> which<00:00:45.360> i<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.780> this

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
typing in here which i really like this

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.950 
typing in here which i really like this
way<00:00:46.760> let's<00:00:47.760> talk<00:00:47.940> about<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.300> specs<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.750> little

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
way let's talk about the specs a little

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.889 
way let's talk about the specs a little
bit<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.260> an<00:00:49.350> intel<00:00:49.590> atom<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:50.789> 520<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.750> it's

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
bit it's an intel atom that 520 so it's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.660 
bit it's an intel atom that 520 so it's
running<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.379> point<00:00:52.500> three<00:00:52.590> gigahertz<00:00:52.949> you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
running at one point three gigahertz you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090 
running at one point three gigahertz you
can<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> 32<00:00:54.960> gigabyte<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.620> 64

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
can get with a 32 gigabyte and 64

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.000 
can get with a 32 gigabyte and 64
gigabyte<00:00:56.520> SSD<00:00:56.870> one<00:00:57.870> gigabyte<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.320> ram<00:00:58.559> it's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
gigabyte SSD one gigabyte of ram it's

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.720 
gigabyte SSD one gigabyte of ram it's
running<00:00:59.640> windows<00:00:59.879> 7<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.500> Philip<00:01:01.500> says<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.039> can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
running windows 7 and Philip says it can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.320 
running windows 7 and Philip says it can
run<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.359> 10<00:01:03.989> hours<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> let's<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> quick

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
run up to 10 hours so let's take a quick

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.300 
run up to 10 hours so let's take a quick
look<00:01:06.360> around<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.350> system<00:01:07.590> itself<00:01:08.689> by<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> way

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
look around the system itself by the way

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.440 
look around the system itself by the way
10.1<00:01:11.310> inch

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
10.1 inch

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.109 
10.1 inch
and<00:01:12.770> HD<00:01:13.770> display<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.939> 1366<00:01:15.750> x<00:01:16.200> 768<00:01:17.119> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and HD display so this is 1366 x 768 so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.490 
and HD display so this is 1366 x 768 so
there's<00:01:18.329> something<00:01:18.539> that<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.229> like

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
there's something that I really like

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
there's something that I really like
when<00:01:19.649> it<00:01:19.740> comes<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.240> surfing<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> web<00:01:21.509> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
when it comes to surfing the web so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.209 
when it comes to surfing the web so
let's<00:01:22.259> take<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.469> quick<00:01:22.619> look<00:01:22.770> around<00:01:22.890> the

we have pretty small trackpad it's only
a<00:02:12.780> single<00:02:12.989> mouse<00:02:13.260> button<00:02:13.709> but<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:14.430> in

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060

a single mouse button but I think in
terms<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.900> build<00:02:16.140> quality<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> really

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
terms of build quality this is a really

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.900 
terms of build quality this is a really
really<00:02:18.060> cool<00:02:18.150> device<00:02:18.600> 1.3<00:02:19.489> megapixel<00:02:20.489> camera
