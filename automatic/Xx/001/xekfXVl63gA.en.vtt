and gals is it's currently being dubbed

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.229 
and gals is it's currently being dubbed
minecraft<00:00:32.579> 2d<00:00:33.300> which<00:00:33.660> may<00:00:34.200> or<00:00:34.230> may<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:35.239> be

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
minecraft 2d which may or may not be

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.619 
minecraft 2d which may or may not be
entirely<00:00:36.750> accurate<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.700> shares<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.329> lot<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
entirely accurate but it shares a lot of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.810 
entirely accurate but it shares a lot of
elements<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:40.050> minecraft<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.980> i<00:00:41.250> figured

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
elements with minecraft so i figured

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it's worth a look i stumbled onto it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.290 
it's worth a look i stumbled onto it
maybe<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.390> week<00:00:45.660> ago<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.649> I've<00:00:46.800> been
