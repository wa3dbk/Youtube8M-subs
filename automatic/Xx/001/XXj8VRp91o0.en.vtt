more like the smell of it isn't bad

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.289 
more like the smell of it isn't bad

either it just smells like shampoo

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.910 
either it just smells like shampoo

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
obviously because it's dry shampoo kind

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.009 
obviously because it's dry shampoo kind
of<00:03:03.040> smells<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.819> little<00:03:04.420> bit<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.690> hairspray

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
at least like once a month just because

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.080

too dry but it's not too oily and so I

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.520 
too dry but it's not too oily and so I
got<00:06:25.729> this<00:06:26.030> to<00:06:26.240> try<00:06:26.509> it<00:06:26.570> out<00:06:26.840> because<00:06:27.139> it<00:06:27.500> was

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
the wintertime and I was like my skin's

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.980 
the wintertime and I was like my skin's
really<00:06:30.919> dry<00:06:31.280> I<00:06:31.310> need<00:06:31.639> some<00:06:31.850> sort<00:06:32.150> of<00:06:32.270> hydration

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990

lotion<00:06:35.840> on<00:06:35.960> my<00:06:36.080> skin<00:06:36.350> just<00:06:36.380> because<00:06:36.710> it<00:06:37.039> feels

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
lotion on my skin just because it feels

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.140

really oily and gross and I actually do
like<00:06:41.419> it<00:06:41.479> because<00:06:41.930> it<00:06:42.910> it<00:06:43.910> doesn't<00:06:44.870> hydrate<00:06:45.410> my

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
like it because it it doesn't hydrate my

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.140 
skin to where I'm super oily but it
gives<00:06:48.530> it<00:06:48.710> some<00:06:48.919> hydration<00:06:49.580> to<00:06:49.820> where<00:06:49.940> I'm<00:06:50.030> not

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.159 
gives it some hydration to where I'm not
