okay<00:00:02.520> guys<00:00:03.680> the<00:00:05.390> CD<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.629> CDI<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.049> installed

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
okay guys the CD on you CDI is installed

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.240 
okay guys the CD on you CDI is installed
on<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.090> big<00:00:09.210> connector<00:00:09.570> here<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:10.349> goes<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
on the big connector here it goes the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.370 
on the big connector here it goes the
clip<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.790> clip<00:00:12.059> they<00:00:12.750> don't<00:00:12.900> actually<00:00:13.049> clip

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
clip to clip they don't actually clip

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.560 
clip to clip they don't actually clip
into<00:00:13.620> each<00:00:13.769> other<00:00:13.980> but<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.420> goes

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
into each other but that is how it goes

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.760 
into each other but that is how it goes
we<00:00:16.020> saw<00:00:16.170> my<00:00:16.320> bike<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:18.449> orange<00:00:18.779> wire<00:00:18.960> goes<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
we saw my bike the orange wire goes to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.170 
we saw my bike the orange wire goes to
the<00:00:19.980> pink<00:00:20.430> wire<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> bike<00:00:21.260> white<00:00:22.260> wire

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
the pink wire on the bike white wire

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.460 
the pink wire on the bike white wire
goes<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.480> yellow<00:00:24.630> wire<00:00:24.869> which<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
goes to the yellow wire which is the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
goes to the yellow wire which is the
left<00:00:25.650> coil<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:26.490> sorry<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> pink<00:00:27.000> wire<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
left coil I'm sorry the pink wire is the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.620 
left coil I'm sorry the pink wire is the
right<00:00:27.570> coil<00:00:28.369> right<00:00:29.369> relative<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.359> when<00:00:30.510> you're

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
right coil right relative to when you're

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.930 
right coil right relative to when you're
riding<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> bike<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.740> green<00:00:31.949> wire<00:00:32.130> goes<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
riding the bike the green wire goes to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.130 
riding the bike the green wire goes to
the<00:00:33.149> black<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.450> white<00:00:33.570> wire<00:00:33.750> which<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the black and white wire which is the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
the black and white wire which is the
ignition<00:00:34.500> cutoff<00:00:34.680> switch<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.280> then<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.790> red

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
ignition cutoff switch and then the red

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
ignition cutoff switch and then the red
wire<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> clip<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:39.360> another<00:00:40.230> red<00:00:40.530> wire

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
wire here has a clip to another red wire

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.590 
wire here has a clip to another red wire
that<00:00:40.890> goes<00:00:40.950> they've<00:00:41.399> got<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> splicer<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.239> on

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that goes they've got a splicer here on

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450 
that goes they've got a splicer here on
most<00:00:43.230> bikes<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.649> will<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> black<00:00:44.190> wire

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
most bikes this will be a black wire

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.369 
most bikes this will be a black wire
coming<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> ignition<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
coming from the ignition it's the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.479 
coming from the ignition it's the
ignition<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.770> off<00:00:46.980> from<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.910> key<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:49.680> wire

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
ignition on off from the key but my wire

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.040 
ignition on off from the key but my wire
has<00:00:50.789> been<00:00:50.940> changed<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.360> some<00:00:51.390> point<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> red

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
has been changed at some point to a red

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
has been changed at some point to a red
wire<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> anyway<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> moment<00:00:54.539> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
wire so anyway here is the moment of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.910 
wire so anyway here is the moment of
truth<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:56.399> engine<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.620> cold<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.800> it's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
truth the engine is not cold but it's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:21.110 
truth the engine is not cold but it's
also<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> temperature<00:01:00.000> yet

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.560 

see<00:01:22.120> if<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.330> ignition<00:01:22.720> kill<00:01:23.710> switch<00:01:23.890> works

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
see if the ignition kill switch works

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.480 
see if the ignition kill switch works
yep<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:28.710> that's<00:01:29.710> pretty<00:01:29.980> much<00:01:30.070> it

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
yep so that's pretty much it

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.010 
yep so that's pretty much it
I<00:01:30.520> would<00:01:30.820> highly<00:01:31.060> recommend<00:01:31.090> when<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.870> guys

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
I would highly recommend when you guys

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.190 
I would highly recommend when you guys
get<00:01:32.200> your<00:01:32.260> CDI<00:01:33.130> in<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.370> mail<00:01:33.520> use<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.660> CD<00:01:34.990> that

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
get your CDI in the mail use the CD that

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.450 
get your CDI in the mail use the CD that
comes<00:01:35.350> with<00:01:35.620> it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
comes with it

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.930 
comes with it
there<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.470> wiring<00:01:38.470> diagram<00:01:38.920> for<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.130> CX<00:01:39.430> 500

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
there is a wiring diagram for the CX 500

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.160 
there is a wiring diagram for the CX 500
that<00:01:40.060> they<00:01:40.180> put<00:01:40.390> in<00:01:40.510> there<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.870> word

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
that they put in there is a word

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.969 
that they put in there is a word
document<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:42.220> has<00:01:42.400> you<00:01:42.880> know<00:01:42.910> you<00:01:43.810> know

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
document and it has you know you know

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.980 
document and it has you know you know
orange<00:01:44.979> wire<00:01:45.160> on<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.880> ignition<00:01:46.090> tech<00:01:46.420> goes<00:01:46.750> to

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
orange wire on the ignition tech goes to

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.990 
orange wire on the ignition tech goes to
the<00:01:47.080> pink<00:01:47.229> wire<00:01:47.380> on<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.650> bike<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:47.979> etc<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:48.970> I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
the pink wire on the bike and etc so I

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.499 
the pink wire on the bike and etc so I
definitely<00:01:49.360> check<00:01:49.720> that<00:01:49.750> out<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:51.330> that's<00:01:52.330> it

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
definitely check that out and that's it

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.359 
definitely check that out and that's it
as<00:01:53.140> soon<00:01:53.259> as<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:53.440> go<00:01:53.560> take<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.740> for<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> ride<00:01:54.100> I

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
as soon as I go take it for a ride I

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.820 
as soon as I go take it for a ride I
will<00:01:55.090> let<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.360> know<00:01:55.420> one<00:01:55.900> other<00:01:55.990> thing<00:01:56.080> it's<00:01:56.740> a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
will let you know one other thing it's a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.310 
will let you know one other thing it's a
serial<00:01:57.430> port<00:01:57.610> here<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.509> can<00:01:58.930> communicate

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
serial port here so you can communicate

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.340 
serial port here so you can communicate
to<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.850> CDI<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.240> can<00:02:01.570> change<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.869> rev<00:02:02.020> limit

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
to the CDI you can change the rev limit

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.270 
to the CDI you can change the rev limit
I<00:02:02.500> think<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.770> can<00:02:02.860> change<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> cognition

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
I think you can change the cognition

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.210 
I think you can change the cognition
curves<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.790> stuff<00:02:03.970> too<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.710> am<00:02:05.710> assuming<00:02:05.920> it's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
curves and stuff too I am assuming it's

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.310 
curves and stuff too I am assuming it's
been<00:02:06.340> loaded<00:02:06.580> with<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.759> CX<00:02:07.030> 500<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:08.290> know

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
been loaded with the CX 500 you know

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.070 
been loaded with the CX 500 you know
normal<00:02:08.950> curve<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.459> don't<00:02:10.030> really<00:02:10.179> know<00:02:10.390> but<00:02:10.959> I'm

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
normal curve I don't really know but I'm

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.850 
normal curve I don't really know but I'm
going<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.230> give<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.470> whirl<00:02:11.530> here<00:02:11.739> in<00:02:11.800> a

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
going to give it a whirl here in a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.990 
going to give it a whirl here in a
little<00:02:11.950> bit<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.400> will<00:02:12.550> come<00:02:12.670> back<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:12.910> let

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
little bit and I will come back and let

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.410 
little bit and I will come back and let
you<00:02:13.090> know<00:02:13.209> see<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.260> guys
