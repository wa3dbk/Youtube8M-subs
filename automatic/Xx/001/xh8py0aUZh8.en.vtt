00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
unit this is the end-all result which

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.720 
unit this is the end-all result which
when<00:02:47.260> you're<00:02:47.410> flying<00:02:47.819> fpv<00:02:48.819> is<00:02:50.730> unbelievable

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
when you're flying fpv is unbelievable

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.199 
when you're flying fpv is unbelievable
and<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:53.019> valuable<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:54.670> adds<00:02:54.940> another

and basically it communicates with the
camera<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.959> pan/tilt<00:03:05.709> system<00:03:06.250> you're

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
camera and the pan/tilt system you're

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.410 
camera and the pan/tilt system you're
able<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.540> basically<00:03:07.989> just<00:03:08.970> move<00:03:09.970> your<00:03:10.180> head
