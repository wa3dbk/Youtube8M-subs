00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
shape of a revlon nail lacquer which I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.520 
shape of a revlon nail lacquer which I

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
thought was kind of cool because i don't

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.260

think<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.770> shape<00:01:40.100> has<00:01:40.310> changed<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:40.910> a<00:01:41.030> very

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
think that shape has changed in a very

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.860 
think that shape has changed in a very
long<00:01:41.510> time<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.530> looks<00:01:42.890> very<00:01:43.510> retro<00:01:44.510> very

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
long time and it looks very retro very

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.050 
long time and it looks very retro very
antique<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.530> me<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.860> color<00:01:46.040> itself<00:01:46.220> is<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.700> pale

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
antique to me the color itself is a pale

blush it has the same sort of candy

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.670 
blush it has the same sort of candy
pinkness<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:35.010> it's<00:05:35.220> very<00:05:36.410> friendly<00:05:37.410> for

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680
