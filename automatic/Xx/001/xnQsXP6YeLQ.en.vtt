00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.170
 hello welcome back today I want to show you 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.300
 how to continue the body of ours 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.400
 placemat if we are making it 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.189
 as a Christmas gift it is also beautiful 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.960
 make it red from as a centerpiece 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.210
 we started in the first phase a 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.220
 create what is the perforated part 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.770
 which will allow us once the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.950
 our rectangle to have these tips 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.680
 which are very particular 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.780
 now we will start doing what is 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.700
 part of stockinette stitch with piping 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.860
 only side 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.940
 then we in the first sentence after 2 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.210
 string irons 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.240
 we made a thrown two 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.420
 together with straight for seven times 8 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.550
 central links straight and then a pass 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.040
 go straight with the thrown seven times 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.110
 up to the last two meshes attached which 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.930
 they create the border and the return iron 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.810
 he was worked on straight to create this 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.549
 we must now move 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.740
 start doing what is the part 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.229
 of the stockinette body and only one 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.930
 small border for which we work 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.000
 2 straight knit we make a thrown and 2 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.480
 knit together with straight but we repeat it 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.790
 only twice and after doing this 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.220
 we work right up to the last 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.930
 six jerseys 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.690
 this will allow us to create a 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.210
 body of our placemat more 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.729
 tight while those who are all 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.530
 throw in the initial burgundy and then 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.560
 we will see how to close in the last phase 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.770
 our placemat create those 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.450
 tips that are very particular 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.210
 originating and if you imagine it too 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.430
 with a vase of flowers as a centerpiece 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.640
 Christmas is very beautiful now I am 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.250
 arrived working straight up almost 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.450
 to the last six jerseys 24 if any 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.950
 work three more here what I do 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.590
 I make my pass passes completely 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:11.540
 then 12 and I work together then I do 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:15.620
 YO it still faces one and then 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.410
 I make a thrown and work the last two 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.500
 jerseys straight now I want to work 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.300
 6 knit straight then all the knits a 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.190
 back to the last 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:36.770
 the six jerseys that I will work on again at 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:39.650
 straight then 123456 that what the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.100
 our side edge and then we start a 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.770
 work backwards for the part 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.340
 center of our knit placemat 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.580
 shaved and we do this until 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.330
 last six jerseys where again 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.610
 we will work on straight because this there 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.810
 allows to make this movement of the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.680
 placemat I'll show you now 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.230
 right on the placemat you see here 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.750
 Initial openwork part widens the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.600
 my toes while I work the part 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.590
 central perforated except the border 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.380
 which I created with my two repetitions 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.110
 see who does this movement and then 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.960
 we are then ready for the last phase that it is 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.850
 that of to achieve and continue the 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.430
 our placemat with the last part 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.130
 perforated to create our symmetry 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.900
 and then to close our shirts and 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.450
 understand how to block ours 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.000
 placemat now I take that again 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.550
 that my job because I have to arrive 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.180
 you remember the last six jerseys that 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:48.050
 I'll have to do straight and I owe this 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.000
 repeat for fifteen more times 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.450
 here we are at our last six 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.349
 jerseys that I work on straight and continue 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.349
 good job
