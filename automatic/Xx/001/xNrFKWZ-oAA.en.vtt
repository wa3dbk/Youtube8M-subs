00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
Sumeria but once it happened I felt so

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.750 
Sumeria but once it happened I felt so
empty<00:06:54.990> and<00:06:56.280> that<00:06:57.280> was<00:06:57.490> when<00:06:57.700> I<00:06:57.730> realized<00:06:58.600> I

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
empty and that was when I realized I

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:10.279
