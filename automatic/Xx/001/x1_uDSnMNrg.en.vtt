00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.260 
into a lot 15 is too and for this
program<00:02:15.780> but<00:02:16.050> whatever<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:17.430> need<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.090> for

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
program but whatever I need to do for

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.650 
program but whatever I need to do for
this<00:02:18.330> program

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
this program

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.210 
this program
a<00:02:20.610> lot<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.640> guys<00:02:21.880> go<00:02:22.630> see<00:02:22.840> what<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.950> know<00:02:24.040> it's

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
a lot of guys go see what you know it's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.330 
a lot of guys go see what you know it's
17<00:02:24.670> or<00:02:24.910> 18<00:02:25.060> guys<00:02:26.020> are<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.530> I'm<00:02:26.620> guessing<00:02:27.070> it's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
17 or 18 guys are so I'm guessing it's

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.250 
17 or 18 guys are so I'm guessing it's
pretty<00:02:27.520> pretty<00:02:27.880> competitive<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.540> mean<00:02:28.960> it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
pretty pretty competitive I mean it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.850 
pretty pretty competitive I mean it
definitely<00:02:29.650> composing<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.490> lot<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.760> person<00:02:31.060> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
definitely composing a lot of person is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.750 
definitely composing a lot of person is
like<00:02:32.860> nine<00:02:33.100> freshmen<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.760> me<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.600> jamari

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
like nine freshmen to me and jamari

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.030 
like nine freshmen to me and jamari
practice<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.180> lot<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:38.040> competitors

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
practice is just a lot of competitors

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.520 
practice is just a lot of competitors
out<00:02:39.760> there<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.180> stuff<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.600> but<00:02:40.960> we

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
out there and stuff like that but we

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.440 
out there and stuff like that but we
also<00:02:41.650> getting<00:02:42.070> better<00:02:42.310> as<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:42.730> sits<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:43.180> stuff

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
also getting better as it sits in stuff

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.140 
also getting better as it sits in stuff
so<00:02:43.990> I<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:45.370> can't<00:02:45.580> wait<00:02:45.610> for<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.940> equation

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
so I just can't wait for this equation

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.690 
so I just can't wait for this equation
is<00:02:46.870> happy<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:49.450> able
