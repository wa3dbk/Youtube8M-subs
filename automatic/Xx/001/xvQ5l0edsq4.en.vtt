line art there is many way to turn a
layer<00:01:38.800> into<00:01:39.369> blue<00:01:39.610> but<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.390> less<00:01:40.600> destructive

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
layer into blue but the less destructive

layer into blue but the less destructive
and<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.740> less<00:01:41.950> resource-intensive<00:01:42.610> iPhone

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
and the less resource-intensive iPhone

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.310 
and the less resource-intensive iPhone
is<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.950> uncheck<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:46.030> blue<00:01:46.299> channel<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:47.020> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
is to uncheck the blue channel in the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.480 
is to uncheck the blue channel in the
layer<00:01:47.500> properties<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:50.259> reduce<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.160> opacity

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
