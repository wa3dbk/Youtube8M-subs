00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
in my turnigy 9x knockoff here

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.380 
in my turnigy 9x knockoff here
when<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.030> first<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> 9<00:00:15.599> X<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.440> put<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
when I first got the 9 X I put in the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.060 
when I first got the 9 X I put in the
smartypants<00:00:18.390> board<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.350> put<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.710> ER<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.010> I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
smartypants board I put in the ER and I

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.160 
smartypants board I put in the ER and I
next<00:00:20.340> firmware<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> great<00:00:21.600> great

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
next firmware and it's a great great

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.080 
next firmware and it's a great great
system<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.740> absolutely<00:00:23.279> love<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.910> works

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
system I absolutely love how it works

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.720 
system I absolutely love how it works
the<00:00:25.050> problem<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.500> had<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.519> right

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the problem I had was the the right

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.009 
the problem I had was the the right
gimbal<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:28.470> original<00:00:28.830> gimbal<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:30.019> one

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
gimbal the original gimbal on this one

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.420 
gimbal the original gimbal on this one
of<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> pots<00:00:31.460> wasn't<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.989> was<00:00:34.110> pretty

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
of the pots wasn't it was pretty

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.610 
of the pots wasn't it was pretty
buggered<00:00:35.430> up<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.820> basically<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:37.170> happened

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
buggered up so basically what happened

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.440 
buggered up so basically what happened
is<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.520> actual<00:00:38.790> centre<00:00:39.120> would<00:00:39.270> keep

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
is the the actual centre would keep

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.840 
is the the actual centre would keep
veering<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.559> right<00:00:40.890> edge<00:00:41.070> limit<00:00:41.430> so

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
veering or the right right edge limit so

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
veering or the right right edge limit so
it's<00:00:41.969> pretty<00:00:42.059> much<00:00:42.300> unfortunately<00:00:43.020> useless

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it's pretty much unfortunately useless

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.979 
it's pretty much unfortunately useless
for<00:00:43.590> flying<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.190> had<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> actually<00:00:44.840> Jimmy<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
for flying I had to actually Jimmy the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.260 
for flying I had to actually Jimmy the
side<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.620> inside<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.520> hot<00:00:47.730> glue<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
side in inside with some hot glue and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.350 
side in inside with some hot glue and
some<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.739> pieces<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.640> plastic<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
some you know pieces of plastic and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
some you know pieces of plastic and
that's<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:52.620> known<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> boards

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
that's actually well known on the boards

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.850 
that's actually well known on the boards
for<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.789> 9x<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.420> having<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.350> possibly<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
for the 9x is having you know possibly a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
for the 9x is having you know possibly a
bad<00:00:56.100> gimbal<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> honest<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.989> wasn't

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
bad gimbal but to be honest I wasn't

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.660 
bad gimbal but to be honest I wasn't
happy<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.590> Kimball's<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.160> ordered<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
happy with the Kimball's so I ordered a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
happy with the Kimball's so I ordered a
pair<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.300> Aurora

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
pair of Aurora

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.009 
pair of Aurora
gimble's<00:01:01.829> from<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> robot<00:01:02.550> shop<00:01:02.870> these<00:01:03.870> are

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
gimble's from the robot shop these are

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
gimble's from the robot shop these are
about<00:01:04.140> 22<00:01:04.500> bucks<00:01:04.710> each<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:04.949> by<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> time<00:01:05.670> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
about 22 bucks each so by the time you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.859 
about 22 bucks each so by the time you
get<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.150> your<00:01:06.270> hands<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.750> there's

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
get it in your hands I think there's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770 
get it in your hands I think there's
about<00:01:07.020> 50<00:01:07.409> bucks<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:09.570> don't

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
about 50 bucks or so but these don't

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
about 50 bucks or so but these don't
actually<00:01:09.990> fit<00:01:10.439> directly<00:01:10.950> they're<00:01:11.400> not

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
actually fit directly they're not

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.810 
actually fit directly they're not
drop-in<00:01:11.939> replacements<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> actually

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
drop-in replacements so this is actually

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.020 
drop-in replacements so this is actually
already<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.390> I'll<00:01:15.479> show<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> did

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
already in but I'll show you what I did

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.499 
already in but I'll show you what I did
on<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.740> Aurora<00:01:19.790> gimbals<00:01:20.790> themselves<00:01:21.420> they

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
on the Aurora gimbals themselves they

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.010 
on the Aurora gimbals themselves they
have<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> couple<00:01:21.869> extra<00:01:22.140> plastic<00:01:23.720> pieces<00:01:24.720> on

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
have a couple extra plastic pieces on

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.280 
have a couple extra plastic pieces on
the<00:01:25.110> bottom<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.130> top<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:27.299> are

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the bottom and the top that are

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.249 
the bottom and the top that are
basically<00:01:28.680> screw<00:01:28.950> holders<00:01:29.280> okay<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.810> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
basically screw holders okay and I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.780 
basically screw holders okay and I
actually<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.619> took<00:01:31.890> them<00:01:32.100> off<00:01:32.220> shave<00:01:32.549> them

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
actually just took them off shave them

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.440 
actually just took them off shave them
off<00:01:32.939> directly<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> dremel<00:01:35.450> after

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
off directly with with a dremel after

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840 
off directly with with a dremel after
that<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.900> almost<00:01:37.079> pop<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.159> fine<00:01:38.490> but

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that they almost pop in just fine but

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
that they almost pop in just fine but
what<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> take

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
what you have to do is you have to take

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
what you have to do is you have to take
a<00:01:40.740> dremel<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:42.530> basically<00:01:43.530> sand<00:01:43.920> off<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
a dremel and just basically sand off the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
a dremel and just basically sand off the
top<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> bottom<00:01:46.049> rims<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:47.250> so

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
top and the bottom rims a little bit so

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.219 
top and the bottom rims a little bit so
these<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.909> pop<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.299> better<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.110> just

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
these can pop in better and you can just

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.420 
these can pop in better and you can just
do<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.680> at<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> time<00:01:49.890> until<00:01:50.250> these

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
do a little bit at a time until these

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.550 
do a little bit at a time until these
pop<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.909> nicely<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.170> course<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.409> got<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
pop in nicely then of course you got to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
pop in nicely then of course you got to
secure<00:01:52.860> them<00:01:53.009> somehow<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.640> instead<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.939> making

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
secure them somehow so instead of making

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.230 
secure them somehow so instead of making
myself<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.810> custom<00:01:55.470> plate<00:01:55.710> or<00:01:55.860> anything<00:01:56.210> what<00:01:57.210> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
myself a custom plate or anything what I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.490 
myself a custom plate or anything what I
did<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.259> actually<00:01:58.759> went<00:01:59.780> found<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.200> couple

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
did was I actually went found a couple

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.859 
did was I actually went found a couple
of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> existing<00:02:02.310> remaining<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.540> know<00:02:03.659> holes

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
of the existing remaining you know holes

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.090 
of the existing remaining you know holes
for<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> gimbals<00:02:04.680> took<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> drill

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
for the gimbals took a drill

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.650 
for the gimbals took a drill
through<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:07.730> and<00:02:07.970> actually<00:02:08.090> just<00:02:08.360> did<00:02:08.509> two

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
through it and actually just did two

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.590 
through it and actually just did two
spots<00:02:08.990> per<00:02:09.640> my<00:02:10.640> hole<00:02:10.880> would<00:02:11.120> come<00:02:11.300> out<00:02:11.420> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
spots per my hole would come out the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.180 
spots per my hole would come out the
front<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.170> then<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.440> put<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.710> couple<00:02:13.040> little

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
front and then I put a couple little

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.490 
front and then I put a couple little
number<00:02:13.520> four<00:02:13.730> screws<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.420> obviously<00:02:15.350> there

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
number four screws it's obviously there

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.440 
number four screws it's obviously there
are<00:02:15.650> much<00:02:15.860> nicer<00:02:16.250> ways<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.880> doing<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.270> but

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
are much nicer ways of doing it but

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.550 
are much nicer ways of doing it but
that's<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.720> way<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.840> did<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.350> it's<00:02:18.500> just

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
that's the way I did it and it's just

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.530 
that's the way I did it and it's just
fine

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
fine

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.030 
fine
I'll<00:02:20.540> probably<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:20.930> back<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.800> up<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:21.980> a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
I'll probably just back it up with a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.380 
I'll probably just back it up with a
little<00:02:22.220> bit<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.459> glue<00:02:22.640> but<00:02:22.850> it's<00:02:22.970> nice<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
little bit of glue but it's nice and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.490 
little bit of glue but it's nice and
secure<00:02:23.510> now<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.080> don't<00:02:24.110> have<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.380> worry

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
secure now so I don't have to worry

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.630 
secure now so I don't have to worry
about<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.740> as<00:02:25.100> far<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.700> wiring<00:02:25.940> goes<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
about it as far as the wiring goes the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.280 
about it as far as the wiring goes the
Aurora<00:02:29.570> Gamble's<00:02:30.020> come<00:02:30.350> with<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:32.390> two<00:02:32.870> pots

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
Aurora Gamble's come with the two pots

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.410 
Aurora Gamble's come with the two pots
going<00:02:33.950> into<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> single<00:02:34.640> connect<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.940> 6-pin

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
going into a single connect a 6-pin

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.240 
going into a single connect a 6-pin
connector<00:02:35.470> which<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.620> obviously<00:02:36.950> not<00:02:37.040> a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
connector which is obviously not a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.449 
connector which is obviously not a
drop-in<00:02:37.900> compatible<00:02:38.900> with<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.260> 9x<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
drop-in compatible with the 9x the

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.640 
drop-in compatible with the 9x the
original<00:02:41.239> gimbals<00:02:42.080> on<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.440> 9x<00:02:43.180> have

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
original gimbals on the 9x have

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.229 
original gimbals on the 9x have
basically<00:02:45.650> two<00:02:46.040> separate<00:02:46.670> connectors<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.120> the

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
basically two separate connectors of the

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.080 
basically two separate connectors of the
two<00:02:47.450> three<00:02:47.720> pins<00:02:47.959> one<00:02:48.260> for<00:02:48.500> each<00:02:48.650> axis<00:02:49.520> on<00:02:49.970> the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
two three pins one for each axis on the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.990 
two three pins one for each axis on the
gimbal<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.170> what<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.130> did<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.640> they<00:02:52.730> actually

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
gimbal so what I did and they actually

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.570 
gimbal so what I did and they actually
connect<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:53.600> below<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.709> trim<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.370> trim

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
connect just below the trim the trim

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.090 
connect just below the trim the trim
board<00:02:55.940> here<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:56.420> what<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.290> ended<00:02:57.440> up<00:02:57.560> doing<00:02:57.620> is

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
board here so what I ended up doing is

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.380 
board here so what I ended up doing is
on<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.340> bottom<00:02:58.640> side<00:02:58.790> I'm<00:02:58.940> actually<00:02:59.060> couldn't

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
on the bottom side I'm actually couldn't

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.820 
on the bottom side I'm actually couldn't
even<00:02:59.570> remove<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.930> connectors<00:03:00.350> there<00:03:00.530> they

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
even remove the connectors there they

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.890 
even remove the connectors there they
were<00:03:00.950> glued<00:03:01.459> on<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:02.090> well<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.540> couldn't

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
were glued on so well I just couldn't

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.400 
were glued on so well I just couldn't
get<00:03:02.959> them<00:03:03.080> off

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
get them off

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.170 
get them off
so<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:03.769> snipped<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.190> wires<00:03:04.430> off<00:03:04.730> at<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.000> base

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
so I snipped the wires off at the base

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.420 
so I snipped the wires off at the base
and<00:03:05.360> that's<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.959> took<00:03:06.530> note<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:06.860> where<00:03:07.160> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
and that's it I took note of where the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.540 
and that's it I took note of where the
electrical<00:03:07.880> placement<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.650> instead<00:03:10.340> of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
electrical placement is so instead of

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.020 
electrical placement is so instead of
going<00:03:11.510> into<00:03:11.720> those<00:03:12.049> what<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.950> did<00:03:13.250> was<00:03:13.459> there

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
going into those what I did was there

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:27.259 
going into those what I did was there
are<00:03:14.269> actually<00:03:14.959> let<00:03:15.709> me<00:03:15.799> just<00:03:15.950> zoom<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.519> here

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.170 

so<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.989> on<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.800> right<00:03:29.950> side<00:03:30.280> here<00:03:30.700> you've

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
so on the on the right side here you've

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.280 
so on the on the right side here you've
got<00:03:31.510> basically<00:03:32.440> six<00:03:33.060> solder<00:03:34.060> points<00:03:34.269> okay<00:03:34.629> now

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
got basically six solder points okay now

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.289 
got basically six solder points okay now
in<00:03:35.530> terms<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:35.890> columns<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.519> call<00:03:36.940> them<00:03:37.060> from

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
in terms of columns you call them from

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.729 
in terms of columns you call them from
the<00:03:37.420> right<00:03:37.540> edge<00:03:37.720> column<00:03:38.110> one<00:03:38.260> then<00:03:38.620> the

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
the right edge column one then the

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.030 
the right edge column one then the
middle<00:03:38.980> column<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.489> then<00:03:40.290> left<00:03:41.290> column<00:03:41.680> okay

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
middle column and then left column okay

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.910 
middle column and then left column okay
the<00:03:42.640> outermost<00:03:43.060> column<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.080> actually<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
the outermost column is actually the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.460 
the outermost column is actually the
ground<00:03:45.160> or<00:03:45.489> what<00:03:46.420> would<00:03:46.569> be<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.260> black

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
ground or what would be the the black

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.100 
ground or what would be the the black
wires<00:03:47.739> off<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.700> original<00:03:48.790> Gibble's<00:03:49.390> the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
wires off the original Gibble's the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.640 
wires off the original Gibble's the
middle<00:03:50.590> column<00:03:51.099> is<00:03:51.220> positive<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
middle column is positive and the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.170 
middle column is positive and the
innermost<00:03:54.160> column<00:03:54.849> is<00:03:55.000> actually<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
innermost column is actually the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.300 
innermost column is actually the
whatever<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.629> pot<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.620> pot<00:03:59.650> connectors

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
whatever the the pot the pot connectors

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.069 
whatever the the pot the pot connectors
are<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.519> resistance<00:04:00.940> connectors<00:04:01.329> and<00:04:01.599> those

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
are the resistance connectors and those

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.580 
are the resistance connectors and those
are<00:04:02.290> separate<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.220> outermost<00:04:03.459> column<00:04:03.940> is

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
are separate so the outermost column is

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.080 
are separate so the outermost column is
ground<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.890> it<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.040> common<00:04:06.519> so<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.760> only<00:04:06.970> have

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
ground and it is common so you only have

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.449 
ground and it is common so you only have
to<00:04:07.269> solder<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.810> one<00:04:07.989> if<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.260> want<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:09.250> middle

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
to solder to one if you want the middle

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.430 
to solder to one if you want the middle
one<00:04:09.609> is<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.760> positive<00:04:10.390> again<00:04:10.599> common<00:04:11.109> and

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
one is the positive again common and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.349 
one is the positive again common and
then<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.970> inner<00:04:13.150> one<00:04:13.480> here<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:15.359> basically

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
then the the inner one here is basically

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.620 
then the the inner one here is basically
for<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.630> pots<00:04:16.810> now<00:04:17.350> if<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:17.919> so<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.299> middle

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
for the pots now if you so the middle

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.580 
for the pots now if you so the middle
the<00:04:20.139> middle<00:04:20.470> pin<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:21.150> each<00:04:22.150> pot<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:23.110> actually

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
the middle pin of each pot is actually

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.770 
the middle pin of each pot is actually
the<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.010> final<00:04:24.370> signal<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.000> that's<00:04:25.570> what

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
the the final signal and that's what

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.920 
the the final signal and that's what
you're<00:04:25.960> gonna<00:04:26.080> solder<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.070> inner<00:04:27.280> most

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
you're gonna solder to the inner most

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.409 
you're gonna solder to the inner most
column<00:04:28.930> here<00:04:29.169> now<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:30.370> thought<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:30.970> had<00:04:31.240> written

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
column here now I thought I had written

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.310 
column here now I thought I had written
down<00:04:31.539> what<00:04:32.470> originally<00:04:33.510> correctly<00:04:34.510> which<00:04:34.990> pot

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
down what originally correctly which pot

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.469 
down what originally correctly which pot
goes<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.770> which<00:04:35.979> but<00:04:36.610> after<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:36.910> wired<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.360> all

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
goes to which but after a wired it all

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.629 
goes to which but after a wired it all
up<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:37.840> discovered<00:04:38.289> no<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.470> got<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.919> backwards<00:04:39.370> so

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
up I discovered no I got it backwards so

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.670 
up I discovered no I got it backwards so
one<00:04:40.389> anama<00:04:40.690> I'm<00:04:40.900> not<00:04:41.050> doing<00:04:41.229> this<00:04:41.349> on<00:04:41.530> just

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
one anama I'm not doing this on just

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.379 
one anama I'm not doing this on just
Jack<00:04:41.919> but<00:04:42.669> when<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.270> went<00:04:43.599> in<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:43.960> did<00:04:44.070> my<00:04:45.389> you

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
Jack but when I went in and did my you

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.730 
Jack but when I went in and did my you
know<00:04:46.479> you<00:04:46.570> go<00:04:46.690> into<00:04:46.840> your<00:04:46.990> calibration<00:04:47.680> of

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
know you go into your calibration of

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.680 
know you go into your calibration of
your<00:04:47.800> sticks<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:49.030> move<00:04:49.180> them<00:04:49.270> up<00:04:49.360> or<00:04:49.539> down

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
your sticks and you move them up or down

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.629 
your sticks and you move them up or down
and<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.080> see<00:04:50.289> okay<00:04:50.650> is<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:50.950> going<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.220> up<00:04:51.310> left

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
and you see okay is it going it up left

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.310 
and you see okay is it going it up left
right<00:04:51.910> there<00:04:52.150> whatever<00:04:52.479> this<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.110> when<00:04:53.229> you're

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
right there whatever this is when you're

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.750 
right there whatever this is when you're
doing<00:04:53.410> your<00:04:53.500> limits<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.010> found<00:04:54.340> that<00:04:54.550> my

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
doing your limits I found that my

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.150 
doing your limits I found that my
throttle<00:04:55.599> was<00:04:55.840> actually<00:04:56.260> now<00:04:56.380> my<00:04:56.530> rudder<00:04:56.770> and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
throttle was actually now my rudder and

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.860 
throttle was actually now my rudder and
I<00:04:57.460> had<00:04:57.610> this<00:04:57.760> one<00:04:57.940> in<00:04:58.030> Reverse<00:04:58.270> too<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:58.720> all<00:04:58.750> I

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
I had this one in Reverse too so all I

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.670 
I had this one in Reverse too so all I
did<00:04:59.099> was<00:05:00.099> I<00:05:00.280> went<00:05:00.400> back<00:05:00.669> in<00:05:00.880> here<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.680> swapped

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
did was I went back in here and swapped

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.210 
did was I went back in here and swapped
the<00:05:03.370> two<00:05:03.639> wires<00:05:04.560> here<00:05:05.560> on<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.979> innermost

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
the two wires here on the innermost

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.250 
the two wires here on the innermost
column<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:06.880> everything<00:05:07.180> was<00:05:07.300> fine<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:08.229> other

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
column and everything was fine the other

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.870 
column and everything was fine the other
thing<00:05:08.560> is<00:05:08.710> if<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:08.950> find<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.430> you're<00:05:09.669> doing

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
thing is if you find that you're doing

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.490 
thing is if you find that you're doing
your<00:05:10.120> adjustment<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.870> all<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:11.260> know<00:05:11.320> if

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
your adjustment and all that you know if

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.810 
your adjustment and all that you know if
your<00:05:11.650> throttle<00:05:11.950> goes<00:05:12.099> up<00:05:12.280> but<00:05:12.490> your<00:05:12.610> stick

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
your throttle goes up but your stick

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.260 
your throttle goes up but your stick
goes<00:05:12.970> down<00:05:13.410> okay<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:15.160> solution<00:05:15.610> for<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:15.849> is

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
goes down okay the solution for that is

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.180 
goes down okay the solution for that is
that<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:16.660> hooked<00:05:16.900> up<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.320> positive<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:18.039> the

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
that you hooked up the positive to the

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.920 
that you hooked up the positive to the
ground<00:05:18.610> by<00:05:18.849> accident<00:05:19.270> like<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.479> swap<00:05:19.720> those

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
ground by accident like you swap those

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.219 
ground by accident like you swap those
two<00:05:19.990> so<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:20.740> just<00:05:20.919> swap<00:05:21.099> them<00:05:21.370> okay<00:05:22.020> but<00:05:23.020> the

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
two so you just swap them okay but the

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.779 
two so you just swap them okay but the
installation<00:05:23.500> took<00:05:23.919> me<00:05:24.039> a<00:05:24.070> little<00:05:24.190> time<00:05:24.490> but

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
installation took me a little time but

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.240 
installation took me a little time but
just<00:05:25.570> mostly<00:05:26.169> because<00:05:26.320> I<00:05:26.500> soldered<00:05:27.070> it<00:05:27.130> up

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
just mostly because I soldered it up

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.339 
just mostly because I soldered it up
wrong<00:05:27.460> but<00:05:27.880> actually<00:05:28.180> works<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:28.479> fine<00:05:28.630> so

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
wrong but actually works just fine so

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.320 
wrong but actually works just fine so
I'm<00:05:29.590> going<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.860> point<00:05:30.039> this<00:05:30.190> out<00:05:30.340> now<00:05:30.639> in<00:05:31.030> case

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
I'm going to point this out now in case

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.850 
I'm going to point this out now in case
you<00:05:31.539> want<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.900> know<00:05:32.310> for<00:05:33.310> the

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
you want to know for the

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:42.000 
you want to know for the
throttle<00:05:35.970> access<00:05:37.590> you<00:05:38.590> want<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:40.750> upper<00:05:41.110> the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
throttle access you want the upper the

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.810 
throttle access you want the upper the
upper<00:05:42.040> 1k<00:05:42.640> and<00:05:42.880> for<00:05:43.600> the<00:05:43.780> rudder<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:45.400> actually

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
upper 1k and for the rudder you actually

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.280 
upper 1k and for the rudder you actually
want<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.300> I<00:05:46.390> know<00:05:46.450> this<00:05:46.660> is<00:05:46.720> a<00:05:46.750> little<00:05:46.960> hard<00:05:47.140> to

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
want and I know this is a little hard to

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.360 
want and I know this is a little hard to
see<00:05:47.530> but<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.610> want<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.090> lower<00:05:49.360> one<00:05:50.190> on<00:05:51.190> the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
see but you want the lower one on the

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.170 
see but you want the lower one on the
other<00:05:51.490> side<00:05:52.500> your<00:05:53.500> elevator<00:05:54.100> and<00:05:54.640> see<00:05:54.850> that<00:05:55.000> is

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
other side your elevator and see that is

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:02.010 
other side your elevator and see that is
the<00:05:55.450> blue<00:05:55.990> wire<00:05:57.240> elevator<00:05:58.240> is<00:05:58.420> bottom<00:05:58.900> and<00:06:01.020> the

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
the blue wire elevator is bottom and the

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.520 
the blue wire elevator is bottom and the
aileron<00:06:02.880> I'm<00:06:03.880> sorry<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.990> elevator<00:06:05.380> I'm

aileron I'm sorry the elevator I'm

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.780
