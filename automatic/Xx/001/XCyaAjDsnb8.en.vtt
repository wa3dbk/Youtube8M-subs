whenever I'm working down in the nether

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.069 
whenever I'm working down in the nether
it<00:00:38.640> seems<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.270> always<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.570> pesky

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
gust in a lava lake shooting at me and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
gust in a lava lake shooting at me and
it's<00:00:42.300> made<00:00:42.450> me<00:00:42.600> ask<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> question<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.890> these

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it's made me ask the question can these

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.130 
it's made me ask the question can these
gasps<00:00:44.370> actually<00:00:44.969> spawn<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> lava<00:00:45.870> cuz

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
gasps actually spawn in the lava cuz

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
gasps actually spawn in the lava cuz
they<00:00:46.260> always<00:00:46.469> seem<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.920> hanging<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.789> down

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
they always seem to be hanging out down

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.330 
they always seem to be hanging out down
there<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> third<00:00:49.320> question<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there and then the third question is to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
there and then the third question is to
do<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.760> slabs<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.239> wanted<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.899> these

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
do with slabs I wanted to know if these

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290 
do with slabs I wanted to know if these
guys<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.590> able<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> shoot<00:00:53.340> fireballs<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
guys are able to shoot fireballs at you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
guys are able to shoot fireballs at you
through<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> half<00:00:55.170> slabs<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.739> obviously<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
through the half slabs now obviously a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.250 
through the half slabs now obviously a
half<00:00:56.520> slab<00:00:56.789> even<00:00:57.180> being<00:00:57.300> half<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.809> block<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
half slab even being half a block it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
half slab even being half a block it
technically<00:00:58.890> counts<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.609> entire<00:00:59.969> block<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
technically counts as an entire block so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
technically counts as an entire block so
I<00:01:00.510> don't<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> ghost<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:02.160> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
I don't know if the ghost is going to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.429 
I don't know if the ghost is going to
see<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:02.969> obstacle<00:01:03.390> between<00:01:03.750> itself

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
see that as an obstacle between itself

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.050 
see that as an obstacle between itself
and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> player<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> know

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and the player or if it's going to know

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.179 
and the player or if it's going to know
that<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> gap<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.680> shoot<00:01:07.950> through

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that there is a gap it can shoot through

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.350 
that there is a gap it can shoot through
so<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> find<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
so we're going to find out in this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.179 
so we're going to find out in this
episode<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.930> before<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:10.950> three

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
episode but before we get to those three

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.830 
episode but before we get to those three
questions<00:01:11.310> we're<00:01:12.150> actually<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> do

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
questions we're actually going to do

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
questions we're actually going to do
another<00:01:13.260> user-based<00:01:14.010> question<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.670> thought

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909

was over so silly and fun and has been
on<00:01:17.100> my<00:01:17.250> list<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> long<00:01:17.820> long<00:01:18.000> time<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
on my list for a long long time you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
on my list for a long long time you
wanted<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.439> ghosts<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.070> drown<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.070 
wanted to know if ghosts can drown in
water<00:01:20.820> which<00:01:21.270> i<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.689> pretty<00:01:21.869> hilarious

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.660 
so let's set up a tank
let's<00:01:23.850> put<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> ghast<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.840> find<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.670> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
let's put a ghast in it and find out so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
let's put a ghast in it and find out so
if<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.939> remember<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> last<00:01:27.659> time<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.140> use

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
if you remember the last time we use

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
if you remember the last time we use
this<00:01:28.500> water<00:01:28.770> tank<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.310> found<00:01:29.549> out<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.939> with

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
this water tank we found out that with

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
this water tank we found out that with
us<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.479> actually<00:01:30.689> break<00:01:31.170> barrier<00:01:31.619> blocks

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
us could actually break barrier blocks

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
us could actually break barrier blocks
and<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.490> guys<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:32.970> young<00:01:33.030> actually<00:01:33.270> saw

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and the guys at my young actually saw

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
and the guys at my young actually saw
this<00:01:33.840> video<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.890> corrected<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.549> which

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
this video and they corrected that which

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
this video and they corrected that which
is<00:01:36.090> awesome<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is awesome so a little bit of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.350 
is awesome so a little bit of
information<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:38.939> but

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
information for you right there but

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120 
information for you right there but
let's<00:01:39.540> use<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.900> summon<00:01:40.229> command<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.740> put<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
let's use the summon command to put a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.630 
let's use the summon command to put a
cast<00:01:41.549> inside<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.329> tank<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.979> yet<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.549> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
cast inside this tank and yet there you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
cast inside this tank and yet there you
go<00:01:44.790> confirmation<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.990> actually<00:01:46.259> drown

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
go confirmation they can actually drown

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350 
go confirmation they can actually drown
it<00:01:46.920> also<00:01:47.040> looks<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it also looks like they don't like to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
it also looks like they don't like to
swim<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.020> either<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.829> sometimes<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
swim in there either but sometimes it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
swim in there either but sometimes it
takes<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.759> while<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.180> AI<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.509> kick<00:01:51.840> inside

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
takes a while for that AI to kick inside

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
takes a while for that AI to kick inside
I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.560> I'm<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> sport<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.850> few

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I think I'm just going to sport a few

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.399 
I think I'm just going to sport a few
more<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> these<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.290> move

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
more of these and see if they can move

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
more of these and see if they can move
around<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.310> go<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.759> move

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
around and there you go they can move

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.800 
around and there you go they can move
around<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> water<00:01:57.570> they<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.350> indeed<00:01:58.740> drown

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
around in the water they do indeed drown

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.359 
around in the water they do indeed drown
so<00:02:00.810> our<00:02:00.869> first<00:02:01.079> question<00:02:01.320> was<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
so our first question was to do with the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.190 
so our first question was to do with the
slime<00:02:02.729> blocks<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.180> wanted<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.930> gas

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
slime blocks we wanted to know if a gas

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.410 
slime blocks we wanted to know if a gas
fireball<00:02:04.799> could<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.100> pushed<00:02:05.369> away<00:02:05.549> with<00:02:06.240> these

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
fireball could be pushed away with these

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.119 
fireball could be pushed away with these
slime<00:02:06.689> blocks<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> after<00:02:07.439> spending<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.890> lot<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
slime blocks and after spending a lot of

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.680 
slime blocks and after spending a lot of
time<00:02:08.280> making<00:02:08.520> myself<00:02:08.819> look<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> fool

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
time making myself look like a fool

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
time making myself look like a fool
running<00:02:10.229> around<00:02:10.440> trying<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.920> get<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> gas<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
running around trying to get a gas to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.309 
running around trying to get a gas to
shoot<00:02:11.849> at<00:02:12.000> me<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.330> get<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> timing<00:02:12.840> right<00:02:13.110> for

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
shoot at me and get the timing right for

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.880 
shoot at me and get the timing right for
the<00:02:13.410> piston<00:02:13.770> to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the piston to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.830 
the piston to
extend<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> slime<00:02:14.550> blocks<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.970> gave<00:02:15.510> up<00:02:15.690> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
extend the slime blocks I gave up and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.510 
extend the slime blocks I gave up and
decided<00:02:15.930> hey<00:02:16.350> let's<00:02:16.590> use<00:02:16.650> command<00:02:17.130> blocks<00:02:17.340> we

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
decided hey let's use command blocks we

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.790 
decided hey let's use command blocks we
can<00:02:17.700> make<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.150> lot<00:02:18.360> simpler<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.959> simulate

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
can make this a lot simpler and simulate

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.590 
can make this a lot simpler and simulate
the<00:02:20.010> same<00:02:20.310> thing<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.970> down<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.330> we're<00:02:21.510> going

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
the same thing so down here we're going

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.900 
the same thing so down here we're going
to<00:02:21.660> spawn<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.319> fireball<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.310> timing<00:02:23.760> of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
to spawn in a fireball and the timing of

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.850 
to spawn in a fireball and the timing of
the<00:02:24.120> piston<00:02:24.540> extending<00:02:25.140> where<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> slime

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the piston extending where the slime

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.620 
the piston extending where the slime
blocks<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.760> push<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.090> away<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.330> let's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
blocks is going to push it away so let's

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.170 
blocks is going to push it away so let's
press<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.959> bun<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.950> goes<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:30.030> can

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
press that bun there it goes and you can

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.370 
press that bun there it goes and you can
see<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.660> worked<00:02:30.840> let's<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.230> do<00:02:31.350> that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
see that it worked let's just do that

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.740 
see that it worked let's just do that
one<00:02:31.830> more<00:02:31.980> time<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.970> correct<00:02:33.240> timing<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.690> can

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
one more time the correct timing you can

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.870 
one more time the correct timing you can
see<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.860> slime<00:02:35.220> blocks<00:02:35.430> will<00:02:35.580> actually

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
see that the slime blocks will actually

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.280 
see that the slime blocks will actually
push<00:02:36.090> away<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.720> fireball<00:02:37.140> entity<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:40.170> I

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
push away the fireball entity and as I

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.840 
push away the fireball entity and as I
mentioned<00:02:40.739> at<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.890> beginning<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.610> video

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
mentioned at the beginning of the video

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.610 
mentioned at the beginning of the video
I'm<00:02:42.150> often<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> hermit<00:02:43.080> craft<00:02:43.319> server

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
I'm often on the hermit craft server

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.440 
I'm often on the hermit craft server
working<00:02:44.220> away<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.760> never<00:02:44.970> on<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.270> river

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
working away in the never on the river

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.720 
working away in the never on the river
farm<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.230> ghost<00:02:46.470> rise<00:02:46.950> up<00:02:47.190> out<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.550> lava

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
farm and a ghost rise up out of the lava

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.820 
farm and a ghost rise up out of the lava
lake<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.239> start<00:02:48.540> shooting<00:02:48.989> at<00:02:49.140> me<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.650> is

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
lake and start shooting at me it is

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.560 
lake and start shooting at me it is
extremely<00:02:50.310> annoying<00:02:50.670> but<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.030> happened<00:02:51.360> so

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
extremely annoying but it's happened so

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.940 
extremely annoying but it's happened so
often<00:02:51.959> now<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.140> I'm<00:02:52.440> thinking<00:02:52.620> it's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
often now that I'm thinking it's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.040 
often now that I'm thinking it's
probably<00:02:53.250> happened<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:54.090> some<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.630> as<00:02:54.810> well

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
probably happened to some of you as well

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.810 
probably happened to some of you as well
and<00:02:55.230> it's<00:02:55.320> made<00:02:55.470> me<00:02:55.620> ask<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.920> question<00:02:56.370> can

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
and it's made me ask the question can

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.060 
and it's made me ask the question can
the<00:02:57.030> GAF<00:02:57.209> spawn<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.290> lava<00:02:58.500> or<00:02:58.800> are<00:02:58.950> they

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
the GAF spawn in the lava or are they

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.500 
the GAF spawn in the lava or are they
just<00:02:59.100> swimming<00:02:59.640> down<00:02:59.820> into<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.360> getting

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
just swimming down into it and getting

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.360 
just swimming down into it and getting
stuck<00:03:00.900> because<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.470> didn't<00:03:01.680> know<00:03:01.830> when<00:03:02.340> a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
stuck because if you didn't know when a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.729 
stuck because if you didn't know when a
gas<00:03:02.610> tip<00:03:02.970> box<00:03:03.180> intersects<00:03:03.870> lava<00:03:04.200> actually

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
gas tip box intersects lava actually

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.530 
gas tip box intersects lava actually
slows<00:03:05.130> down<00:03:05.400> its<00:03:05.670> movement<00:03:06.239> which<00:03:06.360> is

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
slows down its movement which is

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.630 
slows down its movement which is
interesting<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.620> I've<00:03:07.709> set<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.190> test<00:03:08.430> well

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
interesting but I've set up a test well

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.820 
interesting but I've set up a test well

this<00:03:21.510> world<00:03:21.780> has<00:03:21.959> been<00:03:22.079> running<00:03:22.410> for<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.650> very

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
this world has been running for a very

this world has been running for a very
long<00:03:23.220> time<00:03:23.250> I've<00:03:23.730> left<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.390> idle<00:03:24.750> I've<00:03:24.900> spent

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
long time I've left it idle I've spent

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.170 
long time I've left it idle I've spent
some<00:03:25.290> time<00:03:25.500> flying<00:03:25.860> around<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.400> haven't<00:03:26.940> heard

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
some time flying around I haven't heard

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.870 
some time flying around I haven't heard
or<00:03:27.420> seen<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.049> single<00:03:28.590> gas<00:03:28.829> spawn<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:29.610> world

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
or seen a single gas spawn in this world

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.880 
or seen a single gas spawn in this world
and<00:03:30.090> it's<00:03:30.570> been<00:03:30.750> quite<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.140> long<00:03:31.350> test<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:31.829> I

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
and it's been quite a long test so I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130 
and it's been quite a long test so I
think<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.370> clearly<00:03:32.579> say<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:33.150> gas<00:03:33.660> cannot

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
think we can clearly say that gas cannot

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.810 
think we can clearly say that gas cannot
spawn<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.530> lava<00:03:34.739> they<00:03:34.980> probably<00:03:35.250> just<00:03:35.579> swim

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
spawn in lava they probably just swim

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.910 
spawn in lava they probably just swim
down<00:03:36.030> into<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.600> get<00:03:37.079> stuck<00:03:37.380> down<00:03:37.620> there

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
down into it and get stuck down there

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.210 
down into it and get stuck down there
and<00:03:38.720> our<00:03:39.720> third<00:03:39.930> test<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.590> day<00:03:40.769> we<00:03:40.980> want<00:03:41.100> to

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
and our third test of the day we want to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.370 
and our third test of the day we want to
find<00:03:41.459> out<00:03:41.610> if<00:03:41.730> gas<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.299> shoot<00:03:42.570> us<00:03:42.870> through

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
find out if gas can shoot us through

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.810 
find out if gas can shoot us through
half<00:03:43.590> slabs<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.070> I've<00:03:44.190> got<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> feeling<00:03:44.519> they

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
half slabs and I've got a feeling they

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.759 
half slabs and I've got a feeling they
can't<00:03:45.150> because<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> world<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.019> made<00:03:46.620> of

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
can't because the world is made of

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.860 
can't because the world is made of
blocks<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.610> half<00:03:47.790> slab<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.360> block<00:03:48.660> even

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
blocks and a half slab is a block even

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.569 
blocks and a half slab is a block even
though<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.290> only<00:03:49.320> takes<00:03:49.799> up<00:03:49.980> half<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.549> so

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
though it only takes up half of it so

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.789 
though it only takes up half of it so
what<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.090> gas<00:03:51.269> will<00:03:51.510> see<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.230> there<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.769> a

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
what the gas will see is that there is a

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.530 
what the gas will see is that there is a
block<00:03:53.100> here<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.579> may<00:03:53.730> treat<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.120> like<00:03:54.329> this

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
block here and it may treat it like this

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.509 
block here and it may treat it like this
not<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.810> gap<00:03:55.049> but<00:03:55.230> they<00:03:55.350> also<00:03:55.530> may<00:03:56.340> actually

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
not a gap but they also may actually

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.039 
not a gap but they also may actually
know<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:56.910> there<00:03:57.150> are<00:03:57.299> slabs<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.780> try<00:03:57.930> and

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
know that there are slabs and try and

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.060 
know that there are slabs and try and
shoot<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.290> through<00:03:58.320> them<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.709> that's<00:03:58.860> exactly

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
shoot you through them so that's exactly

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.130 
shoot you through them so that's exactly
what<00:03:59.310> we<00:03:59.400> want<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.610> find<00:03:59.760> out<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.570> first<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.989> all

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
what we want to find out so first of all

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.289 
what we want to find out so first of all
you<00:04:01.410> can<00:04:01.590> actually<00:04:01.920> fire<00:04:02.190> five<00:04:02.549> rules<00:04:02.850> through

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
you can actually fire five rules through

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.210 
you can actually fire five rules through
these<00:04:03.480> gaps<00:04:03.750> I've<00:04:04.019> set<00:04:04.560> up<00:04:04.590> one<00:04:04.829> right<00:04:05.010> here

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
these gaps I've set up one right here

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.350 
these gaps I've set up one right here
you<00:04:05.310> can<00:04:05.430> see<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.700> went<00:04:05.880> through<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.120> half

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
you can see it went through the half

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.060 
you can see it went through the half
slabs<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.260> gone<00:04:07.410> all<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.680> way<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.829> the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
slabs and it's gone all the way to the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.920 
slabs and it's gone all the way to the
other<00:04:08.190> side<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.519> our<00:04:08.910> testing<00:04:09.299> area<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.720> blown

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
other side of our testing area and blown

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.840 
other side of our testing area and blown
up<00:04:10.079> because<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.680> thing<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.070> actually<00:04:11.579> a

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
up because this thing is actually a

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.000 
up because this thing is actually a
giant<00:04:12.390> cube<00:04:12.630> made<00:04:12.870> out<00:04:13.079> of<00:04:13.200> barrier<00:04:13.500> blocks<00:04:13.739> so

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
giant cube made out of barrier blocks so

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.979 
giant cube made out of barrier blocks so
when<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.370> spawn<00:04:14.609> in<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.820> ghast<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.630> not<00:04:15.840> going

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
when we spawn in a ghast it's not going

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.349 
when we spawn in a ghast it's not going
to<00:04:16.049> be<00:04:16.140> able<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.650> escape<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:18.000> should

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
to be able to escape and that should

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.120 
to be able to escape and that should
have<00:04:18.450> spawned<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.780> gas<00:04:18.959> there<00:04:19.260> we<00:04:19.380> go<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:20.010> now

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
have spawned a gas there we go so now

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.680 
have spawned a gas there we go so now
we've<00:04:20.280> got<00:04:20.370> one<00:04:20.640> inside<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.090> cage<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.570> what

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
we've got one inside the cage and what

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.750 
we've got one inside the cage and what
I'm<00:04:21.810> going<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.049> do<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.440> go<00:04:22.680> into<00:04:22.919> survival<00:04:23.580> mode

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
I'm going to do is go into survival mode

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.700 
I'm going to do is go into survival mode
and<00:04:24.000> then<00:04:24.419> just<00:04:24.630> wander<00:04:24.990> around<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.440> try<00:04:25.680> and

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
and then just wander around and try and

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.290 
and then just wander around and try and
get<00:04:25.919> this<00:04:26.070> guy<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.400> shoot<00:04:26.880> at<00:04:27.090> me

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
get this guy to shoot at me

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.180 
get this guy to shoot at me
now<00:04:27.389> I'm<00:04:27.509> thinking<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.020> depending<00:04:29.009> on<00:04:29.129> the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
now I'm thinking that depending on the

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.909 
now I'm thinking that depending on the
angle<00:04:29.430> or<00:04:29.789> what<00:04:29.940> high<00:04:30.120> time<00:04:30.360> at<00:04:30.539> etc<00:04:31.199> is<00:04:31.530> going

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
angle or what high time at etc is going

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.589 
angle or what high time at etc is going
to<00:04:31.979> have<00:04:32.099> some<00:04:32.280> trouble<00:04:32.699> finding<00:04:33.210> me<00:04:33.360> if<00:04:33.479> you

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
to have some trouble finding me if you

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.360 
to have some trouble finding me if you
can<00:04:33.840> shoot<00:04:34.229> through<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.590> half<00:04:34.800> slabs<00:04:35.190> but

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
can shoot through the half slabs but

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.740 
can shoot through the half slabs but
anyway<00:04:35.669> I'm<00:04:36.030> going<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.180> go<00:04:36.300> into<00:04:36.449> survival

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
anyway I'm going to go into survival

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.430 
anyway I'm going to go into survival
mode<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.259> we're<00:04:37.379> going<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.560> find<00:04:37.770> out<00:04:39.440> well

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
mode and we're going to find out well

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.529 
mode and we're going to find out well
you<00:04:40.680> saw<00:04:40.919> it<00:04:41.069> right<00:04:41.280> there<00:04:41.340> he<00:04:41.669> shot<00:04:41.970> at<00:04:42.120> me<00:04:42.150> and

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
you saw it right there he shot at me and

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.480 
you saw it right there he shot at me and
that<00:04:43.050> means<00:04:43.289> that<00:04:43.409> he<00:04:43.500> can<00:04:43.800> see<00:04:44.129> us<00:04:44.159> through

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
that means that he can see us through

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.249 
that means that he can see us through
the<00:04:44.610> half<00:04:44.789> slabs<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.539> will<00:04:45.690> also<00:04:45.870> mean

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
the half slabs and it will also mean

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.260 
the half slabs and it will also mean
that<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.500> can<00:04:46.650> do<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:47.009> it's<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.580> perfect<00:04:48.060> test

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
that you can do that it's a perfect test

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.420 
that you can do that it's a perfect test
straight<00:04:48.690> away<00:04:48.960> first<00:04:49.590> time<00:04:49.889> we<00:04:50.069> have<00:04:50.220> found

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
straight away first time we have found

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.279 
straight away first time we have found
out<00:04:50.610> our<00:04:50.759> answer<00:04:51.150> yes<00:04:51.389> they<00:04:51.599> can<00:04:51.659> see<00:04:52.110> through

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
out our answer yes they can see through

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.020 
out our answer yes they can see through
half<00:04:52.530> slabs<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.009> we<00:04:53.370> also<00:04:53.520> know<00:04:53.759> that<00:04:53.789> they're

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
half slabs and we also know that they're

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.850 
half slabs and we also know that they're
able<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.449> shoot<00:04:54.690> at<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:55.020> when<00:04:55.319> they<00:04:55.440> can<00:04:55.620> see

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
able to shoot at you when they can see

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.830 
able to shoot at you when they can see
you<00:04:56.009> and<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.639> those<00:04:56.789> fireballs<00:04:57.330> can<00:04:57.569> pass

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
you and that those fireballs can pass

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.520 
you and that those fireballs can pass
through<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.319> slabs<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:59.810> further<00:05:00.810> testing<00:05:01.379> has

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
through the slabs so further testing has

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.649 
through the slabs so further testing has
revealed<00:05:01.830> something<00:05:02.219> quite<00:05:02.699> interesting<00:05:03.090> I

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
revealed something quite interesting I

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.300 
revealed something quite interesting I
was<00:05:03.780> thinking<00:05:04.139> about<00:05:04.259> how<00:05:04.650> is<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:04.889> that<00:05:05.069> the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
was thinking about how is it that the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.430 
was thinking about how is it that the
gas<00:05:05.490> knows<00:05:05.879> that<00:05:06.479> there's<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.780> gap<00:05:07.020> there<00:05:07.289> does

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
gas knows that there's a gap there does

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.260 
gas knows that there's a gap there does
the<00:05:07.590> game<00:05:07.770> just<00:05:08.039> say<00:05:08.250> hey<00:05:08.460> that's<00:05:08.669> a<00:05:08.849> half<00:05:09.000> slab

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
the game just say hey that's a half slab

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.730 
the game just say hey that's a half slab
you<00:05:09.389> can<00:05:09.539> try<00:05:09.719> and<00:05:09.870> shoot<00:05:10.050> through<00:05:10.259> that<00:05:10.440> or

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
you can try and shoot through that or

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.320 
you can try and shoot through that or
does<00:05:10.889> it<00:05:10.919> actually<00:05:11.099> calculate<00:05:11.759> the<00:05:11.879> gap<00:05:12.090> and

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
does it actually calculate the gap and

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.700 
does it actually calculate the gap and
from<00:05:12.569> standing<00:05:12.930> around<00:05:13.020> here<00:05:13.259> for<00:05:13.319> a<00:05:13.500> long

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
from standing around here for a long

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.469 
from standing around here for a long
time<00:05:13.770> when<00:05:14.460> I'm<00:05:14.550> in<00:05:14.639> this<00:05:14.789> position<00:05:15.000> right

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
time when I'm in this position right

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.570 
time when I'm in this position right
here<00:05:15.509> the<00:05:16.139> gas<00:05:16.349> will<00:05:16.650> never<00:05:16.830> ever<00:05:17.009> shoot<00:05:17.340> at<00:05:17.430> me

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
here the gas will never ever shoot at me

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.279 
here the gas will never ever shoot at me
when<00:05:17.759> it<00:05:17.879> rises<00:05:18.030> up<00:05:18.270> because<00:05:18.690> there's<00:05:18.870> no<00:05:19.050> gap

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
when it rises up because there's no gap

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.290 
when it rises up because there's no gap
that<00:05:19.500> we<00:05:19.680> can<00:05:19.889> see<00:05:20.099> if<00:05:20.430> we<00:05:20.520> take<00:05:20.699> a<00:05:20.759> step<00:05:21.090> back

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
that we can see if we take a step back

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.050 
that we can see if we take a step back
when<00:05:21.539> it<00:05:21.659> gets<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.960> this<00:05:22.110> site<00:05:22.550> come<00:05:23.550> on<00:05:23.669> guy

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
when it gets to this site come on guy

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.089 
when it gets to this site come on guy
perfect<00:05:24.569> demonstration<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:25.440> he<00:05:25.770> going<00:05:25.949> to<00:05:26.009> do

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
perfect demonstration is he going to do

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.070 
perfect demonstration is he going to do
it<00:05:26.219> usually<00:05:26.879> he<00:05:27.270> was<00:05:27.419> shooting<00:05:27.599> me<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:27.960> there

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
it usually he was shooting me and there

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.779 
it usually he was shooting me and there
you<00:05:28.169> go<00:05:28.319> he<00:05:28.530> heard<00:05:28.740> him<00:05:28.919> made<00:05:29.069> the<00:05:29.219> sound<00:05:29.520> and

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
you go he heard him made the sound and

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.459 
you go he heard him made the sound and
he<00:05:30.240> tries<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:30.659> shoots<00:05:30.900> that<00:05:31.050> meat<00:05:31.229> through

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
he tries and shoots that meat through

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.019 
he tries and shoots that meat through
this<00:05:31.590> gap<00:05:31.860> so<00:05:32.039> I<00:05:32.099> do<00:05:32.159> believe<00:05:32.430> that<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.849> gas

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
this gap so I do believe that the gas

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.610 
this gap so I do believe that the gas
can<00:05:33.240> actually<00:05:33.509> calculate<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.110> gap<00:05:34.289> the<00:05:34.500> way

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
can actually calculate the gap the way

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.260 
can actually calculate the gap the way
that<00:05:34.800> we<00:05:34.919> see<00:05:35.130> it<00:05:35.219> here<00:05:35.430> so<00:05:35.490> if<00:05:35.789> there<00:05:36.000> is<00:05:36.120> a

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
that we see it here so if there is a

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.809 
that we see it here so if there is a
small<00:05:37.169> gap<00:05:37.380> it<00:05:37.620> will<00:05:37.740> actually<00:05:37.919> shoot<00:05:38.520> for<00:05:38.729> it

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
small gap it will actually shoot for it

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.360 
small gap it will actually shoot for it
at<00:05:38.969> the<00:05:39.090> player<00:05:39.710> so<00:05:40.710> I<00:05:40.740> believe<00:05:41.069> that<00:05:41.279> the

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
at the player so I believe that the

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.610 
at the player so I believe that the
ghast<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:41.880> actually<00:05:42.240> able<00:05:42.389> to<00:05:42.569> see<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.139> hitbox

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
ghast is actually able to see the hitbox

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.649 
ghast is actually able to see the hitbox
of<00:05:43.889> a<00:05:44.039> block<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:44.669> therefore<00:05:45.090> it<00:05:45.180> will<00:05:45.300> note<00:05:45.539> if

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
of a block and therefore it will note if

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.209 
of a block and therefore it will note if
there's<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.900> gap<00:05:46.139> and<00:05:46.560> it<00:05:46.680> will<00:05:46.770> be<00:05:46.860> able<00:05:46.979> to

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
there's a gap and it will be able to

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.740 
there's a gap and it will be able to
shoot<00:05:47.490> for<00:05:47.669> it<00:05:47.759> which<00:05:47.880> makes<00:05:48.120> a<00:05:48.270> lot<00:05:48.389> of<00:05:48.419> sense

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
shoot for it which makes a lot of sense

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.570 
shoot for it which makes a lot of sense
and<00:05:48.990> from<00:05:49.169> this<00:05:49.289> test<00:05:49.560> with<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:49.889> fencepost

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
and from this test with the fencepost

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.730 
and from this test with the fencepost
and<00:05:50.669> iron<00:05:51.330> bars<00:05:51.569> that<00:05:51.810> would<00:05:51.930> seem<00:05:52.139> to<00:05:52.169> confirm

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
and iron bars that would seem to confirm

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.490 
and iron bars that would seem to confirm
that<00:05:52.919> theory<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.750> that<00:05:54.750> concludes<00:05:55.229> this

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
that theory and that concludes this

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.680 
that theory and that concludes this
