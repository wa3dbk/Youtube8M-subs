00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
depending on how you design it so you

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.450 
depending on how you design it so you

and<00:01:25.310> this<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.350> graveyard

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
and this right here is the graveyard

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.109 
and this right here is the graveyard
this<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.500> field<00:01:31.800> spell<00:01:31.979> zone<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this is the field spell zone because I

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
this is the field spell zone because I
didn't<00:01:33.390> look<00:01:33.509> at<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:33.720> design<00:01:34.170> also<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.100> thought

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
didn't look at the design also I thought

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.820 
didn't look at the design also I thought
it<00:01:35.460> would<00:01:35.550> be<00:01:35.670> much<00:01:36.140> sorry<00:01:37.140> about<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> my

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
it would be much sorry about that my

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.790 
it would be much sorry about that my
camera<00:01:38.190> ran<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.550> of<00:01:38.580> memory<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> anyway<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
camera ran out of memory so anyway this

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.669 
camera ran out of memory so anyway this
is<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> field<00:01:41.340> spell<00:01:41.490> zone<00:01:42.229> now<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
is the field spell zone now the

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.499 
is the field spell zone now the
graveyard<00:01:44.250> which<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.759> right<00:01:44.940> here<00:01:45.240> was

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
graveyard which is right here was

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.900 
graveyard which is right here was
supposed<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.080> here<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.550> guess<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.850> was

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
supposed to be here and I guess I was

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.719 
supposed to be here and I guess I was
supposed<00:01:48.300> to<00:01:48.590> put<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> field<00:01:50.039> spell<00:01:50.190> zone<00:01:50.520> on

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
supposed to put the field spell zone on

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.010 
supposed to put the field spell zone on
top<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.390> graveyard<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:54.690> I<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
top of the graveyard so when I make a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.440 
top of the graveyard so when I make a
new<00:01:55.289> version<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.130> I'll<00:01:56.640> probably<00:01:57.060> do

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
new version of this I'll probably do

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:26.949
