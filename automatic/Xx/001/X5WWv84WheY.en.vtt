00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
foundation so the first thing that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.319 
foundation so the first thing that
really<00:00:34.980> caught<00:00:35.250> my<00:00:35.280> eye<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.940> stuff<00:00:36.120> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
really caught my eye about this stuff is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.990 
really caught my eye about this stuff is
that<00:00:36.570> room<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:36.960> actually<00:00:37.320> had<00:00:37.500> testers<00:00:38.430> so

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
that room will actually had testers so

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
that room will actually had testers so
they<00:00:39.120> had<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.629> tiny<00:00:40.020> bottles<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
they had little tiny bottles of the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.490 
they had little tiny bottles of the
foundation<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.180> each<00:00:42.420> color<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> could

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
foundation in each color so you could

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.770 
foundation in each color so you could
put<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.800> actually<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.640> skin<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:44.940> test

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
put it actually on your skin and test

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
put it actually on your skin and test
out<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.590> how<00:00:47.160> well<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.760> stuff<00:00:48.000> matched

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
out to see how well this stuff matched

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.760 
out to see how well this stuff matched
up<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.480> your<00:00:48.660> skin<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.590> I've

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
up with your skin I don't think I've

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.939

ever<00:00:49.800> seen<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.840> drugstore<00:00:51.840> company<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.770> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this just because I could figure out

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
this just because I could figure out
what<00:00:56.879> color<00:00:57.149> matched<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:57.660> skin<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:59.039> best<00:00:59.370> and
