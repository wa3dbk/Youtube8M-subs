this<00:00:49.320> promising<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.250> steering<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.760> light<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
this promising the steering is light and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.250 
this promising the steering is light and
it's<00:00:51.360> vague<00:00:51.539> especially<00:00:52.020> around<00:00:52.110> the

it's vague especially around the
straight<00:00:52.500> ahead<00:00:52.649> basically<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.789> don't

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
straight ahead basically you just don't

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.819 
straight ahead basically you just don't
get<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> sense<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> front<00:00:55.320> wheels<00:00:55.590> are
