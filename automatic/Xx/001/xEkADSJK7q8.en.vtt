00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.610
 to me 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.610
 ah 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.640
 every time we live in more spaces 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.680
 reduced and if for women it is 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.340
 a topic because we always have things that 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.680
 save I think the closets are never 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.739
 Large enough especially for 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.899
 some of us are a bit odd and 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.570
 good comes to me to speak with patricia 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.390
 fernÃ¡ndez she is a specialist in 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.910
 closet designs and it's also a woman 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.969
 very organized to give you some 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.370
 tips on how to keep my closet tidy 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.420
 and how can I keep all my things in 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 a small space 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.230
 everything is very good 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.620
 I do not know 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.550
 I think it's a theme that women 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.550
 we are very worried 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.020
 I see that you have everything with the same 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.299
 hangers yes because the number one of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.210
 the wooden hangers protect you 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.400
 shoulders of dresses pants 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.830
 you are never marked that the others who are 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.470
 Delgaditos you take out and you mark you 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.759
 clear line while this is never 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.740
 going to mark forgiveness is always going to 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.450
 stay round or if you understand 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.580
 nowadays these players are no longer so 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.500
 expensive as they were before your purchase of 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.520
 wood testing was very expensive now 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.159
 it's not worth coordinating by colors and 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.990
 visually when you get up the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.819
 tomorrow and when you do not wear your uniform to 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.039
 try to work that is let's say 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.649
 I put myself visually then it 's more 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.429
 easy to contain their targets their celestial 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.679
 with the pants down because you 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.259
 you can combine white front because 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.630
 those blacks that if I say is all a 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.880
 theme much easier clothes clothing 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.990
 hang and that red 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.130
 and long to see all that are shirts 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.110
 if I advise you to have them 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.239
 hung by a theme come out of the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 laundry and if you fold them after another 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.239
 Once the girl has to iron the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.099
 lines that are mostly the theme of the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.310
 men that have to leave like that is 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.310
 impeccable 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.210
 when the doors of the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.210
 duck closet I was impressed 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.120
 the orderly he looked inept with 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.040
 hooks of the same color I confess that in 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.870
 the closet has a wooden hook and 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.880
 plastic courts hooks that some 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.760
 once they needed hooks that I brought from the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.380
 laundry there is a mix of colors that 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.720
 types messes up a bit 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.940
 microsoft today is used a lot this 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.170
 material that is like synthetics and what 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.920
 you take very to exactly this if you 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.170
 you had all a nice drawers I've 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.390
 had even in the mill where the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.850
 girl likes her bent blouses 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.760
 then they were often material 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.970
 we folded them but had one in each 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.140
 slit then wonder is a luxury 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.060
 total of the pants and I recommend them 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.250
 with data sometimes there are people who like 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.070
 the pants also memories in 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.810
 no drawers or closet so is armed 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.000
 way you open a drawer and there the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.250
 sticks equal the baggy pants 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.660
 money taking in clear of closes the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.220
 drawer then you open a klose of 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.200
 drawers but there are really s pants 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.690
 cabrio other things hung then it is 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.790
 a whole subject the belts come down from the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.650
 personal belts advised us 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.730
 have the hung more hung on ebay 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.440
 adif or you can have them too 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.270
 rolled up to those named by a 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.910
 full capacity issue really is 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.820
 small but if there are people that you have 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.980
 hangers like this long let's say you can 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.890
 hang today they sell some hangers 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.010
 special rounds to remember the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.470
 humidity is definitely an enemy 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.730
 very dangerous that we have in Lima about 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.940
 all of us who live near the sea 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.280
 the duck says you have to open the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.930
 the closet doors every day 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.180
 for a while and you have to shake everything 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.370
 daily that will not build the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.170
 by dust and that fungi do not form 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.209
 the boxes those dinners is also you 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.220
 They serve a lot but if you in my case and 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.230
 I have all the summer poles 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.970
 kept in the house because that's where 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.220
 where do you make your correct change elaborate 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.960
 correct because I do not have more sites but 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.290
 if you had a big closet today 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.420
 the departments the architects more 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.560
 They think of the dining room in 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.560
 the clubs I know it seems fatal 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:43.830
 the portfolios that is a subject for space 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.020
 one that is ventilated and another that we see 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.360
 those that are related to I have forums but 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.099
 if you do not judge groups an evolution and the 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.080
 keep with paper in some and others 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.009
 not the one that he used daily but not 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.009
 this portfolio persists 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.949
 that is a quantity if you are not coming 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:05.099
 to look is to fix the mushrooms and that is not 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.860
 know nothing no longer go out it was already a winter 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.620
 another that we can be to manufacture the 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.599
 it had the same in you but its subject is 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.789
 we have passed in accredita the 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.409
 period opens us the ideal is to plan and 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.180
 design a cross or with a specialist 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.699
 before building it but if you already 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.789
 you have done it is very easy to maximize the 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:27.629
 space and have them organized from a 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.009
 way that is very useful for you I for 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.409
 soon I will not buy my 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:35.149
 wooden hangers and I'm going to put the 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.149
 challenge of maintaining an orderly
