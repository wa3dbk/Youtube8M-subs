00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.000
 I graduated in fine arts and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.220
 time I did not think or teach my class 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.370
 worked in another area worked with 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.750
 I draw there after I stopped to be a mother. 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.350
 and when I came back I ended up getting into the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.879
 contest and then I fell in love and here 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.690
 I stayed 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:01:00.350
 She is a girl who had won a 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.750
 little hat every class I take one 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.580
 This is a way of stimulating 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.450
 children 2 and call the kids 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.340
 because I want to do this project is the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.490
 The time when I started it a show 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.190
 that victory was a show that 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.100
 presented works by modifying the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.570
 environment, the school mobilized to 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.660
 take the kids 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.229
 Do you remember the exhibition that we 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.030
 we were showing the man who was 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.280
 modifying the nature 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.030
 you remember this work that we saw 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.369
 there is of the amaral that work that is the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.710
 amaral tarsila forest 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.770
 Then I asked if they knew a 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.619
 forest and what came at the time 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.479
 they commented on the forest of history 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.570
 of the red little hat and jo 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.790
 So I took some fantasies into the room. 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.460
 the girls wanted to wear all that 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.619
 Obstet the hood and the boys too. 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.479
 They wanted to invest and the girls spoke 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.180
 what a little red riding hood girl 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.490
 Boy did I need to invest there. 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.040
 I liked spoke but it's hats and green. 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.870
 Lemon is everyone has family 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.840
 also had a family she had a 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.730
 brother I got it I showed the work of the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.070
 tarsila family that was a family 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.510
 large then the children were 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.019
 asking why does the family want 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.830
 gandhi were commenting on their family 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.830
 And then I thought it was good so I 'll send it 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.840
 to draw your family but I told you 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.450
 I thought I would not ask the children, I'll go 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.450
 ask the family to get involved 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.500
 He always likes to play the lattes. 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.810
 The phase in which stimulates me is more 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.970
 of people being able to work together 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.970
 It's the most delicious of the future. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.470
 when I said how it would be little caper 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.470
 red a child said she is blond 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.780
 blue eye I said do not apply 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.540
 there are brown princesses 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.270
 Look, I'm going to show you this work. 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.050
 that also of tarsila tarsila do amaral 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.520
 is the name of this work workers 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.900
 Look here, oh, there are some nice people. 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.830
 There are blond people, so how are you? 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.320
 character to be brunette 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.630
 first we put the ink and went 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.900
 make the flowers mix for us 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.940
 perceive this difference of tone 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.250
 Not all were blending love, love. 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.660
 and trying to compare even with the 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.030
 their skin 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.290
 so I think their self-esteem 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.430
 much improved after this activity 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.430
 after this observation 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.600
 When I took my fantasies 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.430
 I took a wolf mask I said 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.140
 need not be afraid because the logo of the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.140
 our story is not a bad wolf 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.180
 soon there a child commented is the wolf of 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.330
 our story the wolf will do what will be 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.850
 that the globe is consuming because the forest 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.530
 is polluted there a child spoke his foot 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.109
 my house has a forest is a 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.590
 Anguilla has bug there there is air there has water 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.170
 it's a forest and I decided I proposed them 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.410
 to pay a visit to the mangrove 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.600
 we do not even have the time to sit down and 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.610
 observe the mangrove because I think 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.560
 his observation of their gaze 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.440
 enriches this look not only for 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.050
 works but for problems even what 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.220
 has them in the neighborhood where they 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.919
 they live 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.710
 from these questions of the 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.430
 children I decided to raise the issues 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.169
 related to garbage is not pollution 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.820
 must always be present in the 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.760
 kindergarten then we got a 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.800
 toy truck that was in 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.570
 school, we adapted it as if 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.080
 it was a truck of them we remember 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:14.590
 That rubbish all over school then. 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.590
 we even made a mascot with this garbage 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.410
 our reunion was already every day 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.050
 growing but the little red cap already 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.780
 there was one thing a family had to 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.660
 Little Red Riding Hood is Little Wolf 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.600
 It's the guanero but she had to have a 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.470
 voice and a lot of strength and schools sao paulo 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.410
 letters then put the back to being leader 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.050
 we went to know my craft from them 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.520
 the making of clay pot and I 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.210
 I also raised other questions 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.240
 which is respect for the elderly 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.090
 we were able to print a net book 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.940
 here for school for the kids and us 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.940
 we decided to make a morning of autographs 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.010
 We invited families to families. 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.680
 have been grateful that people who are 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.900
 The other side always takes at least 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.789
 issue of arts discipline right 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.440
 I found the work of the 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.880
 teacher had the opportunity of a 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.789
 a little when she put the 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.070
 visual literacy that was for me 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:19.250
 a discovery that I imagined as 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.229
 the arts discipline really has this 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.940
 influence as much as Portuguese and 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.669
 mathematics in children's lives 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.840
 expects to receive or see a project like this 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:34.220
 and when it happens we do not believe 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.320
 to think that without writer a child 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.889
 so small of 10 people we do not 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.889
 imagine 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.139
 the regiane involves cultural issues 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:51.900
 ethnic issues art issues 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:55.320
 itself and knows how to make a single 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.900
 of peanuts on these issues because it 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:01.590
 has a particularity that what for me 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:05.430
 it is fundamental that she listen to the children 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:09.450
 She talks to children and she is not talking. 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:12.270
 for the children the regiane does seem 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.940
 with clarity the importance of people listening 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.580
 The child we are looking for ways 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.680
 How many times am I going to tell you? 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.030
 all the way there when a 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.340
 penance is lacking 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.970
 well I'm on the way there, I gotta 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.970
 Continue
