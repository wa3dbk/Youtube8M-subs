myself I was worried for my family I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.559 
myself I was worried for my family I
felt<00:02:07.170> menaced<00:02:07.619> by<00:02:07.709> this<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.060> had<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.360> tell

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
felt menaced by this and I had to tell

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.259 
felt menaced by this and I had to tell
them<00:02:09.780> all<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> creepy<00:02:11.250> things<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:12.239> I

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
them all of the creepy things that I

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.520 
them all of the creepy things that I
have<00:02:12.540> done<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.930> we're<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.230> be

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
have done that we're going to be

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:26.890 
have done that we're going to be
well<00:02:15.040> now<00:02:15.160> why<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.610> funny<00:02:16.090> that's<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.690> mean

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.369 

so<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.650> idea<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.580> if<00:02:29.000> they<00:02:29.239> believe<00:02:30.170> in

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
so the idea is is if they believe in

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.110 
so the idea is is if they believe in
fact<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.709> crime<00:02:30.950> has<00:02:31.160> been<00:02:31.190> committed<00:02:31.430> then

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
fact a crime has been committed then

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.330 
fact a crime has been committed then
they<00:02:32.330> issue<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.750> warrant<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.349> that's<00:02:33.890> exactly

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
they issue a warrant and that's exactly

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.729 
they issue a warrant and that's exactly
what<00:02:34.459> happened<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.840> little<00:02:36.290> bit<00:02:36.500> after

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
what happened and a little bit after

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.809 
what happened and a little bit after
noon<00:02:36.890> today<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.160> guy<00:02:37.550> was<00:02:37.760> arrested<00:02:37.910> now<00:02:39.819> the

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
noon today the guy was arrested now the

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.190 
noon today the guy was arrested now the
creepy<00:02:41.150> stuff<00:02:41.209> was<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.750> had<00:02:44.750> sex

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
creepy stuff was that I have had sex

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.600 
creepy stuff was that I have had sex
with<00:02:45.799> women<00:02:46.129> who<00:02:46.819> work<00:02:47.090> for<00:02:47.330> me<00:02:47.480> on<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.870> show

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
with women who work for me on this show

00:02:48.610 --> 00:03:04.970 
with women who work for me on this show
now<00:02:50.110> my<00:02:51.110> response<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:52.160> yes<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.330> have

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.479 

and<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.180> would<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:07.040> embarrassing<00:03:08.040> if<00:03:08.220> it

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
and and would it be embarrassing if it

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.350 
and and would it be embarrassing if it
were<00:03:08.640> made<00:03:08.910> public

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
were made public

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.809 
were made public
perhaps<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.050> would<00:03:10.200> perhaps<00:03:10.739> who<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.099> is

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
perhaps it would perhaps who it is

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:21.510 
perhaps it would perhaps who it is
especially<00:03:12.540> for<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:12.989> women

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.699 

but<00:03:21.849> that's<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.360> decision<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:22.840> them<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.530> make

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
but that's a decision for them to make

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.229 
but that's a decision for them to make
if<00:03:23.980> they<00:03:24.099> want<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.310> come<00:03:24.430> public<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:25.090> talk

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
if they want to come public and talk

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.660 
if they want to come public and talk
about<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:26.050> relationships<00:03:26.680> if<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:27.099> want<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.400> go
