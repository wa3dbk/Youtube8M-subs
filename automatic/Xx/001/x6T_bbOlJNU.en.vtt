00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.880 

today<00:00:04.680> we<00:00:04.920> have<00:00:05.160> again<00:00:05.700> an<00:00:06.060> iPhone<00:00:06.600> iPhone<00:00:07.049> 4

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
today we have again an iPhone iPhone 4

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.519 
today we have again an iPhone iPhone 4
and<00:00:10.610> again<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.910> power<00:00:12.210> button<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.080> broken<00:00:13.410> I

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
and again the power button is broken I

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.519 
and again the power button is broken I
do<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:17.009> another<00:00:17.460> video<00:00:17.849> showing<00:00:18.449> using<00:00:19.259> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
do have another video showing using a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.409 
do have another video showing using a
tape<00:00:19.919> fixing<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.319> but<00:00:22.319> I<00:00:22.710> actually<00:00:23.249> found<00:00:23.970> a

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
tape fixing it but I actually found a

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.009 
tape fixing it but I actually found a
better<00:00:24.720> solution<00:00:25.409> for<00:00:26.630> that

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.150 

so<00:00:31.429> basically<00:00:32.429> when<00:00:32.820> iPhone<00:00:33.480> 4s<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.890> it's

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
so basically when iPhone 4s and for it's

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.840 
so basically when iPhone 4s and for it's
best<00:00:35.609> that<00:00:36.079> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.289> remove<00:00:37.679> the<00:00:37.920> fret<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
best that you can remove the fret the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.180 
best that you can remove the fret the
screen<00:00:40.820> but<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:43.019> just<00:00:43.500> move<00:00:43.859> these

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
screen but you can just move these

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.759 
screen but you can just move these
cables<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:46.249> reach<00:00:47.249> that<00:00:49.309> screw<00:00:51.379> easy

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
cables and reach that screw easy

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:59.479 
cables and reach that screw easy
so<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.609> damage<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.690> flex<00:00:55.079> cable<00:00:58.280> just<00:00:59.280> like

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
so now damage the flex cable just like

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:23.580 
so now damage the flex cable just like
that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.760 

so<00:01:24.590> here<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.840> have<00:01:27.049> a<00:01:27.079> game<00:01:27.470> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
so here it is you have a game the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.370 
so here it is you have a game the
missing<00:01:28.329> that<00:01:29.329> pin<00:01:29.840> in<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.350> middle<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:35.659> today

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
missing that pin in the middle and today

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.429 
missing that pin in the middle and today
we'll<00:01:36.740> just<00:01:37.130> replace<00:01:38.649> this<00:01:39.649> button<00:01:40.430> itself

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
we'll just replace this button itself

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.600 
we'll just replace this button itself
but<00:01:42.439> first<00:01:42.860> I'll<00:01:43.280> show<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.820> what<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:45.610> to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
but first I'll show you what to do to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.910 
but first I'll show you what to do to
fix<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:50.390> need<00:01:50.570> some<00:01:50.780> glue<00:01:51.170> I'm<00:01:51.619> using

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
fix it so you need some glue I'm using

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.570 
fix it so you need some glue I'm using
the<00:01:52.369> Geo<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:53.450> glue<00:01:53.780> works<00:01:54.200> best<00:01:54.710> for<00:01:54.920> this

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
the Geo to glue works best for this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.279 
the Geo to glue works best for this
I<00:01:57.490> don't<00:01:58.490> think<00:01:59.740> super<00:02:00.740> glue<00:02:01.720> will<00:02:02.720> do<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
I don't think super glue will do the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:20.020 
I don't think super glue will do the
same<00:02:03.560> thing

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.130 

because<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.170> glue<00:02:21.470> kinda<00:02:21.980> becomes<00:02:22.550> like<00:02:23.000> a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
because this glue kinda becomes like a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.730 
because this glue kinda becomes like a
silicon<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> rubber<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.260> can<00:02:27.470> use

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
silicon like a rubber and you can use

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:41.040 
silicon like a rubber and you can use
any<00:02:28.100> type<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.820> wire<00:02:36.100> cut<00:02:37.100> small<00:02:37.520> pieces<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.360> it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:03:03.050 

take<00:02:42.050> some<00:02:42.440> glue

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:14.620 

and<00:03:03.720> take<00:03:04.140> one<00:03:04.470> piece<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.160> wire<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:09.050> place<00:03:10.050> it

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:32.240 

on<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.230> top<00:03:16.620> where<00:03:17.160> blue<00:03:17.670> is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:42.599 

and<00:03:33.250> we'll<00:03:33.760> let<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.359> dry<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:41.170> can<00:03:41.200> do<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:42.370> same

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
and we'll let it dry you can do the same

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.780 
and we'll let it dry you can do the same
thing<00:03:43.090> on<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.980> single<00:03:44.980> button<00:03:45.250> right<00:03:45.760> here

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
thing on the single button right here

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.240 
thing on the single button right here
but<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.950> find<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.219> much<00:03:48.519> more<00:03:48.849> comfortable<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
but I find it much more comfortable to

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.959 
but I find it much more comfortable to
do<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:54.040> single<00:03:55.030> power<00:03:55.420> button<00:03:56.579> here<00:03:57.579> I<00:03:57.639> have

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:57.969 
do it on single power button here I have

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:12.710 
do it on single power button here I have
one<00:03:58.659> or<00:03:59.019> is<00:03:59.260> ready<00:03:59.879> right

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.530 

and<00:04:13.940> after<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.390> glue<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:16.080> dried<00:04:16.560> actually

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
and after the glue is dried actually

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.220 
and after the glue is dried actually
this<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.780> pretty<00:04:19.230> strong<00:04:20.420> and<00:04:21.420> I<00:04:21.840> don't<00:04:21.870> think

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
this is pretty strong and I don't think

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.320 
this is pretty strong and I don't think
it<00:04:22.830> will<00:04:23.100> fail<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:23.580> easy<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:25.760> of<00:04:26.760> course<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
it will fail so easy and of course you

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.400 
it will fail so easy and of course you
don't<00:04:27.570> need<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.840> buy<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.020> new<00:04:29.510> flex<00:04:30.510> cable<00:04:31.170> for

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
don't need to buy a new flex cable for

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.390 
don't need to buy a new flex cable for
that<00:04:31.620> because<00:04:35.600> when<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.630> play<00:04:36.990> with

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
that because when you play with

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.180 
that because when you play with
proximity<00:04:38.400> sensor<00:04:38.910> when<00:04:39.120> iPhone<00:04:39.630> 4<00:04:40.880> sometimes

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
proximity sensor when iPhone 4 sometimes

00:04:43.190 --> 00:05:39.659 
proximity sensor when iPhone 4 sometimes
they<00:04:44.190> stop<00:04:44.490> working

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.040 

just<00:05:40.669> be<00:05:40.819> careful<00:05:41.090> with<00:05:41.569> these<00:05:41.810> flex<00:05:42.259> cables

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
just be careful with these flex cables

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.879 
just be careful with these flex cables
because<00:05:45.050> if<00:05:45.289> you<00:05:45.500> damage<00:05:45.830> them<00:05:47.379> you<00:05:48.379> will<00:05:48.680> need

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
because if you damage them you will need

00:05:48.889 --> 00:06:01.600 
because if you damage them you will need
to<00:05:50.199> buy<00:05:51.199> in<00:05:51.470> your<00:05:51.710> screen<00:05:52.099> for<00:05:52.430> it<00:06:00.220> as<00:06:01.220> you<00:06:01.250> can

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
to buy in your screen for it as you can

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:09.760 
to buy in your screen for it as you can
hear<00:06:01.909> it's<00:06:02.500> clicking<00:06:03.500> already<00:06:08.289> let's<00:06:09.289> put<00:06:09.620> it

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
hear it's clicking already let's put it

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.980 
hear it's clicking already let's put it
all<00:06:09.860> back<00:06:10.190> together<00:06:10.490> and<00:06:10.909> check<00:06:11.569> it<00:06:11.720> out<00:06:13.990> so

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
all back together and check it out so

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:27.110 
all back together and check it out so
it's<00:06:15.319> time<00:06:15.680> to<00:06:16.069> check<00:06:16.639> it

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.780 

the<00:06:28.120> same<00:06:28.389> we<00:06:28.600> can<00:06:28.630> do<00:06:28.960> for<00:06:29.230> iPhone<00:06:29.680> 4s<00:06:30.010> or<00:06:30.490> any

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
the same we can do for iPhone 4s or any

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:38.550 
the same we can do for iPhone 4s or any
other<00:06:31.570> Apple<00:06:32.290> devices<00:06:35.190> but<00:06:36.190> I<00:06:36.430> will<00:06:37.560> recommend

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
other Apple devices but I will recommend

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.629 
other Apple devices but I will recommend
for<00:06:39.010> iPhone<00:06:39.460> 4s<00:06:40.380> to<00:06:41.380> remove<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:41.919> front<00:06:42.250> screen

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
for iPhone 4s to remove the front screen
