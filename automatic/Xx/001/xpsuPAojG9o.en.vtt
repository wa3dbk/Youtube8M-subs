00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
 and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.160
 I'm with Miguel del moral he is 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 director of the international festival of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.180
 animation with the fest that is going to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.160
 performing soon in Queretaro 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.840
 few days and I just want that we 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.110
 talk a little about what this is about 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 hello festival thank you for the interview 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.929
 well, this is a forum for 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.150
 animation in mexico started as a festival 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.890
 of short animation and now precisely 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.660
 we have extended to animation in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.699
 other formats in other media where 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.160
 It is totally linked to the 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.420
 technology and this festival is that one 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.850
 great party of animation for 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.650
 boost this industry and then all 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.720
 have a great time and generate opportunities 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.979
 for animation in our country as 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.080
 it does the people who want to go to the 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.400
 animation because there are two areas one is 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.010
 all the people who applied so 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.839
 international several countries sent their 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.720
 short film in the month of April and 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.210
 you selected I think 128 and 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.580
 so there were 128 shorts in the selection 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.140
 official of more than 6 thousand 632 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.810
 short films that arrive a competition 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.180
 from 54 countries and there is another area that is the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.240
 living market that is this modality as 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.850
 company or as villa and pique is to see today 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 interesting people do not matter because the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.240
 people is not important can be 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.329
 interesting 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.920
 in this area you can attend other 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.240
 activities that are more related to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.250
 the generation of industry that we are 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.409
 proposing this year and what we do 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.970
 to strengthen the industry of the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.310
 animation in our country related 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.289
 with these other branches these other 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.970
 industries as is the technology the 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.710
 connectivity mobility 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 information technology and so on 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.460
 It struck me a lot that this is 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.070
 the fifth edition of this festival and 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.080
 just ten years ago there was nothing 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.850
 or very few things of animation and 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.340
 now there are too many people as you say 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.860
 participated people are interested 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 how do you think it's good 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.069
 industry if there is any and our 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.440
 animation in mexico and where are we going 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.330
 if there is definitely a big boom or 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.250
 growth there are not many schools that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.350
 offer the race but precisely in 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.940
 this great challenge of what we always 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.770
 we ask the industry not industries 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.530
 we know that cinematography is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.900
 just taking off there are few 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.700
 Feature films a year are increasingly being made 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.610
 shorter however because our 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 proposal is that put other industries 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.180
 where is the animation for in 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.160
 together generate these agreements and these 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.660
 opportunities also with the others 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.990
 countries like the United Kingdom case that 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.450
 it's country 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.550
 this year and start generating these 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.620
 links that allow us to strengthen and 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.600
 professionalize the industry and give 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.670
 opportunities for all animators 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.370
 then the living market proposal 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.920
 it's very important and that's where I think 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.260
 we are going to generate agreements so that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.750
 precisely be strengthened and generated 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.310
 also these opportunities for not only 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.830
 those who make movies but also those who 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.110
 are involved in the animation in 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.390
 other of its formats not as it can be 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.370
 the applications the video games sometimes 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.350
 they are the same animators to them 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.630
 dispatches that do this but well I think 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.330
 that all of those areas are very 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.400
 related and people who want to go to 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.990
 court the fest that will see and that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.550
 You need to do because as you say does 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.290
 you mentioned that it was free but 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.690
 Sometimes this doubt of good is going to be 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.030
 a chaos I will be able to enter easy how is it going 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.250
 being this dynamic does not come easy 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.990
 What we recommend is that you register 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.490
 that's where they're going to speed up their access 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.170
 so that they give them their bracelet they arrive at 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.380
 the venues and be much faster the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.540
 income and finally once again have 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.879
 to attend querétaro from the 13th to the 16th 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.000
