to speak on the phone and separately use  the mic

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.020
or together for phone calls

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.560

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.466
in the box we find the headphones

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.560
and the phone jack

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.230
this is the double jack for the PC

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:05.062
individual mic and headphones jacks

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.320
and the one for the phone

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
lets get them out

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.280
this is how they look like

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.440
they are black and red a contrasted red

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.774
that palm is the logo

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.220
the retractable microphone

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880
you can twist it and turn it

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.040
They look pretty good, i dont realy like this triangular shape

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.900
of the of the headphone but i hope they have a good sound quality

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.920
the design is not too serious

00:02:52.163 --> 00:02:54.163
but lets hope that the sound quality is good

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.620
they seem robust

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.660
this is very soft

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.740
and comfortable

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.360
for your ears

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.380
i forgot to specify that they have

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.240
flat cable

00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:14.548
so its not a normal circular cable

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.880
it is flat

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:20.163
to avoid knots

00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:25.528
hope you see well

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.020
to avoid difrent problems, issues

00:03:33.503 --> 00:03:35.503
they are fine

00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:39.701
the cable is 1,5 meters long

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
and the adapter 1 meter

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.440
i think 2,5 meters is more than enough for everybody

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:50.229
anyway they are not made for house running...

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.881
while connected to the PC

00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:53.479
that was it

00:03:54.405 --> 00:03:56.405
and i will come back with microphone test.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.750
So this is how it sounds like

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.110
hope you enjoyed today's review

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.309

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.340
