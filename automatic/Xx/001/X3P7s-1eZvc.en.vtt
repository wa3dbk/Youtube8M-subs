seedling there's two types of Tomatoes
of<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.840> called<00:01:28.100> determinant<00:01:29.100> which

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
of some are called determinant which

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
of some are called determinant which
means<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.180> grow<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> certain<00:01:30.770> height

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
means that they grow a certain height

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
means that they grow a certain height
they<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> certain<00:01:32.700> number<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.000> tomatoes

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
they have a certain number of tomatoes

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.530 
they have a certain number of tomatoes
and<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.680> stop<00:01:34.979> growing<00:01:35.280> those<00:01:36.150> usually

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
and then they stop growing those usually

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
and then they stop growing those usually
stay<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:36.960> bit<00:01:37.110> smaller<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.950> you'll<00:01:38.100> see

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
stay a little bit smaller so you'll see

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
stay a little bit smaller so you'll see
them<00:01:38.430> call<00:01:38.700> patio<00:01:39.210> tomatoes<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.770> in

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
them call patio tomatoes I think in

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.510 
them call patio tomatoes I think in

tomato<00:01:42.060> planters<00:01:43.020> those<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.470> probably<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
tomato planters those are probably the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.490 
tomato planters those are probably the
best<00:01:44.340> ones<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.450> other<00:01:45.600> type<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> called<00:01:46.290> an

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
best ones the other type is called an

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
best ones the other type is called an
indeterminate<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:47.640> which<00:01:48.240> means<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.689> going

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
indeterminate one which means it's going

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.249 
indeterminate one which means it's going
to<00:01:48.990> keep<00:01:49.229> growing<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.860> keep<00:01:51.259> sprouting

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to keep growing and keep sprouting

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.620 
to keep growing and keep sprouting
tomatoes<00:01:52.740> you'll<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> lot<00:01:53.759> more<00:01:54.030> fruit<00:01:54.420> on

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
tomatoes you'll get a lot more fruit on

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.080 
tomatoes you'll get a lot more fruit on
it<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.200> it'll<00:01:55.380> also<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.310> bigger<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it but it'll also be a lot bigger so you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.929 
it but it'll also be a lot bigger so you
may<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.439> problem<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.340> growing

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
may have the the problem of it growing

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
out and we do the same thing on the top

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.320 
out and we do the same thing on the top
of<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> bucket<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:50.550> make<00:02:51.550> sure<00:02:51.820> I've<00:02:52.060> cut

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
of the bucket and make sure I've cut

of the bucket and make sure I've cut
this<00:02:52.540> out<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:53.140> make<00:02:53.530> sure<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.830> is<00:02:54.010> all<00:02:55.410> open

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.410 

one<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.740> these<00:03:02.830> holes<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.460> hole<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
one of these holes is the hole that the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.240 
one of these holes is the hole that the
tomato<00:03:04.720> will<00:03:04.960> come<00:03:05.200> out<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.770> other<00:03:05.920> hole

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
tomato will come out of the other hole

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.520 
tomato will come out of the other hole
is<00:03:06.550> how<00:03:06.760> you're<00:03:06.970> going<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.300> water<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.720> now<00:03:08.440> you

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
is how you're going to water it now you

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.500 
is how you're going to water it now you
can<00:03:08.770> take<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.160> lid<00:03:09.310> off<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.790> water<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.330> but<00:03:10.450> I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
can take the lid off to water it but I

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.030 
can take the lid off to water it but I
think<00:03:10.690> it's<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.900> lot<00:03:11.020> more<00:03:11.230> convenient<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:11.950> the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
think it's a lot more convenient if the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.770 
think it's a lot more convenient if the
lid<00:03:12.190> stays<00:03:12.460> on<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.000> just<00:03:13.030> put<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.630> water

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
lid stays on and you just put the water

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.170 
lid stays on and you just put the water
in<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> hole<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:15.280> now<00:03:15.460> you<00:03:15.520> have<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> bucket

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
in the hole so now you have a bucket

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.050 
in the hole so now you have a bucket
with<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.360> hole<00:03:16.600> in<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.900> bottom<00:03:17.170> here<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.060> what

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
with a hole in the bottom here and what

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.610 
with a hole in the bottom here and what
you<00:03:19.180> want<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.480> do<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.870> take<00:03:20.110> your<00:03:20.350> piece<00:03:20.590> of
