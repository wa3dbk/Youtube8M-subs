00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
individual cases so that's what it looks

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.550

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
they're pretty much the same as the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.589 
they're pretty much the same as the
first<00:02:45.019> films<00:02:45.500> disc<00:02:45.709> art<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.569> I

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.539 
class what people rave about this movie
and<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.540> was<00:03:41.630> quite<00:03:41.900> good<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.319> I'm<00:03:42.680> not<00:03:43.400> having

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
and it was quite good but I'm not having

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.670 
and it was quite good but I'm not having
Hugh<00:03:43.850> Jackman<00:03:44.209> in<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.390> lead<00:03:44.569> role<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:45.530> know

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
Hugh Jackman in the lead role you know

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.099 
Hugh Jackman in the lead role you know
that<00:03:45.859> kind<00:03:46.069> of<00:03:46.160> just<00:03:46.340> left<00:03:46.579> it<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.880> bit<00:03:46.959> empty<00:03:47.959> in

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
that kind of just left it a bit empty in

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.630 
that kind of just left it a bit empty in
my<00:03:48.140> opinion<00:03:48.620> like<00:03:48.799> obviously<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.340> can't<00:03:49.519> be

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
my opinion like obviously it can't be

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.069 
my opinion like obviously it can't be
there<00:03:49.819> because<00:03:49.940> this<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.329> in<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.569> past<00:03:50.810> but

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
there because this is in the past but

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.500 
there because this is in the past but
you're<00:03:51.859> still<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.100> good<00:03:52.340> movie<00:03:52.579> standalone<00:03:53.299> but

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
you're still a good movie standalone but

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.819 
you're still a good movie standalone but
I<00:03:53.569> don't<00:03:53.810> think<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.019> was<00:03:54.109> as<00:03:54.230> great<00:03:54.410> as<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> lot

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
I don't think it was as great as a lot

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.970 
I don't think it was as great as a lot
of<00:03:54.859> people<00:03:54.950> think<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.549> is

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
of people think it is

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.590 
of people think it is
that's<00:03:57.980> first-class<00:03:59.319> discard<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.760> then

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
that's first-class discard and then

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.590 
that's first-class discard and then
finally<00:04:02.989> we<00:04:03.170> have<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.769> Wolverine<00:04:04.220> from<00:04:04.609> 2013

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
finally we have the Wolverine from 2013

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.199 
finally we have the Wolverine from 2013

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
and this is in a thicker case so because

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.759 
and this is in a thicker case so because
it<00:04:08.329> comes<00:04:08.480> with<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.750> UH<00:04:08.780> 3d<00:04:09.200> blu-rays<00:04:09.590> well
