I<00:00:05.330> first<00:00:06.330> heard<00:00:06.480> about<00:00:06.540> 4k<00:00:07.200> through<00:00:07.560> the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
I first heard about 4k through the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.370 
I first heard about 4k through the
director<00:00:08.220> mccaskin<00:00:08.790> he<00:00:09.330> was<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> director

director mccaskin he was the director

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.650 
director mccaskin he was the director
for<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.769> film<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.190> he<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:12.420> worked<00:00:12.599> through

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
for this film and he we worked through

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.089 
for this film and he we worked through
many<00:00:12.900> times<00:00:13.110> before<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.440> he<00:00:13.620> suggested<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.070> us

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
many times before and he suggested to us

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.259 
many times before and he suggested to us
using<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.519> technology<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.059> I'd<00:00:15.150> never

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
using this technology and I'd never

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.609 
using this technology and I'd never
heard<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.839> thought<00:00:16.020> what<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.500> this

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
heard of it and I thought what is this

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.720 
heard of it and I thought what is this
you<00:00:16.830> know<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.130> must<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.400> something

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
you know it must be something

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.890 
you know it must be something
interesting<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.180> my<00:00:18.330> ass<00:00:18.449> comes<00:00:18.630> talking

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
interesting if my ass comes talking

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.689 
interesting if my ass comes talking
about<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.350> he<00:00:20.070> talked<00:00:20.250> about<00:00:20.279> getting<00:00:20.609> all

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
about it and he talked about getting all

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.340 
about it and he talked about getting all
the<00:00:20.789> cameras<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.390> trying<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> do

technologically brand-new and 4k salad

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.459 
technologically brand-new and 4k salad
like<00:00:32.099> exactly<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> right<00:00:33.090> thing<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:34.320> went

the<00:00:39.200> MU<00:00:39.410> has<00:00:39.560> always<00:00:39.650> been<00:00:39.860> very<00:00:40.670> connected

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
the MU has always been very connected

the MU has always been very connected
with<00:00:41.630> new<00:00:41.750> technologies<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.410> know

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
with new technologies you know

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.810 
with new technologies you know
especially<00:00:42.680> in<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.920> studio<00:00:43.250> we<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.580> to<00:00:43.700> use

especially in the studio we like to use

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.490 
especially in the studio we like to use
lots<00:00:44.060> of<00:00:44.150> new<00:00:44.360> synthesizers<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.020> new<00:00:45.200> guitar

of<00:00:48.500> brand-new<00:00:48.950> technology<00:00:49.370> built<00:00:49.580> in<00:00:49.730> I<00:00:49.970> sort

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
of brand-new technology built in I sort

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.670 
of brand-new technology built in I sort
of<00:00:50.360> invented<00:00:50.629> them<00:00:50.780> basically<00:00:51.050> every<00:00:51.530> time<00:00:51.650> I

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
of invented them basically every time I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.990 
of invented them basically every time I
picked<00:00:51.890> up<00:00:51.950> an<00:00:52.070> old<00:00:52.129> vintage<00:00:52.340> guitar<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:52.760> found

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
picked up an old vintage guitar I found

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.880 
picked up an old vintage guitar I found
myself<00:00:53.230> you<00:00:54.230> know<00:00:54.320> playing<00:00:54.530> music<00:00:54.769> that

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
myself you know playing music that

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.320 
myself you know playing music that
sounded<00:00:55.129> like<00:00:55.160> from<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.460> 60s<00:00:55.790> or<00:00:55.820> 70s<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:56.300> I

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
sounded like from the 60s or 70s so I

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.369 
sounded like from the 60s or 70s so I
wanted<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.570> invent<00:00:56.780> something<00:00:56.960> brand<00:00:57.199> news

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
wanted to invent something brand news

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.259 
wanted to invent something brand news
and<00:00:57.530> my<00:00:57.590> girls<00:00:57.980> have<00:00:58.070> got<00:00:58.250> Cales<00:00:58.760> pads<00:00:59.090> and

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
and my girls have got Cales pads and

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.549 
and my girls have got Cales pads and
MIDI<00:00:59.420> controllers<00:00:59.900> and<00:00:59.989> various<00:01:00.290> effects

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
MIDI controllers and various effects

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.840 
MIDI controllers and various effects
built<00:01:00.769> into<00:01:01.010> them<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:01.430> I<00:01:01.460> can<00:01:01.610> run<00:01:01.760> around

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
built into them so that I can run around

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.759 
built into them so that I can run around
on<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.180> stage<00:01:02.360> whilst<00:01:03.019> activating<00:01:03.559> all<00:01:03.650> these

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
on the stage whilst activating all these

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.439 
on the stage whilst activating all these
effects<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.160> go<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:04.519> my<00:01:04.940> guitars<00:01:05.210> are<00:01:05.330> quite

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
effects and go so my guitars are quite

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.450 
effects and go so my guitars are quite
unique<00:01:05.660> in<00:01:05.810> that<00:01:05.840> way<00:01:06.050> yeah<00:01:06.770> our<00:01:06.950> live<00:01:07.100> concert

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
unique in that way yeah our live concert

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.380 
unique in that way yeah our live concert
have<00:01:07.550> always<00:01:07.640> been<00:01:07.759> very<00:01:07.820> important<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.300> us

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
have always been very important to us

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.609 
have always been very important to us
and<00:01:08.509> we<00:01:08.600> put<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.780> lot<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:08.990> effort<00:01:09.259> into<00:01:09.380> the

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
and we put a lot of effort into the

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.410 
and we put a lot of effort into the
visuals<00:01:10.009> or<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.340> video<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.000> can<00:01:11.119> see<00:01:11.300> the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
visuals or the video and you can see the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.940 
visuals or the video and you can see the
colors<00:01:11.690> and<00:01:11.840> everything<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.470> stage<00:01:12.740> set

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
colors and everything and the stage set

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.350 
colors and everything and the stage set
as<00:01:13.100> well<00:01:13.250> we<00:01:13.430> put<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.759> lot<00:01:13.850> of<00:01:13.940> effort<00:01:14.180> into<00:01:14.270> that

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
as well we put a lot of effort into that

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.650 
as well we put a lot of effort into that
so<00:01:14.920> working<00:01:15.920> with<00:01:16.100> Sony<00:01:16.700> 4k<00:01:16.940> cameras<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:17.509> think

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
so working with Sony 4k cameras I think

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.820 
so working with Sony 4k cameras I think
is<00:01:17.750> pretty<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.020> best<00:01:18.170> way<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.320> capture<00:01:18.619> that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
is pretty the best way to capture that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.680 
is pretty the best way to capture that
level<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.190> detail<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.970> color<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.479> color

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
level of detail the color the color

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.060 
level of detail the color the color
quality<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.200> color<00:01:21.350> contrast<00:01:21.560> seems<00:01:21.979> to

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
quality and the color contrast seems to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.529 
quality and the color contrast seems to
be<00:01:22.160> far<00:01:22.430> more<00:01:22.460> superior<00:01:23.000> than<00:01:23.119> anything<00:01:23.390> I've

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539

one<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.870> ways<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.110> want<00:01:35.260> to<00:01:35.350> emphasize

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
one of the ways we want to emphasize

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.930 
one of the ways we want to emphasize
this<00:01:35.890> in<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.070> film<00:01:36.310> was<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.550> actually

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
this in the film was to actually

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.340 
this in the film was to actually
transition<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.570> black<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.930> white<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:38.110> cutter

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
transition to black and white a cutter

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.660 
transition to black and white a cutter
for<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.620> couple<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:38.950> moments<00:01:39.100> so<00:01:39.370> that<00:01:39.490> when<00:01:39.580> you

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
for a couple of moments so that when you

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.010 
for a couple of moments so that when you
come<00:01:39.820> back<00:01:39.940> out<00:01:40.090> again<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.480> reminds<00:01:40.900> you<00:01:40.990> of

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
come back out again it reminds you of

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.480 
come back out again it reminds you of
the<00:01:41.110> sheer<00:01:41.320> power<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.680> how<00:01:41.890> much<00:01:42.040> detail<00:01:42.400> there

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
the sheer power of how much detail there

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.640 
the sheer power of how much detail there
isn't<00:01:42.760> in<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.970> 4k<00:01:43.180> colors<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.290> know<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.560> so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
remember when I first watched HD it was

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.750 
remember when I first watched HD it was
like<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.040> difference<00:02:06.280> between<00:02:06.310> HD<00:02:06.729> a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
like the difference between HD a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.760 
like the difference between HD a
standard<00:02:07.570> definition<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:08.260> difference

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
standard definition the difference

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.410 
standard definition the difference
between<00:02:08.890> 4k<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.640> HD<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:09.940> about<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.240> same

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
between 4k and HD is about the same

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.870 
between 4k and HD is about the same
lesson<00:02:10.890> yeah<00:02:11.890> when<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.130> comes<00:02:12.280> when<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.670> comes

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
lesson yeah when it comes when it comes

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
because you get to see all the

production and all the fans in the venue

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.230 
production and all the fans in the venue
got<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.650> 60<00:02:23.950> 70<00:02:24.220> thousand<00:02:24.580> people<00:02:24.850> there<00:02:25.000> and

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
got the 60 70 thousand people there and

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.790 
got the 60 70 thousand people there and
it's<00:02:25.450> very<00:02:25.959> rarely<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.410> get<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.650> see

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
it's very rarely that you get to see

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.920 
it's very rarely that you get to see
them<00:02:26.950> all<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.250> with<00:02:27.640> 4k<00:02:27.940> when<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.630> camera

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
them all and with 4k when the camera

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.810 
them all and with 4k when the camera
pans<00:02:29.170> around<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.650> literally<00:02:29.890> can<00:02:30.070> see<00:02:30.250> all

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
pans around you literally can see all

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.520 
pans around you literally can see all
their<00:02:31.120> heads<00:02:31.300> all<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.660> details<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.170> almost

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
their heads all the details it almost

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.860 
their heads all the details it almost
seems<00:02:32.770> like<00:02:32.830> everybody's<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.430> focus<00:02:33.840> yeah<00:02:34.840> I

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
seems like everybody's in focus yeah I

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.190 
seems like everybody's in focus yeah I
think<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.170> only<00:02:35.260> 4k<00:02:35.910> Ultra<00:02:36.910> High<00:02:37.030> Definition

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
think it's only 4k Ultra High Definition

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.060 
think it's only 4k Ultra High Definition
will<00:02:38.200> probably<00:02:38.470> become<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.769> standard<00:02:38.920> for

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
will probably become the standard for

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.800 
will probably become the standard for
wall<00:02:39.250> films<00:02:39.610> including<00:02:40.060> concert<00:02:40.390> films<00:02:40.660> you

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
wall films including concert films you

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.850 
wall films including concert films you
know<00:02:40.930> because<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.260> think<00:02:41.320> when<00:02:41.830> people

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
know because I think when people

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.960 
know because I think when people
actually<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.519> themselves<00:02:42.640> and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
actually see it themselves and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.009 
actually see it themselves and
experience<00:02:43.390> themselves<00:02:43.540> there<00:02:43.900> definitely

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
experience themselves there definitely

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.750 
experience themselves there definitely
wants<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.680> their<00:02:44.800> homes<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.250> absolutely

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
wants it in their homes I absolutely

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.220
