00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
we're just using pressure-treated two by

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.580 
we're just using pressure-treated two by
tens<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.600> they've<00:01:06.780> done<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> doubled<00:01:07.470> up

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
tens and what they've done is doubled up

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
tens and what they've done is doubled up
up<00:01:07.920> against<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> foundation<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> right

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
up against the foundation with it right

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
up against the foundation with it right
here<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.439> been<00:01:10.590> lag<00:01:10.920> bolted<00:01:11.400> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
here and then it's been lag bolted in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.550 
here and then it's been lag bolted in
it's<00:01:12.119> been<00:01:12.299> yeah<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> first<00:01:12.960> piece<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.320> shot

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's been yeah the first piece was shot

in<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.040> concrete<00:01:14.250> nails<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.210> lag

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
in with concrete nails and then they lag

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.450 
in with concrete nails and then they lag
the<00:01:15.750> second<00:01:16.110> piece<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.500> through<00:01:17.009> right

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
the second piece right on through right

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.370 
the second piece right on through right
and<00:01:17.670> then<00:01:18.060> they've<00:01:18.299> cut<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> span<00:01:18.990> down<00:01:19.229> as

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and then they've cut the span down as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.950 
and then they've cut the span down as
you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.860> we've<00:01:20.189> got<00:01:20.360> headers<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.780> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you can see we've got headers up here so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.109 
you can see we've got headers up here so
we<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.350> real<00:01:22.830> long<00:01:23.100> spans<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.759> those<00:01:23.939> 2

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
we don't have real long spans on those 2

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
we don't have real long spans on those 2
by<00:01:24.270> 10<00:01:24.540> exactly<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.560> they're<00:01:25.740> 12<00:01:26.040> inches

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
by 10 exactly and then they're 12 inches

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
by 10 exactly and then they're 12 inches
on<00:01:26.490> Center<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.540> that's<00:01:27.689> pretty<00:01:27.990> beefy

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
on Center as well so that's pretty beefy

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.170 
on Center as well so that's pretty beefy
yeah<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> could<00:01:28.950> put<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.250> 16<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.820> centers

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
yeah if you could put them 16 on centers

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.819 
yeah if you could put them 16 on centers
you<00:01:30.299> wouldn't<00:01:30.540> end<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.049> only<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you wouldn't end up with only one and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.010 
you wouldn't end up with only one and
that's<00:01:31.979> how<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.280> sturdy<00:01:32.790> enough<00:01:33.000> sure<00:01:33.479> why<00:01:33.960> do

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that's how not sturdy enough sure why do

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.390 
that's how not sturdy enough sure why do
you<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.320> double<00:01:34.619> up<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.920> outside

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you have to double up on the outside

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.210 
you have to double up on the outside
here<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.470> good<00:01:37.650> nail<00:01:37.860> when<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
here we use the concrete suiting nails

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.830 
here we use the concrete suiting nails
added<00:01:55.920> into<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> concrete<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.479> concrete

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
added into the concrete so this concrete

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
added into the concrete so this concrete
goes<00:01:58.079> down<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> way<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> actually<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.610> can
