00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.150
 slight fork pressure for 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:25.010
 mash them, add a thread 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:30.050

 homogeneous our potato cream ready 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.780
 now we leave it slightly 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.970
 warm up and move on to the second phase 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.760
 let's get started with this recipe 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.570
 now preparing our plaice 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.090
 we will take a baking sheet covered with a 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.000
 paper baking sheet of paper 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.700
 non-stick and we take ours 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.400
 fillets rest them open for good 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.110
 on the bottom of our pan without 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.710
 add any seasoning 15 minutes in 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.260
 180 degrees oven and in the meantime we do 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.550
 let's prepare the pinzimonio we do then 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.690
 a light dip is a thing of its own 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.959
 fresh with some parsley leaves 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.000
 it must not be too aggressive because 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.890
 the fish is a delicate fish and does not want to 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.660
 a too aggressive pizzino 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.440
 we reach abundant oil 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.440
 extra virgin olive oil 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.390
 at this point a pinch of pepper one 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.200
 take a little bit more salt 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.980
 important a few drops of vinegar 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.040
 balsamic of modena and we are ready for 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.300
 emulsify our dip with the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.620
 which we will then dress our own 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.709
 plaice fillets 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.629
 at this point we are going to prepare 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:02.260
 our light turnip of red turnip 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.879
 we clean our red turnip 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:11.840
 so in my case I took it from 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:16.160
 vegetable garden for which we have a fresh turnip 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.940
 we take a pot a pan with 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.419
 very little water to do the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.889
 our sample we put a couple of 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.389
 tablespoons of white wine vinegar 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.380
 let's add a pinch of salt 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.960
 just barely 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.960
 and then squeeze 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:43.379
 the lemon we are ready we only need 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:49.199
 grate our turnip in the way of 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:52.279
 have the flakes ready to garnish the 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.259
 our perfect audience we are ready for 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:57.330

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.909
 just let him keep up the flight then 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.830
 just about thirty seconds and then the 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:05.300
 we write with a skimmer and the 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.990
 our turnip sample is ready 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.990
 would be ready 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.780
 our waiting is over 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:23.190
 cooking 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.400
 we pulled out of the oven at this 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:31.919
 point we can only dress the i 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:35.970
 fillets we are going to take ours 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:40.520
 light pinzimonio that we had prepared 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.139
 we put them a spoon over each 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:48.419
 fillet that reminds you we did 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:51.540
 cook without any seasoning and we are 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:57.129

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:14.889
