00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
updated version on our Altoid stove

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.000 
updated version on our Altoid stove
remember<00:00:06.540> about<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:07.080> don't<00:00:07.379> know<00:00:07.529> almost<00:00:07.799> three

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
remember about I don't know almost three

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339 
remember about I don't know almost three
years<00:00:08.040> ago<00:00:08.220> now<00:00:08.400> we<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:09.030> did<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> thing<00:00:10.110> with<00:00:10.290> how

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
years ago now we I did a thing with how

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.690 
years ago now we I did a thing with how
to<00:00:10.410> do<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.650> allowed<00:00:10.980> towards<00:00:11.280> stove<00:00:11.550> and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
to do this allowed towards stove and

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.879 
to do this allowed towards stove and
here's<00:00:11.849> actually<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.240> original<00:00:12.330> stove<00:00:12.889> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
here's actually the original stove and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.470 
here's actually the original stove and
for<00:00:14.190> three<00:00:14.370> years<00:00:14.549> I've<00:00:14.700> been<00:00:14.730> using<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.269> I

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
for three years I've been using it I

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.510 
for three years I've been using it I
don't<00:00:16.170> know<00:00:16.260> probably<00:00:16.470> at<00:00:16.920> least<00:00:17.190> once<00:00:17.400> a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
don't know probably at least once a

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.550 
don't know probably at least once a
month<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.020> can<00:00:19.050> see<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.350> kind<00:00:19.529> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
month and it's you can see it's kind of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
month and it's you can see it's kind of
discolored<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> screen<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.060> pretty<00:00:21.210> wore

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
discolored and the screen is pretty wore

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.269 
discolored and the screen is pretty wore
out<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> screen<00:00:22.920> by<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.100> way

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
out but it's and the screen by the way

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
out but it's and the screen by the way
is<00:00:23.430> rusted<00:00:23.939> because<00:00:24.300> from<00:00:24.750> time<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.080> time<00:00:25.109> I

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
is rusted because from time to time I

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.960 
is rusted because from time to time I
use<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> rubbing<00:00:26.010> alcohol<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
use a rubbing alcohol in here and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.120 
use a rubbing alcohol in here and
rubbing<00:00:27.689> alcohol<00:00:27.810> has<00:00:28.230> water<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
rubbing alcohol has water in it's not a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.339 
rubbing alcohol has water in it's not a
had<00:00:29.310> percent<00:00:29.609> alcohol<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.210> heat<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.750> or<00:00:31.019> or

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
had percent alcohol like heat is or or

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.290 
had percent alcohol like heat is or or
denatured<00:00:32.009> alcohol<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.759> I'll<00:00:32.940> leave<00:00:33.149> some

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
denatured alcohol and I'll leave some

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.720 
denatured alcohol and I'll leave some
water<00:00:33.540> residue<00:00:33.899> behind<00:00:34.260> it'll<00:00:34.440> rust<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.950> but

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
water residue behind it'll rust it but

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.360 
water residue behind it'll rust it but
you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> thing<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.510> still<00:00:36.690> usable

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
you can see the thing is still usable

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.010 
you can see the thing is still usable
and<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> fiberglass<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.360> still<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and the fiberglass is still just like it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020 
and the fiberglass is still just like it
was<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.530> used<00:00:40.800> white<00:00:41.040> fiberglass<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.820> did

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
was I used white fiberglass if I did

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.270 
was I used white fiberglass if I did
this<00:00:42.270> now<00:00:43.200> today<00:00:43.440> I've<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> pink<00:00:44.010> stuff

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
this now today I've got the pink stuff

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
this now today I've got the pink stuff
but<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.390> don't<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.870> use<00:00:46.079> fiberglass

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
but now you don't have to use fiberglass

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
but now you don't have to use fiberglass
you<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.219> use<00:00:47.370> vermiculite<00:00:47.910> which<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you can use vermiculite which is a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
you can use vermiculite which is a
forest<00:00:49.289> rock<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.370> you'll<00:00:50.489> need<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> use

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
forest rock but you'll need to use

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
forest rock but you'll need to use
regular<00:00:51.210> house<00:00:51.360> screen<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.960> should<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
regular house screen you should do that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
regular house screen you should do that
because<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> finer<00:00:53.340> than<00:00:53.520> fiberglass<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
because it's a finer than fiberglass is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
because it's a finer than fiberglass is
and<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.170> purpose<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> fiberglass<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and the purpose of the fiberglass that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.799 
and the purpose of the fiberglass that
I've<00:00:56.489> been<00:00:56.610> asked<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.910> supply<00:00:57.120> several<00:00:57.480> people

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I've been asked to supply several people

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
I've been asked to supply several people
it<00:00:58.500> slows<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> evaporation<00:00:59.579> down<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it slows the evaporation down on the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
it slows the evaporation down on the
alcohol<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.690> allows<00:01:00.899> them<00:01:01.050> more<00:01:01.199> control<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
alcohol and allows them more control to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
alcohol and allows them more control to
burn<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.850> put<00:01:03.059> straight

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
burn now if you just put straight

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660 
burn now if you just put straight
alcohol<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
alcohol in there you can do that the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.100 
alcohol in there you can do that the
only<00:01:05.850> problem<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> there's<00:01:06.600> there's<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
only problem is there's there's the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.109 
only problem is there's there's the
distinct<00:01:07.650> possibility<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.400> alcohol<00:01:08.760> begin

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
distinct possibility the alcohol begin

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
distinct possibility the alcohol begin
to<00:01:09.240> boil<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> does<00:01:10.770> it'll<00:01:10.979> start

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to boil and if it does it'll start

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.969 
to boil and if it does it'll start
splashing<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.510> everywhere

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
splashing out and get it everywhere

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.410 
splashing out and get it everywhere
anyway<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.340> we're<00:01:14.430> gonna<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.240> like

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
anyway what we're gonna do is just like

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.980 
anyway what we're gonna do is just like
we<00:01:15.540> did<00:01:15.689> last<00:01:15.720> time<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> take<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
we did last time I'm going to take the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
we did last time I'm going to take the
screen<00:01:18.990> which<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.189> guttering<00:01:20.670> screen<00:01:20.970> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
screen which is a guttering screen this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.520 
screen which is a guttering screen this
is<00:01:21.180> actually<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> same<00:01:21.840> piece<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.320> had

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
is actually the same piece that I had

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.090 
is actually the same piece that I had
and<00:01:23.460> cut<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> chunk<00:01:24.390> off<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.810> mark<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and cut a chunk off I mark it at the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
and cut a chunk off I mark it at the
desired<00:01:26.400> width<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.540> its<00:01:27.689> head<00:01:27.810> about

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
desired width you know its head about

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.289 
desired width you know its head about
three<00:01:28.259> inches<00:01:28.500> wide<00:01:28.880> couple<00:01:29.880> inches<00:01:29.970> let<00:01:30.240> me

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
it out a little bit to cover the bottom

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.090

then<00:01:49.280> I'll<00:01:49.580> snapped<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.150> piece<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.479> screen<00:01:50.690> to

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
then I'll snapped a piece of screen to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.830 
then I'll snapped a piece of screen to
place<00:01:51.050> just<00:01:51.080> like<00:01:51.560> we<00:01:51.740> did<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:51.950> last<00:01:52.040> time<00:01:55.840> so

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
place just like we did the last time so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.560

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
but the difference is instead of using a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.280 
but the difference is instead of using a
little<00:02:00.890> post<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.550> this<00:02:01.729> one<00:02:01.880> has<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:03.020> post
