00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
especially on the inner corner because i

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.370 
especially on the inner corner because i
have<00:05:25.190> monolids<00:05:26.080> so<00:05:27.850> it<00:05:28.850> tends<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.420> crease

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.030 
there so whatever color you're using you
just<00:05:34.040> want<00:05:34.250> to<00:05:34.310> take<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.670> same<00:05:34.910> color<00:05:35.290> and<00:05:39.040> put
