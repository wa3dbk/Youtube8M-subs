 we are also going to occupy ground pepper 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.390
 I think it was not ground and we're going to 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:53.750
 occupy this franck's salsita that is 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.089
 for the wings especially buffalo well 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.359

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.739
 mark for wings that good I hope that 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.530

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.479
 approach dracula which are about 4 garlic 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.270
 teeth that we are also going to occupy and the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.539
 guilty of our markets the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.330
 butter so let's occupy 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:17.030
 also chile guajillo that are only 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.520
 the veins are going to occupy chicken wings 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.750
 of course more or less what of three 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.970
 pounds well clean oil and also 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.520
 the juice of a lemon I hope you grab 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.759
 the juiciest the first thing we're going to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.149
 to do is to boil our outputs 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.170
 for 15 minutes only so that 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.509
 we will not be left 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.940
 raw at the time of following the steps 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.950
 next we will also put a 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.060
 teaspoon 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.090
 and chicken powder chicken broth and the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.189
 we will cover in the pot in which we 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.439
 we heat the water to bathe 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.969
 they agree good I am I remember and if not 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.860
 Well, surely you had 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.619
 shower or even the heater 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.299
 electrical the next step that we're going to 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.490
 to do is that we're going to put the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.640
 butter inside our blender 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.910
 and we're going to put the garlic 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.099
 grind so it does not matter if you do not rip 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.049
 this butter that what we want is 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.420
 mix that flavor with the 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.829
 Butter and garlic will be more 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.209
 or less this pasta as you can see and 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.489
 super easy the next step is that 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.260
 let's spend a little toasting the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.079
 guajillo chile seeds what good 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.150
 that does not remember the roast we do 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:35.030
 with chile my mom who would barbara towards a 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.799
 will give in there we go running open 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.870
 the windows so that the chile will be read 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.640
 but well let's just leave it for 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.410
 a minute not a lot I do not want to be 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.890
 go burn because if you do not you do not have the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.829
 good taste we add the butter as 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.510
 you can see is something quick either 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.370
 we leave so much time because you can 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.739
 burn let's add add the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.950
 we are going to add also the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.680
 ground pepper and also the parsley 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.709
 so we are going to stir, although it is 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.200
 a little bit just a little while and 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.480
 let's add the buffalo sauce 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.670
 as I tell you there are different brands that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.370
 you can find especially this 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.139
 kind to make wings so it's good I 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.330
 add here in the sauce we're going to 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:21.440
 try to see how it is 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.390
 we're going to keep trying all of our 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.230
 content always because good I do not know if 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.970
 have seen that there are people who 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.800
 on television as it does not prove its 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.240
 Food I say well maybe not them 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.770
 it was so good it 's also 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.530
 think they did not put salt but 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.980
 well we have our wings 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.580
 I'm taking out of the water and we're going to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.860
 dry them perfectly so that they do not 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.410
 at the time of pouring the oil salt 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.180
 let's go then to jump a few droplets 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.730
 and do not leave third degree burns 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.340
 Of course we do not want that true 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.990

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:52.370
 appetite and we are already hungry and then nothing 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:54.800
 more than saying more than I'm already there 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.860
 is that it's really here I have my 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.320

 putting the juice of a lemon friends is 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.920
 optional but they have to do it because 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:22.340
 gives them a flavor so rich and so more 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.260

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.350

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.000
 lemon zest to give it that 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.160
 Scented touch really is a delight 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.040
 that can not be lost even for 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.200
 those moments of football either from 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.520
 the fight that by the way is going to fight for 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.009

 my husband but good this occasion then 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.560

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.990
 wings that the good I accompanied him with a 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.669

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.810
 rich be in another world seriously 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.900
 good once of milk but really 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.000
 very rich riquÃ­simas falls short if 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.250
 will remove the verbatim recipe 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.020
 the bones are going to stay like this if not 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.720
