 Hi guys I am never the Gomes and Ears mans podcasts Century 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.420
 today is the purest September 2011 you will with their 200 of the man Punk Rock 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.839
 Pop punk places 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.550
 Ounces of today's topic were about protection and they made sections 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.750
 Desire to learn and know the compulsory education and freedom brings us 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.890
 want 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.890
 that is fundamentally different forms of schooling and that no one is forced 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.599
 to attend a school 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.699
 compulsory education everyone was entitled to self-determined education 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.790
 mandatory attendance 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.470
 Finally, for about ten million children and adolescents in 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.710
 Germany depending on the state for nine or ten years 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.530
 about 200 days a year for every few hours rehab state or from 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.310
 State recognized school have to introduce 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.900
 The young people are obliged to spend so much time 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.420
 to spend a place 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.060
 View can not choose by itself 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.170
 alone is a huge cut in her freedom 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 however, the actual extent of bondage depends on it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.500
 which are created in schools 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.440
 Patronizing in everyday school life 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.400
 the state and also the mostly non-state schools are one 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.100
 characterized considerable power differentials and designed largely authoritarian 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.310
 give the honor instructions and students have to submit 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.299
 although Atto's children are very much alive and constantly in motion 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.390
 if committed to sit still for several hours daily 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.090
 on and just sharing with other children their social skills 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.000
 strengthens and learns children best from other children 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.310
 they are not allowed to chat with friends except during the break 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.490
 they have to do whatever the teacher asks them to do 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.380
 and they have their natural willingness to acquire one 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.520
 Subordinate unnatural 45-minute tact 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.830
 that if they had to go to the bathroom would have to allow that 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.890
 As far as the interests of the students are concerned, they are hardly taken into consideration 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.130
 the teacher is left with his own opinion of the students 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.140
 mostly not on their wishes and needs it comes at your discretion 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170
 the teacher 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.479
 however, the scope of teachers gives students more freedom 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.670
 Grant is quite limited as it would be a government contract 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.960
 have enforced and are required to have the upper hand over Celle 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.930
 to keep 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.450
 for a specific learning 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.049
 Children are curious by nature and learning spaces everyone forced all sorts of things 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:07.610
 things 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.390
 in conventional schools when children and adolescents are forced to do things too 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.740
 would like to learn to prepare them and they may not care 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.709
 Find 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.069
 Students are not only prescribed what they learn but also on what 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.390
 wise 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.819
 they should learn between time and by what people 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.659
 through a variety of smaller and larger performance control and their 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.760
 Grading we tried 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.989
 also subject students to keep on track 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.629
 The original joy of learning goes on so many students over time 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.579
 lost 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.379
 At first, most children would still be relatively reluctant to go to school 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.730
 With a lot of learning to learn, he says he can do something 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.220
 At a considerable part, higher grades are 64 units for many 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.189
 Students do not recognize what they should be good for 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.689
 Much is simply unimportant for them, much just too detailed 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.699
 the students have different interests and are nevertheless forced 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.789
 all largely the same to learn 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.869
 For some it may not seem that bad at first, but who? 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.079
 does not anyone know that tells a long broad life story or 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.249
 something else just not at all interested one tries friendly that 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.489
 End conversation but keep going at Red Hill and leave one 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.689
 also do not go 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.669
 you are bored and keep hoping for a speedy end or one 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.899
 escape 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:13.740
 so far 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.119
 so unpleasant 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.749
 Absolutely it would be so that one of the unbidden achieve even more 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.550
 asked to play 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.300
 that was a withdrawal 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.930
 formally subsequently informed by him would get whether you have done well 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:27.750
 in everyday life 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.310
 When most people find that unreasonable for students, that is 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.770
 Everyday life you have to miss them for years with those of others 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.180
 Deal with content if explicitly not interested 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.060
 those students who are interested in a country theme 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.330
 Linde is often under-challenged for himself and is supposed to be in step by step with distance learning 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.780
 As she curls her curiosity the students are supposed to be laid out 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.650
 Do not care about things that are not yet known to Rich 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.550
 but not only because of Ems school authorities teaching content 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.810
 meaningful are the criticize rather that the state should be at all before 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.349
 Write what they have to know and think 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.580
 the actual problem 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.450
 In our opinion, not the eggs obsolete teachers forced Taylor as 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.949
 calculator 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.449
 akz-i Rome the school, however, is not just knowledge transfer but 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.619
 also has an educational mission 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:17.139
 even if today's educational goal propagated strongly from the earlier 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.319
 Times are almost progressive sounds and the sounds 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.360
 Spanking and long since abolished is so the whole 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.680
 Functioning school not suitable liberal or democratic values 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.779
 to promote 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.989
 For example, while the school claims to be self-employed 

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:34.929
 think educate yourself by going for a journal Nature 

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:38.559
 Morals seem to be just the opposite who are hard to learn what they are doing 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:40.819
 it is said 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.169
 Now here must be in today's city school ubiquitous sitting stills of

 Censorship penalty tasks Valley and references

 meanwhile, that the conversation with the parents is little 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.860
 undemocratic structures 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.689
 In school, so obviously domination began over the students 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.639
 In a democratic state, one expects that the ruled 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.430
 to the principle is the possibility of living together according to their 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.919

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.220
 although they do not by far make the largest share of school people 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.759
 namely over 90 percent 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.639

 In a rule violation, their ticket is not as innocent for so long 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.289
 until a debt has been proven 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.069
 just one more note 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.070
 compulsory education was in Germany by the Nazis 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.159
 in the context of wealth not law introduced 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.460

 I wish you a nice day
