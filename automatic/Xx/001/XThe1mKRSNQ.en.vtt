towards<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.230> top<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.710> simulate<00:03:20.130> flames

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.010 

inside<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:26.160> can<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:26.600> if<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.690> could<00:03:27.750> get<00:03:27.990> a

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
inside you can see if I could get a

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.890 
inside you can see if I could get a
focus<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:29.580> have<00:03:29.730> these<00:03:29.910> studs<00:03:30.270> in<00:03:30.480> here<00:03:30.690> that

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
focus you have these studs in here that

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.640 
focus you have these studs in here that
these<00:03:31.500> flames<00:03:31.800> go<00:03:31.980> into<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:34.260> if<00:03:34.350> you're<00:03:34.440> doing

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
these flames go into and if you're doing

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.920 
these flames go into and if you're doing
stop<00:03:34.830> motion<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.400> guess<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.300> could<00:03:36.330> actually

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
stop motion I guess you could actually

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.740 
stop motion I guess you could actually
simulate<00:03:37.700> burning<00:03:38.700> flames<00:03:38.940> by<00:03:39.270> taking<00:03:39.630> one

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
simulate burning flames by taking one

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.940 
simulate burning flames by taking one
frame<00:03:41.540> twisting<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.690> these<00:03:43.020> flames<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.770> little

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
frame twisting on these flames a little

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.110 
frame twisting on these flames a little
bit<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.220> make<00:03:44.460> them<00:03:44.640> look<00:03:44.730> like<00:03:44.850> they're

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
bit to make them look like they're

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.140 
bit to make them look like they're
flickering<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.690> jumping<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:47.400> guess<00:03:47.970> even

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
flickering and jumping and I guess even

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.660 
flickering and jumping and I guess even
to<00:03:48.450> change<00:03:48.900> their<00:03:49.140> height<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.520> switch

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
to change their height you just switch

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:59.090 
to change their height you just switch
them<00:03:50.820> around<00:03:55.850> there<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:56.910> go<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.560> there<00:03:58.980> you

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
them around there you go and there you

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.530 
them around there you go and there you
have<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.250> sticker<00:03:59.580> on<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.850> front<00:03:59.880> of<00:04:00.240> this<00:04:00.330> one

lamp<00:05:04.840> for<00:05:05.840> turn<00:05:06.139> signals<00:05:06.560> looks<00:05:06.770> like<00:05:06.949> I<00:05:07.070> guess

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
lamp for turn signals looks like I guess

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.670 
lamp for turn signals looks like I guess
rear<00:05:08.330> view<00:05:08.360> mirrors<00:05:08.810> as<00:05:09.400> an<00:05:10.400> antenna<00:05:10.699> I<00:05:11.680> guess

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
rear view mirrors as an antenna I guess

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.770 
rear view mirrors as an antenna I guess
that's<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:13.099> that's<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.669> splasher<00:05:14.150> for<00:05:14.479> when<00:05:14.690> he

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
that's a that's a splasher for when he

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.010 
that's a that's a splasher for when he
needs<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.820> what<00:05:16.820> needs<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.360> respond<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.960> an

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
needs to what needs to respond to an

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:28.390 
needs to what needs to respond to an
emergency<00:05:22.479> and<00:05:24.639> on<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.759> side<00:05:25.970> here<00:05:27.280> just<00:05:28.280> get

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
emergency and on the side here just get

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.779 
emergency and on the side here just get
a<00:05:28.430> focus<00:05:29.620> put<00:05:30.620> this<00:05:30.770> into<00:05:31.009> that<00:05:31.220> stud<00:05:31.550> hole

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
a focus put this into that stud hole

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.499 
a focus put this into that stud hole
right<00:05:32.030> there<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.750> that's<00:05:33.740> where<00:05:33.860> his<00:05:34.509> fire

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
right there and that's where his fire

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.409 
right there and that's where his fire
extinguisher<00:05:35.990> extinguish<00:05:36.680> it<00:05:36.800> goes<00:05:36.949> and<00:05:37.520> I

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
extinguisher extinguish it goes and I

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:39.879 
extinguisher extinguish it goes and I
guess<00:05:38.599> I<00:05:38.720> could<00:05:38.840> also<00:05:38.960> function<00:05:39.440> as<00:05:39.590> an

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
guess I could also function as an

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:46.540 
guess I could also function as an
exhaust<00:05:40.220> pipe<00:05:41.229> or<00:05:42.229> maybe<00:05:42.440> not<00:05:45.340> let's<00:05:46.340> get<00:05:46.520> a

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
exhaust pipe or maybe not let's get a

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.920 
exhaust pipe or maybe not let's get a
better<00:05:46.759> focus<00:05:47.180> cuz<00:05:47.330> this<00:05:47.509> and<00:05:47.690> not<00:05:47.750> working

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
better focus cuz this and not working

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.870 
better focus cuz this and not working
too<00:05:48.139> well<00:05:48.169> that<00:05:49.070> would<00:05:49.219> be<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.490> exhaust<00:05:49.759> pipe

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
too well that would be the exhaust pipe

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.379 
too well that would be the exhaust pipe
of<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.240> bike<00:05:50.419> itself<00:05:50.889> justice<00:05:51.889> for<00:05:52.099> his<00:05:52.389> for

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
of the bike itself justice for his for

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.480 
of the bike itself justice for his for
his<00:05:53.479> duty<00:05:53.810> and<00:05:54.289> it's<00:05:54.889> a<00:05:54.949> dual<00:05:55.130> exhaust

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
his duty and it's a dual exhaust

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.089 
his duty and it's a dual exhaust
apparently<00:05:55.969> he<00:05:56.090> has<00:05:56.180> a<00:05:56.210> pretty<00:05:56.509> cool<00:05:56.659> bike

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.550 

that's<00:06:01.099> just<00:06:01.430> like<00:06:01.699> that

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.350
