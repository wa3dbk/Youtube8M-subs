that<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.570> might<00:03:16.810> pick<00:03:16.990> today<00:03:17.260> was<00:03:17.530> with<00:03:17.709> a

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
that I might pick today was with a

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.100 
that I might pick today was with a
broken<00:03:18.220> controller<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.060> what<00:03:19.840> was<00:03:19.959> broken

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
broken controller and what was broken

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.979 
broken controller and what was broken
about<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:21.070> left<00:03:21.670> joystick<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.810> used

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
about it the left joystick that you used

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.560 
about it the left joystick that you used
to<00:03:23.140> run<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:24.160> would<00:03:24.430> spaz<00:03:24.700> out<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.239> couldn't

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
to run it would spaz out and I couldn't

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.500 
to run it would spaz out and I couldn't
run<00:03:26.440> with<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.220> if<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:27.700> try<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:27.940> run<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.269> with

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
run with it so if I try to run it with

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.690 
run with it so if I try to run it with
just<00:03:28.570> like<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> boo-boo<00:03:29.110> point<00:03:29.950> my<00:03:30.070> what<00:03:30.550> what

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
just like a boo-boo point my what what

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.210 
just like a boo-boo point my what what
the<00:03:30.790> fuck<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.989> couldn't<00:03:32.860> drop

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
the fuck is this and I couldn't drop

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.460 
the fuck is this and I couldn't drop
shot<00:03:33.519> with<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.820> sometimes<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.390> think<00:03:34.690> sometimes

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
shot with it sometimes I think sometimes

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.900 
shot with it sometimes I think sometimes
it<00:03:35.800> would<00:03:35.860> work<00:03:36.010> sometimes<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.580> wouldn't<00:03:36.850> I

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
it would work sometimes it wouldn't I
