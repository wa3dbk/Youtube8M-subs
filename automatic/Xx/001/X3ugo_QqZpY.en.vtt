samurai<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:48.859> decided<00:00:49.609> just<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.120> winch<00:00:50.420> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
samurai I decided just to winch the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.680 
samurai I decided just to winch the
samurai<00:00:50.989> side<00:00:51.500> words<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:52.640> get<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:52.940> up<00:00:53.089> to<00:00:53.570> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
samurai side words and get it up to the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.259 
samurai side words and get it up to the
back<00:00:53.839> of<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.050> record<00:01:00.460> this<00:01:01.460> may<00:01:01.730> seem<00:01:01.789> like<00:01:02.210> a

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
back of the record this may seem like a

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.930 
back of the record this may seem like a
time-consuming<00:01:02.749> process<00:01:03.430> but<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.460> think<00:01:04.790> it

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
time-consuming process but I think it

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.390 
time-consuming process but I think it
would<00:01:05.089> have<00:01:05.180> been<00:01:05.300> a<00:01:05.659> lot<00:01:05.960> worse<00:01:06.200> if<00:01:06.740> we<00:01:07.070> had

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
would have been a lot worse if we had

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.520 
would have been a lot worse if we had
gotten<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.940> wrecker<00:01:08.120> stock<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.020> had<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.320> try

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
gotten the wrecker stock and had to try

gotten the wrecker stock and had to try
and<00:01:09.680> winch<00:01:09.860> both<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.370> samurai<00:01:10.790> end<00:01:11.090> the
