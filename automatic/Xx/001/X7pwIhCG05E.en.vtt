in finding a franchise quarterback Ryan
Fitzpatrick<00:03:35.940> had<00:03:36.540> nothing<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.110> do<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.380> this

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
Fitzpatrick had nothing to do with this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.410 
Fitzpatrick had nothing to do with this
win<00:03:37.740> while<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.490> Raiders<00:03:38.850> are<00:03:39.000> committed<00:03:39.390> to

win while the Raiders are committed to

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.390 
win while the Raiders are committed to
Derek<00:03:39.810> Carr<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.560> think<00:03:40.800> he'll<00:03:40.950> play<00:03:41.160> well

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
Derek Carr and I think he'll play well

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.460 
Derek Carr and I think he'll play well

longer than Michael Sam ever has you get
it<00:04:06.510> once<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.810> quarterback<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.770> other<00:04:07.920> one

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
it once a quarterback and the other one

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.120 
it once a quarterback and the other one
is<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.220> gay<00:04:08.580> oh<00:04:09.410> I'm<00:04:10.410> sorry<00:04:10.590> Joe<00:04:10.800> do<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:10.950> know

is a gay oh I'm sorry Joe do you know

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.910 
is a gay oh I'm sorry Joe do you know
someone<00:04:11.400> who<00:04:11.550> has<00:04:11.580> that<00:04:11.970> at<00:04:12.300> any<00:04:13.170> rate<00:04:13.470> while

neither<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.430> these<00:04:14.550> defenses<00:04:15.150> whelming<00:04:15.570> I

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
neither of these defenses whelming I

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.090 
neither of these defenses whelming I
think<00:04:15.900> both<00:04:16.109> quarterbacks<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.859> receivers

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
think both quarterbacks and receivers

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.000 
think both quarterbacks and receivers
are<00:04:17.579> evenly<00:04:17.940> matched<00:04:18.060> but<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.690> duo<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.290> McCoy

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
are evenly matched but the duo of McCoy

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.250 
are evenly matched but the duo of McCoy
and<00:04:20.190> sproles<00:04:20.519> are<00:04:20.820> far<00:04:21.450> better<00:04:21.690> than<00:04:21.870> Trent

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
and sproles are far better than Trent

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.500 
and sproles are far better than Trent
Richardson<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.890> Ahmad<00:04:23.310> Bradshaw<00:04:23.580> who<00:04:24.300> by<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
Richardson and Ahmad Bradshaw who by the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.610 
Richardson and Ahmad Bradshaw who by the
way<00:04:24.600> if<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.780> haven't<00:04:25.020> noticed<00:04:25.050> Trent

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
way if you haven't noticed Trent

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.140

Richardson<00:04:26.070> has<00:04:26.190> put<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.430> far<00:04:26.790> too<00:04:27.000> much

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
Richardson has put on far too much

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.850 
Richardson has put on far too much
muscle<00:04:27.450> since<00:04:27.810> his<00:04:27.930> junior<00:04:28.290> year<00:04:28.320> at<00:04:28.620> Bama

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
muscle since his junior year at Bama

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.070 
muscle since his junior year at Bama
which<00:04:29.370> is<00:04:29.520> why<00:04:29.700> he's<00:04:29.940> no<00:04:30.210> longer<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.660> good<00:04:30.870> ball

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
which is why he's no longer a good ball

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
carrier and that is why the only thing

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.600 
carrier and that is why the only thing
that<00:04:33.480> I<00:04:33.510> see<00:04:33.840> being<00:04:34.110> more<00:04:34.350> painful<00:04:34.920> than<00:04:35.280> Trent

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
that I see being more painful than Trent
