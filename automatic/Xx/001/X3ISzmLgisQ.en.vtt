Mother's Day is a joyous time Mother's
Day<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.430> me<00:05:42.790> means<00:05:43.390> a<00:05:43.900> global<00:05:44.440> notion<00:05:44.770> of

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
Day to me means a global notion of

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.950

motherhood<00:05:45.220> I<00:05:45.520> can't<00:05:45.820> help<00:05:45.970> think<00:05:46.240> about<00:05:46.480> the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
motherhood I can't help think about the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.740 
motherhood I can't help think about the
mothers<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.740> all<00:05:47.920> the<00:05:48.160> Iraqi<00:05:48.700> civilians<00:05:49.480> and

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
mothers of all the Iraqi civilians and

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.470 
mothers of all the Iraqi civilians and
soldiers<00:05:49.960> who<00:05:50.620> are<00:05:50.650> dying<00:05:51.460> every<00:05:51.940> single<00:05:52.330> day

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
soldiers who are dying every single day

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.270 
soldiers who are dying every single day
I<00:05:52.780> can't<00:05:53.110> help<00:05:53.230> thinking<00:05:53.560> about<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.920> mothers

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
I can't help thinking about the mothers

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.420 
I can't help thinking about the mothers
of<00:05:54.550> our<00:05:54.910> own<00:05:55.510> soldiers<00:05:55.950> who<00:05:56.950> are<00:05:56.980> being<00:05:57.220> killed

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
of our own soldiers who are being killed

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.260 
of our own soldiers who are being killed
every<00:05:57.640> day

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
every day

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.750 
every day
I<00:05:58.330> think<00:05:58.960> Mother's<00:05:59.260> Day<00:05:59.440> is<00:05:59.500> a<00:05:59.740> day<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.980> bring

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
I think Mother's Day is a day to bring

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.120 
I think Mother's Day is a day to bring
violence<00:06:01.110> against<00:06:02.110> our<00:06:02.230> children<00:06:02.440> to<00:06:02.770> an<00:06:02.920> end

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
violence against our children to an end
