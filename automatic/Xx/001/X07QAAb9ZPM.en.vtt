00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 today is a day especially the 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.670
 willing to marry ladies do not miss 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.770
 should live with easier than us 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.840
 Show them how they are styled to good 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.120
 Going wedding because I always have to say 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.700
 at a wedding just when it comes to the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.529
 Church wedding then I think 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
 women always want only one thing 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.600
 namely marry beautiful white or yes 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 very classic note but there is also 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.350
 different knows either 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.500
 cracked white or cream white or 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.960
 pure white and that plays a big role 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.210
 because he's not you're seiling 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.430
 Consultant now not only in relation to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.649
 on bridal wear but I believe that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.059
 the most important day of life there wants 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.920
 Woman just look like one 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.930
 princess and then it is natural 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.700
 Great if you have someone at your side 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.399
 How do you really get there ? 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.739
 leads and then everything actually thinks yes 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.329
 Exactly so I always recommend a few 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.660
 to make vitamins 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.120
 we'll discuss everything first 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.489
 color style of the dress bridal bouquet and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.519
 make up was of course that day 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.310
 Every woman looks beautiful and natural 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.010
 leave here on the make-up and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.030
 that's why it's very important for now 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.490
 is the color 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.880
 that's the color analysis special 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 books the guide gives 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.150
 different passes for a fall 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.299
 summer and winter and depending on 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.680
 what type would the lady belong to then 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.360
 I recommend a dress so yes 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.009
 bridal fashions do you do the chart analysis 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.549
 that means you also look which winter 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.220
 summer fall - even if it's clyde 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.540
 may be white but then go 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 maybe it's also about make-up 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.890
 and it's because most exactly 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 styling the buttocks and of course 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.210
 bridal bouquet that's right too 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.980
 After the bride's closing, he also has to go in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.160
 to the hue 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.960
 everyone should look harmonious and not 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.230
 For example, if everything was only then 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.840
 something is cold and big contrasts 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.350
 That is why it is important and in terms of clothing 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.770
 also see for example victory 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.960
 winter tube that before white or one 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.220
 knows and when they fall for example 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.310
 or to be taken 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.080
 ok creamy white right there you can 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.970
 see wonderful differences 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.000
 I do not know how long ago 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.170
 that may be good too 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.670
 over 20 years for a catalog 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.560
 bridal fashions showcased and that 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.750
 only thing I keep in mind 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.210
 I was that these clothes like that 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.830
 were incredibly uncomfortable that I hardly 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.750
 got air at the time was 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.670
 changed or is it still today 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.650
 that a wedding dress just times tight 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.730
 you barely get air and the day you sit 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.980
 Sometimes you need one for that 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.690
 bit tiring yes so the day is 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.420
 Of course, a little exhausting for each 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.730
 woman but the clothes it is today 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.180
 so different you can do a short one 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.490
 find a dress and a little bit so - so 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.860
 in every style there is there at all 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.100
 still great differences or is 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.990
 the wedding dress still is 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.920
 currently what you also 20 years ago 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.320
 could wear 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.239
 or is there in the course as well of course 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.340
 classic stays forever but each 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.800
 Woman decides what she has 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.800
 but would like to, for example, of course, many 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.840
 first marry women or first 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.120
 then you almost want wedding 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.100
 All classic look so in white 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.360
 dress 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.340
 I also have the dream wedding 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.950
 worked and for us it was always a 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.320
 highlight if we had my bride 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.660
 There is also a marriage in red 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.610
 the brave women then belong 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.260
 to one or have one then 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.300
 a bit more power a bit more 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.130
 vigor 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.990
 to give to the wedding yes but me 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.140
 think that is already at the second wedding 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.780
 ok, the first years were clear 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.060
 so knows a second or third 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.730
 high field then you can a bit there 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.530
 so play what belongs to 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.240
 Preparation for this , of course, is natural 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.130
 once the selection of the dress the 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.860
 you need a selection of the dress for that 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.080
 a consultation becomes a short analysis 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.050
 the figure analyzes which shapes or 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.670
 which cut fits best honor 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.690
 and of course, make-up tastes 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.489
 Make-up appointment is more likely to get married 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.590
 glamorous or do you change that too? 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.269
 I was already on the one or the other make-up 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.330
 another wedding where the bride is 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.010
 different in the morning or the bride in the morning 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.810
 Looked different than one evening 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.750
 so party what we have 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.470
 but normally if at 19 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.580
 Clock is and the guests at 4 19 o'clock 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.710
 are invited 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.020
 Of course I would recommend it 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.250
 second make-up poor and in the morning what 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.990
 easy what yes what maybe it just 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.970
 one would recommend 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.669
 and in the evening machule bit stronger 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.410
 Emphasize how important is in the groom 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.880
 he plays no unessential 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.880
 roll on the day 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.100
 pay attention to the fact that the dress 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.110
 once, of course, to the type of woman 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.419
 but that fits the man accordingly 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.550
 Of course it should look good , yes 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.590
 Of course, then the suit is also very 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.990
 important so i would also have a ford 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.360
 advice for the groom 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.550
 so that he is very good on this day too 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.160
 looks and a bit light 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.650
 make up your eyes a bit 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.620
 Concrete one and a little cooler on 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.880
 wear so that he does not shine and make 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.669
 the men as well with so 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.100
 normally yes, yes, yes 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.200
 There are also tricks on how to do it 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.140
 Of course this does not work as it does 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.040
 women but a bit rouge bit 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.720
 funny there is one or the powder 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.370
 another man with whom I would be me 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.110
 can not imagine that with the 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.710
 rouge and a bit of powder before that 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.060
 bride or in front of the mourning party 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.410
 I think it has to be harmonious 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.720
 look and that is very important for 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.280
 the photos so if you take pictures 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.810
 becomes 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.130
 Of course you can do everything in photoshop 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.130
 have it corrected 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.620
 but you still want to look good 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.120
 mid-april we have now in may 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.830
 yes, that's it 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.200
 marriage month par excellence 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.570
 when or how should you start? 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.870
 to plan that dress 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.960
 to make honest to three months 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.020
 so long, of course, you can in two 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.460
 I will find a dress for three days 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.300
 would recommend everything so slowly 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.590
 So do not do any hectic which first 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.390
 which one also for example with the 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.830
 can wear wedding and most of all 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.900
 again the woman's wardrobe 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.400
 nowadays look has it going 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.020
 you tell us a lot more 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.270
 In the meantime, we all want to be whole 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.590
 switch over well to our always top 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.080
 styled a mosque 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.910
 somehow this has it on you na you see 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.910
 today again fantastic from my love
