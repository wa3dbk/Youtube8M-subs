00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.460
 Galician that's good this is delicious

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.810
 once in a while not a pulpit to the Galician 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.490
 and when we found a good octopus 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.080
 you have to buy it and make this recipe 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.000
 also with this writing that starts at 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.430
 do it well with a beer 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.560
 or with cider or something like that they are not 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.380
 crave and it's very simple to do just 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.660
 you need your octopus 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.400
 so the octopus buy it how it goes and in its 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.229
 case you in house can if you want 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.409
 give him a whitening this is 

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:41.269
 bleached that is to say it is therefore pasadito 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.430
 in boiled water to give it as a 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.900
 first cooking is also going to be used 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 a little bit of paprika 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.450
 let's take a little bit of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.770
 onion and aji toque can not miss in 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:59.010
 these typical Spanish dishes I would 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.730
 let's put some here too 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.920
 little piquin not for that of that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.040
 we are Mexican and we like what 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.470
 picantito potatoes chips that in this case 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.630
 they are already peeled they are boiled they are 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 cut into cubes drained with a 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 little bit of salt they're going to put a little 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.410
 chips and of course there is olive oil 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 and with good olive oil we're going to 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.909
 make this recipe 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.939
 the octopus has the Galician octopus 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.729
 have to go with enough so far 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.560
 so as they say in Spain 'batter and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.720
 when it says the batter is because it has 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.840
 very much olive oil then good 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.430
 we are going to put to heat a frying pan and in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.550
 this pan let's put 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.100
 a little olive oil 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.659
 and there we are going to put to brown 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.659
 our onion 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.650
 and ours 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.260
 I shake quite Egypt because the time I 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.010
 It gives a very rich flavor 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.750
 to everything that is all that you go fried and 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.880
 especially the galician octopus 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.410
 terrific delicious and delicious 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.160
 also in a house they know that they can 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.900
 put if they want chorizo they crave 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.629
 with chorizo 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.310
 who said no because I do not believe you no 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.980
 you will really 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.380
 is that I - with a way out a 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.430
 habanero for garish with habanero 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.870
 then then 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.020
 and all our onions and our 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.480
 our bass we are going to add 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.130
 the octopus that the octopus choose it for is 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.840
 very easy it has to be tender 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.840
 notice that your eyes are not very 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.750
 sunk when you touch it this has to 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.130
 be soft but not sluggish and this 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.560
 so you can realize that the octopus 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.710
 it's good then in the fishmongers 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.880
 some really good ones are sold there too if 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.590
 you can not make that octopus also a 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.460
 squid there are as you want 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.470
 as you send 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.470
 well let's add our octopus 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.900
 now it is time to throw him 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.060
 more olive oil to rock and roll or 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.840
 If you and all who 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.020
 since who I want to cheat now this 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.910
 dish between more oil you put more 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.000
 caloric becomes because each 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.440
 spoonful of olive oil or canola 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.930
 or of this sunflower or of what you 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.280
 they want it turns they have 90 calories 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.110
 then we are talking about him 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.510
 saucers that for each spoonful 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.730
 going up 90 calories 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.090
 let's season with a little 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:51.379
 of salt and pepper and let's add 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.540
 also the potatoes come, today I begin 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.340
 to talk delicious this little bit more than 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.550
 get out of pepper to save that area 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.470
 the legs 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.440
 when using 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.180
 I started to skip a little to give 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.689
 like your little things for what 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.530
 I catch flavor little color without I know 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.530
 when I turn off over there 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.090
 let's remove it 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.210
 that you choose in house, they can 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.500
 be sometimes that according to accambray was this 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.340

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.660
 cambrai with objection with the approved with 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.870
 lemon parsley appointment 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.620

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.060
 This liquefy some lemon parsley 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.310

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.539
