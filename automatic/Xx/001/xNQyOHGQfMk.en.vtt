almost positively my fault and that's a
pretty<00:03:57.400> decent<00:03:57.790> shop<00:03:58.000> it'll<00:03:58.329> be<00:03:58.419> uncle<00:03:58.840> puck

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
pretty decent shop it'll be uncle puck

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.140 
pretty decent shop it'll be uncle puck
but<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.409> going<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> be<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.889> big<00:04:00.250> sidehill<00:04:00.849> lie

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
but it's going to be a big sidehill lie

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.319 
but it's going to be a big sidehill lie
like<00:04:01.419> this<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:02.709> is<00:04:02.859> called<00:04:03.069> a<00:04:03.310> tirana<00:04:04.000> green

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
like this this is called a tirana green

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.080 
like this this is called a tirana green
if<00:04:04.599> you<00:04:04.750> did<00:04:04.870> if<00:04:05.019> you<00:04:05.109> don't<00:04:05.259> know<00:04:05.349> about<00:04:05.470> tears

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
if you did if you don't know about tears

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.390 
if you did if you don't know about tears
it's<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.239> really<00:04:07.479> really<00:04:08.049> hot<00:04:08.379> apple<00:04:08.919> portion

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
it's a really really hot apple portion

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.879 
it's a really really hot apple portion
of<00:04:09.489> a<00:04:09.579> green<00:04:09.819> that<00:04:10.509> that's<00:04:10.840> really<00:04:11.079> really

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
of a green that that's really really

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.550 
of a green that that's really really
steep<00:04:12.220> unpredictable<00:04:13.030> line<00:04:13.299> I<00:04:13.720> mean<00:04:13.989> under

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
steep unpredictable line I mean under

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.450 
steep unpredictable line I mean under
the<00:04:14.650> predictive

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
the predictive

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.580 
the predictive
slow<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.030> that's<00:04:16.270> what<00:04:16.420> a<00:04:16.450> tear<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:16.990> basically

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
slow and that's what a tear is basically

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.950 
slow and that's what a tear is basically
it's<00:04:18.070> multiple<00:04:18.520> levels<00:04:18.940> on<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.210> green<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.840> you

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 
it's multiple levels on a green and you

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.540 
it's multiple levels on a green and you
do<00:04:20.050> not<00:04:20.200> want<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.560> be<00:04:20.740> on<00:04:20.770> a<00:04:20.980> different<00:04:21.160> level

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
do not want to be on a different level

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.720 
do not want to be on a different level
of<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.810> tier<00:04:23.170> than<00:04:23.650> where<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.980> hole<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.190> like<00:04:24.580> I

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
of a tier than where the hole is like I

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.930 
of a tier than where the hole is like I
are<00:04:24.880> right<00:04:25.120> now<00:04:28.320> now<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.710> was<00:04:29.830> an<00:04:29.950> ok<00:04:30.550> i

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
are right now now that was an ok i

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.970 
are right now now that was an ok i
guess<00:04:31.720> i<00:04:31.810> could<00:04:31.930> have<00:04:32.050> got<00:04:32.170> that<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:32.530> but<00:04:32.740> in

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
guess i could have got that in but in

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.590 
guess i could have got that in but in
not<00:04:33.400> going<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.670> dwell<00:04:33.760> on<00:04:33.880> my<00:04:34.150> mistakes

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
not going to dwell on my mistakes

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.120 
not going to dwell on my mistakes
