00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.160
 to mourn boxing so the xbox 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.490
 one advance and loire lighthouse so 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.789
 the special edition for call of duty 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.139
 so we'll start by looking a little 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.749
 packing 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:22.009
 so we already see the console in 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:24.320
 foreground on the minimum side of the game 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.669
 and so the content 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.759
 so we see that it's different 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:34.590
 because we have an interest instead of 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:43.770
 500 gigas so that's it so I'm going 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:45.920
 So start with this before there was 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.530
 not so that allows you to 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 raise the xbox without too much trouble that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.190
 I know that on the d one and at 8.10 this 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.180
 little blocking system was not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.160
 still on the boxes 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:08.460
 so it's still very useful 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.260
 as an aspect so the controller before 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:18.510
 so it was the kinect that was 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:23.220
 here so we will delete this record so 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.790
 there so we see the game with so its 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.650
 code that is already used and the content 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.710
 so this is the limited edition 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:38.570
 atlas edition with two teeth 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.570
 so small manuals for xbox 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.000
 for the joystick the code 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:53.190
 so that's all that's guaranteed 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.470
 if I'm not mistaken yes he guarantees to 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.299
 associations next so then we 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.970
 find a battery headset for the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.960
 handle it before it was not yet in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.250
 the boxes 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.569
 so that's good that they thought about it 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.819
 now so the power cable 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:20.279
 with his block went too much so on the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:32.010
 side cable hdmi cathcart for livebox 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:33.840
 so one then go out a little 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.049
 packaging for the joystick which is very 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.590
 nice so the joystick very beautiful 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:45.569
 by the way so really in the colors of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.760
 advanced edwards flagship I find a 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.980
 little damage is that good they put a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.290
 trick with the colors inside I 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.519
 do not see the utility apart for 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.159
 those who do not know but still 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.090
 it is not necessary that the colors 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:02.999
 buttons everyone knows them 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:11.010
 now here we are going to move to a 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:13.950
 alone so again a novelty so 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.939
 there is a block on the top and on the bottom 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.950
 who were not there before and xbox does not 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.549
 you women is not even they 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.549
 would like to sing that 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.020
 except when 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:46.749
 and here is the fact so beautiful console 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:58.029
 have lived mixity made of my could 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:05:00.700
 to say that if you are made of scratches on it 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:02.920
 we will believe 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.000
 observe on the top so we can 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.340
 observe the sentinel logo for 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.220
 those who have already started the game you 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.720
 So there it will see a qr code that will 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.060
 scanner to surely get things 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.780
 collector like a soundtrack or whatever 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:27.570
 I guess bomb at the back not too much 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:30.820
 always changed the same optics 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:34.720
 so is below so not always the 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.760
 serial number of the console here is bah 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.080
 I hope you enjoyed it and we 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.080
 find for a next video
