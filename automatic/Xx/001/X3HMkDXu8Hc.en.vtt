00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:53.329
 different but only the rain there has a 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:56.790
 half cattle is kind of not very connected 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:03.000

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.030
 there in the sand biome I've seen a ti with 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.879
 The time, so cool, comes the minute. 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.500

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:39.569

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.620
 advertised or not much is 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.009
 Thank you, you said you had nothing, too. 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:51.439
 here is only one stone that adds 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:55.979
 still very vulgar, let me draw that 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:59.250
 decrease and that will improve 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:02.189
 I managed to find a notebook that is 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.219
 the Arabic types only fly away 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.930

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.750

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.479

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.620

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.620

 another way over a mole that type 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.650
 add minecraft stuff it also goes 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.080
 well things may need type chests 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.730
 I inadvertently when I went to test my way 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.680
 I put the mold of the clippers 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.480
 here you did not see take a look at 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.850
 channel that has clipper mode there type 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.760
 here an iron door and type inside the 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.920
 chest appears Paulo is clipper type is 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.230
 very show and yes people are you 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.750
 using car type sword type 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.750
 another type of mode it will appear 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:18.940
 Also the things in the chest 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:22.840
 Look what another kind of ruin to break 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.920
 here was what there was a hoe of 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.320
 stone 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.940
 so people have several types of ruins 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.370
 I do not think I've ever seen a biome of 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.960
 desert here does not give a city with 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.790
 the desert time 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.620
 so this way if you liked it 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.330
 of the video click you had heard 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.160

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.280
