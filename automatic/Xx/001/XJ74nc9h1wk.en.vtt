00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
 good evening welcome to our hell 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.230
 second lesson workshop 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.530
 dedicated to the window district our 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.620
 Today our conversation will be about such 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.699
 serious topic as advertising 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.379
 we'll talk a column what 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.499
 the amount of advertising is different from hers 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:17.380
 qualities 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.109
 why between these two 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.970
 characteristics often put a mark 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.659
 of equality 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.230
 so we analyze a little 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.180
 but estimated method of evaluating effectiveness 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.500
 advertising about the cost of one 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.749
 call 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.760
 compare them two options prices the same thing 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.210
 same 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.570
 advertising 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.760
 mean and so 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.950
 went to Nalchik 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.240
 the main 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.270
 and a prerequisite 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.130
 our profit is calls 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.180
 incoming customer if 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.640
 the law will not call accordingly 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.720
 no sales 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.180
 and she won't have money 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.790
 for this purpose we give on advertising we pay 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.589
 definitely advertising budget 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.309
 we will buy in the newspaper advertising city 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.730
 on TV 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.860
 and start but bake certain lyrics 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.500
 unfortunately rarely think about 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350
 what we write city hall 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.890
 often equate between 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.740
 the amount of money we spend 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.620
 advertising and 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.870
 as little as she is 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.800
 so effective 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.280
 I would like to give you two examples today 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.830
 In addition, as one and the same advertisements in the same 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.090
 the same newspaper more precisely two modules 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.170
 can bring totally different 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.710
 effects so 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.170
 imagine that in none in one 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.049
 free weekly n 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.760
 placed two tips on the ad 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.909
 the budget of one and the second is 20 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.780
 thousand rubles a month 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.530
 what have they got the same modules yet 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.979
 about the same size they 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.170
 arranged on pages 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 may even periodically 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.439
 accordingly, these conditions are all 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.220
 various 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.320
 the only difference is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.979
 writes one text which is standard 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.920
 windows of five thousand turnkey 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.680
 the second can write some 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.390
 special offer which 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.499
 g 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.569
 gives much greater effect 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:20.989
 means and 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.709
 almost 50 percent fictitious of this 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.269
 ad module above 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.139
 often unfortunately often we donâ€™t 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.129
 think about what we write to them 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.420
 n 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.940
 even often unfair 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.140
 charges advertisers that and 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.390
 newspapers effectively their target audience 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.400
 not 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.879
 me and buyers are capable 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.620
 and we can even think about what 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.579
 what we wrote there are such cases 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.859
 just amazing what they write such nonsense 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.219
 forgets but the phone number is wrong 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.049
 is specified 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.159
 forget to even write what sells 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.849
 the company did not come across that 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.139
 announcement in tambov 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.069
 Nastya by the way here in the presentation seminar 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.219
 probably saw what is there 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.449
 protocol even forgot to point out that he 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.019
 sells but accordingly 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.239
 and what efficiency can be discussed in 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.199
 principle 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.439
 There are many such examples. 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.739
 so before you increase 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.540
 advertising budget to increase its third hour 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.389
 in their religion 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.289
 Think go test the most 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:23.689
 effective ad 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.620
 after you explain it 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.420
 maximum effect from your 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.299
 ads start to fill there 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.099
 advertising budgets 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.049
 if you will invest in 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.409
 ineffective advertising 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.529
 respectively 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.539
 your profit from this is very strong 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:38.829
 will suffer 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.830
 so imagine that 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.300
 the difference is only 500 percent principle you 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.740
 You know, I want to tell you that considering 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.389
 this is no media so difficult to achieve this 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.029
 changing the premiere your headline 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.649
 adding ad unique shopping 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.399
 sentence 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.229
 write-off rub man you certain 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.049
 groups about pensioners percentage 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.479
 cottages noam young moms have anyone else either 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.419
 so you 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.879
 thriving and all the excess do not give 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.299
 advertising for all who position 6 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.199
 There is such a form from dp points for odds we get 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.629
 call to action 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.709
 and unique selling proposition all these 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.370
 chips which means we have them 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.169
 trainings 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.949
 in final management training 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.189
 and what is the province 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.469
 earning 400 thousand place all the time was 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:26.879
 is dedicated to advertising just how to write 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.189
 today in buckwheat about it today I wanted 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:30.720
 show you more 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.569
 the fact that the same ad can 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.599
 bring a different number of calls 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.830
 also in the end the cost of one 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.599
 call may differ 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.809
 and it differs by a decent amount 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:44.849
 imagine that here is the cost of one 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.919
 call on the first floor 200 rubles 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.849
 cost of one call replay about 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.849
 advertising 133 rubles and the guards that 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.529
 let's say for the base you uah said goal 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.779
 cost first first first 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.979
 The cost of vertebral opera advertising is 20 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.619
 thousand rubles cost of vertebrae 

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:05.979
 second advertising 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.080
 almost 7 thousand cheaper that is 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.990
 imagine 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.539
 what 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.419
 km what you write advertising advertising 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.129
 very important can not so significant 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.499
 money 7 thousand rubles 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:19.889
 the money that will never be 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.150
 superfluous your pocket 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.400
 way to sell even more efficient 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.500
 additional advertising 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500
 source responded was to spend on 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.690
 development that is but i will not explain you 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.539
 you understand that 7 thousand rubles 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.819
 carriages can 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.849
 in a little play a certain 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.849
 positive role 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.430
 the next moment 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.059
 if but third if we 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:45.469
 use 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:48.399
 n we use the forecast that is comfort based on 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.370
 two options first results first 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.130
 in the first embodiment, the number 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.430
 April calls for the second 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.220
 the first call costs 200 rubles for the second 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.650
 option factory according ruble 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.180
 let's imagine to 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.580
 pour in advertising further 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.639
 20 thousand rubles each 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.919
 and note that as a result 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.939
 on the advertising budget is the same but when 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.800
 very different 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.650
 that is, calls will be strong too 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.050
 differ stick one source at 50 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.849
 percent became bogus 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.080
 than another 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.949
 so 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.860
 when you give advertising 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.879
 first thing worth thinking about postal 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.569
 write in advertising and only then what 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.610
 advertising budget you allocate 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.939
 that's all for today 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:37.899
 we had with you merkulov andrey 

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.999
 see you at the next meeting more
