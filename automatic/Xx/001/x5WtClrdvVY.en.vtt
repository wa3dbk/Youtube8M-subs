I'm<00:01:47.180> not<00:01:47.360> sure<00:01:47.510> what<00:01:47.690> that<00:01:47.870> is<00:01:48.050> based<00:01:48.500> on<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.310> if

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
I'm not sure what that is based on so if

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.940 
I'm not sure what that is based on so if
you<00:01:49.460> guys<00:01:49.580> know<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.690> can<00:01:50.900> help<00:01:51.260> me<00:01:51.410> out<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.710> I

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
you guys know you can help me out and I

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.330 
you guys know you can help me out and I
can<00:01:52.160> maybe<00:01:52.640> bump<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.360> score<00:01:53.630> up<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.960> little

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
can maybe bump that score up a little

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.710 
can maybe bump that score up a little
but<00:01:55.340> yeah<00:01:55.580> I<00:01:55.790> really<00:01:56.030> don't<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:56.330> how<00:01:56.570> it's

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
but yeah I really don't like how it's

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.600 
but yeah I really don't like how it's
the<00:01:56.990> base<00:01:57.380> score<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.710> based<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.250> lowest

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
the base score is based on the lowest

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.610 
the base score is based on the lowest
subscore<00:01:59.210> they<00:01:59.720> should<00:01:59.930> like<00:02:00.110> average<00:02:00.440> them

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
subscore they should like average them

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.540 
subscore they should like average them
