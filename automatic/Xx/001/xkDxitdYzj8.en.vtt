00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:06.450
 Previously we had the holidays of the Band of Brothers presented Formento my 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.379
 Son Stephen Spielberg 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.239
 here always on beautiful metal box 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.239
 Golden globe winner best miniseries 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.369
 I'm going to be extremely good 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.109
 because so different than the successor series Kristof Wilke 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.989
 from the same producers 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.989
 that did not really appeal to me personally 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.390
 the big author pay attention to the series is from 16 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.100
 and whether 18 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.570
 as far as I remember 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.400
 as I said very nice 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.290
 from this protection conductor 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.239
 Wörmann June what's behind the shot is the book black paint 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.680
 Paul this black Marcus extremely sensitive compared to so small 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.100
 Käthchen 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 which does not look nice at all 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.690
 everywhere you can 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.890
 on the back side 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.000
 this nice motive 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.090
 marched together shine 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.000
 also here in the lower area a lot of cats 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.440
 so shoes by Dieter Pape here 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.440
 is that a bit dusty 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.280
 can not do anything 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 happy that completely normal 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 fixed glued 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.900
 m8 and dance 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.350
 the stupid thing about this box Munster that this 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.300
 this 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.600
 all this party the citizen is stuck in the same critique park fixed 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.510
 you can not take it out completely 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.320
 For example, it works 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.410
 this is not 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.080
 unruly 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.080
 but this motive 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 also good 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.520
 Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 Erfurt his twins 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.580
 Clinton is a little bit 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.580
 be careful not to loose it 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.769
 the latter can be completely solid 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.009
 and obviously not yet like that "July" There's one more piece 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.519
 that's how it looks 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.759
 and the back is now stuck firmly in the metal box 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.759
 an extra booklet that does not work 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.109
 which in any case a very nice Boxster 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.979
 is doing very well on the shelf 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.169
 as I said but unfortunately very important 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.699
 the Wars with Band of Brothers
