00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
very very literal sense and the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
very very literal sense and the
personifications<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.659> various<00:01:46.020> aspects<00:01:46.500> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and nature are actually offices that are

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
and nature are actually offices that are
held<00:01:52.890> by<00:01:53.009> ordinary<00:01:53.909> mortals<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.840> me

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
held by ordinary mortals like you and me

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
held by ordinary mortals like you and me
and<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> course<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> seven<00:01:56.310> book

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and in the course of the seven book

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.920 
and in the course of the seven book
series<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.000> realized<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.540> he<00:01:57.659> did<00:01:57.810> actually

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
series I realized that he did actually

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
series I realized that he did actually
write<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.380> eighth<00:01:58.590> book<00:01:58.890> recently<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.759> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
write an eighth book recently but I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.429 
write an eighth book recently but I
haven't<00:02:00.360> read<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.780> no<00:02:00.869> plans<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> Reena

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
haven't read it have no plans to Reena

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.749 
haven't read it have no plans to Reena
so<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:01.770> far<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.040> we're<00:02:02.159> concerned<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
so as far as we're concerned it is a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.670 
so as far as we're concerned it is a
seven<00:02:03.119> book<00:02:03.299> series<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.869> during<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> course

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
seven book series and during the course

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
seven book series and during the course
of<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.950> series<00:02:05.280> he<00:02:05.610> told<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.030> very<00:02:06.240> compelling

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
of this series he told a very compelling

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.690 
of this series he told a very compelling
story<00:02:07.079> about<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.500> nature<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> good<00:02:08.250> versus

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
story about the nature of good versus

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.270 
story about the nature of good versus
evil<00:02:08.729> told<00:02:09.599> from<00:02:09.810> seven<00:02:10.289> distinct<00:02:10.800> points<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
evil told from seven distinct points of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.790 
evil told from seven distinct points of
view<00:02:11.520> now<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.910> said<00:02:12.150> earlier<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.599> were

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
view now I said earlier that we were

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.860 
view now I said earlier that we were
to<00:02:13.040> look<00:02:13.220> at<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.520> entire<00:02:13.850> series<00:02:14.330> today<00:02:14.600> but

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
to look at the entire series today but

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.780 
to look at the entire series today but
in<00:02:15.050> fact<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.560> was<00:02:15.830> lying<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.190> little<00:02:16.310> bit<00:02:16.580> because

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
in fact I was lying a little bit because

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.030 
in fact I was lying a little bit because
I<00:02:17.270> decided<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:18.110> want<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.440> do<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.770> series

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
I decided that I want to do this series

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.230 
I decided that I want to do this series
a<00:02:19.160> little<00:02:19.340> bit<00:02:19.550> differently<00:02:19.970> than<00:02:20.030> I've<00:02:20.210> done

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
a little bit differently than I've done

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.300 
a little bit differently than I've done
series<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.930> past<00:02:21.200> normally<00:02:22.130> with<00:02:22.280> a

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
series in the past normally with a

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.940 
series in the past normally with a
series<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:22.970> books<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.390> treat<00:02:23.780> one<00:02:24.110> series<00:02:24.710> like

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
series of books I treat one series like

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.610 
series of books I treat one series like
the<00:02:25.100> Harry<00:02:25.310> Potter<00:02:25.580> series<00:02:25.940> or<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.900> series<00:02:27.530> of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the Harry Potter series or the series of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.430 
the Harry Potter series or the series of
unfortunate<00:02:27.740> events<00:02:28.160> by<00:02:28.460> Lemony<00:02:28.520> Snicket<00:02:29.270> as

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
unfortunate events by Lemony Snicket as

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.050 
unfortunate events by Lemony Snicket as
one<00:02:30.440> book<00:02:30.770> on<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.220> favorites<00:02:31.610> list<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:31.970> I'll

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
one book on the favorites list so I'll

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.000 
one book on the favorites list so I'll
just<00:02:32.240> review<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.570> as<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> whole<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.620> do<00:02:33.770> this

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
just review it as a whole I do this

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.440 
just review it as a whole I do this
because<00:02:34.190> usually<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.970> books<00:02:35.150> are<00:02:35.330> written

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
because usually the books are written

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.120 
because usually the books are written
similarly<00:02:36.170> enough<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.650> they<00:02:36.710> follow<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
similarly enough and they follow the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.440 
similarly enough and they follow the
same<00:02:37.160> group<00:02:37.490> of<00:02:37.610> characters<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.330> they're

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
same group of characters and they're

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.080 
same group of characters and they're
part<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:39.050> overarching<00:02:39.920> storyline<00:02:40.670> that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
part of one overarching storyline that

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.250 
part of one overarching storyline that
it<00:02:41.180> doesn't<00:02:41.420> really<00:02:41.510> make<00:02:41.690> any<00:02:41.930> sense<00:02:41.960> to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
it doesn't really make any sense to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260 
it doesn't really make any sense to
review<00:02:42.440> every<00:02:42.860> individual<00:02:43.580> book<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.090> just

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
review every individual book so I just

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.940 
review every individual book so I just
review<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.660> entire<00:02:45.050> story

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
review the entire story

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.230 
review the entire story
however<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.370> incarnations<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.880> immortality

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
however the incarnations of immortality

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.820 
however the incarnations of immortality
series<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.780> little<00:02:48.020> bit<00:02:48.140> different<00:02:48.680> because

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
series is a little bit different because

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.040 
series is a little bit different because
first<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.550> all<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:49.850> being<00:02:50.060> told<00:02:50.450> as<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.870> said

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
first of all it's being told as I said

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.690 
first of all it's being told as I said
earlier<00:02:51.350> from<00:02:51.500> seven<00:02:51.920> distinct<00:02:52.280> points<00:02:52.610> of

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
earlier from seven distinct points of

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.000 
earlier from seven distinct points of
view<00:02:52.940> each<00:02:53.210> book<00:02:53.540> focuses<00:02:54.170> around<00:02:54.320> one<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.890> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
view each book focuses around one of the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.410 
view each book focuses around one of the
different<00:02:55.340> incarnations<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.970> immortality

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
different incarnations of immortality

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.600 
different incarnations of immortality
and<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.350> are<00:02:57.440> following<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.980> story<00:02:58.280> from

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
and so we are following the story from

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.880 
and so we are following the story from
seven<00:02:59.240> different<00:02:59.420> characters<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.500> even

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
seven different characters and even

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.110 
seven different characters and even
though<00:03:00.980> all<00:03:01.190> seven<00:03:01.490> of<00:03:01.550> these<00:03:01.700> books<00:03:01.970> are

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
though all seven of these books are

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.360 
though all seven of these books are
essentially<00:03:02.600> episodes<00:03:03.080> in<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.500> same<00:03:03.830> story

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
essentially episodes in the same story

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.560 
essentially episodes in the same story
they're<00:03:04.910> looking<00:03:05.210> at<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.420> from<00:03:05.510> different

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
they're looking at it from different

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.290 
they're looking at it from different
perspectives<00:03:05.960> they<00:03:06.770> are<00:03:07.160> not<00:03:07.490> even<00:03:07.910> really<00:03:08.060> in

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
perspectives they are not even really in

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.870 
perspectives they are not even really in
chronological<00:03:08.690> order<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.650> they<00:03:10.280> can<00:03:10.580> each

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
chronological order and they can each

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.940 
chronological order and they can each
stand<00:03:11.150> alone<00:03:11.390> as<00:03:11.540> their<00:03:11.750> own<00:03:11.870> story<00:03:12.290> plus<00:03:12.740> I

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
stand alone as their own story plus I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.650 

this<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.100> first<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.610> quite<00:03:39.910> possibly<00:03:40.210> the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
this is the first and quite possibly the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.480 
this is the first and quite possibly the
best<00:03:40.840> book<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.860> series<00:03:42.190> which<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.430> know

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
best book in the series which I know

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.130 
best book in the series which I know
it's<00:03:42.730> not<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> really<00:03:43.180> good<00:03:43.210> indication<00:03:43.930> of

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
it's not a really good indication of

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.410 
it's not a really good indication of
things<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.530> come<00:03:44.740> but<00:03:45.070> bear<00:03:45.670> with<00:03:45.700> me<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.240> this

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
things to come but bear with me and this

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.930 
things to come but bear with me and this
focuses<00:03:46.810> around<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.290> incarnation<00:03:48.100> of<00:03:48.310> death

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.000 
focuses around the incarnation of death
but<00:03:49.540> as<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.750> said<00:03:49.810> death<00:03:50.170> isn't<00:03:50.380> just<00:03:50.770> one

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
but as I said death isn't just one

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.190 
but as I said death isn't just one

by character but by an idea this book
actually<00:05:21.070> does<00:05:21.520> really<00:05:21.910> well<00:05:22.090> when<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.300> feel

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.020 
be able to look at it from from the guy
who<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:41.169> actually<00:05:41.979> in<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.400> business<00:05:42.610> of

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
who is actually in the business of

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.000 
who is actually in the business of
collecting<00:05:43.210> your<00:05:43.600> souls<00:05:44.020> when<00:05:44.320> you<00:05:44.410> die<00:05:44.650> and

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
collecting your souls when you die and

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.920 
collecting your souls when you die and

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
never really me and errs away from that

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.400

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
and the story does contain a fair bit of

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.210
