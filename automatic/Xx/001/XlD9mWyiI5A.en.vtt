00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:09.559
 hi friends today we will see 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.610
 and what is the problem in this monitor 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.360
 mark bit where when 111 turn it on 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.380
 what it does is blink the bulb on 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.090
 led 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.800
 blink and it does not turn on and turn on 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.800
 after several minutes 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.630
 what is damaged in this case are the 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.020
 capacitors let's check and then 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 follow the replacement of the capacitors 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.760
 I'm going to first open the monitor and so 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.760
 I'm going to cut the video 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.970
 good as we can see here they left the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:06.340
 of the device disconnect the cables 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.579
 they go to the screen as you can see here 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.210
 then it gives me more power to be able 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.130
 observe 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.719
 if you look closely 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.369
 here is one of the 22 of the 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.619
 capacitors what we are going to do is 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.420
 replace them with others that have the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:32.840
 same value then let's proceed to 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.840
 remove them and put them I will spend 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.240
 and replace the trainers that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.240
 they were damaged that are here 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.270
 I do not know if they can see 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.870
 and I put others that are not the same size 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.740
 but they have the same voltage value and 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.890
 IM f 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.130
 says welding and now I'm going to move on 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.130
 assemble the monitor and approve it 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 well here I already have the monitor armed and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.020
 plug the two part wires 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.420
 later and I will proceed to turn it on 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.900
 to show them that if it works 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.849
 we press the power button 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.519
 and as you can see it turns on normally 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.720
 so I forgot to show the 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:34.140
 start as green light blinked quote 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.990
 when you turn on for example the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.830
 off or on at night 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.030
 and the next day I lit it and this one 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.550
 flashes as if trying to turn on 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.640
 blinking will blink and blink until 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.920
 it was like 10 minutes and it's 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.380
 turned on good I hope you have them 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.560
 served 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.790
 Give him live the video and share the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.790
 thanks bye
