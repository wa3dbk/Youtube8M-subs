00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
so every case is going to be totally

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.080 
so every case is going to be totally
unique<00:02:40.500> totally<00:02:41.040> distinct<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:41.849> we're<00:02:42.000> all

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
unique totally distinct but we're all

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.270 
unique totally distinct but we're all
different<00:02:42.349> every<00:02:43.349> if<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.620> were<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.099> buy<00:02:44.220> two

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
of these cases that the you know the

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.509 
of these cases that the you know the
wood<00:02:46.319> with<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.530> grain<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.129> wood<00:02:47.220> would<00:02:47.430> be

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
wood with the grain of the wood would be

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.500 
wood with the grain of the wood would be
a<00:02:47.549> little<00:02:47.790> bit<00:02:47.879> different<00:02:48.060> because<00:02:48.269> it's

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
a little bit different because it's

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.369 
a little bit different because it's
actual<00:02:48.870> wood<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.079> said<00:02:52.230> these<00:02:52.319> are

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
actual wood so like I said these are

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.410 
actual wood so like I said these are
these<00:02:52.799> are<00:02:52.829> created<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.609> hand

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
click and it works fine there is a

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.650 
click and it works fine there is a
little<00:04:38.670> bit<00:04:38.790> of<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:38.970> lip<00:04:39.150> on<00:04:39.270> our<00:04:39.420> right<00:04:39.510> there

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
little bit of a lip on our right there

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.780 
little bit of a lip on our right there
so<00:04:39.840> if<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:39.990> do<00:04:40.110> lay<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.470> face<00:04:40.650> down<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:41.580> will

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
so if you do lay it face down it will

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.490 
so if you do lay it face down it will
not<00:04:41.820> be<00:04:42.090> touching<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.570> glass<00:04:42.720> screen<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.410> if

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
not be touching the glass screen so if

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.800 
not be touching the glass screen so if
you<00:04:43.560> were<00:04:43.680> perfect<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.640> it's<00:04:45.600> not

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
you were perfect like this it's not

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.110 
you were perfect like this it's not

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
touching the screen at all the one issue

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.640 
touching the screen at all the one issue
I<00:04:48.180> didn't<00:04:48.390> notice<00:04:48.600> though<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:49.350> see<00:04:49.500> those

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
I didn't notice though is you see those

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.990 
I didn't notice though is you see those

I<00:05:04.440> was<00:05:04.560> using<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.220> would<00:05:05.400> be<00:05:05.520> like

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
I was using it so I would be like

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
thing when I was on phone calls so that

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.040 
thing when I was on phone calls so that
that<00:05:11.940> sensor<00:05:12.330> there<00:05:12.480> is<00:05:12.600> not<00:05:12.750> a<00:05:12.780> hundred

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
that sensor there is not a hundred

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.390 
that sensor there is not a hundred
percent<00:05:13.260> it's<00:05:13.470> kind<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.710> raised<00:05:13.920> up<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.190> little

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
percent it's kind of raised up a little

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.680 
percent it's kind of raised up a little
bit<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:14.670> there<00:05:14.820> are<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.360> was<00:05:15.450> strange

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
bit and there are and it was strange

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.090 
bit and there are and it was strange
enough<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:16.080> where<00:05:16.230> at<00:05:16.350> times<00:05:16.590> now<00:05:16.740> using<00:05:17.040> the

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
enough to where at times now using the

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.980 
enough to where at times now using the
front-facing<00:05:17.460> camera<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:18.000> did<00:05:18.480> notice<00:05:18.780> a

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
front-facing camera I did notice a

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.450 
front-facing camera I did notice a
little<00:05:19.140> bit<00:05:19.320> of<00:05:19.440> haziness<00:05:19.710> in<00:05:19.920> the<00:05:20.010> bottom<00:05:20.310> of

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
little bit of haziness in the bottom of

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.220 
little bit of haziness in the bottom of
the<00:05:20.730> images<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.300> didn't<00:05:21.510> always<00:05:21.630> happen<00:05:21.900> which

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
the images it didn't always happen which

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.570 
the images it didn't always happen which
is<00:05:22.380> weird<00:05:22.620> I'm<00:05:22.710> not<00:05:22.830> sure<00:05:22.950> how<00:05:23.040> that<00:05:23.070> was<00:05:23.460> the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
is weird I'm not sure how that was the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.070 
is weird I'm not sure how that was the
case<00:05:23.730> I<00:05:23.940> think<00:05:23.970> when<00:05:24.210> light<00:05:24.420> is<00:05:24.660> bouncing<00:05:25.020> off

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
case I think when light is bouncing off

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.660 
case I think when light is bouncing off
the<00:05:25.200> edge<00:05:25.290> of<00:05:25.380> that<00:05:25.470> maybe<00:05:25.740> you<00:05:26.430> could<00:05:26.550> see

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
the edge of that maybe you could see

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.860 
the edge of that maybe you could see
like<00:05:26.700> a<00:05:26.820> slight<00:05:27.060> haze<00:05:27.210> but<00:05:27.420> there<00:05:27.540> were<00:05:27.630> times

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
like a slight haze but there were times

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.760 
like a slight haze but there were times
I<00:05:27.990> took<00:05:28.140> pictures<00:05:28.410> with<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.590> with<00:05:28.710> the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
I took pictures with it with the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.080 
I took pictures with it with the
front-facing<00:05:29.100> camera<00:05:29.490> there<00:05:29.640> was<00:05:29.730> no<00:05:29.820> issues

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
front-facing camera there was no issues

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.370 
front-facing camera there was no issues
whatsoever<00:05:30.240> and<00:05:30.780> then<00:05:31.110> there<00:05:31.230> were<00:05:31.290> other

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
whatsoever and then there were other

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.380 
whatsoever and then there were other
times<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:32.010> just<00:05:32.610> noticed<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:33.120> there<00:05:33.270> was<00:05:33.330> a

and<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.510> flash<00:05:42.660> is<00:05:42.960> enough<00:05:43.380> space<00:05:43.620> around<00:05:43.650> us

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
and the flash is enough space around us

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.320
