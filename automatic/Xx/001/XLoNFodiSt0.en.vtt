 I like cows, cows, that's me 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 makes optimistic optimistic why 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.960
 profoundly optimistic existentially 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.130
 optimistic and why listen there is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.440
 so many things that go beyond you 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.140
 all edges that are impossible to 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.740
 grab to catch to understand so much 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.229
 things that are too too you see the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.479
 infinite infinite infinite so many 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.090
 things that overwhelm you that this book has 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:45.899
 never ever understand then a cow 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:48.330
 you see a cow it's simple that's where 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.610
 it's clear it's net it's transparent 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.220
 even when this pac 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.950
 yes it's transparent a cow with its 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.909
 horns his ears his muzzle his hair 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.920
 it fits it completely matches 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.560
 how does it fit that corresponds to 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.560
 the idea starts to ideas 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.370
 to the idea that you make yourself a cow of 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.530
 cow cows now you 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.920
 see a cow's eyes the look the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.500
 lure yes lure language to language 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.930
 right now you know you know it's 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.900
 Language is a pity that there are 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.120
 cow names starts with names of 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.030
 cows and of course there are names of 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.690
 cow klein no for example aurélie 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.380
 amélie anthony brigitte bérénice

 Heavenly blandine Corinne Celine dagmar

 daphne ernestine emmanuel stops 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.130
 stop I'm talking to you about cow's name and 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.750
 so you do not ask for cow long 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.480
 I give you breeding 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.890

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.050
 of lyon 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.390
 all the names absolutely all the names 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:08.410
 are cow names a cold duty 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:10.660
 face but the language of the cows what the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.660
 cow tongue cow tongue 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.820
 the speaking or the language you speak of 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.470
 French mages I do not speak surely 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.950
 not cows english cows 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.230
 English is good for roasts the 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.360
 tarpaulins are international they get 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.780
 do not understand she's talking all the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840
 languages 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.120
 it's the superiority of cows but 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.340
 she understands what do they do to you 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.730
 include the other cow the other cow 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.430
 or being others as a cow 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.580
 stop stop stop a cow my only 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.700
 luck for me is the maximum of the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.140
 cow me I think French is 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.240
 better suited to talk about cows 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.060
 that one as you prove age there 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.660
 arrive and then we feel right away 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.110
 washing 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.630
 while caro nothing to see but nothing if 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.280
 you are honest if you are serious you see 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.040
 although it has no relation 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.110
 it's true that's why cows 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.220
 French are superior as cows 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.380
 calves cows landaises 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.780
 but whatever is making them 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.280
 superior their relationship to language 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.260
 This is what ranks 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.150
 they live in French 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.130
 it's all like a soundtrack 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.880
 original is still better than 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.320
 subtitles 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.300
 I do not understand your comparison 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.000
 what do not you understand where is 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.250
 the original soundtrack of cows does 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.960
 do not be stupid even closing the 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.150
 eyes in your head you hear it 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.550
 yes but I do not see the relationship with the 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.930
 French so we can see that you 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.730
 are not from here 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.080
 and as root is a meaning not 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.080
 nobody can explain
