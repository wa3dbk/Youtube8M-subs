really cut out the the card and now I'm

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.960 
really cut out the the card and now I'm
gonna<00:00:19.890> glue<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> sides<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.180> fold<00:00:21.539> all<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
gonna glue the sides so fold all the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.710 
gonna glue the sides so fold all the
areas<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.000> you've<00:00:25.580> scored<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:27.300> know<00:00:27.390> which

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
areas that you've scored you know which

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.710 
areas that you've scored you know which
include<00:00:28.050> those<00:00:28.199> sides<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.920> then<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.720> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
include those sides and then the the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.819 
include those sides and then the the
clasp<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.380> top<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> folded<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
clasp on top so the way I folded the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.260 
clasp on top so the way I folded the
edges<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.420> top<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.750> bottom<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> picture

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
edges the top and bottom in this picture

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.729 
edges the top and bottom in this picture
they<00:00:39.270> fold<00:00:39.540> inwards<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.590> also

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
they fold inwards but you could also

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.160 
they fold inwards but you could also
have<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:41.280> fold<00:00:41.579> outwards<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.840> put

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
have them fold outwards if you put

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
have them fold outwards if you put
something<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.739> know<00:00:44.100> relatively<00:00:44.610> large<00:00:44.910> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
something you know relatively large in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.830 
something you know relatively large in
the<00:00:45.239> purse<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.860> glue<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> sides

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
the purse so I'm going to glue the sides

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.240 
the purse so I'm going to glue the sides
again<00:00:48.840> I'm<00:00:49.140> using<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.649> bit<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.890> Elmer's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
again I'm using a little bit of Elmer's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:02.680 
again I'm using a little bit of Elmer's
glue

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.770 

and<00:01:03.230> then<00:01:03.350> fold<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.770> card<00:01:04.120> to<00:01:05.120> make<00:01:05.150> sure<00:01:05.510> that

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
and then fold the card to make sure that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:20.010 
and then fold the card to make sure that
the<00:01:05.960> edges<00:01:06.790> line<00:01:07.790> up

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.460 

there<00:01:20.829> now<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.130> inside<00:01:21.579> is<00:01:21.880> pretty<00:01:22.240> much<00:01:22.390> done

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.130 

so<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.280> next<00:01:28.460> step<00:01:28.670> is<00:01:28.910> to<00:01:29.390> glue<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.750> backing

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
so the next step is to glue the backing

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.650 
so the next step is to glue the backing
so<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.010> backing<00:01:31.370> is<00:01:31.460> made<00:01:31.730> up<00:01:32.000> of<00:01:32.240> another

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
so the backing is made up of another

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.200 
so the backing is made up of another
cardstock<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:34.010> six<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.790> quarter<00:01:35.180> by

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
cardstock that is six and a quarter by

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.640 
cardstock that is six and a quarter by
four<00:01:35.480> and<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.110> quarter<00:01:36.290> inches<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.600> take<00:01:38.840> two

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
four and a quarter inches so take two

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.760 
four and a quarter inches so take two
pieces<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:41.120> then<00:01:41.300> glue<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:41.990> cardstock<00:01:42.620> to

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
pieces and then glue the cardstock to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.830 
pieces and then glue the cardstock to
the<00:01:42.860> back<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.280> I'm<00:01:43.790> using<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:46.360> glue<00:01:47.360> stick<00:01:47.390> for

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
the back and I'm using a glue stick for

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.720 
the back and I'm using a glue stick for
the<00:01:47.930> center<00:01:48.560> parts<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.160> then<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> little<00:01:49.580> bit

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
the center parts and then a little bit

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.330 
the center parts and then a little bit
Elmer's<00:01:50.030> glue<00:01:50.150> on<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.330> edges<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:51.800> reduce<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
Elmer's glue on the edges to reduce the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.460 
Elmer's glue on the edges to reduce the
amount<00:01:52.580> of<00:01:53.500> bowing<00:01:54.500> or

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
amount of bowing or

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.020 
amount of bowing or
curling<00:01:57.470> that<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.740> page<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.610> paper<00:01:58.850> would

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
curling that the page the paper would

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:13.630 
curling that the page the paper would
have<00:01:59.240> if<00:01:59.480> I<00:01:59.570> used<00:01:59.890> Elmer's<00:02:00.890> glue<00:02:01.130> everywhere

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.140 

okay<00:02:14.330> first<00:02:14.540> start<00:02:14.810> up<00:02:14.960> by<00:02:15.200> gluing<00:02:15.680> one

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
okay first start up by gluing one

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.030 
okay first start up by gluing one
backing<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.510> you'll<00:02:18.140> see<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.680> backing

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
backing and you'll see that the backing

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.770 
backing and you'll see that the backing
is<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> little<00:02:19.430> bit<00:02:19.520> larger<00:02:19.790> than<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.940> card<00:02:20.330> so

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
is a little bit larger than the card so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.700 
is a little bit larger than the card so
you'll<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.310> frame<00:02:22.960> so<00:02:23.960> align<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.410> first

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
you'll have a frame so align that first

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.490 
you'll have a frame so align that first
edge<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> center<00:02:26.450> crease<00:02:26.630> as<00:02:27.020> well<00:02:27.080> as<00:02:27.440> you

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
edge to the center crease as well as you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.740 
edge to the center crease as well as you
can

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.490 

now<00:02:34.750> glue<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.290> other<00:02:35.319> half<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:38.080> same<00:02:38.319> way

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
now glue the other half on the same way

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.800 
now glue the other half on the same way
but<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.220> careful<00:02:39.550> not<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.700> gain<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.940> glue<00:02:40.330> on<00:02:40.599> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
but be careful not to gain a glue on the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:52.250 
but be careful not to gain a glue on the
inside<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.860> card

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.800 

make<00:02:52.830> sure<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.280> edge<00:02:53.430> has<00:02:54.209> enough<00:02:54.540> glue

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
make sure that the edge has enough glue

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:05.699 
make sure that the edge has enough glue
that<00:02:55.769> inside<00:02:56.250> crease

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.729 

okay<00:03:06.430> now<00:03:06.549> go<00:03:07.060> ahead<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.239> line<00:03:07.599> up<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.049> second

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
okay now go ahead and line up the second

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.970 
okay now go ahead and line up the second
card<00:03:09.010> backing<00:03:09.930> with<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.140> first<00:03:11.469> backing<00:03:11.890> to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980
