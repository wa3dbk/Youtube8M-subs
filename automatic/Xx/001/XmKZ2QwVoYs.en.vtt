unique<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.460> pearl<00:01:36.180> essence

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
unique for that because pearl essence

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
think it's a lot rarer than a legendary

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.020 
think it's a lot rarer than a legendary
but<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:43.170> also<00:01:43.439> got<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.070> cool<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.579> thing

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
but it's also got the cool little thing

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.780 
but it's also got the cool little thing
that<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.810> blue<00:01:46.320> unique<00:01:46.829> weapon<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.340> hard<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
that a blue unique weapon would hard and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.450 
that a blue unique weapon would hard and
