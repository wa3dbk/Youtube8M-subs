 evaluation of our server 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.049
 can 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.679
 and 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:09.749

 and creating down other folders 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.129
 as you can see 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.129
 and then the download will go by itself 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.729
 yes affects the client base 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.609
