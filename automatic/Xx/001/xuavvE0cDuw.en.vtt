this<00:00:00.539> slide<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.319> trachea<00:00:02.250> at<00:00:02.490> low<00:00:02.879> power

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
this slide is the trachea at low power

this slide is the trachea at low power
the<00:00:03.540> tip<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.929> pointer<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.529> on<00:00:04.740> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
the tip of the pointer is on the

epithelial layer of the trachea this is

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.850 
epithelial layer of the trachea this is
actually<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> layer<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.990> stratified<00:00:10.590> columnar
