00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.590 

that's<00:00:42.840> how<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.260> fits<00:00:43.649> relative<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:45.239> how<00:00:45.450> I'm

riding<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.739> notice<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.850> Ruth<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
riding so you notice if you Ruth if you

riding so you notice if you Ruth if you
compare<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.469> author<00:00:49.950> movie<00:00:50.489> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
compare this with the author movie that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.670 
compare this with the author movie that
I<00:00:50.670> did<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> higher<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.809> meaning<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
I did it's it's a higher up meaning that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.799 
I did it's it's a higher up meaning that
I<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> lot<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> adjustments<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
I do have to do a lot of adjustments to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.139 
I do have to do a lot of adjustments to
get<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> sort<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> level<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.969> would

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
get at the sort of level that I would

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
get at the sort of level that I would
regard<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.690> uncomfortable<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.399> issue

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
regard as uncomfortable now the issue

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
regard as uncomfortable now the issue
that<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.910> have<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.120> his<00:01:00.329> backpack<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.899> if

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that I have with his backpack is if

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.569 
that I have with his backpack is if
you're<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.559> racing<00:01:02.039> position<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you're in the racing position like that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.030 
you're in the racing position like that
not<00:01:03.539> only<00:01:03.750> does<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> stick<00:01:04.199> tall<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> have

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
not only does it stick tall if you have

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.630 
not only does it stick tall if you have
a<00:01:05.070> helmet<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.580> head<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:07.619> sort<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> angle

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
a helmet on your head that sort of angle

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
a helmet on your head that sort of angle
would<00:01:08.880> mean<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.689> top<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.990> your<00:01:10.140> helmet

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
would mean that the top of your helmet

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
would mean that the top of your helmet
is<00:01:10.619> sort<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:13.189> intruding<00:01:14.189> into<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> upper

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
is sort of intruding into the upper

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.899 
is sort of intruding into the upper
space<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> backpack<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.790> from<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
space of the backpack and from this

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
space of the backpack and from this
orientation<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.110> thick<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
orientation you can see how thick the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.679 
orientation you can see how thick the
back<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> hump<00:01:20.700> meaning<00:01:21.659> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
back is because of the hump meaning that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.840 
back is because of the hump meaning that
period<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.680> I'm<00:01:22.799> doing<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.310> shoulder<00:01:23.640> checks

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
period when I'm doing so shoulder checks

period when I'm doing so shoulder checks
