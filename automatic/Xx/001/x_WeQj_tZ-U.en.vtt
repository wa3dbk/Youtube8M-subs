00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820

lead in this game for much of the game
the<00:00:52.450> lakers<00:00:52.600> made<00:00:52.990> a<00:00:53.020> good<00:00:53.290> push<00:00:53.590> in<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:55.140> third

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
didn't give up which is a good sign so

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
didn't give up which is a good sign so
even<00:01:00.340> though<00:01:00.370> they're<00:01:00.550> not<00:01:00.580> playing<00:01:00.970> that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
even though they're not playing that

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.880 
even though they're not playing that
well<00:01:01.450> right<00:01:01.720> now<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.080> they're<00:01:02.230> missing<00:01:02.620> Steve

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
well right now and they're missing Steve

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.789 
well right now and they're missing Steve
Nash<00:01:03.220> and<00:01:03.460> Pau<00:01:03.640> Gasol<00:01:03.900> they<00:01:04.900> played<00:01:05.229> hard<00:01:05.259> they

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
Nash and Pau Gasol they played hard they

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.560 
Nash and Pau Gasol they played hard they
they<00:01:06.310> kept<00:01:06.520> trying<00:01:06.850> it's<00:01:07.060> just<00:01:07.270> kind<00:01:07.509> of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
they kept trying it's just kind of

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.709 
they kept trying it's just kind of
things<00:01:07.900> aren't<00:01:08.290> in<00:01:08.439> sync<00:01:08.979> right<00:01:09.369> now<00:01:09.719> so

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
things aren't in sync right now so

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.270 
things aren't in sync right now so
that's<00:01:10.929> where<00:01:11.170> they're<00:01:11.320> at<00:01:11.499> and<00:01:11.530> now<00:01:12.100> there

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
that's where they're at and now there

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.950 
that's where they're at and now there
are<00:01:12.340> a<00:01:12.399> lot<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.549> new<00:01:12.729> pieces<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.329> this<00:01:13.479> team<00:01:13.719> so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
are a lot of new pieces on this team so

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.989 
are a lot of new pieces on this team so
I<00:01:13.990> guess<00:01:14.200> that's<00:01:14.439> not<00:01:14.590> really<00:01:14.649> a<00:01:14.950> big<00:01:15.460> surprise

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:15.999 
I guess that's not really a big surprise

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.300 
I guess that's not really a big surprise
I<00:01:16.359> just<00:01:17.049> feel<00:01:17.289> like<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.679> Lakers<00:01:18.039> defense

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
I just feel like the Lakers defense

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.639 
I just feel like the Lakers defense
isn't<00:01:18.939> good<00:01:19.390> enough<00:01:19.420> right<00:01:19.960> now<00:01:19.990> neither

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
isn't good enough right now neither

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.020 
isn't good enough right now neither
their<00:01:21.159> base<00:01:21.969> defense<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:22.899> a<00:01:22.960> half<00:01:23.170> court<00:01:23.530> and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
their base defense and a half court and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.510 
their base defense and a half court and
also<00:01:25.030> their<00:01:25.270> transition<00:01:25.960> defense<00:01:26.369> Lakers<00:01:27.369> had

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
also their transition defense Lakers had

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.609 
also their transition defense Lakers had
too<00:01:27.759> many<00:01:27.880> turnovers<00:01:28.179> in<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:28.689> game<00:01:28.990> 19

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
too many turnovers in this game 19

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.919 
too many turnovers in this game 19
turnovers<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.429> even<00:01:30.999> though<00:01:31.119> Kobe<00:01:31.539> Bryant

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.440 
turnovers and even though Kobe Bryant
had<00:01:32.109> 42<00:01:32.649> points<00:01:33.369> in<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.579> very<00:01:33.850> efficient

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
had 42 points in a very efficient

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.899 
had 42 points in a very efficient
performance<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:35.170> Dwight<00:01:35.799> Howard<00:01:36.189> had<00:01:36.369> 19

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
performance and Dwight Howard had 19

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.690

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
points and 20 rebounds it's just it

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.200 
points and 20 rebounds it's just it
doesn't<00:01:40.030> feel<00:01:40.450> like<00:01:40.749> it's<00:01:41.409> coming<00:01:41.950> together

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
doesn't feel like it's coming together

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.749 
doesn't feel like it's coming together
the<00:01:43.210> teams<00:01:43.600> just<00:01:44.049> they're<00:01:45.009> not<00:01:45.249> in<00:01:45.429> sync

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
the teams just they're not in sync

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.539 
the teams just they're not in sync
they're<00:01:46.509> not<00:01:46.749> in<00:01:46.929> sync<00:01:47.319> so<00:01:47.950> you're<00:01:48.159> having

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
they're not in sync so you're having

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.709 
they're not in sync so you're having
individual<00:01:49.770> spots<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:51.069> brilliance<00:01:51.549> like<00:01:52.209> Kobe

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
individual spots of brilliance like Kobe

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.139 
individual spots of brilliance like Kobe
or<00:01:52.869> like<00:01:53.530> Dwight<00:01:53.859> Howard<00:01:54.219> rebounding<00:01:54.819> but<00:01:54.969> the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.690 
team isn't functioning as a unit right
now<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:59.020> uh<00:01:59.409> but<00:02:00.159> they're<00:02:00.340> gonna<00:02:00.459> have<00:02:00.609> to

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
now and uh but they're gonna have to

season<00:02:25.420> struggles<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:26.230> think<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.950> lakers<00:02:27.220> will

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
season struggles I think the lakers will

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.800 
season struggles I think the lakers will
be<00:02:28.090> at<00:02:28.930> best<00:02:29.790> they'll<00:02:30.790> get<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.120> nut<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.510> fifth

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
be at best they'll get the nut the fifth

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.620 
be at best they'll get the nut the fifth
seed<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> West<00:02:32.830> behind<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.090> Grizzlies

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
seed in the West behind the Grizzlies

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.190 
seed in the West behind the Grizzlies
the<00:02:35.410> Clippers<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.489> Spurs<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.690> funder

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the Clippers the Spurs and the funder

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.750 
the Clippers the Spurs and the funder
and<00:02:38.319> that's<00:02:38.950> going<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.250> make<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.580> very

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
and that's going to make it very

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.360 
and that's going to make it very
difficult<00:02:40.060> because<00:02:40.959> assuming<00:02:41.830> all<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.100> top

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
difficult because assuming all the top

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.180 
difficult because assuming all the top
seeds<00:02:42.730> win<00:02:43.239> their<00:02:43.690> series<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.830> Lakers

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
seeds win their series and the Lakers

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.520 
seeds win their series and the Lakers

1995 Houston was seeded number six I
believe<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.480> playoffs<00:03:05.410> but<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:06.190> was

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
believe in in the playoffs but that was

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.759 
believe in in the playoffs but that was
a<00:03:06.430> tested<00:03:07.209> team<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:08.050> was<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.200> team<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.620> had

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
a tested team that was a team that had

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.920 
a tested team that was a team that had
excellent<00:03:09.100> chemistry<00:03:09.580> that's<00:03:10.569> Hakeem

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890

they<00:03:18.100> weren't<00:03:18.340> getting<00:03:18.610> used<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:19.030> one<00:03:19.180> another

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.660 
they weren't getting used to one another
really<00:03:19.840> although<00:03:20.830> they<00:03:20.950> had<00:03:21.069> added<00:03:21.250> Clyde

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670

Drexler<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.750> Lakers<00:03:23.079> aren't<00:03:23.320> at<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.620> level

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
Drexler the Lakers aren't at that level

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.830 
Drexler the Lakers aren't at that level
that<00:03:24.100> not<00:03:24.760> right<00:03:24.940> now<00:03:25.150> they're<00:03:25.329> not<00:03:25.480> anyway

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
that not right now they're not anyway

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.020 
that not right now they're not anyway
maybe<00:03:26.560> they<00:03:26.829> can<00:03:27.040> get<00:03:27.220> there<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> last

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030

three quarters of the season right now
it<00:03:30.310> doesn't<00:03:30.340> look<00:03:30.640> good<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:31.320> think<00:03:32.320> it's<00:03:32.410> going

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it doesn't look good I think it's going

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.650 
it doesn't look good I think it's going
to<00:03:32.620> be<00:03:32.769> very<00:03:32.799> difficult<00:03:33.459> for<00:03:33.910> them<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.269> make<00:03:34.630> a

to be very difficult for them to make a

going to be tough and this year I know
started<00:03:53.650> out<00:03:53.799> with<00:03:53.950> really<00:03:54.549> high

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
started out with really high

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.729 
started out with really high
expectations<00:03:55.269> a<00:03:55.930> lot<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.320> people<00:03:56.560> were

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
expectations a lot of people were

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.180 
expectations a lot of people were
thinking<00:03:56.980> kobe<00:03:57.700> vs<00:03:58.120> lebron<00:03:58.299> final<00:03:59.170> you<00:04:00.070> know

thinking kobe vs lebron final you know
honestly<00:04:00.670> i<00:04:01.060> think<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.480> lakers<00:04:01.690> at<00:04:01.959> one<00:04:02.140> point

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
honestly i think the lakers at one point

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.120 
honestly i think the lakers at one point
in<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:03.730> season<00:04:03.970> or<00:04:04.269> whatever<00:04:04.510> were<00:04:04.840> were<00:04:05.470> you

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
in the season or whatever were were you

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.949 
in the season or whatever were were you
know<00:04:06.489> they<00:04:06.519> might<00:04:06.730> have<00:04:06.940> even<00:04:07.030> been<00:04:07.209> thought

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
know they might have even been thought

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.460 
know they might have even been thought
to<00:04:08.019> be<00:04:08.290> even<00:04:08.859> a<00:04:09.420> stronger<00:04:10.420> contender<00:04:11.019> than<00:04:11.200> the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
to be even a stronger contender than the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.699 
to be even a stronger contender than the
miami<00:04:11.920> heat<00:04:12.160> for<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:13.090> win<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.390> title<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.470> now

miami heat for to win the title and now

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.610 
miami heat for to win the title and now
it's<00:04:15.220> it's<00:04:15.700> not<00:04:16.060> looking<00:04:16.510> like<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.989> it's<00:04:17.410> not

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
it's it's not looking like that it's not

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.430 
it's it's not looking like that it's not
looking<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.100> good<00:04:18.459> as<00:04:18.729> their<00:04:19.150> 9<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.660> 13<00:04:19.840> and

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
looking that good as their 9 and 13 and

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.250 
looking that good as their 9 and 13 and
and<00:04:20.560> really<00:04:21.070> struggling<00:04:21.539> look<00:04:22.539> Cleveland<00:04:23.080> is

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
and really struggling look Cleveland is

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.710 
and really struggling look Cleveland is
better<00:04:23.590> than<00:04:24.250> their<00:04:24.520> record<00:04:24.729> they<00:04:25.270> are<00:04:25.330> better

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
better than their record they are better

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.070 
better than their record they are better
team<00:04:26.080> than<00:04:26.110> 5<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.830> 17<00:04:27.159> because<00:04:28.060> Kyrie<00:04:28.510> Irving

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
team than 5 and 17 because Kyrie Irving

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.500 
team than 5 and 17 because Kyrie Irving
missed<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.440> bunch<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.770> games<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.310> dion<00:04:31.060> Waiters

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
missed a bunch of games and dion Waiters

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.700 
missed a bunch of games and dion Waiters
i<00:04:31.690> think<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:32.140> also<00:04:32.320> miss

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
i think is also miss

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.990 
i think is also miss
games<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.100> he<00:04:33.220> didn't<00:04:33.400> play<00:04:33.490> again<00:04:33.820> tonight

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
games and he didn't play again tonight

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.870 
games and he didn't play again tonight
but<00:04:34.390> so<00:04:34.840> they're<00:04:35.320> better<00:04:35.680> than<00:04:35.830> five<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.550> 17

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
but so they're better than five and 17

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.550 
but so they're better than five and 17
but<00:04:37.270> still<00:04:37.540> they're<00:04:37.750> not<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.170> good<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.440> a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
but still they're not that good of a

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.390 
but still they're not that good of a
team<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:40.320> they<00:04:41.320> really<00:04:41.800> didn't<00:04:41.980> get<00:04:42.100> anything

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
team and they really didn't get anything

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.070 
team and they really didn't get anything
off<00:04:42.670> of<00:04:42.730> their<00:04:43.030> bench<00:04:43.270> tonight<00:04:43.540> and<00:04:43.870> they

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
off of their bench tonight and they

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.110 
off of their bench tonight and they
still<00:04:44.350> handle<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.770> Lakers<00:04:45.130> even<00:04:45.610> with<00:04:45.730> Kobe

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
still handle the Lakers even with Kobe

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.600 
still handle the Lakers even with Kobe
going<00:04:46.360> crazy<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.320> scoring<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:47.950> Dwight

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
going crazy and scoring and Dwight

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.300 
going crazy and scoring and Dwight
Howard<00:04:49.000> dominating<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:49.960> mean<00:04:50.350> 19<00:04:50.770> points20

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
Howard dominating I mean 19 points20

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.920 
Howard dominating I mean 19 points20
boards<00:04:51.880> now<00:04:52.120> he<00:04:52.180> struggled<00:04:52.840> at<00:04:52.870> the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
boards now he struggled at the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.870 
boards now he struggled at the
free-throw<00:04:53.170> line<00:04:53.550> didn't<00:04:54.550> take<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.670> lot<00:04:54.820> of

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
free-throw line didn't take a lot of

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.610 
free-throw line didn't take a lot of
shots<00:04:55.180> what<00:04:55.390> he<00:04:55.480> still<00:04:55.690> dominated<00:04:56.290> a<00:04:56.320> lot<00:04:56.500> of

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
shots what he still dominated a lot of

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.070 
shots what he still dominated a lot of
this<00:04:56.710> game<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.220> it's<00:04:57.340> like<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:58.390> still<00:04:58.840> didn't

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
this game and it's like it still didn't

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.360 
this game and it's like it still didn't
feel<00:04:59.230> like<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.590> Lakers<00:04:59.890> were<00:05:00.040> ever<00:05:00.190> really

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
feel like the Lakers were ever really

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.120 
feel like the Lakers were ever really
going<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:00.700> win<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.180> that's<00:05:01.780> that's<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.920> tough

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
going to win and that's that's a tough

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.670 
going to win and that's that's a tough
situation<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:04.630> think<00:05:05.260> they're<00:05:05.350> going<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.530> be<00:05:05.650> a

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
situation I think they're going to be a

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.250 
situation I think they're going to be a
lot<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:05.890> questions<00:05:06.400> asked<00:05:06.850> now<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.330> Mike

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
lot of questions asked now of Mike

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.250 
lot of questions asked now of Mike
D'Antoni<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:09.630> maybe<00:05:10.630> even<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.020> ownership

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
D'Antoni and maybe even the ownership

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260 
D'Antoni and maybe even the ownership
you<00:05:11.800> know<00:05:11.920> was<00:05:12.160> Mike<00:05:12.370> D'Antoni<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:13.090> right

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
you know was Mike D'Antoni the right

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.730 
you know was Mike D'Antoni the right
hire<00:05:14.040> etc<00:05:15.040> etc<00:05:15.190> etc<00:05:15.610> so<00:05:16.260> this<00:05:17.260> was<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.470> tough

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
hire etc etc etc so this was a tough

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.790 
hire etc etc etc so this was a tough
loss<00:05:17.860> but<00:05:19.230> it<00:05:20.230> just<00:05:20.380> got<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.620> keep<00:05:20.740> going

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
loss but it just got to keep going

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.610 
loss but it just got to keep going
hopefully<00:05:21.760> they<00:05:21.940> can<00:05:22.000> work<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.510> out<00:05:22.630> figure<00:05:23.410> it

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
hopefully they can work it out figure it

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.400 
hopefully they can work it out figure it
out<00:05:23.830> um<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.910> good<00:05:25.060> thing<00:05:25.360> is<00:05:25.390> is<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:25.930> wicket

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
out um the good thing is is that wicket

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.140 
out um the good thing is is that wicket
with<00:05:26.620> veterans<00:05:27.040> like<00:05:27.400> Nash<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.750> kobe<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.710> pau

with veterans like Nash and kobe and pau

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.810

gasol<00:05:31.470> those<00:05:32.470> guys<00:05:32.740> can<00:05:33.010> figure<00:05:33.250> things<00:05:33.610> out

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
gasol those guys can figure things out

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.990 
gasol those guys can figure things out
quicker<00:05:34.210> than<00:05:34.480> younger<00:05:34.780> players<00:05:35.170> can<00:05:35.530> so<00:05:36.160> you

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
quicker than younger players can so you

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.990 
quicker than younger players can so you
can't<00:05:37.570> give<00:05:37.720> up<00:05:37.900> hope<00:05:37.950> but<00:05:38.950> um<00:05:39.220> it's<00:05:39.700> just

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
can't give up hope but um it's just

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.850 
can't give up hope but um it's just
tough<00:05:40.240> right<00:05:40.480> now<00:05:40.510> and<00:05:40.990> so<00:05:41.350> hopefully<00:05:41.680> those

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
tough right now and so hopefully those

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.650 
tough right now and so hopefully those
guys<00:05:41.890> can<00:05:42.310> get<00:05:42.430> healthy<00:05:42.820> and<00:05:42.940> get<00:05:43.120> back<00:05:43.330> in<00:05:43.540> the
