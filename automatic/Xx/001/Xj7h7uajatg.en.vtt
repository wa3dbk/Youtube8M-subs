loved all their lives no skills are
really<00:00:20.509> required<00:00:20.630> every<00:00:21.590> student<00:00:22.160> comes<00:00:22.489> to

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
really required every student comes to

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.970 
really required every student comes to
the<00:00:22.970> school<00:00:23.210> with<00:00:23.480> different<00:00:23.809> skill<00:00:24.079> sets<00:00:24.410> so

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
the school with different skill sets so

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.010 
the school with different skill sets so
we<00:00:25.160> start<00:00:25.430> with<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:25.669> basics<00:00:26.149> with<00:00:26.390> theory<00:00:26.720> and

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
we start with the basics with theory and

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.589 
we start with the basics with theory and
build<00:00:27.349> from<00:00:27.590> there<00:00:27.860> we<00:00:28.550> spend<00:00:29.149> a<00:00:29.210> tremendous

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
build from there we spend a tremendous

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.620 
build from there we spend a tremendous
amount<00:00:29.779> of<00:00:29.899> time<00:00:30.110> on<00:00:30.550> electrical<00:00:31.550> both<00:00:31.820> DC<00:00:32.360> and

amount of time on electrical both DC and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.560 
amount of time on electrical both DC and
AC<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.620> do<00:00:33.770> a<00:00:33.800> lot<00:00:34.070> of<00:00:34.100> propulsion<00:00:34.880> you<00:00:35.360> got<00:00:35.450> to

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
AC we do a lot of propulsion you got to

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.200 
AC we do a lot of propulsion you got to
learn<00:00:35.660> about<00:00:35.900> gas<00:00:36.200> and<00:00:36.530> diesel<00:00:36.710> engines<00:00:37.210> do

after<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.330> students<00:00:44.720> have<00:00:44.840> had<00:00:45.020> time<00:00:45.380> to

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
after the students have had time to

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.260 
after the students have had time to
digest<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.400> lot<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.730> what<00:00:46.880> they've<00:00:47.030> learned

digest a lot of what they've learned
here<00:00:47.480> we<00:00:48.020> put<00:00:48.230> them<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.410> work<00:00:48.560> on<00:00:48.800> actual

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
here we put them to work on actual

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.840 
here we put them to work on actual
project<00:00:50.090> boats<00:00:50.420> here<00:00:50.930> in<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.590> shop<00:00:52.250> they'll

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
project boats here in the shop they'll

and<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.710> number<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.070> other<00:00:58.550> things<00:00:58.720> we<00:00:59.720> also

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
and a number of other things we also

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.610 
and a number of other things we also
have<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:01.239> module<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:02.540> we've<00:01:02.690> assembled<00:01:03.050> that

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
have a module that we've assembled that

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.980 
have a module that we've assembled that
looks<00:01:04.070> very<00:01:04.670> much<00:01:04.879> like<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:05.150> section<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.780> boat

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
looks very much like a section of a boat

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.430 
looks very much like a section of a boat
where<00:01:06.740> we<00:01:07.010> will<00:01:07.250> replicate<00:01:08.110> DC<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.290> AC

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
where we will replicate DC and AC

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.260 
where we will replicate DC and AC
electrical<00:01:10.070> systems<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.850> lot<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.180> the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
electrical systems and a lot of the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.880 
electrical systems and a lot of the
plumbing<00:01:11.450> systems<00:01:11.990> used<00:01:12.229> on<00:01:12.380> board<00:01:12.620> a<00:01:12.680> boat

and<00:01:13.390> we<00:01:14.390> team<00:01:14.840> up<00:01:14.870> two<00:01:15.290> students<00:01:15.800> per<00:01:15.830> each<00:01:16.130> one

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
and we team up two students per each one

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.690 
and we team up two students per each one
of<00:01:16.520> those<00:01:16.670> modules<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:17.960> quite<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.350> bit<00:01:18.650> of

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
of those modules it's quite a bit of

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.820 
of those modules it's quite a bit of
hands-on<00:01:19.700> work<00:01:20.090> for<00:01:21.020> all<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.290> our<00:01:21.380> students
