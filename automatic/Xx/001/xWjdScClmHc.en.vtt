00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 the good news the alliance arena 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 is also lit without franck ribery 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.110
 get and I can now our four 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 Men will be in residence area and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:21.779
 Japan will be released and Andreas Dreyer 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.840
 and ask to take over this task 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.029
 with a spirited pressure on this 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.070
 so-called water is still there 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.880
 five seconds that had to do so 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 tell 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.899
 It is the 50 customers expect over there 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.629
 it brings the microphone back to the mistress 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.770
 that will explain to you and us what we are 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.770
 because see everything here 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.739
 photographers are offering all the protection 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.379
 the new alliance arena does not open there 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.410
 to show us what we like from now on 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.410
 can with our seriously the ddr 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.580
 what is perhaps even more interesting is the 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.880
 for us of course this project too 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.020
 not over with these takeovers 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.150
 with this handover with this 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.830
 activation but that we ourselves 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.230
 of course, also a service 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.940
 activity on this project depends thus 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.110
 Ten years from now we will do that too 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.390
 service side care 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.890
 I think what they saw here was the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.410
 worth the effort and I hope that it 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.630
 they like and all the fans of the fc 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.370
 bavaria likes that we build on it 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.500
 many more new ideas 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.890
 come designed as this facade and 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.890
 be used 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.220
 Next thing you see after this world 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.890
 will be a timer so here 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.490
 builds up from top to bottom row for 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:22.390
 row the red off in white and respectively 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.330
 a white facade and this one again 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.880
 would be followed after all, again by 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.350
 another scenario which is 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.540
 then split takes and they become 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.370
 See the same again where it is not 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.410
 row after row without down 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.260
 but in the column from the left to the right 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.480
 changes interesting is that for 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.870
 Of course, this project does not work for us either 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.480
 is to end with these adopted this 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.980
 handover with this unlock but 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.380
 for us, of course, also a 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.300
 Service activity on this project 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.400
 So, ten years from now , we'll do it 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.110
 also look after the service side and 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.200
 so that worked really well 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.450
 we still another world novelty in this blog 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.900
 entry we call this active and active 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:08.320
 pages praised monitoring system which 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.060
 All 6500 lights allow us over 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.740
 on 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.590
 about a system which with old 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.050
 shine services network cells to adjacent 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.689
 So monitor the function 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.769
 to measure the temperature in the system 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.629
 the expansion of capacity the 

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:24.819
 power consumption to measure after 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:27.039
 So hold something then again 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:30.209
 this is helped by preventive problems 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.209
 may occur
