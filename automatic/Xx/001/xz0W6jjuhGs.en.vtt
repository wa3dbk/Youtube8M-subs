what's<00:00:05.330> up<00:00:05.540> in<00:00:05.779> this<00:00:05.960> tutorial<00:00:06.109> we're<00:00:06.589> going

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
what's up in this tutorial we're going

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:19.439 
what's up in this tutorial we're going
to<00:00:06.859> learn<00:00:07.069> how<00:00:07.129> to<00:00:07.279> do<00:00:07.520> ducting<00:00:08.000> check<00:00:08.480> it<00:00:08.600> out

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.519 

this<00:00:20.449> is<00:00:20.480> another<00:00:20.749> trick<00:00:21.109> we're<00:00:21.320> just

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
this is another trick we're just

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.290 
this is another trick we're just
freestyler<00:00:22.009> that's<00:00:22.189> all<00:00:22.400> from<00:00:22.609> foot<00:00:22.849> back<00:00:23.029> the

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
freestyler that's all from foot back the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.790 
freestyler that's all from foot back the
idea<00:00:23.599> is<00:00:23.749> pretty<00:00:23.810> simple<00:00:24.410> we're<00:00:24.619> going<00:00:24.650> to

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
idea is pretty simple we're going to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.470 
idea is pretty simple we're going to
knock<00:00:24.949> the<00:00:25.099> ball<00:00:25.249> up<00:00:25.429> duck<00:00:25.789> underneath<00:00:26.179> the

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
knock the ball up duck underneath the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.239 
knock the ball up duck underneath the
ball<00:00:26.659> and<00:00:26.960> let<00:00:27.140> it<00:00:27.169> come<00:00:27.409> down<00:00:27.619> on<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.130> other

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
ball and let it come down on the other

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:29.950 
ball and let it come down on the other
side<00:00:28.519> I<00:00:28.759> would<00:00:28.939> say<00:00:29.089> it'd<00:00:29.179> be<00:00:29.300> pretty<00:00:29.480> useful

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
side I would say it'd be pretty useful

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.300 
side I would say it'd be pretty useful
to<00:00:30.140> learn<00:00:30.259> house<00:00:30.470> do<00:00:30.619> be<00:00:30.769> around<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.159> moon

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
to learn house do be around the moon

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.980 
to learn house do be around the moon
before<00:00:31.489> trying<00:00:31.939> this<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.540> make<00:00:32.690> sure<00:00:32.720> you<00:00:32.900> go

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
before trying this so make sure you go

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.600 
before trying this so make sure you go
and<00:00:33.110> check<00:00:33.260> out<00:00:33.380> my<00:00:33.560> tutorial<00:00:33.740> on<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.340> if<00:00:34.520> you

and check out my tutorial on it if you
haven't<00:00:34.880> already<00:00:34.940> firstly<00:00:35.600> we're<00:00:35.780> going<00:00:35.900> to

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
haven't already firstly we're going to

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.270 
haven't already firstly we're going to
hit<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.200> ball<00:00:36.350> up<00:00:36.410> we're<00:00:36.890> not<00:00:36.980> going<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.130> hit

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
hit the ball up we're not going to hit

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.590 
hit the ball up we're not going to hit
the<00:00:37.340> ball<00:00:37.520> too<00:00:37.700> hard<00:00:37.940> because<00:00:38.120> it<00:00:38.300> will<00:00:38.390> end<00:00:38.510> up

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
the ball too hard because it will end up

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.000 
the ball too hard because it will end up
just<00:00:38.780> smashing<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.230> ball<00:00:39.440> into<00:00:39.560> our<00:00:39.770> face

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
just smashing the ball into our face

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.770 
just smashing the ball into our face
we're<00:00:40.460> going<00:00:40.490> to<00:00:40.670> hit<00:00:40.760> it<00:00:40.880> directly<00:00:41.030> up<00:00:41.510> and

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
we're going to hit it directly up and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.630 
we're going to hit it directly up and
then<00:00:41.900> just<00:00:42.110> lean<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.680> side<00:00:42.710> just<00:00:43.310> as<00:00:43.490> the

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
then just lean to the side just as the

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.980 
then just lean to the side just as the
ball<00:00:43.820> is<00:00:43.850> about<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.330> reach<00:00:44.510> its<00:00:44.720> maximum

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
ball is about to reach its maximum

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.960 
ball is about to reach its maximum
height<00:00:45.140> we're<00:00:45.860> gonna<00:00:45.980> roll<00:00:46.280> on<00:00:46.400> a<00:00:46.460> neck<00:00:46.700> and

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
height we're gonna roll on a neck and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.480 
height we're gonna roll on a neck and
sway<00:00:47.360> back<00:00:47.630> across<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.050> other<00:00:48.320> side<00:00:48.490> ducking

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
sway back across the other side ducking

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.520 
sway back across the other side ducking
underneath<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.210> ball<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:50.630> narrowly<00:00:51.080> missing

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
underneath the ball and narrowly missing

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.320 
underneath the ball and narrowly missing
as<00:00:51.890> we<00:00:52.100> move<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.460> other<00:00:52.550> side<00:00:52.820> we<00:00:53.180> should

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
as we move to the other side we should

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.610 
as we move to the other side we should
be<00:00:53.420> able<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.600> catch<00:00:53.840> a<00:00:53.960> glimpse<00:00:54.080> of<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.410> ball

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
be able to catch a glimpse of the ball

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.290 
be able to catch a glimpse of the ball
out<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.980> corner<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.400> our<00:00:55.520> eye<00:00:55.580> passing

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
out of the corner of our eye passing

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.360 
out of the corner of our eye passing
back<00:00:56.480> down<00:00:56.720> on<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.230> shoulder<00:00:57.650> as<00:00:57.830> we<00:00:58.040> complete

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
back down on the shoulder as we complete

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.310 
back down on the shoulder as we complete
the<00:00:58.490> ducking<00:00:58.850> movement<00:00:59.270> we<00:00:59.690> want<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.990> lift<00:01:00.140> our

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
the ducking movement we want to lift our

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.020 
the ducking movement we want to lift our
head<00:01:00.500> up<00:01:00.620> slightly<00:01:00.980> but<00:01:01.340> we<00:01:01.460> don't<00:01:01.640> lift<00:01:01.850> it

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
head up slightly but we don't lift it

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.670 
head up slightly but we don't lift it
straight<00:01:02.150> back<00:01:02.450> up<00:01:02.630> because<00:01:03.080> obviously<00:01:03.230> we're

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
straight back up because obviously we're

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.260 
straight back up because obviously we're
going<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:03.860> be<00:01:03.920> continuing<00:01:04.460> juggling<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:04.999> ball

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.760 

the<00:01:10.750> thing<00:01:10.870> that<00:01:11.020> makes<00:01:11.170> this<00:01:11.320> trick<00:01:11.560> look

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
the thing that makes this trick look

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.590 
the thing that makes this trick look
good<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.400> height<00:01:12.580> of<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.850> ball<00:01:13.030> we're<00:01:13.540> on

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
good is the height of the ball we're on

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.390 
good is the height of the ball we're on
the<00:01:13.720> ball<00:01:13.869> to<00:01:14.049> reach<00:01:14.229> about<00:01:14.350> head<00:01:14.710> height<00:01:14.950> and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
the ball to reach about head height and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.800 
the ball to reach about head height and
also<00:01:15.520> we<00:01:15.850> want<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.090> stay<00:01:16.270> as<00:01:16.390> close<00:01:16.540> to<00:01:16.659> the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
also we want to stay as close to the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.660 
also we want to stay as close to the
ball<00:01:17.020> as<00:01:17.170> possible<00:01:17.229> if<00:01:17.920> we<00:01:18.070> hit<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.310> ball<00:01:18.460> up

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
ball as possible if we hit the ball up

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.670 
ball as possible if we hit the ball up
and<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.030> Rockets<00:01:19.479> up<00:01:19.659> into<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.080> air<00:01:20.229> but<00:01:20.560> it's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
and it Rockets up into the air but it's

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.320 
and it Rockets up into the air but it's
going<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.860> look<00:01:21.070> pretty<00:01:21.310> bad<00:01:21.580> as<00:01:21.850> we<00:01:22.000> wait<00:01:22.150> for

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
going to look pretty bad as we wait for

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:30.090 
going to look pretty bad as we wait for
it<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.479> come<00:01:22.690> back<00:01:22.750> down<00:01:28.740> when<00:01:29.740> you've<00:01:29.890> got<00:01:30.009> the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
it to come back down when you've got the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.560 
it to come back down when you've got the
hang<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.729> should<00:01:30.759> be<00:01:30.909> pretty<00:01:31.119> easy<00:01:31.360> it's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
hang of it it should be pretty easy it's

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.389 
hang of it it should be pretty easy it's
how<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.780> cross<00:01:32.020> over<00:01:32.350> at<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.649> end<00:01:32.800> as<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.220> ball

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
how to cross over at the end as the ball

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:41.280 
how to cross over at the end as the ball
comes<00:01:33.610> down<00:01:39.300> so<00:01:40.300> that's<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.630> for<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.869> ducking

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
comes down so that's it for the ducking

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.810 
comes down so that's it for the ducking
tutorial<00:01:41.890> there's<00:01:42.250> plenty<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.520> things<00:01:42.700> you
