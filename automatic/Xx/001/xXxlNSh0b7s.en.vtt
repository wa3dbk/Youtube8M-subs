00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello guys this video a little different 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 compared to the other this channel the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.970
 will give the ok sit born with the idea 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.550
 however, to make us love animals 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.799
 obviously to show us how beautiful it is 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.960
 live with them but therefore also a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.630
 Fun channels will continue to be 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
 amusing though precisely because it is there 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.490
 this love for animals 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.010
 it also seems correct to show you how 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.300
 other alarm bells too 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.660
 situations there is animal violence 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.100
 walked around a little through that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 via the internet and I've seen things 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.239
 really creepy I cut 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.460
 some pictures because they were anyway 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 very strong though I want to do them 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.300
 to know I want to show them why it is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.399
 just know that there are people who 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.430
 they love animals but they are there too 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.940
 people who hate them deeply 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:00.750
 this channel is very strong but I want to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.070
 do because the question I ask 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.460
 through this video that makes you 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.939
 through this video is who the real people are 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.939
 beasts 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.810
 so who do you think are the real ones 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.810
 beasts
