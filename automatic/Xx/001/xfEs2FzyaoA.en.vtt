00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 let's see the whole lab here 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.220
 to analyze Luis Suarez the Uruguayan 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.839
 Luis Suarez, let's analyze his 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.069
 trajectory your beginnings let's see you 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.139
 play just start in national 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.030
 Montevideo in 2005 we will see a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 match in which he plays with cavani a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.059
 forward center with the U-20 team 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.550
 against Canada World Cup Spain 2007 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 and analyze where I had to play 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.010
 then we 'll see a little bit of ajax like that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.380
 that I believe that the first thing we can 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.699
 to do is look for his first matches in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.470
 national we will give search 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.119
 National of Montevideo will come out here 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.740
 many but in 2005 the debuts against 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.449
 paysandú let's watch the game against 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.650
 paysandú and the match with defender that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.120
 it's his first big match as a starter 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.000
 to see exactly the position in the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.440
 that played this game is exactly 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 the party that scores its first goal with 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.030
 national in September 2005 in this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.460
 party that already seemed like a match 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 very cod the truth is going to turn 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.820
 in the first goal of the race 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.739
 professional of luis suárez in nacional 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.559
 of national montevideo happening we are going to 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.390
 see him because he's curious comes in play 10 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.469
 minutes and the first ball practically 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.150
 that plays the first play in which 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.880
 intervenes is national goal 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.390
 it's a bit the beginning the debut of 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.390
 Luis Suarez 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.310
 Y 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.180
 they have symptoms 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.180
 between rodeos 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.720
 What is it 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.880
 we were going to also take the match against 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.340
 defender that this December 3 of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.320
 2005 cost 357 well this is a team 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.790
 of national against in that the first 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.650
 year of visuals that you were there that is 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.540
 silva and then up the chori Castro 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.970
 here we have it even 21 years old 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.410
 newly debuted they played 44 dollars 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.390
 always has always been unwrapped 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.400
 better playing with someone someone close 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.560
 up did not communicate puntanos likes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.210
 have reference to the side in this case the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.220
 chori castro current player of the real 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.410
 society we are going to see a goal that marks 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.700
 This is a spectacular game of Luis Suarez 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.580
 before defender 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 there is the technician Martin Lasarte and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.700
 well we talk about the first of the first 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.030
 five years we will quickly move the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.030
 match 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.180
 this goal defines a lot the great quality 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.800
 of Luis Suarez that is the technique 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.270
 individual the very refined technique 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.000
 individual and the good management of the two 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.350
 legs the footballer who is not 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.960
 especially very fast because it is not 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.250
 but yes it is extremely skillful and a 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.840
 very aggressive game and this is also 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.310
 important sometimes even in activity 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.350
 it takes bigger there is receives from behind 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.850
 there we will see 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.850
 with left-handed clipping 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.510
 and with the right the goal that defines 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.510
 exactly what is visual 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.420
 and now what I want to catch is also 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.330
 the famous spanish uruguay of the world 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.900
 sub-20 of canada in 2007 is this match 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.880
 July 1, 2007 71 36 the DVD 71 36 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.110
 I believe that this match in this world cup 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.930
 where Uruguay is pretty bad for 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.520
 true in this world cup demonstrates the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.380
 natural position for Luis Suarez that is 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.110
 Accompanying us let's put it Spain 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.590
 world uruguay of canada sub 20 of 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.930
 2007 the list kills capel with the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.420
 selection with this sub 20 there is beige well 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.330
 that this is adam is javi garcía 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.020
 also out there and while we watch the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.520
 cute Uruguayan 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.570
 but you are going to see a very young 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.270
 visuals are there and comment that he is 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.140
 the Uruguayan Luis Suarez plays 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.460
 accompanying cavani then curiously 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.650
 the absolute selection 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.210
 I have been playing a little more 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.480
 ranked with the user of 9 and with 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.830
 forlán from behind but in this first 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.570
 Luis Suarez with the Uruguayan U-20 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.430
 they played for me in a more natural place 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.080
 the two that were and nine and Luis 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.730
 Suarez on the left with a line of three 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.590
 up we're going to see it now there we have 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.030
 Let's go back to see the position of the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.560
 visual is very clear cavani is the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.630
 front center and there's left 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.580
 these visuals cavani is the 9 that is 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.590
 incorporates here and lightness and that is that 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.480
 its natural position accompanying a 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.250
 center forward with mobility he 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.100
 he has and with the skill that he has 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.600
 clouds is much more damage than what 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.520
 is that it takes out the power stations of 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.600
 position and that's why in the liverpool 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.190
 insist on it when it has arrived 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.780
 Sturridge has improved even more 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.460
 monthly because I had a reference 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.800
 above and that sturridge is not a 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.630
 9 positional far from it but still 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.860
 has improved a lot good monthly let's go 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.420
 to see the goal that marks the state in this 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.130
 Cavani scored the game 0-1 and will 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.450
 be another goal that defines very well the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.330
 shot that the user is going to 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.980
 to receive 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.300
 is Luis Suarez in a pure state look 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.980
 where is cavani through nine 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.290
 fixing and there is the visual is by 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.290
 behind right there they receive 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.940
 what I want 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.120
 the line will receive and moving away from the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.580
 Center forward position as such and 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.410
 of spectacular rejection we have seen two 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.150
 great goals with the right that define 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.320
 very good ability also by 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.030
 of course you have visuals 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.220
 Luisa arrives at Groningen in Holland 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.660
 a modest team like the groningen and 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.280
 then it will happen already has four 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.070
 seasons and especially one of them 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.270
 scores 35 league goals plus an average of 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.560
 more than one goal per game which is the great 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.360
 season in the area of ​​Luis Suarez that 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.280
 then you end up giving it happened shortly after 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.650
 a year 1 year and a half later only about 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.450
 months after the liverpool a match 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.070
 previous of the europa league against the 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.330
 slovan from bratislava which marks four of 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.860
 the five goals that match can 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.410
 serve a little to see the position of 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.060
 the user so let's find that one already 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.920
 It's the Bratislava Slovan, we speak 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.300
 of the 13.544 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.300
 exactly this match 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.130
 until Friday of Judah psv and then the 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.890
 that we are interested that the slovan ajax of 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.050
 bratislava if you want the dialogue I'll 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.300
 you are in the Israeli team 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.590
 well here the ajax did not have one of 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.090
 fixed as such let's see suleman and 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.590
 on the left was a 9 of a lot 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.180
 permanent mobility no no was not a 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.970
 vertigo because it never has been but 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.290
 let's see for example the first goal of 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.090
 the 4 that mark the day they are going 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.040
 granizado the starting from there is not 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.700
 in the position of the 9 fixed and then the 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.870
 The user's definition is spectacular 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.890
 let's see the second now that day 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.600
 so you can see that it's not a 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.610
 9 of 9 natural position not much 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.410
 less a little heeled in the play 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.410
 in the corner he has scored many goals 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.000
 he's a goal scorer but he's not a pure 9 like 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.400
 such chicken has made you create this goal there 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.050
 quite heeled and then there's define with 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.540
 the left the great capacity of Suarez 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.340
 I insist once more the management of 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.960
 two legs has scored goals with both 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.060
 right as with the left handles it 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.920
 very well the two is a footballer who 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.460
 needs permanent mobility is not a 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.020
 nine of area nor much less and if 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.910
 plays with a forward center fixed to 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.840
 side yields even more is the feeling 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.910
 that can yield more 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.500
 another another goal 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.210
 quite late he comes to receive 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.830
 there is the position he is not again 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.440
 fixed comes that back refers to up 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.560
 there he is there he does not wait anymore and 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.260
 then define very well with the right 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.040
 pegadito the post great great definer 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.040
 Shooting
