00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 gaga as seasoning

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.690
 must have it 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.690
 I use up over a million

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.870
 of those in between performing well 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.990
 while the eu provides a very gently cooked time for driving time, the group does that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.500
 pieces of time 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500

 it still neat 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 a small groups

 let those places look nice 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.929
 The special thing about this recipe is that we are actually going to make the transition 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.709
 slightly accepted everything 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.039
 obama put the whole dish in the oven 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.349
 is important if you want a panda that is also across the street not with 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.080
 a plastic 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.339
 to maintain 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:52.349
 you have achieved nothing at all this just for the frying pan and 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.119
 put a baking dish in the oven to preheat before you throw it 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.119
 the whole thing upstairs 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.929

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.550
 which ultimately resulted in the volume also doubled lead tip not one 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.099
 Dutch and tips delivered the supermarket picked up only a real can 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.419
 as a brand you find at more and more stores 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.090
 and that is time and good I count on 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.090
 for that was rightly 75 grams per person 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.299
 for four people 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.859
 nevertheless, they must now apply a little to cover up extra taste 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.389
 have been given 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.419
 the party stays with it 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.419
 no transport 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.499
 a number of buses with the district 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.129
 then have the hot broth the ratio is one in three so in 100 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.879
 gram 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.329
 the three hundred military boeljon 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.300
 in this case 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.499
 almost not out 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.499
 miquel boiling hot 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.349
 let this get used to the boil to the bone 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.059
 he picks the king the deceased falls 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.679
 paulissen 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.969
 wear gloves 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.769
 the oven has risen to 175 degrees 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.769
 without lid 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.970
 it should take half an hour in the oven but halfway through it should eat everything once in a while 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.029
 in a row 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.150
 so because not to forget 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
 we just put a kitchen timer on a merit 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.360
 it is difficult to do that 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.979
 keep finishing the parsley 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.009
 add the butter 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
 and parmesan cheese 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.659
 and if you have forgotten just like me, consider the salt and pepper 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.659
 if you do not do it when there is 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.659
 give alves ground 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.849
 all this well together 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.039
 to shorten the rate he will fall 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.039

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.880
