 most common sores 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.779
 in the videogame field as far as i 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.150
 anti-piracy systems always become 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.590
 more complex than you can do 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.490
 in front of the strength of the many teams 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.650
 present on the net 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.509
 despite this some software houses 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 they have however tried to insert 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.740
 some escamotage not to render the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 easy life is not the pirate on duty

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.010
 one of the aspects that characterizes the

 better our gotham superhero 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.879
 city is the possibility of exploiting the 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.210
 his dark cloak for gliding from a 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.210
 roof to the other 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.170
 but in the pirated version its roof 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.730
 mantle does not open carrying the dear 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.630
 Bruce Wayne to fall ruinously 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.630

 the adventure of the Finnish remedy team 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.520
 entertainment and perhaps the least worst for 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.470
 what about anti-piracy beyond 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.479
 to a notice reminding you to use 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.000
 an original copy on each screen of 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.800
 loading our protagonist will 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.150
 forced to carry for the whole of the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.799
 like to waste time 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.990
 the anti-piracy system of their title 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.369
 he immediately put us in front of a 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.369
 practically unstoppable enemy 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.560
 a huge red scorpion but in the case 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.140
 that anyone had been in anyway 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.670
 able to survive that beast 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.680
 a few levels after the camera yes 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.479
 would be positioned in such a way as to 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.979
 force the player to turn 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.979
 continuously on itself

 crysis the published data shooter is 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.420
 developed by crytek os and is perhaps the

 well understood meat hens and feathers

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.860
 destructive is practically nil 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.100
 forcing the player to a death

 absolutely nothing consisted of a

 effective
