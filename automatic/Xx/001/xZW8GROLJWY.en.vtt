00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
going to take our lid place it on top

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.120 
going to take our lid place it on top
and<00:02:00.810> let<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> cool<00:02:01.259> down<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.829> what's<00:02:01.979> between

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
70 and 80 degrees at this point we can

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
70 and 80 degrees at this point we can
then<00:02:04.710> pitch<00:02:05.009> our<00:02:05.189> yeast<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:06.060> ahead<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.329> put

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
then pitch our yeast go ahead and put

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
then pitch our yeast go ahead and put
your<00:02:06.570> yeast<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.960> top<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.950> work<00:02:08.129> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
your yeast on top of the the work that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.309 
your yeast on top of the the work that
liquid<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.270> called<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.569> word<00:02:09.750> until<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.170> been

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
liquid is called a word until it's been

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.910

seal it up and then take your piece of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.110 
seal it up and then take your piece of
equipment<00:02:16.740> called<00:02:16.770> an<00:02:16.980> airlock<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.580> place<00:02:17.940> it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
equipment called an airlock and place it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.199 
equipment called an airlock and place it
in<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:19.520> grommet<00:02:20.520> hole<00:02:20.730> right<00:02:20.880> there<00:02:20.940> to

in the the grommet hole right there to

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.970 
in the the grommet hole right there to
seal<00:02:21.420> everything<00:02:21.569> up<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.140> it'll<00:02:22.709> start

seal everything up and it'll start

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.980 
seal everything up and it'll start
fermenting<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.060> next<00:02:24.270> day<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:24.510> two<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.870> a

fermenting in the next day or two in a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.770 
fermenting in the next day or two in a
week<00:02:25.140> you'll<00:02:25.380> have<00:02:25.410> beer
