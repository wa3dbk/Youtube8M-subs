00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
hi guys this is my third tutorial and

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.200 
hi guys this is my third tutorial and
today<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:05.009> going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.279> show<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.520> how<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.819> make

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.299 
today I'm going to show you how to make
lasers<00:00:06.690> using<00:00:07.319> blender<00:00:08.480> 2.56<00:00:09.650> alright<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.920> so

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
lasers using blender 2.56 alright so so

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.980 
lasers using blender 2.56 alright so so
let's<00:00:11.490> get<00:00:11.580> started<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.660> first<00:00:12.690> thing

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
let's get started so the first thing

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.760 
let's get started so the first thing
we're<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.639> open<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.820> new<00:00:15.770> blend

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
we're going to do is open up a new blend

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.340 
we're going to do is open up a new blend
file<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.580> when<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> delete<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.050> cube

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
file here and when I delete this cube

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.529 
file here and when I delete this cube
and<00:00:21.410> we<00:00:22.410> want<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.859> add<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.550> mesh<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:24.269> we're

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
and we want to add a mesh here we're

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.470 
and we want to add a mesh here we're
gonna<00:00:24.630> add<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> point<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:26.039> basically<00:00:26.480> we're

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
gonna add a point so basically we're

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.410 
gonna add a point so basically we're
going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> use<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.900> plane<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.529> create<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
going to use this plane to create a

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.429 
going to use this plane to create a
straight<00:00:30.420> line<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.349> our

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
straight line that's going to be our

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
straight line that's going to be our
laser<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.040> let's<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.340> started<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.570> press

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
laser so let's get started so so press

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.860 
laser so let's get started so so press
tab<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.320> go<00:00:34.860> into<00:00:35.040> edit<00:00:35.250> mode<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.660> make<00:00:36.660> sure

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
tab and go into edit mode and make sure

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.700 
tab and go into edit mode and make sure
you<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.309> vertex<00:00:38.309> select<00:00:38.610> mode<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.710> take

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you have vertex select mode on and take

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.910 
you have vertex select mode on and take
two<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.160> vertices<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.739> delete<00:00:43.739> them

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
two of the vertices here and delete them

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760 
two of the vertices here and delete them
so<00:00:44.390> all<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.629> left<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.469> one

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
so all we have left here is this one

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.740 
so all we have left here is this one
line<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.570> there

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
line right there

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.619 
line right there
so<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.520> line<00:00:50.789> we're<00:00:51.030> actually<00:00:51.210> going

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
so with this line we're actually going

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.770 
so with this line we're actually going
to<00:00:51.949> subdivide<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.000> click<00:00:54.239> subdivide

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
to subdivide it if you click subdivide

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.610 
to subdivide it if you click subdivide
and<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.320> down<00:00:55.559> by<00:00:55.770> number<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.250> cuts<00:00:57.620> change

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and then down by number of cuts change

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
and then down by number of cuts change
that<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.550> goes<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.000> ten<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that all the way up to it goes to ten so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.810 
that all the way up to it goes to ten so
do<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.350> twice<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:03.239> wanna<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.629> again

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
do that twice so wanna do that again

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.429 
do that twice so wanna do that again
there<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.909> go<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.360> you'll<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.780> our<00:01:06.810> line<00:01:07.110> here

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
there we go and you'll see our line here

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.830 
there we go and you'll see our line here
is<00:01:07.530> now<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.830> been<00:01:07.950> subdivided<00:01:09.229> with<00:01:10.229> 20<00:01:10.619> cuts

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
is now have been subdivided with 20 cuts

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
is now have been subdivided with 20 cuts
so<00:01:12.840> using<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:13.830> we're<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> add

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
so using that now we're going to add

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.289 
so using that now we're going to add
some<00:01:15.509> color<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> hopefully<00:01:16.950> some<00:01:17.189> glow<00:01:17.490> so

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
some color and hopefully some glow so

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.580 
some color and hopefully some glow so
we're<00:01:18.570> gonna<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.840> over<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> our

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
we're gonna go over here to our

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.210 
we're gonna go over here to our
materials<00:01:20.549> tab<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.380> create

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
materials tab and we're going to create

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.240 
materials tab and we're going to create
a<00:01:23.310> new<00:01:23.460> material<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.439> material<00:01:25.619> is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a new material and this material is

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.530 
a new material and this material is
actually<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:28.850> let's<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.329> for

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
actually going to be let's see so for

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.789 
actually going to be let's see so for
now<00:01:30.630> we're<00:01:30.810> gonna<00:01:30.900> make<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.290> whatever<00:01:31.439> color

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
now we're gonna make it whatever color

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.390 
now we're gonna make it whatever color
we<00:01:31.979> want<00:01:32.570> let's<00:01:33.570> make<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> green<00:01:34.650> laser<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
we want let's make a green laser and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.600 
we want let's make a green laser and
that<00:01:36.710> should<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:39.710> okay<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.770> let's<00:01:41.250> leave<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.490> at

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that should be okay so let's leave it at

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.469 
that should be okay so let's leave it at
that<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.329> over<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:43.729> texture<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that and then go over to texture and

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
that and then go over to texture and
we're<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.140> add<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> new<00:01:46.710> texture<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.250> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
we're going to add a new texture to this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.639 
we're going to add a new texture to this
material<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.930> we're<00:01:49.200> gonna<00:01:49.320> use<00:01:49.500> these

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
material and we're gonna use these

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
material and we're gonna use these
clouds<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.909> should<00:01:50.939> pop

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
clouds right here that they should pop

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.780 
clouds right here that they should pop
up<00:01:51.450> by<00:01:51.840> default<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.890> just

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
up by default but if they don't just

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.789 
up by default but if they don't just
select<00:01:54.119> type<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> make<00:01:55.350> sure<00:01:55.530> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
select type here and make sure you

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.609 
select type here and make sure you
select<00:01:56.100> clouds<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:59.270> under<00:02:00.270> mapping<00:02:01.140> we're

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
select clouds and under mapping we're

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.319 
select clouds and under mapping we're
going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> change<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> size<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.030> use<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
going to change the size of the use of

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.899 
going to change the size of the use of
the<00:02:03.420> XYZ<00:02:03.930> values<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.619> somewhere<00:02:05.280> around<00:02:05.340> three

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the XYZ values to somewhere around three

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.100 
the XYZ values to somewhere around three
for<00:02:06.780> x<00:02:06.960> y&amp;z

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.260 

all<00:02:10.590> righty<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.160> also<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.820> noticed<00:02:12.120> out

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
all righty and also if you noticed out

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.240 
all righty and also if you noticed out
here<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.570> see<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.900> uh<00:02:12.960> this<00:02:13.710> pink<00:02:13.980> here

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
here you see this uh this pink here

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.980 
here you see this uh this pink here
we're<00:02:14.430> gonna<00:02:14.520> change<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.240> all<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.750> way<00:02:15.840> down

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
we're gonna change it all the way down

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.300 
we're gonna change it all the way down
to<00:02:16.290> two<00:02:16.740> black<00:02:17.060> make<00:02:18.060> sure<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.420> stays<00:02:19.310> that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to two black make sure that stays that

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.650 
to two black make sure that stays that
color<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.940> leave<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.240> color<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:22.190> and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
color we can leave this color on and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.820 
color we can leave this color on and
let's<00:02:24.660> go<00:02:24.810> back<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.770> materials<00:02:26.250> tab<00:02:26.660> and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
let's go back to the materials tab and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.710 
let's go back to the materials tab and
and<00:02:28.830> see<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:29.700> at<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.880> top<00:02:29.970> here<00:02:30.180> which<00:02:30.570> is

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and see up at the top here which is

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.750 
and see up at the top here which is
surface<00:02:31.140> we're<00:02:31.350> gonna<00:02:31.470> select<00:02:31.710> halo<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
surface we're gonna select halo and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880 
surface we're gonna select halo and
let's<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.810> kinda<00:02:34.170> let's<00:02:34.410> kind<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.590> see<00:02:34.740> where

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
let's just kinda let's kind of see where

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.940 
let's just kinda let's kind of see where
we<00:02:35.070> are<00:02:35.160> right<00:02:35.340> now<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.209> really<00:02:37.170> huge

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
we are right now so that's a really huge

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.910 
we are right now so that's a really huge
fuzzy<00:02:38.610> not<00:02:39.510> glowy<00:02:39.930> laser<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.680> we're<00:02:40.830> gonna

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
fuzzy not glowy laser so we're gonna

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.760 
fuzzy not glowy laser so we're gonna
make<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> few<00:02:41.880> more<00:02:41.970> changes<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.750> one<00:02:43.680> of

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
make a few more changes to that one of

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.930 
make a few more changes to that one of
the<00:02:43.830> things<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.100> want<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.730> want<00:02:44.880> to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the things I want to do is I want to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.850 
the things I want to do is I want to
turn<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.600> texture<00:02:45.990> option<00:02:46.320> for<00:02:46.740> that

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
turn on the the texture option for that

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.890 
turn on the the texture option for that
and<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.880> also<00:02:48.030> want<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.330> select<00:02:50.480> extreme<00:02:51.480> alpha

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
and I also want to select extreme alpha

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.960 
and I also want to select extreme alpha
and<00:02:52.140> shaded<00:02:53.720> now<00:02:54.720> if<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:56.160> look<00:02:56.310> at<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.580> well

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and shaded now if we look at that well

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
and shaded now if we look at that well
look<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.360> just<00:02:57.390> looks<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:58.020> really<00:02:58.380> big

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
look it just looks like a really big

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.460 
look it just looks like a really big
blob<00:02:59.280> here<00:02:59.610> so<00:02:59.940> let's<00:03:00.570> bring<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> size<00:03:01.140> down<00:03:01.170> a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
blob here so let's bring the size down a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.750 
blob here so let's bring the size down a
bunch<00:03:02.190> I'm<00:03:02.580> gonna<00:03:03.030> bring<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.390> down<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.739> 0.1

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
bunch I'm gonna bring this down to 0.1

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.110 
bunch I'm gonna bring this down to 0.1
and<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:06.780> also<00:03:06.900> want<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.500> bring<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.580> hardness

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
and I also want to bring this hardness

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.930 
and I also want to bring this hardness
value<00:03:09.540> here<00:03:09.810> all<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.260> way<00:03:10.380> up<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:11.489> stops<00:03:11.790> at

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
value here all the way up at stops at

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.590 
value here all the way up at stops at
127<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:14.160> ad<00:03:14.340> right<00:03:14.880> below<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.299> I'm<00:03:15.450> also

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
127 and the ad right below it I'm also

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.870 
127 and the ad right below it I'm also
gonna<00:03:15.810> bring<00:03:15.959> all<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.230> way<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.380> 1<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.370> let's

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
gonna bring all the way to 1 so let's

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.699 
gonna bring all the way to 1 so let's
look<00:03:18.030> at<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.299> okay<00:03:18.900> that's<00:03:19.290> starting<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
look at that okay that's starting to

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.020 
look at that okay that's starting to
look<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:20.370> lot<00:03:20.850> better<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.810> um<00:03:22.790> let's<00:03:23.790> do<00:03:24.000> a

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
look a lot better so um let's do a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.440 
look a lot better so um let's do a
couple<00:03:24.600> more<00:03:24.930> things<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:26.299> actually<00:03:27.299> if<00:03:27.360> we

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
couple more things to it actually if we

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.670 
couple more things to it actually if we
were<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.600> look<00:03:27.750> right<00:03:27.989> now

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
were to look right now

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.220 
were to look right now
what<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.370> do<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.150> notice<00:03:30.450> what

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
what you can do is if you notice what

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.650 
what you can do is if you notice what
we're<00:03:31.380> really<00:03:31.530> doing<00:03:31.799> here<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.299> this<00:03:33.299> halo

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
we're really doing here is this halo

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.150 
we're really doing here is this halo
effect<00:03:33.690> makes<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.070> vertices<00:03:35.370> glow<00:03:35.820> and

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
effect makes all the vertices glow and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.650 
effect makes all the vertices glow and
that's<00:03:38.160> why<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.459> added<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:38.940> many<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.299> them<00:03:39.420> is

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
that's why we added so many of them is

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.080 
that's why we added so many of them is
that<00:03:39.959> if<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:40.980> were<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.190> stretch<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.610> out<00:03:41.820> a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
that if you were to stretch this out a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.460 
that if you were to stretch this out a
whole<00:03:42.269> bunch<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.780> could<00:03:42.930> actually<00:03:43.080> see<00:03:43.440> that

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
whole bunch you could actually see that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.820 
whole bunch you could actually see that
we're<00:03:43.769> just<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.459> just<00:03:44.640> making<00:03:44.850> each

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
we're just really just making each

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:54.289 
we're just really just making each
vertex<00:03:46.830> glow<00:03:47.750> individually<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:52.549> so<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:54.209> you

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
vertex glow individually so so so if you

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.140 
vertex glow individually so so so if you
want<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.570> make<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:54.900> laser<00:03:55.320> larger<00:03:56.280> an<00:03:56.820> easy

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
want to make this laser larger an easy

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.910 
want to make this laser larger an easy
way<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.420> do<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.080> would<00:03:58.290> be<00:03:58.350> just<00:03:58.739> to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
way to do that would be just to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.280 
way to do that would be just to
duplicate<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.940> instead<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.390> scaling<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.200> all

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
duplicate it instead of scaling it all

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.930 
duplicate it instead of scaling it all
the<00:04:01.410> way<00:04:01.500> up<00:04:01.530> because<00:04:02.160> if<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.430> scale<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.820> too

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
the way up because if you scale it too

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.240 
the way up because if you scale it too
much<00:04:03.090> well<00:04:03.360> then<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.660> gonna<00:04:03.780> look<00:04:04.250> it's

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
much well then it's gonna look it's

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.350 
much well then it's gonna look it's
gonna<00:04:05.400> look<00:04:05.580> like<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.790> bunch<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.120> little<00:04:06.269> dots

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
gonna look like a bunch of little dots

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.710 
gonna look like a bunch of little dots
so<00:04:06.900> um<00:04:07.190> let's<00:04:08.190> say<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.459> actually<00:04:09.209> one<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.630> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
so um let's say so actually one of the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.060 
so um let's say so actually one of the
things<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.200> like<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.440> do<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.739> make<00:04:10.769> this<00:04:11.010> look

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
things I like to do to make this look

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.509 
things I like to do to make this look
more<00:04:11.730> like<00:04:11.910> an<00:04:12.060> actual<00:04:12.540> laser<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:14.370> take

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
more like an actual laser is to take

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.580 
more like an actual laser is to take
this<00:04:14.700> color<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.269> bring<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.600> back<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.959> white<00:04:16.200> or

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
this color and bring it back to white or

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.830 
this color and bring it back to white or
maybe<00:04:16.890> some<00:04:17.250> some<00:04:18.000> lighter<00:04:18.239> color<00:04:18.570> that's

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
maybe some some lighter color that's

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.689 
maybe some some lighter color that's
going<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.140> represent<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.919> lighter<00:04:20.400> color<00:04:20.760> of

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
going to represent a lighter color of

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.909 
going to represent a lighter color of
the<00:04:22.509> actual<00:04:22.900> color<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.289> the<00:04:23.379> laser<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:23.680> want

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
the actual color of the laser you want

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.659 
the actual color of the laser you want
to<00:04:24.009> use<00:04:24.159> so<00:04:24.520> let's<00:04:25.509> say<00:04:25.689> for<00:04:25.720> instance<00:04:26.669> let's

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
to use so let's say for instance let's

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.520 
to use so let's say for instance let's
turn<00:04:27.849> on<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.360> ring<00:04:28.689> see<00:04:28.960> under<00:04:29.139> option

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
turn on this this ring see under option

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.700 
turn on this this ring see under option
C<00:04:29.740> I'm<00:04:29.919> in<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.099> halo<00:04:31.050> tab<00:04:32.050> right<00:04:32.379> here<00:04:32.409> that's

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
C I'm in the halo tab right here that's

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.129 
C I'm in the halo tab right here that's
under<00:04:32.919> my<00:04:32.949> materials<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.699> if<00:04:34.599> you<00:04:34.719> select

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
under my materials and if you select

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.839 
under my materials and if you select
this<00:04:35.259> thing<00:04:35.740> that<00:04:35.830> says<00:04:35.889> rings<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.639> you<00:04:36.699> bring

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
this thing that says rings and you bring

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.110 
this thing that says rings and you bring
that<00:04:36.969> all<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.120> way<00:04:37.210> up<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.569> 24<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:39.120> change

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
that all the way up to 24 and change

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.089 
that all the way up to 24 and change
this<00:04:40.479> color<00:04:40.930> right<00:04:41.199> here<00:04:41.229> to<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.740> actual

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
this color right here to the actual

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.770 
this color right here to the actual
color<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.580> you<00:04:42.699> want<00:04:42.909> your<00:04:43.030> laser<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.419> be<00:04:43.539> so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
color that you want your laser to be so

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.589 
color that you want your laser to be so
let's<00:04:44.379> say<00:04:44.590> I<00:04:44.620> want<00:04:44.830> it<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:45.009> be<00:04:45.159> this<00:04:46.000> green

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
let's say I want it to be this green

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.990 
let's say I want it to be this green
color<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.259> then<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.860> can<00:04:48.039> make<00:04:48.189> this<00:04:48.430> either

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
color and then I can make this either

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.230 
color and then I can make this either
keep<00:04:49.479> it<00:04:49.629> white<00:04:49.840> or<00:04:50.139> some<00:04:50.740> lighter<00:04:51.009> color<00:04:51.939> of

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
keep it white or some lighter color of

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.629 
keep it white or some lighter color of
green<00:04:52.810> or<00:04:52.870> something<00:04:53.199> like<00:04:53.500> that<00:04:53.560> now<00:04:54.400> if<00:04:54.520> we

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
green or something like that now if we

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.070 
green or something like that now if we
look<00:04:54.789> at<00:04:54.879> our<00:04:54.969> laser<00:04:55.180> you'll<00:04:55.509> notice<00:04:55.810> that<00:04:55.930> it

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
look at our laser you'll notice that it

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.659 
look at our laser you'll notice that it
there<00:04:56.259> we<00:04:56.530> get<00:04:56.620> this<00:04:56.830> white<00:04:57.190> bar<00:04:57.430> in<00:04:57.580> the

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
there we get this white bar in the

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.700 
there we get this white bar in the
center<00:04:57.849> and<00:04:58.150> that's<00:04:58.270> actually<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:59.379> actual

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
center and that's actually the actual

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.040 
center and that's actually the actual
color<00:05:00.099> of<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.610> halo<00:05:00.909> where<00:05:01.509> all<00:05:01.659> the<00:05:01.810> rings

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
color of the halo where all the rings

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.860 
color of the halo where all the rings
around<00:05:02.229> it<00:05:02.590> really<00:05:03.009> just<00:05:03.330> are<00:05:04.330> is<00:05:04.569> what's

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
around it really just are is what's

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.890 
around it really just are is what's
giving<00:05:05.259> at<00:05:05.500> that<00:05:05.680> green<00:05:05.919> color<00:05:06.099> so<00:05:07.000> there<00:05:07.840> are

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
giving at that green color so there are

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.200 
giving at that green color so there are
a<00:05:07.930> couple<00:05:08.050> things<00:05:08.319> a<00:05:08.949> couple<00:05:09.729> other<00:05:09.849> things<00:05:09.909> we

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
a couple things a couple other things we

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.719 
a couple things a couple other things we
can<00:05:10.330> do<00:05:10.449> with<00:05:10.569> this<00:05:10.690> actually<00:05:11.169> um<00:05:11.319> if<00:05:12.219> we<00:05:12.490> want

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
can do with this actually um if we want

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.990 
can do with this actually um if we want
just<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:14.039> and<00:05:15.039> so<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.370> can<00:05:15.580> have<00:05:15.729> this<00:05:15.849> any

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
just to and so you can have this any

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.300 
just to and so you can have this any
color<00:05:16.300> you<00:05:16.479> want<00:05:16.659> and<00:05:16.930> just<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:18.159> have<00:05:18.250> a

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
color you want and just to have a

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.860 
color you want and just to have a
different<00:05:18.729> insight<00:05:19.210> to<00:05:19.360> make<00:05:19.509> it<00:05:19.629> look<00:05:19.779> a

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
different insight to make it look a

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.040 
different insight to make it look a
little<00:05:20.020> more<00:05:20.169> realistic<00:05:20.560> of<00:05:21.750> course<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:22.900> can

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
little more realistic of course you can

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.550 
little more realistic of course you can
use<00:05:23.229> your<00:05:23.259> size<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.860> change<00:05:24.300> we<00:05:25.300> 0-5<00:05:26.110> if<00:05:26.440> you

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
use your size to change we 0-5 if you

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.680 
use your size to change we 0-5 if you
want<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.800> skin<00:05:26.979> your<00:05:27.159> laser<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.879> higher<00:05:28.330> up<00:05:28.539> if

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
want to skin your laser and higher up if

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.140 
want to skin your laser and higher up if
you<00:05:28.840> want<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.400> bigger<00:05:30.400> laser<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:32.879> also<00:05:33.879> if<00:05:34.029> you

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
you want a bigger laser and also if you

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.879 
you want a bigger laser and also if you
like<00:05:34.330> instead<00:05:34.810> of<00:05:34.900> using<00:05:35.080> rings<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:35.650> can<00:05:35.770> also

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
like instead of using rings you can also

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.670 
like instead of using rings you can also
use<00:05:36.159> lines<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.940> this<00:05:37.569> I<00:05:37.750> found<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.139> be<00:05:38.289> kind<00:05:38.560> of

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
use lines and this I found to be kind of

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.839 
use lines and this I found to be kind of
cool<00:05:38.860> because<00:05:39.099> it<00:05:39.370> creates<00:05:39.639> a<00:05:39.699> pretty

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
cool because it creates a pretty

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.659 
cool because it creates a pretty
interesting<00:05:40.330> effect<00:05:40.389> for<00:05:40.870> you<00:05:41.129> if<00:05:42.129> you<00:05:42.310> set

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
interesting effect for you if you set

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.999 
interesting effect for you if you set
your<00:05:42.819> lines<00:05:43.060> somewhere<00:05:43.620> you<00:05:44.620> just<00:05:44.680> have<00:05:44.889> to

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
your lines somewhere you just have to

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.119 
your lines somewhere you just have to
kind<00:05:45.190> of<00:05:45.250> mess<00:05:45.460> with<00:05:45.699> it<00:05:46.560> nothing<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:47.860> put<00:05:48.009> it

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129 
kind of mess with it nothing you put it

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.760 
kind of mess with it nothing you put it
maybe<00:05:48.310> around<00:05:48.520> 19<00:05:49.419> or<00:05:49.629> 20<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.379> kind<00:05:50.560> of<00:05:50.589> get<00:05:50.740> a

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
maybe around 19 or 20 you kind of get a

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.279 
maybe around 19 or 20 you kind of get a
bit<00:05:51.009> of<00:05:51.129> a<00:05:51.219> grainy<00:05:51.580> or<00:05:51.729> laser<00:05:52.289> that's

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
bit of a grainy or laser that's

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.360 
bit of a grainy or laser that's
something<00:05:53.529> that<00:05:53.620> just<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.979> just<00:05:54.009> kind<00:05:54.339> of

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
something that just it just kind of

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.820 
something that just it just kind of
looks<00:05:54.610> cool<00:05:54.819> or<00:05:55.060> you<00:05:55.150> know<00:05:55.240> so<00:05:55.449> just<00:05:55.830> mess

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
looks cool or you know so just mess

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.309 
looks cool or you know so just mess
around<00:05:56.979> with<00:05:57.250> that<00:05:57.310> and<00:05:57.759> see<00:05:58.060> if<00:05:58.089> you<00:05:58.360> can<00:05:58.539> get

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.040 

the<00:06:02.319> desired<00:06:02.710> effect<00:06:02.860> out<00:06:03.279> of<00:06:03.400> it<00:06:03.870> so<00:06:04.870> there

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
the desired effect out of it so there

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.719 
the desired effect out of it so there
are<00:06:05.199> lots<00:06:05.710> of<00:06:05.860> different<00:06:06.129> things<00:06:06.219> you<00:06:06.370> can<00:06:06.580> do

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
are lots of different things you can do

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.659 
are lots of different things you can do
if<00:06:06.909> I<00:06:07.060> wanted<00:06:07.330> to<00:06:07.449> make<00:06:07.599> this<00:06:08.400> red<00:06:09.400> for

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
if I wanted to make this red for

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.570 
if I wanted to make this red for
instance<00:06:10.029> and<00:06:10.599> then<00:06:10.870> I'd<00:06:11.020> probably<00:06:11.550> give<00:06:12.550> it

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
instance and then I'd probably give it

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.100 
instance and then I'd probably give it
an<00:06:12.759> orange<00:06:12.909> center<00:06:13.449> or<00:06:13.599> something<00:06:13.810> along

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
an orange center or something along

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.310 
an orange center or something along
those<00:06:14.169> lines

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.230 

you<00:06:19.320> try<00:06:19.800> that<00:06:20.070> or<00:06:20.250> something<00:06:20.430> like<00:06:20.639> that<00:06:20.880> so

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
you try that or something like that so

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.320 
you try that or something like that so
um<00:06:21.560> so<00:06:22.560> yeah<00:06:22.680> so<00:06:22.919> that's<00:06:23.400> basically<00:06:23.970> how<00:06:24.300> you

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
um so yeah so that's basically how you

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.750 
um so yeah so that's basically how you
make<00:06:24.660> a<00:06:24.690> laser<00:06:25.820> using<00:06:26.820> a<00:06:26.850> blender<00:06:27.449> or<00:06:27.479> 2.56

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
make a laser using a blender or 2.56

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.710 
make a laser using a blender or 2.56
actually<00:06:29.760> you<00:06:29.850> know<00:06:29.940> there's<00:06:30.330> one<00:06:30.510> other

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
actually you know there's one other

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.379 
actually you know there's one other
thing<00:06:30.870> I<00:06:30.960> want<00:06:31.169> to<00:06:31.290> do<00:06:31.410> real<00:06:31.620> quick<00:06:31.650> and<00:06:32.389> you

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
thing I want to do real quick and you

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.650 
thing I want to do real quick and you
don't<00:06:33.540> have<00:06:33.720> to<00:06:33.930> do<00:06:34.080> this<00:06:34.760> if<00:06:35.760> you<00:06:36.090> go<00:06:36.270> over

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
don't have to do this if you go over

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.430 
don't have to do this if you go over
back<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:36.900> your<00:06:37.430> textures<00:06:38.430> tab<00:06:38.729> and<00:06:39.419> you<00:06:39.960> look

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
back to your textures tab and you look

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.640 
back to your textures tab and you look
down<00:06:40.470> to<00:06:41.130> this<00:06:41.820> and<00:06:42.090> see<00:06:42.180> this<00:06:42.300> colors<00:06:42.720> tab

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
down to this and see this colors tab

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.530 
down to this and see this colors tab
here<00:06:43.919> under<00:06:44.130> textures<00:06:44.520> if<00:06:45.120> you<00:06:45.330> actually

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
here under textures if you actually

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.420 
here under textures if you actually
change<00:06:45.780> this<00:06:46.350> brightness<00:06:46.710> if<00:06:47.070> you<00:06:47.190> tone<00:06:47.400> it

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
change this brightness if you tone it

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.820 
change this brightness if you tone it
down<00:06:47.840> this<00:06:48.840> will<00:06:49.020> actually<00:06:49.169> make<00:06:49.350> your<00:06:49.590> laser

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
down this will actually make your laser

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.700 
down this will actually make your laser
glow<00:06:50.220> brighter<00:06:50.610> so<00:06:51.300> this<00:06:52.080> is<00:06:52.229> because<00:06:52.530> you're

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
glow brighter so this is because you're

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.159 
glow brighter so this is because you're
you're<00:06:53.040> blocking<00:06:53.550> the<00:06:53.729> or<00:06:54.419> you're<00:06:54.630> making<00:06:54.840> the

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
you're blocking the or you're making the

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.650 
you're blocking the or you're making the
the<00:06:56.040> actual<00:06:56.610> texture<00:06:56.970> on<00:06:57.090> it<00:06:57.210> smaller<00:06:57.510> so

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
the actual texture on it smaller so

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.379 
the actual texture on it smaller so
you're<00:06:58.080> the<00:06:58.919> material<00:06:59.790> itself<00:07:00.060> will<00:07:00.210> stand

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 
you're the material itself will stand

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.540 
you're the material itself will stand
out<00:07:00.600> more<00:07:00.889> because<00:07:01.889> this<00:07:02.040> texture<00:07:02.460> is

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
out more because this texture is

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.790 
out more because this texture is
actually<00:07:02.940> more<00:07:03.120> of<00:07:03.150> a<00:07:03.360> black<00:07:03.900> gray<00:07:04.260> color<00:07:04.500> so

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
actually more of a black gray color so

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.040 
actually more of a black gray color so
see<00:07:05.370> if<00:07:05.490> I<00:07:05.580> set<00:07:05.760> this<00:07:05.880> at<00:07:06.060> zero<00:07:06.330> then<00:07:06.630> it

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
see if I set this at zero then it

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.529 
see if I set this at zero then it
wouldn't<00:07:07.290> be<00:07:07.410> there<00:07:07.530> at<00:07:07.650> all<00:07:07.740> so<00:07:08.389> put<00:07:09.389> this

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
wouldn't be there at all so put this

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.250 
wouldn't be there at all so put this
around<00:07:10.460> maybe<00:07:11.539> 0.6<00:07:12.539> or<00:07:12.690> something<00:07:12.930> like<00:07:13.080> that

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260 
around maybe 0.6 or something like that

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.140 
around maybe 0.6 or something like that
you<00:07:13.919> can<00:07:14.070> mess<00:07:14.190> around<00:07:14.340> with<00:07:14.580> it<00:07:14.729> and<00:07:14.970> the<00:07:15.120> the

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
you can mess around with it and the the

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.870 
you can mess around with it and the the
contrast<00:07:15.870> as<00:07:16.050> well<00:07:16.370> just<00:07:17.370> see<00:07:17.520> it<00:07:17.669> you<00:07:17.789> know

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
contrast as well just see it you know

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.879 
contrast as well just see it you know
the<00:07:18.030> kind<00:07:18.210> of<00:07:18.330> desired<00:07:18.780> effect<00:07:19.139> that<00:07:19.470> you<00:07:19.620> want

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:19.889 
the kind of desired effect that you want

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:26.950 
the kind of desired effect that you want
and<00:07:21.650> yeah<00:07:22.650> so<00:07:22.950> that's<00:07:23.460> that's<00:07:24.300> pretty<00:07:24.419> much<00:07:24.690> it

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.080 

thanks<00:07:27.960> for
