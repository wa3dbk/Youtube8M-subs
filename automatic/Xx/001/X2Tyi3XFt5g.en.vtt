00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.140 
get this to gear 6 there so it's pulling
on<00:03:04.480> both<00:03:04.540> at<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.260> same<00:03:05.590> time<00:03:05.820> if<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:06.910> didn't

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
on both at the same time if you didn't

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.210 
on both at the same time if you didn't
do<00:03:07.210> that<00:03:07.240> you'd<00:03:07.750> start<00:03:07.990> changing<00:03:08.380> one<00:03:08.740> gearbox

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
do that you'd start changing one gearbox

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.530 
do that you'd start changing one gearbox
and<00:03:09.610> not<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.090> other

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and not the other

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.420 
and not the other
so<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:10.990> one<00:03:11.200> gear<00:03:11.410> running<00:03:11.560> fifth<00:03:12.040> let's<00:03:12.280> say

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
so then one gear running fifth let's say

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.030 
so then one gear running fifth let's say
and<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.000> other<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.270> fourth<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:14.470> critically

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
and the other in fourth just critically

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.190 
and the other in fourth just critically
pulls<00:03:15.310> back<00:03:15.490> evening

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
pulls back evening

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.429 
pulls back evening
let's<00:03:17.830> see<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.040> again

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:39.350 

I'm<00:03:26.689> getting<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.450 

you<00:03:40.110> really<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.800> see<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.130> this<00:03:41.250> car<00:03:41.430> is

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
you really can see that this car is

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.809 
you really can see that this car is
instantly<00:03:42.210> quick

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.800 

fascinating<00:03:50.819> to<00:03:50.849> see<00:03:51.030> what<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.269> actual<00:03:51.420> lap

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
fascinating to see what the actual lap

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.660 
fascinating to see what the actual lap
times<00:03:52.079> are<00:03:52.200> gonna<00:03:52.290> be<00:03:52.439> at<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.590> end

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.670 

okay<00:03:56.480> now<00:03:56.540> from<00:03:56.810> this<00:03:56.930> angle<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.319> can<00:03:57.500> see<00:03:57.530> if

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
okay now from this angle you can see if

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.580 
okay now from this angle you can see if
the<00:03:57.770> car<00:03:57.920> is<00:03:58.010> not<00:03:58.040> running<00:03:58.310> any<00:03:58.640> rear<00:03:59.060> glass

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
the car is not running any rear glass

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.960 
the car is not running any rear glass
now<00:04:00.590> Matt<00:04:00.770> has<00:04:01.100> run<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.550> car<00:04:01.760> with

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
now Matt has run the car with

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.660 
now Matt has run the car with
lightweight<00:04:02.209> perspex<00:04:02.900> annals<00:04:03.350> in<00:04:03.500> place<00:04:03.709> but

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
lightweight perspex annals in place but

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.880 
lightweight perspex annals in place but
today<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.390> preferred<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.810> maximise<00:04:06.530> cooling

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
today is preferred to maximise cooling

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.430 
today is preferred to maximise cooling
efficiency<00:04:07.180> as<00:04:08.180> with<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.690> lack<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:08.900> any<00:04:09.140> front

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
efficiency as with the lack of any front

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.290 
efficiency as with the lack of any front
grille<00:04:09.830> does<00:04:10.430> tend<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.730> give<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.120> car

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
grille does tend to give the car

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.150 
grille does tend to give the car
slightly<00:04:11.540> unfinished<00:04:12.110> look<00:04:12.320> but<00:04:13.010> that's

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
slightly unfinished look but that's

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.140 
slightly unfinished look but that's
perhaps<00:04:13.370> not<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.910> priority<00:04:14.450> here

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.210 

you

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.430 

forget<00:04:20.579> what<00:04:20.730> this<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.360> fully<00:04:21.750> road-legal
