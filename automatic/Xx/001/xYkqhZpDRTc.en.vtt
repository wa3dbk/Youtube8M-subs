 the film will tell a new story 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.320
 that will be located within the facts 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.600
 shown in the original sleeve and according to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.789
 has promised its creator on the other hand 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.280
 Akira Toriyama has also confirmed that 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.229
 he is personally working so much 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.670
 in the script as in the concept and 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.670
 Character designs 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.290
 very well 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.789
 not me, not him 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.100
 well the title of the movie is the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.650
 worst wish of history and remain in the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.610
 air two mysteries who invokes the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.650
 mighty dragon who will be revived 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.990
 who will be revived will be bard as 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.420
 we know they can not revive people who 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.550
 already dead more than five years good 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.860
 also the movie will be after the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.960
 saga of wood so it can not be bard 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.760
 well broli could be revived since 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.650
 has a power like super sayayin 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.600
 legendary and so you can defeat the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.760
 gods good as we can see in the 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.860
 trailer goku transforms into super 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.020
 sayayin good there are theories that could be 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.180
 revived the goku evil then what 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.430
 it could be true since in the trailer 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.170
 it shows goku expelling a bit of his 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.390
 keel on the film to which its 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.850
 brother of vegeta comes to earth but 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.680
 a sayayin expelled by the king vegeta 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.690
 he wants revenge so he follows the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.480
 brother of vegeta and he notices that there is 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.790
 sayayin is living on earth that does not 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.890
 it was only vegetable but it is also 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.900
 goku and among others sayayin it is so 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.970
 this sayayin inform you that there are some 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.220
 strange powerful balls that grant a 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.300
 I wish so this sayayin is dedicated to 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.060
 look for them since I had a trace 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.640
 improved and found them easily and so 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.410
 that this sayayin invokes the being long and 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.840
 he asks that Goku expel his 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.610
 malignant form that it has inside and how 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.010
 we can see in the trailer the dragon is 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.810
 he keeps it that way by having goku expel 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.790
 to its evil form good up to here the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.040
