00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.180
 most of the morning we just did the review every year and 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.590
 your pet is great to enjoy a sovereign price 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.720
 the mayer caps as a few years ago this scoundrel 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.590
 portillo a box of pasta that had this one ate it suddenly sat him down 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.909
 fatal 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.259
 you have to keep in mind with this type of accident the pets some are 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.030
 very sweet 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.850
 and if they binge on lots, for example, at the moment with the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.660
 'pross' enjoy but then they can get very bad since then we take care 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.920
 we take into account that accidents of this type do not happen 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.510
 and if we have to give it some prize link 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 but not just for example of pet that like an amount 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.380
 what is not fantastic in form 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.760

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.780
 well you can see 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.469
 I just finished with Bologna now we are going to open up this precious 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.570
 puppy of huesca and lan fixos in a puppy of huesca were of three months 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.890
 who is called judge 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.490

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.600
 puppy vaccine 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.170
 and now I was checking how the teeth change 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.649
 it is a gradual process the dog does not like to be looked at in the mouth 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.319
 it's a gradual process between three and four months the teeth start 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:16.710
 Definitive to push 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.329
 alos milk teeth and dog have small discomfort in the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.630
 It is an ideal time sometimes to offer the dog a specific food for 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.060
 growing dogs 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.380
 but of soft consistency 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.130
 these foods must also be very practical come and how the tubs 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.310
 that depending on him of the breed of the animal as he with a pot per day 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.840
 It's enough 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.929
 they assure us 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.830
 first a high palatability 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.020
 that is, they have a smell, a taste, a texture 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.900
 which makes them a choice for the puppy and practically pounced 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.820
 about food 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.299
 because he loves to enjoy eating 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.200

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.030
 that the formulation is specific for growing dogs and assures us a 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.020

 of a container that we can easily transport 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.739
 It is a very natural food specifically formulated to 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.529
 puppies with a high content of meat a percentage of proteins greater than 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:17.920
 who needs an adult dog 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.240

 the right one for a puppy 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.529
 a flavor and a pungent smell that they like and prevents them is encouraged 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.050
