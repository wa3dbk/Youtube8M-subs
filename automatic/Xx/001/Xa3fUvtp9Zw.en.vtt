00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
has been from the very beginning so what

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.160 
has been from the very beginning so what
I'm<00:03:55.200> looking<00:03:55.320> at<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:55.800> 1<00:03:56.100> foot<00:03:56.400> one<00:03:56.970> foot

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
I'm looking at is a 1 foot one foot

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:05.680 
I'm looking at is a 1 foot one foot
brick<00:03:58.170> plant<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:59.490> only<00:03:59.820> sticks<00:04:00.270> out<00:04:01.880> an<00:04:03.170> inch

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
brick plant it only sticks out an inch

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.420 
brick plant it only sticks out an inch
all<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.750> way<00:04:06.930> around<00:04:07.020> and<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:07.650> what<00:04:08.130> I'm<00:04:08.250> going

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
all the way around and so what I'm going

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.420 
all the way around and so what I'm going
to<00:04:08.460> do<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.880> have<00:04:09.330> my<00:04:09.600> brick<00:04:09.900> man<00:04:10.410> actually<00:04:11.040> do<00:04:11.400> a

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
to do is have my brick man actually do a

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.140 
to do is have my brick man actually do a
little<00:04:11.790> foot<00:04:12.350> raised<00:04:13.350> up<00:04:13.650> space<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.430> will

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
little foot raised up space that will

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.600 
little foot raised up space that will
give<00:04:15.600> them<00:04:15.690> some<00:04:15.750> more<00:04:16.230> height<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.190> idea

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
give them some more height so the idea

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.700 
give them some more height so the idea
is<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.820> get<00:04:18.000> these<00:04:18.120> things<00:04:18.390> up<00:04:18.780> about<00:04:18.930> 6<00:04:19.410> feet

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
is to get these things up about 6 feet

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.060 
is to get these things up about 6 feet
or<00:04:19.980> more<00:04:20.880> up<00:04:21.330> above<00:04:22.080> people<00:04:22.620> walking<00:04:22.980> around

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
or more up above people walking around

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.380 
or more up above people walking around
and<00:04:23.340> then<00:04:23.430> I'm<00:04:23.520> going<00:04:23.670> to<00:04:23.760> put<00:04:23.940> some<00:04:24.120> kind<00:04:24.270> of

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
and then I'm going to put some kind of

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.650 
and then I'm going to put some kind of
funky<00:04:24.750> plant<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:26.000> accent<00:04:27.000> this<00:04:27.150> gardens

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
funky plant in it to accent this gardens

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.420 
funky plant in it to accent this gardens
there<00:04:27.810> were<00:04:27.930> some<00:04:28.080> areas<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.740> allowed<00:04:29.190> on

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
there were some areas that I allowed on

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.880 
there were some areas that I allowed on
the<00:04:29.550> drawing<00:04:29.880> where<00:04:30.300> these<00:04:31.020> paths<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.650> come

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
the drawing where these paths that come

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.350 
the drawing where these paths that come
through<00:04:32.100> these<00:04:32.250> boxwood<00:04:32.790> parterre

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
through these boxwood parterre

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.400 
through these boxwood parterre
it<00:04:33.990> actually<00:04:34.470> was<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.670> round<00:04:36.000> oval<00:04:36.660> space<00:04:37.050> and

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
it actually was a round oval space and

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.600 
it actually was a round oval space and
in<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.590> middle<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.890> that<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.100> idea<00:04:38.460> was<00:04:38.550> to

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
in the middle of that the idea was to

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.730 
in the middle of that the idea was to
have<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.880> tall<00:04:39.210> object<00:04:39.780> because<00:04:40.050> everything's

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
have a tall object because everything's

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.520 
have a tall object because everything's
really<00:04:40.950> flat<00:04:41.460> across<00:04:41.940> here<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.230> needed

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
really flat across here and so I needed

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.590 
really flat across here and so I needed
something<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:44.130> would<00:04:44.340> come<00:04:44.640> up<00:04:44.790> really<00:04:45.180> tall

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
something that would come up really tall

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.960 
something that would come up really tall
because<00:04:46.320> these<00:04:46.560> buildings<00:04:47.070> are<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:47.370> tall<00:04:47.640> the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
because these buildings are so tall the

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.090 
because these buildings are so tall the
gates<00:04:48.240> are<00:04:48.450> tall<00:04:48.660> but<00:04:48.690> only<00:04:49.170> inside<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:49.800> the

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
gates are tall but only inside of the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.100 
gates are tall but only inside of the
Rose<00:04:50.310> Garden<00:04:50.340> we<00:04:50.880> really<00:04:51.180> don't<00:04:51.330> have<00:04:51.630> that

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
Rose Garden we really don't have that

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.930 
Rose Garden we really don't have that
sort<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.380> verticality<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.340> think<00:04:53.610> we<00:04:53.730> need

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
sort of verticality that I think we need

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.610 
sort of verticality that I think we need
so<00:04:54.240> think<00:04:54.750> are<00:04:54.810> going<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.020> look<00:04:55.080> really<00:04:55.410> cool

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
so think are going to look really cool

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.500 
so think are going to look really cool
I'm<00:04:55.830> excited<00:04:55.890> we<00:04:56.370> finally<00:04:56.790> got<00:04:56.970> when<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.270> found

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
I'm excited we finally got when I found

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.320 
I'm excited we finally got when I found
something<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:57.990> is<00:04:58.110> working<00:04:58.590> here

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.389 

you
