I<00:00:42.380> think<00:00:43.220> having<00:00:44.000> McGee<00:00:44.690> at<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.710> helm<00:00:45.950> of<00:00:46.190> this

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
I think having McGee at the helm of this

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.250 
I think having McGee at the helm of this
really<00:00:48.200> really<00:00:48.950> sort<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.460> raises<00:00:50.450> it<00:00:50.630> to<00:00:51.020> a

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
really really sort of raises it to a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.250 
really really sort of raises it to a
whole<00:00:51.590> new<00:00:51.830> level

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.040 

when<00:00:56.860> I<00:00:56.890> read<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.340> script<00:00:57.490> I<00:00:58.050> felt

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
when I read the script I felt

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.860 
when I read the script I felt
immediately<00:00:59.800> like<00:01:00.670> I<00:01:00.820> had<00:01:01.060> never<00:01:01.360> seen

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
anything like it before and that was the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.320 
anything like it before and that was the
first<00:01:05.260> thing<00:01:05.500> that<00:01:05.530> excited<00:01:06.070> me

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.040
