00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.330
 It is terrible to see something you love 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.730
 destroy yourself see how it is coming 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.860
 down 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.840
 we always believe that the disaster is 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.330
 far 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 what is something that affects other people in 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 other site 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 until it reaches our city and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.550
 knock on our door we do not give 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.250
 account of the fragile we are all 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.250
 we all our 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.640
 Y 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.960
 so when it happened when it came 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.460
 down 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.620
 everything fell apart 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.579
 and we we 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.690
 we feel in the oven in fear at 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.690
 the survival instinct 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.900
 these are 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.390
 and the worst is that space 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.320
 nobody saw it we did not want to see it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.320
 we did not want to look 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.150
 the tragedy is invisible people look 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.340
 flees away from them and can 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.280
 It's hard to realize that you are part of 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.690
 of this that your purpose is hidden in the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.690
 bottom of all this value 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.470
 someone has to be there 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.770
 to pick up the pieces 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.260
 to fight 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.750
 to try to unite what has been broken 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.590
 for again 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.590
 our own life 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.110
 stop
