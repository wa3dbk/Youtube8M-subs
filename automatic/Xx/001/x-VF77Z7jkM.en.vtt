every<00:00:17.190> day<00:00:18.109> we<00:00:19.109> actually<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:20.240> 26<00:00:21.240> species<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
every day we actually have 26 species of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
every day we actually have 26 species of
frogs<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.320> are<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.830> exhibit<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
frogs that are in the exhibit at the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.759 
frogs that are in the exhibit at the
moment<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> Interactive's<00:00:25.500> in

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
moment we have a lot of Interactive's in

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.920 
moment we have a lot of Interactive's in
there<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.580> means<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.900> example

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
there so it means that for example

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.689 
there so it means that for example
families<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.680> young<00:00:28.710> children<00:00:28.830> there's<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
families with young children there's a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
families with young children there's a
lot<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.939> hands-on<00:00:30.300> things<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.750> example<00:00:30.840> we

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
lot of hands-on things for example we

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.290 
lot of hands-on things for example we
have<00:00:31.410> video<00:00:31.740> cameras<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.090> can

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
have video cameras in there that you can

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
have video cameras in there that you can
control<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.680> close-up<00:00:34.920> views<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
control to get really close-up views of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.990 
control to get really close-up views of
frogs<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.840> are<00:00:37.190> interactive<00:00:38.190> kiosks<00:00:38.790> where

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
frogs there are interactive kiosks where

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
frogs there are interactive kiosks where
you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.270> playback<00:00:39.510> different<00:00:39.989> frog<00:00:40.260> calls<00:00:40.559> or

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
you can playback different frog calls or

you can playback different frog calls or
see<00:00:41.340> frogs<00:00:41.670> feeding<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.809> wanted<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> bring

frogs<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.160> museum<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> showcase<00:00:45.629> for

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
frogs to the museum as a showcase for

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.950 
frogs to the museum as a showcase for
the<00:00:46.620> environment<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> fact<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.239> things

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the environment and the fact that things

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.410 
the environment and the fact that things
like<00:00:49.140> frogs<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.590> very<00:00:49.770> sensitive<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
like frogs are very sensitive to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
like frogs are very sensitive to
environmental<00:00:51.420> change<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> maintain

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
environmental change we have to maintain

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.500 
environmental change we have to maintain
the<00:00:53.610> frogs<00:00:54.350> daily<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> real<00:00:57.059> labor<00:00:57.300> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the frogs daily so it's a real labor of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.779 
the frogs daily so it's a real labor of
love<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.430> several<00:00:59.430> staff<00:00:59.760> members

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
love and we have several staff members

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.930 
love and we have several staff members
which<00:01:00.649> are<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:01.980> every<00:01:02.129> day<00:01:02.160> feeding<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
which are in there every day feeding the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.030 
which are in there every day feeding the
frogs

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.630 

we<00:01:10.730> usually<00:01:11.030> feed<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.360> frogs<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:12.640> pinhead

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
we usually feed the frogs the pinhead

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.730 
we usually feed the frogs the pinhead
crickets<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.270> two<00:01:14.960> different<00:01:15.320> sizes<00:01:15.710> of

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
crickets and two different sizes of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.550 
crickets and two different sizes of
fruit<00:01:16.010> flies<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:17.090> larger<00:01:17.840> one<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.200> smaller

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
fruit flies a larger one and a smaller

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.530 
fruit flies a larger one and a smaller
one<00:01:18.680> but<00:01:19.460> they're<00:01:19.580> actually<00:01:19.730> bred<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.510> be

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
one but they're actually bred to be

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:29.100 
one but they're actually bred to be
flightless<00:01:21.340> for<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.430> new<00:01:22.550> one<00:01:22.760> pretty<00:01:23.000> quick

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.630 

every<00:01:30.110> morning<00:01:30.380> we<00:01:31.990> give<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.920> habitat<00:01:34.340> a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
every morning we give the the habitat a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.140 
every morning we give the the habitat a
mist<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.570> spritz<00:01:36.140> down<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:37.550> make<00:01:37.730> sure<00:01:37.880> all<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
mist a spritz down to make sure all the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.930 
mist a spritz down to make sure all the
plants<00:01:38.450> are<00:01:38.540> getting<00:01:38.630> enough<00:01:39.080> water<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:40.670> also

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
plants are getting enough water and also

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.910 
plants are getting enough water and also
just<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.360> help<00:01:41.510> clean<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.840> down<00:01:42.110> as<00:01:42.320> well<00:01:42.500> we

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
just to help clean it down as well we

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.300 
just to help clean it down as well we
have<00:01:43.070> 74<00:01:43.670> frogs<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.270> here<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.890> we<00:01:45.980> just<00:01:46.010> make

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
have 74 frogs in here that we just make

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.020 
have 74 frogs in here that we just make
sure<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:46.760> there<00:01:47.000> are<00:01:47.380> flies<00:01:48.380> sprinkles

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
sure that there are flies sprinkles

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.050 
sure that there are flies sprinkles
pretty<00:01:50.030> much<00:01:50.240> all<00:01:50.420> over<00:01:51.700> moving<00:01:52.700> around<00:01:52.880> so

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
pretty much all over moving around so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.390 
pretty much all over moving around so
everybody<00:01:53.450> gets<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.750> chance<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.080> get<00:01:54.260> some<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
everybody gets a chance to get some and

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.490 
everybody gets a chance to get some and
you<00:01:55.580> can<00:01:55.730> see<00:01:55.910> immediately<00:01:56.180> these<00:01:56.660> these<00:01:57.140> also

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
you can see immediately these these also

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.530 
you can see immediately these these also
started<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.890> move

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
started to move

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.180 
started to move
follow<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.720> Flies<00:01:59.930> when<00:02:00.710> we<00:02:00.860> have<00:02:01.010> more

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
follow the Flies when we have more

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.520 
follow the Flies when we have more
crickets<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.970> crickets<00:02:02.660> tend<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.960> be<00:02:03.080> bigger

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
crickets the crickets tend to be bigger

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.800 
crickets the crickets tend to be bigger
so<00:02:04.370> they'll<00:02:04.580> eat<00:02:04.790> less<00:02:05.030> crickets<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.690> they

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
so they'll eat less crickets and they

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.810 
so they'll eat less crickets and they
wood<00:02:05.990> flies<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:07.640> really<00:02:08.240> varies<00:02:12.520> we<00:02:13.520> really

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
wood flies so it really varies we really

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.360 
wood flies so it really varies we really
wanted<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.150> show<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.480> nice<00:02:14.990> diversity<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.770> frogs

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
wanted to show a nice diversity of frogs

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.540 
wanted to show a nice diversity of frogs
for<00:02:16.910> example<00:02:17.300> some<00:02:17.510> species<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.990> will<00:02:18.290> be

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
for example some species that will be

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.860 
for example some species that will be
fairly<00:02:19.550> familiar<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:20.150> people<00:02:20.180> things<00:02:20.690> like

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
fairly familiar to people things like

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.890 
fairly familiar to people things like
the<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.350> North<00:02:22.340> American<00:02:22.760> bullfrog<00:02:23.240> but<00:02:23.810> we

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the the North American bullfrog but we

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.720 
the the North American bullfrog but we
also<00:02:24.020> then<00:02:24.290> wanted<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.709> showcase<00:02:24.950> really

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
also then wanted to showcase really

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.990 
also then wanted to showcase really
unusual<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.450> bizarre<00:02:26.600> frogs<00:02:27.140> things<00:02:27.590> that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
unusual and bizarre frogs things that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.860 
unusual and bizarre frogs things that
