00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.120
 I called the port of Santos to Jundiaí 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.130

 was the manufacturing 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.570
 it was made there and brought here so in that sense it has an aspect 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.520
 very modern 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 why it also linked to the history of railroads 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 from 1976 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.960

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.730
 after cleaning. 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.790

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.619
 without ever having similar things without previous front 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:24.179
 every Saturday two wagons are reserved for a special trip 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.769

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:46.499
 state of são paulo 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.080
 the railway station of jundiaí 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.670
 and was dropped six months and will go through a restoration project for 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.899
 keep the past 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:58.449
 and build the future the importance of past time with the construction of 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.570
 São Paulo was founded 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.809
 and that the future also because 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.179
 proven 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.930
 this line here will make the metropolitan connection 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.200
 who already came with the project thinks great and totalizing as early as 1836 he 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.549
 will never change 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.319
 in his opinion that will come back still 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.829
 not even much future a faster train more 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.989
 the atrophy she has at her side what is positive is the long distance rock 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.969
 This will not die I'm sure that the celebrity life
