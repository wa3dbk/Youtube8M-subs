00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.539
 zr which is a very interesting bridge from 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.130
 ibanez because the extremities 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:23.600
 cylindrical to them end up providing 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.280
 the lowest friction which causes the bridge

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.500
 that allows you to adjust attention
