between like a permanent race circuit
and<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> street<00:00:31.289> circuit<00:00:31.470> there's<00:00:32.009> lots

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
and like a street circuit there's lots

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.250 
and like a street circuit there's lots
of<00:00:32.969> corners<00:00:33.390> where<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> walls<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:34.079> very

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
graining you know which makes it even

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
graining you know which makes it even
more<00:00:53.789> difficult<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:55.050> keep<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> comic

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

take some downfalls of the car so as a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
take some downfalls of the car so as a
driver<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.850> used<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.240> as

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
driver you have to get used to that as

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.359 
driver you have to get used to that as
well<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.780> driving<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.259> car<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:29.070> less

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
well you know driving a car with less

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.109 
well you know driving a car with less
downforce<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.420> feels<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> bit<00:01:30.869> looser<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
downforce it just feels a bit looser and

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
downforce it just feels a bit looser and
at<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> same<00:01:33.420> time<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.840> still<00:01:34.079> need<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> use

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
at the same time you still need to use

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.289 
at the same time you still need to use
the<00:01:34.470> curbs<00:01:34.829> need<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> go<00:01:35.610> close<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.060> wall

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the curbs need to go close to the wall

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.289 
the curbs need to go close to the wall
so<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.829> quite<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.070> quite<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> challenge<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
so it is quite a quite a challenge in a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.240 
so it is quite a quite a challenge in a
nice<00:01:39.630> thrill<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.409> drive<00:01:40.590> around<00:01:40.799> Montreal

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
nice thrill to to drive around Montreal

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.429 
nice thrill to to drive around Montreal
I<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:42.150> montrell<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.869> those<00:01:43.020> cities

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
I think montrell is one of those cities

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.170 
I think montrell is one of those cities
which<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:44.130> gears<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> formula

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
which really gears up for the formula

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.760 
which really gears up for the formula

the weekend so it's a very unique and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.749 
the weekend so it's a very unique and
special<00:01:57.450> atmosphere<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:58.500> I've<00:01:58.759> experienced

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
special atmosphere as I've experienced

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.319 
special atmosphere as I've experienced
it<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.299> two<00:02:00.570> thousand<00:02:00.930> ten<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.259> eleven<00:02:01.590> so

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
it in two thousand ten and eleven so

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.850 
it in two thousand ten and eleven so
yeah<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.780> look<00:02:03.990> forward<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:04.680> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
yeah I really look forward going there I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.930 
yeah I really look forward going there I
think<00:02:05.640> overtaking<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.299> generally<00:02:06.689> possible

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
think overtaking is generally possible

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.380 
think overtaking is generally possible
I<00:02:08.979> think<00:02:09.979> there<00:02:10.100> was<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.250> double<00:02:10.460> DRS<00:02:10.880> on<00:02:11.090> last

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
I think there was a double DRS on last

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.890 
I think there was a double DRS on last
year<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:14.000> know<00:02:14.090> I'm<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> first<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
year so you know I'm the first on the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.850 
year so you know I'm the first on the
back<00:02:15.050> straight<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.320> then<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.710> main

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
back straight and then on the main

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.180 
back straight and then on the main
straight<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.730> gives<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:17.000> plenty<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.450> of

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
straight so it gives you plenty of of

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.400 
straight so it gives you plenty of of
you<00:02:19.190> know<00:02:19.250> chances<00:02:19.820> for<00:02:20.000> overtaking<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.720> also

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
you know chances for overtaking and also

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.830 
you know chances for overtaking and also
deck<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.490> quite<00:02:22.820> high<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.030> Montreal<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:23.690> that

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
deck is quite high in Montreal so that

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.770 
deck is quite high in Montreal so that
mixes<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.860> all<00:02:25.010> up<00:02:25.190> quite<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.520> bit<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.970> that's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
mixes it all up quite a bit and that's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.760 
mixes it all up quite a bit and that's
why<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.020> overtaking<00:02:27.680> shouldn't<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> problem
