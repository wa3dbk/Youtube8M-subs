the style of the older poster image
that's<00:00:29.609> been<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.029> was<00:00:30.150> leaked<00:00:30.420> onto<00:00:30.630> the

that's been that was leaked onto the
internet<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> revolution<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:31.980> that's<00:00:32.910> one

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.270 
internet the revolution one that's one
of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> reasons<00:00:33.750> why<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:35.070> may

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
of the reasons why I think this one may

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.650 
of the reasons why I think this one may
be<00:00:35.309> fake<00:00:35.640> again<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.360> looks<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
be fake again because it just looks a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.240 
be fake again because it just looks a
little<00:00:36.780> bit<00:00:36.930> too<00:00:37.079> similar<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:38.040> make

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
little bit too similar but they make

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
little bit too similar but they make
your<00:00:38.399> own<00:00:38.489> opinions<00:00:38.850> upon<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.629> you
