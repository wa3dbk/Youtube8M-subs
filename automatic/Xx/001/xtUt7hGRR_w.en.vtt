thought<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.590> Honda<00:02:08.250> had<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> commuting

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
thought that Honda had the commuting

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.990 
thought that Honda had the commuting
market<00:02:09.450> sewn<00:02:09.840> up<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.380> CB<00:02:10.739> 500<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.489> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
market sewn up with the CB 500 and the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.660 
market sewn up with the CB 500 and the
600<00:02:12.540> Hornet<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.590> seems<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.370> wasn't

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
600 Hornet but it seems this wasn't

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.479 
600 Hornet but it seems this wasn't
quite<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.209> case<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.830> some<00:02:17.250> people

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
quite the case you see some people

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.360 
quite the case you see some people
thought<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.270> CB<00:02:18.660> 500<00:02:19.320> was<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.160> bit

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
thought that the CB 500 was just a bit

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.210 
thought that the CB 500 was just a bit
too<00:02:20.400> weedy<00:02:21.110> but<00:02:22.110> they<00:02:22.230> also<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:22.890> thought

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
too weedy but they also then thought

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.760 
too weedy but they also then thought
that<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.489> 600<00:02:24.030> Hornet<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.510> its<00:02:24.690> whole<00:02:24.930> 100

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
that the 600 Hornet with its whole 100

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.729 
that the 600 Hornet with its whole 100
horsepower<00:02:26.070> was<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.880> bit<00:02:27.120> too<00:02:27.300> much<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.350> Honda

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
horsepower was a bit too much so Honda

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.500 
horsepower was a bit too much so Honda
went<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.130> invented<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.060> halfway

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
went and invented this as a halfway

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.180 
went and invented this as a halfway

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.479 
gonna say gone boring then for a minute
almost<00:04:07.170> but<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.650> don't<00:04:08.069> think<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.370> would<00:04:08.459> be

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
almost but I don't think that would be

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.880 
almost but I don't think that would be
fair<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:09.150> mean<00:04:09.330> if<00:04:09.510> you've<00:04:09.870> come<00:04:10.170> from<00:04:10.350> big<00:04:10.620> fast

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
fair I mean if you've come from big fast

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.890 
fair I mean if you've come from big fast
bikes<00:04:11.190> you've<00:04:11.519> ridden<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.819> lot<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.480> may<00:04:12.600> find

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
bikes you've ridden a lot you may find

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.920 
bikes you've ridden a lot you may find
this<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.290> little<00:04:13.769> unexcited<00:04:14.370> yeah<00:04:14.910> but<00:04:15.420> you

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
this a little unexcited yeah but you

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.090 
this a little unexcited yeah but you
think<00:04:15.989> if<00:04:16.260> you've<00:04:16.380> got<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.620> background<00:04:16.799> you

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
think if you've got that background you

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.170 
think if you've got that background you
wouldn't<00:04:17.280> be<00:04:17.340> one<00:04:17.459> environment<00:04:17.820> it's<00:04:18.150> not

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
wouldn't be one environment it's not

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.819 
wouldn't be one environment it's not
meant<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.750> no<00:04:18.959> point<00:04:19.200> doing<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.500> down<00:04:19.620> for

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
meant to be no point doing it down for

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.960 
meant to be no point doing it down for
something<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.160> not<00:04:20.280> it's<00:04:20.459> not<00:04:20.579> meant<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.880> be

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
something it's not it's not meant to be

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.460 
something it's not it's not meant to be
so<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.239> does<00:04:21.450> what<00:04:21.660> it's<00:04:21.810> designed<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.440> but

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
so it does what it's designed to do but

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.830 
so it does what it's designed to do but
it<00:04:22.740> says<00:04:22.889> on<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.100> tin<00:04:23.340> exactly<00:04:23.880> succeeds<00:04:24.419> just

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
it says on the tin exactly succeeds just

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.830 
it says on the tin exactly succeeds just
a<00:04:25.080> little<00:04:25.680> bit<00:04:25.830> lacking<00:04:26.040> in<00:04:26.540> vibrancy<00:04:27.540> spark

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
a little bit lacking in vibrancy spark

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.290 
a little bit lacking in vibrancy spark
character<00:04:28.500> character<00:04:29.370> ah<00:04:29.580> now<00:04:29.970> there's<00:04:30.180> an

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
character character ah now there's an

something with character

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.720
