style<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:13.020> advantage<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.499> this<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.889> throw

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
style the advantage of this is you throw

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.760 
style the advantage of this is you throw
it<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.249> the<00:01:14.340> water<00:01:15.289> and<00:01:16.289> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.469> see<00:01:16.679> us

it in the water and you can see us
floating<00:01:17.189> upside<00:01:17.549> down<00:01:17.789> there<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> it's

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
floating upside down there so it's

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:20.840 
floating upside down there so it's
definitely<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.369> there

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
definitely in there

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
dry it out and there would not be dry it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.279 
dry it out and there would not be dry it
would<00:01:29.999> be<00:01:30.149> soaking<00:01:30.659> wet<00:01:30.749> and<00:01:30.810> you'll<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
would be soaking wet and you'll have to

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.349 
would be soaking wet and you'll have to
try<00:01:31.469> to<00:01:31.530> draw<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.889> out<00:01:32.039> for<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> few<00:01:32.909> minutes<00:01:33.209> try

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
try to draw it out for a few minutes try

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.519 
try to draw it out for a few minutes try
to<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.539> it<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.719> if<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:34.020> could<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.319> it<00:01:34.439> to
