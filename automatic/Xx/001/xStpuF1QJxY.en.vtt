00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.500
 do not 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.300
 Hello 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.320
 good morning car followers 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.270
 first dotcom we are here in our 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.330
 display of our new vehicle 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.820
 The Kia Core is our flagship of 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.570
 the devil brand as you can see the 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.369
 lights are all and poleras both 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.239
 exteriors like the interiors of 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.660
 vehicle 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.460
 the lights this part is from here are 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.980
 robotized that means when the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.360
 vehicle is still light and texts 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.579
 they expand and as we go 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.829
 advancing in speed the lights go 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.679
 closing they are closing the angle and we 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.300
 is showing more more projection 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.219
 also at the moment the vehicle is 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.170
 move to right by left the 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.629
 they are going to rotate a bit so that 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.860
 let's always have visibility and we can 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.680
 see the blind spots here we have 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.260
 sound sensors that will indicate us 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.020
 that if one approaches the self it will sound 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.860
 two in a critical field where we 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.320
 will indicate that we have something in front 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.960
 here we have the first front camera 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.340
 with one of the four cameras that he manages 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.460
 the vehicle since our vehicle 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.920
 handles camera in front of camera back and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.640
 each one in each mirror that will give us 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.190
 a 360 degree vision that is going to 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.320
 serve both for parking and if we go 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.300
 driving we can easily look if 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.890
 we have a bollard an obstacle 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.920
 there is some depth the road 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.320
 we as human beings have a 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.210
 roughly approximate vision of 120 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.060
 meters away our vehicle 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.640
 has a kind of radar that we 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.160
 indicates an approximate distance of 170 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.350
 meters which will tell us if it's going to 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.450
 move something forward there is an object 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.610
 some person so that we have 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.400
 caution as you can see we have rin 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.000
 18 is a pretty rin 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.310
 It's nice already with an excellent design 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.050
 We drove the vehicle chromed 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.520
 how can you see there being a distance 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.360
 normal to the floor 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.730
 if we have multilink suspension so much 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.160
 forward as well as back to make us 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.770
 to make it a super soft car and 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.200
 besides that we have the option of having 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.990
 air suspension that suspension of 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.300
 how does it work if the car is going to 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.370
 Less than 40 kilometers per hour 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.160
 us from the cabin that further in 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.290
 I'll show you we have a button where 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.630
 we can lift the vehicle about 30 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.570
 millimeters when we pass the ground 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.630
 hard press the button again on 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.400
 car is going to go down to normal to the floor and 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.140
 if it goes beyond that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.600
 we passed 110 kilometers 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.090
 approximately the car is already going to record 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.390
 another 15 millimeters for that gives us 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.060
 greater stability and faster is a 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.830
 vehicle between Mercedes classics 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.970
 we can say it that way for the sporty 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.220
 must 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.210
 here we can see it by the double exit 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.730
 of our sixth this that gives us a 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.180
 sports air we have with sensors 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.890
 also sound if the other camera that 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.810
 I told them about the four we have 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.810
 with our lights the led 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.180
 additional to that we have in this part and 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.750
 in this part 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.939
 is the radar that will indicate if a 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.219
 vehicle a motorcycle or something is approaching us 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.069
 about 30 centimeters from 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:37.599
 vehicle more or less at this distance 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.819
 the mirrors that we will see later 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.209
 these are some tortilla chips 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.620
 little triangles are going to start illuminating 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.230
 if by chance we do not reach 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.090
 to see the little triangles the belt of 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.980
 security is going to vibrate and it will indicate 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.219
 that someone is passing us 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.900
 we have our smart key if with 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.700
 this key we can also control the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.709
 Opening the trunk inside 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.180
 we have a special button so that what 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.750
 we can open or close but I'm going to 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.419
 indicate how we can do it we hold 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.450
 and our water is going to open 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.609
 automatically our vehicle has 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.850
 the system that if the door goes wrong 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.980
 closed 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.980
 and will automatically close 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:27.509
 as you can notice is a vehicle 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.729
 pretty smart inside 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.849
 our finishes completely in 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.669
 aluminum give us an elegant touch 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.770
 also all our hobby nerÃ­a is in 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.830
 leather all our part of here up 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.569
 it's a leather is an excellent 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.400
 presentation doors all 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.949
 doors come in leather with their details 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.460
 in aluminum our rudder in leather 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.550
 and the rudder this way in leather comes with 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.159
 heating have a gearbox 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.470
 analogues is already a gearbox that 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:01.409
 no need for cables is a box type 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.620
 guys we handle eight changes 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.680
 sequential forward is excellent 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:12.240
 The response of the vehicle is excellent 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.270
 Our vehicle has 3800 engine of 294 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.370
 horses v6 engine on the board we can 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.860
 upload the letter download the letter change the 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.259
 color change the texture we can make it 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.300
 absolutely everything usually 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.680
 on-board computers come up in 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.210
 half but we if we want 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.180
 we can expand 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.210
 on the whole board or we can see it 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.580
 reflected with this display in the glass 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.030
 ahead we will indicate several 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.919
 things if there is a speed curve is 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.660
 absolutely everything we want this 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.319
 that's what the radar on the back told them 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.419
 that a car approaches 30 meters 30 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:51.530
 centimeters he will start to vibrate 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.530
 the belt 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.930
 good first car friends I hope 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.410
 that you liked our vehicle 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.300
 coris as you can see is an excellent 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.040
 excellent vehicle option 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.440
 we hope and invite you to visit 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.120
 our showcases and buy it without 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.110
 no problem thank you very much that
