00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 hi today I was talking to you about 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.150
 little animals we know we love 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.710
 almost every cat the osha is a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.019
 carnivorous mammal of the family of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
 felids in ancient times the Egyptians to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.890
 the effect of dreams but they were 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.029
 demonized in the middle ages in europe which 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.010
 brings him to ask me a quick question 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.289
 honestly how to consider that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.820
 that's the incarnation of the devil the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.170
 cats are also part of the animals of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.779
 most frequent company he in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.550
 still exists 50 race what I 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 think or fuck a little 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.250
 so here you see there is a clear decline 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.680
 initiated in euros point the chartreuse 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.870
 here it's a bengal tiger there a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.969
 Burmese according to him France and Turkey 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.410
 is going great of course so I have the other who 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.820
 characterizes the most the shout 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.260
 information and his little look 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.449
 innocent it's their bank account 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.559
 and what's more rhyme and if there is something 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.629
 that I find quite heartbreaking does a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.949
 novel is that we still do not know where 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.440
 he comes and how he is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.690
 yes the man masters the fire we see 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.909
 rockets in space and do not know 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.880
 how the sharan look for the mistake 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.280
 ok ok I admit it must be pretty 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 hard to do an autopsy of a cat all 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.390
 by making rhÃ´ne and more the hat 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 rhone and as much in the situations of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.530
 pleasure than suffering if he wants 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:30.050
 that maybe when I t lmost my 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:32.150

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.580

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.560

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.570

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.170
 low truth it was too late but 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.940
 Nevertheless 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.670
