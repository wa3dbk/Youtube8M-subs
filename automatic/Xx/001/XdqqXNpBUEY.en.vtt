loading closures that they make it's
just<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.669> one<00:00:34.760> that's<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.300> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
just the one that's it it's about I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.940 
just the one that's it it's about I
worked<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.350> using<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> outer

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
worked it out just using the outer

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.670 
worked it out just using the outer
dimensions<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:39.030> roughly<00:00:39.480> about<00:00:40.200> training

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
dimensions it's roughly about training

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.799 
dimensions it's roughly about training
life<00:00:40.800> kids<00:00:41.040> after<00:00:41.520> displacement<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.600> about

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
life kids after displacement it's about

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.549 
life kids after displacement it's about
three<00:00:43.079> cubes

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
three cubes

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.639 
three cubes
so<00:00:44.010> each<00:00:44.160> subs<00:00:44.460> getting<00:00:44.760> about<00:00:44.879> 1/2<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:46.200> 800

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so each subs getting about 1/2 the 800

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.880 
so each subs getting about 1/2 the 800
IMS<00:00:46.950> subs<00:00:47.960> 2.4<00:00:48.960> inch<00:00:49.050> voice<00:00:49.260> coils<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.770> we

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
IMS subs 2.4 inch voice coils and we

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
IMS subs 2.4 inch voice coils and we
nice<00:00:50.070> deep<00:00:50.340> probe<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> one

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
nice deep probe the going of this one

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.270 
nice deep probe the going of this one
here<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> hundred<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
here now it's going to be a hundred and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.569 
here now it's going to be a hundred and
eighteen<00:00:53.670> liters<00:00:54.030> after<00:00:54.449> displacement<00:00:55.579> tune

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
eighteen liters after displacement tune

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.460 
eighteen liters after displacement tune
to<00:00:56.730> 33<00:00:57.180> Hertz<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.600> sure

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.520 

it's<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> lower<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.430> okay<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.530> can't

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it's the lower one here okay I can't

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310 
it's the lower one here okay I can't
extend<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.250> low<00:01:08.430> end<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.049> from

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
extend the low end a bit but we go from

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.910 
extend the low end a bit but we go from
118<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> 152<00:01:11.850> liters<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:13.080> makes<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> box<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
118 to 152 liters which makes the box a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460 
118 to 152 liters which makes the box a
lot<00:01:14.520> bigger<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> why<00:01:15.689> mini-game<00:01:16.140> you're

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
lot bigger and why mini-game you're

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.670 
lot bigger and why mini-game you're
gonna<00:01:16.590> gain<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.509> decibel<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> lower

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
gonna gain about a decibel in the lower

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.710 
gonna gain about a decibel in the lower
frequencies<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.479> making

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
frequencies but is that that's making

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.590 
frequencies but is that that's making
the<00:01:21.960> Box<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.380> lot<00:01:22.680> bigger<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:24.360> time

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the Box a lot bigger and this time

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480 
the Box a lot bigger and this time
around<00:01:24.869> we're<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> try<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> horn<00:01:26.159> port

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
around we're going to try a horn port

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.140 
around we're going to try a horn port
like<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> from<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> inside

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
like that so from the inside

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.050 
like that so from the inside
she<00:01:30.659> looks<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.259> horn<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
she looks like that horn here like that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.249 
she looks like that horn here like that
and<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> gotta<00:01:35.340> give<00:01:35.490> credit<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
and that so I gotta give credit to

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.450 
and that so I gotta give credit to
someone<00:01:37.259> else<00:01:37.409> well<00:01:37.590> there's<00:01:38.189> no<00:01:38.280> point

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
someone else well there's no point

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
someone else well there's no point
naming<00:01:38.820> them<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.869> did<00:01:40.200> tell<00:01:40.409> me<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
naming them but they did tell me that I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.280 
naming them but they did tell me that I
was<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.280> gonna<00:01:41.430> horn<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
was just gonna horn here and do this and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.870 
was just gonna horn here and do this and
they<00:01:43.409> said<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> might<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:43.920> well<00:01:44.009> horny<00:01:44.369> inside

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
they said you might as well horny inside

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.830 
they said you might as well horny inside
as<00:01:45.090> well<00:01:45.920> I'll<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.070> that

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
as well I'll do that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.200 
as well I'll do that
anyway<00:01:48.979> that's<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.280> we'll<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.700> there<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.119> is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
anyway that's what we'll do there it is

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
anyway that's what we'll do there it is
of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> top<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> idea

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
of the top on it so you get the idea

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.260 
of the top on it so you get the idea
double<00:01:54.570> baffle<00:01:54.720> front<00:01:55.219> 16<00:01:56.219> mil<00:01:56.460> probably

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
double baffle front 16 mil probably

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.670 
double baffle front 16 mil probably
going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.780> rezoned<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.320> everything<00:01:58.590> on

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
going to be rezoned and everything on

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.450 
going to be rezoned and everything on
the<00:01:58.770> inside<00:01:59.840> probably<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.170> brace<00:02:01.560> over<00:02:01.890> here

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the inside probably a brace over here

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
the inside probably a brace over here
just<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.969> triangle<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.719> from<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:03.990> side<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
just a triangle going from this side to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.160 
just a triangle going from this side to
this<00:02:04.530> side<00:02:05.390> otherwise<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.689> shouldn't<00:02:07.020> need

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this side otherwise it shouldn't need

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290 
this side otherwise it shouldn't need
too<00:02:07.469> much<00:02:07.649> other<00:02:07.920> bracing<00:02:08.429> being<00:02:08.729> rezoned<00:02:09.119> and

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
too much other bracing being rezoned and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.719 
too much other bracing being rezoned and
everything

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
everything

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.130 
everything
should<00:02:09.970> be<00:02:10.060> fairly<00:02:10.300> strong<00:02:10.659> it<00:02:10.989> is

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
should be fairly strong it is

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.910 
should be fairly strong it is
essentially<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.709> three<00:02:11.980> inch<00:02:12.129> port<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.819> here

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
essentially a three inch port in here

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.460 
essentially a three inch port in here
but<00:02:14.920> with<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.310> big<00:02:15.459> flare<00:02:15.760> which<00:02:16.180> doubles<00:02:16.599> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
but with the big flare which doubles the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.940 
but with the big flare which doubles the
outside<00:02:17.830> that's<00:02:18.610> back<00:02:18.849> my<00:02:19.060> morning<00:02:19.709> doing<00:02:20.709> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
outside that's back my morning doing the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.610 
outside that's back my morning doing the
maths<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.360> condensed<00:02:23.049> clean<00:02:23.349> one

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
maths that is the condensed clean one

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.180 
maths that is the condensed clean one
after<00:02:24.159> I<00:02:24.220> wasted<00:02:24.819> that<00:02:24.909> piece<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.269> paper<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
after I wasted that piece of paper and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.650 
after I wasted that piece of paper and
did<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.400> lot<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.700> maths<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.569> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
did a lot of maths just on the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.750 
did a lot of maths just on the
calculator<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.709> that's<00:02:29.890> all<00:02:30.190> those<00:02:30.459> specs

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
calculator and that's all those specs

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.650 
calculator and that's all those specs
look<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.290> anyway<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.000> guys<00:02:34.299> are<00:02:34.480> seeing

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
look so anyway if you guys are seeing

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.119 
look so anyway if you guys are seeing
this<00:02:34.840> then<00:02:35.230> I'm<00:02:35.410> probably<00:02:35.650> going<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.920> go<00:02:36.040> ahead

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
this then I'm probably going to go ahead

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.130 
this then I'm probably going to go ahead
and<00:02:36.340> build<00:02:36.489> this<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.060> next<00:02:37.299> upcoming<00:02:37.840> week

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
and build this in the next upcoming week

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.130 
and build this in the next upcoming week
or<00:02:38.290> two<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.430> stay<00:02:39.700> tuned<00:02:40.030> before<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.420> build<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
or two so stay tuned before I build and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.920 
or two so stay tuned before I build and
then<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.370> few<00:02:42.760> weeks<00:02:42.940> after<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.660> should<00:02:43.720> be

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
then a few weeks after that we should be

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.930 
then a few weeks after that we should be
able<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.140> get<00:02:44.260> some<00:02:44.440> demo<00:02:44.709> footage<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
able to get some demo footage of the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.840 
able to get some demo footage of the
chops<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.329> audios

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.910
