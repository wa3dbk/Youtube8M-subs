00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.269
 hello friends and welcome to another tuto 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.619
 Tuesday I am I nardo pÃ©reznieto and today 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.040
 let's do something that I have been 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.230
 asking a lot and it's like drawing a 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.230
 bee 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.470
 with a pen we start by drawing the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.539
 candle silhouette 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.700
 we do the top part and the 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.420
 sides the wick 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.850
 the flame 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.539
 and the wax will be draining to 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.430
 give it a little more character and health 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.829
 marked an area that is going to be the halo of 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.470
 light 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.230
 and then we start to fill the background 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.260
 people ask me how to pencil how 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.490
 it can give the intensity of a flame 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.840
 or if the light of a flame when you're 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.160
 drawing a candle or fire in general 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.650
 they want it to look clearer and more 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.740
 bright but they are drawing on 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.350
 white paper in pencil do not know how 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 achieve that effect 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.020
 the trick is that to give more light there 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.600
 you have to put more light but more 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.390
 darkness 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.869
 more darkness not in the flame by 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.020
 course but all the round of this 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.860
 that's why I'm obscuring what is the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.250
 background with a dark background we will achieve 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.009
 that the flame of light with a chamois 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.710
 blurred to give a slight tone to the 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.409
 paraffin we know that paraffin is 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.259
 white however in this drawing I do not 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.750
 I want it as clear as the flame so that 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.850
 the latter shines even more very well 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.240
 now in this area you have to make a 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.670
 degradation so that the black 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.440
 gradually become white what 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.350
 which is the black background I did with 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.330
 a very soft lace about 6 go in 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.990
 change now for this middle term 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.789
 I'm using a 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.489
 we continue on the other side 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.319
 approaching the flame and we can 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.290
 blur with the make 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.420
 ok but let's continue darkening 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.900
 because the halo of light should not be so 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.569
 big nor so intense 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.629
 little by little with the pen we go 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.909
 achieving the intensity that we want with 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.610
 the pen or you can use a pencil 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.860
 of the wooden ones is actually the same 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.159
 as long as it's a pencil for 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.310
 drawing I do not want to see an edge 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.760
 between light and dark therefore 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.000
 we carefully fading it 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.430
 well it's almost done with the draft 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 moldable we can get even more lights 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.590
 both in the flame so that the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.829
 white of the paper like reflections in 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.170
 some drops of paraffin very well 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.069
 we make the final details and it goes to 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.069
 be prepared 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.379
