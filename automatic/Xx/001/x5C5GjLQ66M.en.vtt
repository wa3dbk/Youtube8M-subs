00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
shown for the beauty and where there was

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
shown for the beauty and where there was
the<00:00:49.950> reality<00:00:50.430> was<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> bit<00:00:50.910> out<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the reality was a bit out of the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.100 
the reality was a bit out of the
movement<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.309> fascinated<00:00:53.489> by<00:00:54.149> what

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
movement and I was fascinated by what

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.740 
movement and I was fascinated by what
the<00:00:55.469> body<00:00:55.710> has<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.520> without<00:00:57.030> having<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the body has to do without having a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.770 
the body has to do without having a
choice<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.850> survival<00:00:59.850> instinct<00:01:00.420> almost

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
choice or the survival instinct almost

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.709 
choice or the survival instinct almost
has<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> come<00:01:01.590> back<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> stage<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
has to come back to the stage so the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.690 
has to come back to the stage so the
whole<00:01:03.899> evening<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.280> based<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:07.320> idea<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
whole evening is based on this idea of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.109 
whole evening is based on this idea of
what<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.510> body<00:01:09.750> has<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.950> find<00:01:11.490> its<00:01:11.850> way

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
what the body has to do to find its way

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
out of course we live in this in cities

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.080 
out of course we live in this in cities
people<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.380> together<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.580> less<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.030> less

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
contact is there sometimes people go out

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
contact is there sometimes people go out
working<00:01:21.150> between<00:01:21.479> millions<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.259> people<00:01:22.590> come

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
working between millions of people come

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.760 
working between millions of people come
home<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.520> say<00:01:23.700> nobody<00:01:24.119> touched<00:01:24.420> me<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.650> us

home and say nobody touched me so for us

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.859 
home and say nobody touched me so for us
it<00:01:25.920> was<00:01:25.950> also<00:01:26.280> research<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.119> touching

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it was also research for this touching

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.380 
it was also research for this touching
what<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.380> touching<00:01:29.250> each<00:01:29.579> other<00:01:29.790> how<00:01:30.000> people

to<00:01:32.780> affection<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.740> love<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.500> research<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to affection or love so so we research a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.910 
to affection or love so so we research a
lot<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:39.000> things<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:40.200> came<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.650> kind

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
lot of these things and we came to kind

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.690 
lot of these things and we came to kind
of<00:01:41.009> repetitive

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of repetitive

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.480

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
lot of things we didn't know and because

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.920 
lot of things we didn't know and because
of<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:57.020> had<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.470> very<00:01:57.890> rough<00:01:58.369> structure<00:01:59.060> we

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
of this it had a very rough structure we

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.930 
of this it had a very rough structure we
had<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.200> organize<00:02:00.650> things<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:01.040> had<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.340> invent

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
had to organize things we had to invent

the<00:02:02.150> kind<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.720> language<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.440> like<00:02:03.520> we<00:02:04.520> have

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
the kind of language it's like we have

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.510 
the kind of language it's like we have
these<00:02:04.820> dances<00:02:05.360> between<00:02:05.750> men<00:02:06.710> women<00:02:07.100> where

these dances between men women where

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.240 
these dances between men women where
it's<00:02:07.820> based<00:02:08.209> on<00:02:08.390> attraction<00:02:08.989> repulsion<00:02:09.619> which

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
it's based on attraction repulsion which

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.120 
it's based on attraction repulsion which
is<00:02:10.429> very<00:02:10.610> close<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:11.120> tangle<00:02:11.770> but<00:02:12.770> of<00:02:12.890> course

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
is very close to a tangle but of course

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.300 
is very close to a tangle but of course
we<00:02:13.280> were<00:02:13.489> 23<00:02:14.270> years<00:02:14.420> old<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:15.260> said<00:02:15.500> if<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.040> want

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
direct but it goes fine and we have to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.380 
direct but it goes fine and we have to
invent<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:44.060> calls<00:02:44.690> what<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.680> did<00:02:45.890> and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
invent this calls what we did and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.120 
invent this calls what we did and
because<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.660> we<00:02:48.019> created<00:02:48.920> something

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
because of this we created something

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.570 
because of this we created something
which<00:02:49.370> was<00:02:49.550> new<00:02:49.900> like<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.140> when<00:02:51.580> sometimes

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
when you have to do something that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.670 
when you have to do something that

brick<00:04:16.790> it<00:04:17.299> goes<00:04:17.600> fast<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.769> slows<00:04:19.100> down<00:04:19.430> it

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
brick it goes fast and it slows down it
