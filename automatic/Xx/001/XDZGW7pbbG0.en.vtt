00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
don't have to search you don't have to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.339 
don't have to search you don't have to
like<00:01:41.549> go<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> link<00:01:43.110> there

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
like go around you have the link there

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.469 
like go around you have the link there

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
so you have a ten-second head start in

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510 
so you have a ten-second head start in
front<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.780> everyone<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
use that extra time wisely so in the ten

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.479 
use that extra time wisely so in the ten
seconds<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.840> should<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.799> an<00:01:52.950> account<00:01:53.159> set

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.489
