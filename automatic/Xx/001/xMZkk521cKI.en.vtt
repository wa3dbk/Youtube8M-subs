don't<00:00:38.879> how<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> explain<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.450> exactly<00:00:39.629> but

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
don't how to explain it exactly but

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.250 
don't how to explain it exactly but
there's<00:00:40.559> there's<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> certain<00:00:41.399> point<00:00:42.030> where

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
there's there's a certain point where

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.690 
there's there's a certain point where
fabrication<00:00:43.260> becomes<00:00:43.620> art<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.430> me<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.550> think

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
fabrication becomes art for me I think

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.369 
fabrication becomes art for me I think
you<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.120> there's<00:00:45.539> always<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.870> continual

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you know there's always this continual

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.720 
you know there's always this continual
search<00:00:46.559> being<00:00:46.860> an<00:00:46.980> artist<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.430> finding

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
search being an artist to finding

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760 
search being an artist to finding
something<00:00:47.879> beautiful<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.600> think<00:00:48.690> welding<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
something beautiful I think welding and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
something beautiful I think welding and
plasma<00:00:50.340> cutting<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> fabricating

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
plasma cutting and that fabricating

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
plasma cutting and that fabricating
aspect<00:00:52.160> maybe<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.520> way<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
aspect maybe it's not that way for

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.819 
aspect maybe it's not that way for
everybody<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.020> me<00:00:55.140> an<00:00:55.320> aspect<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
everybody but it is for me an aspect of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.380 
everybody but it is for me an aspect of
just<00:00:56.039> sort<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.370> seeking<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> beautiful

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
just sort of seeking out the beautiful

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
just sort of seeking out the beautiful
and<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> creating<00:00:58.500> something<00:00:58.739> that's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and and creating something that's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.189 
and and creating something that's
beautiful<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> tool<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
beautiful it's a tool to do that in the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.720 
beautiful it's a tool to do that in the
world<00:01:01.410> there's<00:01:01.770> many<00:01:02.219> people<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.579> will

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
world there's many people that will

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.910 
world there's many people that will
create<00:01:03.359> hard<00:01:03.660> lines<00:01:03.840> between<00:01:04.080> craft<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.799> art

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
create hard lines between craft and art

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.620 
create hard lines between craft and art
format<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.670> me<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.090> blur<00:01:06.390> lines

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
format for me they really blur lines

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.910 
format for me they really blur lines
