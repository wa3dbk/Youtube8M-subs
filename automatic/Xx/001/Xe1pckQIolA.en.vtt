00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.279 
opposed to an open body roll which looks
like<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.639> so<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.059> see<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:16.109> really

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
start off with the ball on the back of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.770 
start off with the ball on the back of
our<00:00:31.320> hand<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.769> our<00:00:32.070> crane<00:00:32.279> now<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> get<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
our hand in our crane now to get the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.389 
our hand in our crane now to get the
ball<00:00:33.930> moving<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.469> opposed<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:34.980> giving<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
ball moving as opposed to just giving it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.250 
ball moving as opposed to just giving it
a<00:00:35.520> flick<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.910> your<00:00:35.940> wrist<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.719> could<00:00:37.050> do

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
a flick of your wrist which you could do

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
a flick of your wrist which you could do
but<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.340> harder<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> control

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
but it's a little harder to control

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060 
but it's a little harder to control
you're<00:00:39.780> actually<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> move<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.890> arm

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
you're actually going to move your arm

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.139 
you're actually going to move your arm
forward<00:00:41.820> underneath<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.820> other<00:00:44.820> thing

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
forward underneath it and other thing

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.850 
forward underneath it and other thing
I'm<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> say<00:00:45.660> before<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.559> too<00:00:46.620> much

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
I'm going to say before we go too much

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
I'm going to say before we go too much
farther<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.210> rest<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.660> body<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
farther is that the rest of your body is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.690 
farther is that the rest of your body is
going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.070> shift<00:00:50.129> its<00:00:50.489> weight

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
going to have to shift its weight

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
going to have to shift its weight
especially<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:51.629> learning<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> if

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
especially when you're learning so if

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
especially when you're learning so if
you<00:00:53.129> find<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.059> move<00:00:54.629> your

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you find that you have to like move your

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.170 
you find that you have to like move your
back<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.440> your<00:00:55.559> hips<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> stuff<00:00:56.250> that's<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
back and your hips and stuff that's just

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.799 
back and your hips and stuff that's just
fine

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
fine

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.439 
fine
do<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> actually<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> learn<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.210> way

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
do it actually if you learn that way

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.029 
do it actually if you learn that way
then<00:01:00.750> you're<00:01:00.899> gonna<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.260> more<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.620> fluid

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
then you're gonna be more like fluid

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
then you're gonna be more like fluid
with<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> later<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> it'll<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> lot<00:01:03.600> easier

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
with it later and it'll be a lot easier

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.690 
with it later and it'll be a lot easier

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the back of our hand and moving forward

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.260 
the back of our hand and moving forward
underneath<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:18.680> excellent<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.000> tough

everybody's different are the shoulders
so<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:28.950> arms<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.340> up

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
like this I like to keep a nice solid

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
like this I like to keep a nice solid
frame<00:01:31.560> unless<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.220> getting<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:32.549> floaty<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
frame unless I'm getting all floaty and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
frame unless I'm getting all floaty and
dancing<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.509> we're<00:01:33.780> learning<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.290> let's<00:01:34.590> not

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
dancing but we're learning so let's not

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.660 
dancing but we're learning so let's not
get<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.040> yet<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:37.040> keeping<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.159> nice<00:01:38.280> solid

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
get there yet so keeping a nice solid

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.219 
get there yet so keeping a nice solid
frame<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.600> important<00:01:40.049> especially

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
frame is really important especially

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.050 
frame is really important especially
with<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> shoulders<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.640> ball<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.909> going

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
with the shoulders so your ball is going

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
with the shoulders so your ball is going
to<00:01:42.119> come<00:01:42.270> along<00:01:42.360> here<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> drop<00:01:43.710> your

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740

to come along here if you drop your
elbow<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.520> gonna<00:01:45.000> fall<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.570> well<00:01:46.560> that's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
elbow it's gonna fall and well that's
