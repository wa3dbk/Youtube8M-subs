initiative okay anyways we're gonna get

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.609 
initiative okay anyways we're gonna get
back<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> point<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.960> first<00:01:49.170> box<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
back to the point so the first box the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.219 
back to the point so the first box the
48<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:51.829> um<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.360> got<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.720> three<00:01:54.930> tiers

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
48 is um the it's got like three tiers

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.499 
48 is um the it's got like three tiers
obviously<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.820> 48<00:01:57.390> packs<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:59.509> so

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
obviously is all the 48 packs do and so

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.929 
obviously is all the 48 packs do and so
each<00:02:00.780> from<00:02:01.020> their<00:02:01.200> separate<00:02:01.469> boxes<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.670> this

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
each from their separate boxes so this

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.789 
each from their separate boxes so this
one<00:02:03.090> has<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.899> colors<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.590> guess

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
one has like the colors that I guess

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.609 
one has like the colors that I guess
