00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
autonomy I feel like this movie is the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.530 
autonomy I feel like this movie is the
quintessential<00:02:17.740> example<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.340> how<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.490> go<00:02:18.880> from

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
quintessential example of how we go from

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.740 
quintessential example of how we go from
a<00:02:19.780> more<00:02:20.080> grounded<00:02:20.890> story<00:02:21.220> two<00:02:21.489> more<00:02:22.120> spectacle

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
a more grounded story two more spectacle

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.420 
a more grounded story two more spectacle
and<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.170> feel<00:02:23.320> like<00:02:23.350> Zack<00:02:23.650> Snyder<00:02:23.950> that's<00:02:24.310> what

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
and I feel like Zack Snyder that's what

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.310 
and I feel like Zack Snyder that's what
we<00:02:24.519> know<00:02:24.700> him<00:02:24.880> for<00:02:25.060> nowadays<00:02:25.239> whereas<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.170> feel

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
we know him for nowadays whereas I feel

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.780 
we know him for nowadays whereas I feel
like<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> dawn<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.890> dead.the<00:02:27.130> Romero

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
Dawn of the Dead it was really about the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.540 
Dawn of the Dead it was really about the
characters<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.920> was<00:02:30.010> really<00:02:30.220> about<00:02:30.370> getting

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
characters it was really about getting

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.220 
characters it was really about getting
in<00:02:30.760> depth<00:02:31.030> with<00:02:31.300> these<00:02:31.660> people<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:31.989> are

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
in depth with these people that are

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.690
