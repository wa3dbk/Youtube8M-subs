conditions that I concoction the dosage
of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> medication<00:01:15.869> how<00:01:16.080> much<00:01:16.259> more<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:17.250> about

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
of the medication how much more is about

two<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.540> half<00:01:18.570> times<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:20.270> effective<00:01:21.270> than

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
two and a half times more effective than

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.770 
two and a half times more effective than
it<00:01:21.780> was<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.950> sense<00:01:23.189> he<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.360> time

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it was make sense he have more on time

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
it was make sense he have more on time
with<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.350> were<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.159> don't<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.640> time

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
right now so my surprise in our research

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
right now so my surprise in our research
we<00:01:41.250> found<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> there<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> common<00:01:43.079> problem

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.219 
we found that there was a common problem
with<00:01:43.560> parts<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.130> patients<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.720> would

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
with parts and patients and it would

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.100 
with parts and patients and it would
reach<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.590> point<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.220> where<00:01:47.430> literally<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150
