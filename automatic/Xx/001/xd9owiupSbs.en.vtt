00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.129
 2 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.129
 This is 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.679
 the money did not always exist 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.549
 In the early days of humanity, one has very different things of importance 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.269
 the value-oriented at the benefit for humans 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.640
 exchange first items and trade 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 Money today is useful as a medium of exchange 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.270
 as long as each family needs their own Becht 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.570
 So all solid that they needed from here cultivated or hunting 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.030
 All animals buy commodities such as clothing or tableware 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.370
 made by the members of the family themselves and transferred to the Bahamas 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.140
 where she lives is built by herself 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.780
 there is no need to trade or trade for so long 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.200
 called this kind of economizing with closed housekeeping 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 money is not needed in it 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.710
 on 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.540
 he threefold one 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 is best and not so what should that be 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.550
 the Aachener 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.550
 pretty absurd but that's an old story 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.460
 a reason to trade or trade 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 may be the shortage of a good sign 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.400
 For example, a family can diligence their needs and do not want 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.340
 be valid 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.840
 because the herd of flocks of the family often attacked by wolves 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.280
 has been 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.100
 so the family is forced 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 to meet this need in other ways 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.180
 she has to exchange other excess kyte in this case 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.670
 In the same year, for example, the grain harvest is particularly good 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.380
 The family can try the surplus grain on others 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.380
 Swapping families for the meat needed 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.799
 Franconia 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.059
 with the transformation of society into village communities 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.209
 this type of bartering continued to form one 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.209
 so-called natural or barter economy 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.789
 Money space is not necessary here 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.429
 but with the advancement of the craft of transport and in 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.859
 Linking with ever more efficient management methods 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.069
 The requirements for the properties of the exchanged can increase
