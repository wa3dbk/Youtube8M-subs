hey<00:00:02.040> guys<00:00:02.280> so<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> quick<00:00:03.120> update<00:00:03.270> on

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hey guys so this is a quick update on

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.780 
hey guys so this is a quick update on
the<00:00:04.020> agenda<00:00:04.380> one<00:00:04.680> that<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:04.950> swapped<00:00:05.490> with<00:00:05.700> the

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
the agenda one that I swapped with the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.589 
the agenda one that I swapped with the
microti<00:00:06.240> board<00:00:06.509> so<00:00:07.440> as<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.859> can<00:00:07.980> see<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.599> has

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
microti board so as you can see here has

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.110 
microti board so as you can see here has
talked<00:00:09.929> about<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> video<00:00:10.730> to<00:00:11.730> fit<00:00:11.910> some

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
talked about in the video to fit some

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.440 
talked about in the video to fit some
more<00:00:12.269> bodies<00:00:12.889> you<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.280> move<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.210> board

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
more bodies you can just move the board

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.980 
more bodies you can just move the board
from<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> sideways<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.100> up<00:00:17.160> top<00:00:17.690> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.810> see

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
from the sideways to up top you can see

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.779 
from the sideways to up top you can see
that<00:00:19.020> my<00:00:19.230> connections<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:20.609> bit

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
that my connections are a little bit

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.160 
that my connections are a little bit
different<00:00:21.119> now<00:00:21.150> because<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> had<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.810> move<00:00:21.960> it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
different now because I had to move it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.009 
different now because I had to move it
around<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.830> everything<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> does<00:00:24.810> look<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
around and everything so it does look a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
around and everything so it does look a
little<00:00:25.260> bit<00:00:25.410> cleaner<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.010> center<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.580> gravity

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
little bit cleaner the center of gravity

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.689 
little bit cleaner the center of gravity
is<00:00:27.060> definitely<00:00:27.539> higher<00:00:27.859> as<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.609> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
is definitely higher as you can see it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.640 
is definitely higher as you can see it
like<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
like that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.530 
like that
so<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.640> race<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.480> do

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
so if you do like race with it I do

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.799 
so if you do like race with it I do
recommend<00:00:33.960> keeping<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:35.000> parallel<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> or

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
recommend keeping it parallel to it or

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
recommend keeping it parallel to it or
perpendicular<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.920> chassis<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> like

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
perpendicular to a chassis if you like

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.510 
perpendicular to a chassis if you like
race<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.540> use<00:00:40.170> rubber<00:00:40.379> tires<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.129> you'll

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
race it and use rubber tires this you'll

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.160 
race it and use rubber tires this you'll
be<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.850> lot<00:00:42.059> more<00:00:42.210> prone<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> flipping<00:00:43.020> if

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
be a lot more prone to flipping if

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
be a lot more prone to flipping if
you're<00:00:43.320> using<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.800> way<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> does<00:00:45.270> fit

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
you're using this way but it does fit

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.750 
you're using this way but it does fit
and<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.980> working<00:00:47.190> great<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and you know it's working great it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.160 
and you know it's working great it
drifts<00:00:48.120> amazing<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:50.390> what's<00:00:51.390> funny<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.930> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
drifts amazing and what's funny is so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.930 
drifts amazing and what's funny is so
this<00:00:52.350> actually<00:00:52.920> isn't<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> board<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> used<00:00:53.820> in

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this actually isn't the board I used in

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.090 
this actually isn't the board I used in
the<00:00:54.030> tutorial<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.920> right

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the tutorial because that one is right

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
the tutorial because that one is right
here<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:57.870> happened<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:59.489> tried<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.750> do

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
here so what happened was I tried to do

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
here so what happened was I tried to do
I<00:01:01.469> tried<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> move<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> board<00:01:02.789> round<00:01:03.030> like

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
I tried to move the board round like

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.350 
I tried to move the board round like
this<00:01:03.510> after<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.530> done<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.430> wanted

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
this after I was done because I wanted

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.660 
this after I was done because I wanted
to<00:01:06.420> fit<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.810> 370z<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.310> found<00:01:08.549> out

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to fit my 370z and which I found out

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.609 
to fit my 370z and which I found out
even<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> plexus<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.840> 370z

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
even when it's the plexus the 370z

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.820 
even when it's the plexus the 370z
doesn't<00:01:11.189> fit<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.150> no<00:01:12.900> matter<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.200> hard<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.650> try

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
doesn't fit so no matter how hard I try

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.200 
doesn't fit so no matter how hard I try
I<00:01:13.860> couldn't<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.430> use<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> body<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
I couldn't get to use that body on the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.380 
I couldn't get to use that body on the
gen1<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.400> like<00:01:17.400> well<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.030> mod<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
gen1 so I was like well was this mod I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.700 
gen1 so I was like well was this mod I
mean<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.350> general<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:21.229> what<00:01:22.229> ended<00:01:22.590> up

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
mean on a general and so what ended up

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.609 
mean on a general and so what ended up
happening<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> board<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.470> used

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
happening was this is the board I used

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.580 
happening was this is the board I used
in<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> tutorial<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.869> underside<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
in a tutorial so on the underside you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.170 
in a tutorial so on the underside you
can<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> rest<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> board<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.970> pretty

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
can see the rest of the board is pretty

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.440 
can see the rest of the board is pretty
much<00:01:30.270> unprotected<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.880> what<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> did<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
much unprotected and what I did was I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.800 
much unprotected and what I did was I
place<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.049> top<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> motor<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.299> now<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
place it on top of the motor and now I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
place it on top of the motor and now I
have<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> kind<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
have now that I know see how I kind of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.399 
have now that I know see how I kind of
protected<00:01:39.360> those<00:01:39.509> motor<00:01:39.840> LEDs

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
protected those motor LEDs

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.880 
protected those motor LEDs
Asya<00:01:41.270> solder<00:01:42.270> joints<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.899> motor<00:01:43.229> with

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
Asya solder joints on the motor with

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.710 
Asya solder joints on the motor with
some<00:01:44.070> double<00:01:44.310> side<00:01:44.460> stick<00:01:44.729> tape<00:01:44.939> well<00:01:45.659> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
some double side stick tape well I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.170 
some double side stick tape well I
didn't<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.470> first<00:01:46.649> time<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.909> here's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
didn't do that the first time so here's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.840 
didn't do that the first time so here's
a<00:01:48.240> Gen<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.869> an<00:01:49.020> example<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.799> placed<00:01:50.700> it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
a Gen one as an example I placed it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.670 
a Gen one as an example I placed it
right<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.090> top<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.720> gassed<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.530> it

only<00:03:33.290> five<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.829> can<00:03:33.950> drift<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:34.700> in<00:03:35.329> the

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
only five that can drift so in the

future I hope that I can put together a

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.699 
future I hope that I can put together a
pretty<00:03:38.480> sweet<00:03:38.690> drift<00:03:38.989> video<00:03:39.260> now<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.440> have<00:03:39.680> a
