what<00:00:17.240> foods<00:00:17.960> are<00:00:18.169> available<00:00:18.589> now<00:00:18.619> with

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
what foods are available now with

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.200 
what foods are available now with
omega-3<00:00:19.429> I<00:00:19.460> think<00:00:19.730> we're<00:00:19.880> starting<00:00:20.000> to

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
omega-3 I think we're starting to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.849 
omega-3 I think we're starting to
realize<00:00:20.509> that<00:00:20.660> we<00:00:20.779> need<00:00:20.929> to<00:00:20.960> be<00:00:21.140> taken<00:00:21.410> omega-3

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
realize that we need to be taken omega-3

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.499 
realize that we need to be taken omega-3
on<00:00:21.919> a<00:00:22.009> regular<00:00:22.160> basis<00:00:22.580> absolutely<00:00:23.119> it's<00:00:23.240> great

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
on a regular basis absolutely it's great

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.390 
on a regular basis absolutely it's great
people<00:00:23.900> are<00:00:23.960> educated<00:00:24.079> and<00:00:24.710> as<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.189> result

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
people are educated and as a result

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.249 
people are educated and as a result
companies<00:00:26.119> are<00:00:26.240> starting<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:26.539> put<00:00:26.660> Omega<00:00:26.869> 3s

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
companies are starting to put Omega 3s

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.259 
companies are starting to put Omega 3s
and<00:00:27.470> many<00:00:28.070> different<00:00:28.490> foods<00:00:28.699> I<00:00:28.909> mean<00:00:29.060> you<00:00:29.150> have

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
and many different foods I mean you have

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.409 
and many different foods I mean you have
cookies<00:00:29.720> even<00:00:30.710> eggs<00:00:30.919> now<00:00:31.249> even<00:00:31.939> peanut<00:00:32.270> butter

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
cookies even eggs now even peanut butter

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.060 
cookies even eggs now even peanut butter
which<00:00:32.630> is<00:00:32.810> really<00:00:33.020> interesting<00:00:33.590> twist<00:00:33.890> is

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
which is really interesting twist is

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.380 
which is really interesting twist is
that<00:00:34.100> they're<00:00:34.310> putting<00:00:34.550> omega-3<00:00:35.060> now<00:00:35.180> and

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
that they're putting omega-3 now and

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.910 
that they're putting omega-3 now and
butter<00:00:35.600> it's<00:00:35.990> not<00:00:36.140> good<00:00:36.410> if<00:00:36.710> they<00:00:36.860> were

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
butter it's not good if they were

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.210 
butter it's not good if they were
putting<00:00:37.420> fish<00:00:38.420> derived<00:00:38.900> omega-3<00:00:39.650> it<00:00:39.950> would<00:00:40.070> be

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
putting fish derived omega-3 it would be

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.040 
putting fish derived omega-3 it would be
good<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.030> all<00:00:41.240> the<00:00:41.330> only<00:00:41.540> question<00:00:41.930> is

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
good and all the only question is

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.200 
good and all the only question is
absolutely<00:00:42.650> get<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:43.010> put<00:00:43.190> in<00:00:43.310> that<00:00:43.520> because

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
absolutely get to put in that because

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.120 
absolutely get to put in that because
that's<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.780> other<00:00:44.900> issue<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:45.710> know<00:00:45.830> to<00:00:45.890> get<00:00:46.100> a

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
that's the other issue you know to get a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.460 
that's the other issue you know to get a
meaningful<00:00:46.550> dose<00:00:46.910> of<00:00:47.150> this<00:00:47.300> exactly<00:00:47.810> to<00:00:48.140> just

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
meaningful dose of this exactly to just

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.350 
meaningful dose of this exactly to just
say<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:48.830> contains<00:00:49.220> omega-3<00:00:49.400> it<00:00:49.970> might<00:00:50.150> have

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
say it contains omega-3 it might have

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.730 
say it contains omega-3 it might have
like<00:00:50.630> you<00:00:50.780> know<00:00:50.840> what<00:00:51.140> an<00:00:51.320> eighth<00:00:51.470> of<00:00:51.620> a

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
like you know what an eighth of a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.100 
like you know what an eighth of a
grandma<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.340> not<00:00:52.490> exactly<00:00:53.390> when<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:53.870> need<00:00:53.900> at

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
grandma is not exactly when you need at

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.560 
grandma is not exactly when you need at
least<00:00:54.170> 1.2<00:00:54.770> grams<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.520> really<00:00:55.760> do<00:00:56.270> something

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
least 1.2 grams to really do something

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.090 
least 1.2 grams to really do something
for<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.020> that's<00:00:57.080> going<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.410> be<00:00:57.500> beneficial

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
for you that's going to be beneficial

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.740 
for you that's going to be beneficial
but<00:00:58.280> what<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.880> lot<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.090> these<00:00:59.270> companies<00:00:59.540> are

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
but what a lot of these companies are

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.150 
but what a lot of these companies are
starting<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.110> do<00:01:00.260> John<00:01:00.500> is<00:01:00.650> they<00:01:00.800> put<00:01:01.040> the

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
starting to do John is they put the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.410 
starting to do John is they put the
flaxseed<00:01:01.700> in<00:01:01.850> there<00:01:01.970> because<00:01:02.060> it<00:01:02.240> really

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
flaxseed in there because it really

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.259 
flaxseed in there because it really
doesn't<00:01:02.780> have<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.080> bad<00:01:03.350> fishy<00:01:03.800> taste<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.670> so

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
doesn't have that bad fishy taste and so

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.419 
doesn't have that bad fishy taste and so
that<00:01:05.449> is<00:01:05.630> quote<00:01:06.259> unquote<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.859> source<00:01:07.280> of

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:07.429 
that is quote unquote a source of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:09.489 
that is quote unquote a source of
omega-3<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.329> I'm<00:01:08.780> really<00:01:09.020> excited<00:01:09.289> that

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
omega-3 and I'm really excited that

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.529 
omega-3 and I'm really excited that
we're<00:01:09.649> talking<00:01:09.829> about<00:01:10.100> this<00:01:10.369> because<00:01:10.579> a<00:01:11.119> lot

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
we're talking about this because a lot

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:12.520 
we're talking about this because a lot
of<00:01:11.570> people<00:01:11.899> out<00:01:11.960> there<00:01:12.140> saying<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.409> know<00:01:12.499> I'm

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
of people out there saying you know I'm

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.980 
of people out there saying you know I'm
taking<00:01:12.979> flaxseed<00:01:13.520> oil<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.210> if<00:01:14.630> they<00:01:14.749> could<00:01:14.899> oh

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
taking flaxseed oil and if they could oh

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.230 
taking flaxseed oil and if they could oh
I'm<00:01:15.109> getting<00:01:15.289> omega-3<00:01:15.740> on<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.009> daily<00:01:16.189> basis<00:01:16.700> and

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
I'm getting omega-3 on a daily basis and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.580 
I'm getting omega-3 on a daily basis and
it's<00:01:17.359> very<00:01:17.420> unfortunate<00:01:17.929> because<00:01:18.289> what

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
it's very unfortunate because what

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.319 
it's very unfortunate because what
they're<00:01:18.710> getting<00:01:19.159> is<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.759> type<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.060> omega-3

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
they're getting is the type of omega-3

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.450 
they're getting is the type of omega-3
that<00:01:20.990> don't<00:01:21.200> necessarily<00:01:21.380> give<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
that don't necessarily give you the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.120 
that don't necessarily give you the
benefits<00:01:23.090> that<00:01:23.689> we<00:01:23.929> know<00:01:24.229> as<00:01:24.469> a<00:01:24.499> mega<00:01:24.799> three

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
benefits that we know as a mega three

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.069 
benefits that we know as a mega three
they're<00:01:25.670> basically<00:01:25.819> three<00:01:26.509> sources<00:01:26.960> of

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
they're basically three sources of

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.010 
they're basically three sources of
omega-3<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:28.280> have<00:01:28.399> EPA<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.179> DHA<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.869> give

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
omega-3 you have EPA and DHA that give

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.330 
omega-3 you have EPA and DHA that give
you<00:01:30.109> the<00:01:30.139> beneficial<00:01:30.740> effects<00:01:31.100> such<00:01:31.310> as

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
you the beneficial effects such as

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.370 
you the beneficial effects such as

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.919 
to gives you beneficial effects and the
problem<00:01:48.200> with<00:01:48.740> flaxseed<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.579> as<00:01:50.359> we<00:01:50.539> get<00:01:50.749> older

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
problem with flaxseed is as we get older

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.349 
problem with flaxseed is as we get older
our<00:01:51.409> ability<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.130> do<00:01:52.219> that<00:01:52.399> becomes<00:01:52.789> inhibited

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
our ability to do that becomes inhibited

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:54.699 
our ability to do that becomes inhibited
but<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.509> think<00:01:53.689> what<00:01:53.780> you're<00:01:53.959> saying<00:01:54.259> is<00:01:54.499> that

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
but I think what you're saying is that

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.519 
but I think what you're saying is that
we<00:01:54.859> really<00:01:55.280> need<00:01:55.609> a<00:01:55.939> reliable<00:01:56.749> source<00:01:57.259> of

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:57.529 
we really need a reliable source of

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:59.429 
we really need a reliable source of
these<00:01:57.920> fatty<00:01:58.429> acids<00:01:58.969> that<00:01:59.060> have<00:01:59.209> found

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
these fatty acids that have found

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
preformed in fish right as we can't rely

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.690

on our body always making the amount

on our body always making the amount
that<00:02:04.939> we<00:02:05.060> would<00:02:05.209> need<00:02:05.509> just<00:02:06.109> from<00:02:06.289> flaxseed

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
that we would need just from flaxseed

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.830 
that we would need just from flaxseed
exactly<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:07.639> we<00:02:07.850> need<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.240> make<00:02:08.420> sure<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.600> if

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
exactly so we need to make sure that if

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.869 
exactly so we need to make sure that if
we're<00:02:08.959> taking<00:02:09.409> an<00:02:09.500> omega-3<00:02:09.830> supplement<00:02:10.429> the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
planet in order to be good fish don't

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.860

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
have passport a mega three is omega-3

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.140 
have passport a mega three is omega-3
absolute<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.710> mega<00:03:06.950> three<00:03:07.310> correct<00:03:07.580> okay

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
absolute is a mega three correct okay

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.710 
absolute is a mega three correct okay
and<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.260> other<00:03:09.440> sources<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.130> we<00:03:10.310> can<00:03:10.460> get

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
and so the other sources that we can get

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.370 
and so the other sources that we can get
omega-3<00:03:11.720> from<00:03:12.050> are<00:03:12.940> your<00:03:13.940> sardines<00:03:14.900> now<00:03:15.320> we

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
omega-3 from are your sardines now we

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.280 
omega-3 from are your sardines now we
had<00:03:15.650> these<00:03:15.800> covered<00:03:16.250> because<00:03:16.720> basically<00:03:17.720> we

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
had these covered because basically we

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.199 
had these covered because basically we
have<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.620> little<00:03:19.100> bit<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.280> an<00:03:19.400> older<00:03:19.670> they<00:03:19.910> have

yeah many things I've told people about
sardines<00:03:27.890> for<00:03:28.220> years<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:28.610> hear<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:28.850> lot<00:03:28.910> of

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
sardines for years and I hear a lot of

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.580 
sardines for years and I hear a lot of
people<00:03:29.360> say<00:03:29.510> that's<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.900> lot<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.200> people<00:03:30.470> like

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
people say that's a lot of people like

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.500 
people say that's a lot of people like
them<00:03:30.800> I<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.010> them<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.520> lot<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.060> people<00:03:32.180> say

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
them I like them a lot of people say

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.410 
them I like them a lot of people say
sardines<00:03:33.260> no<00:03:33.740> way<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.790> know<00:03:34.910> we<00:03:35.120> can't

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
sardines no way so you know we can't

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.390 
sardines no way so you know we can't
really<00:03:35.810> count<00:03:36.020> on<00:03:36.260> most<00:03:36.530> people<00:03:36.890> getting<00:03:37.220> the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
really count on most people getting the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.550 
really count on most people getting the
amount<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.880> omega-3s<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.810> they<00:03:38.959> need<00:03:39.290> for

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
amount of omega-3s that they need for

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.280 
amount of omega-3s that they need for
real<00:03:40.160> health<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:40.730> Prevention<00:03:41.240> just<00:03:41.900> from

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
real health and Prevention just from

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.280 
real health and Prevention just from
fish<00:03:43.010> just<00:03:43.400> not<00:03:43.580> doing<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:44.000> instead<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.660> taking

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
fish just not doing it instead of taking

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.100 
fish just not doing it instead of taking
fish<00:03:45.530> on<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.709> daily<00:03:45.980> basis<00:03:46.550> hmmm<00:03:47.000> what<00:03:47.810> people

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
fish on a daily basis hmmm what people

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.420 
fish on a daily basis hmmm what people
never<00:03:48.290> wrong<00:03:48.590> with<00:03:48.740> them<00:03:48.890> it's<00:03:49.070> not<00:03:49.130> most

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
never wrong with them it's not most

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.370 
never wrong with them it's not most
people<00:03:49.760> aren't<00:03:49.880> doing<00:03:50.120> it's<00:03:50.420> it's<00:03:50.690> great<00:03:51.110> but

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
people aren't doing it's it's great but

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.080 
people aren't doing it's it's great but
who's<00:03:51.560> gonna<00:03:51.680> do<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.459> know<00:03:52.550> I<00:03:52.580> mean<00:03:52.880> try

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
who's gonna do it you know I mean try

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.390 
who's gonna do it you know I mean try
with<00:03:53.420> kids<00:03:53.780> or<00:03:54.080> even<00:03:54.260> adults<00:03:54.890> getting<00:03:55.250> on<00:03:55.340> a

with kids or even adults getting on a
daily<00:03:55.580> basis<00:03:56.000> it's<00:03:56.180> not<00:03:56.360> necessarily

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
daily basis it's not necessarily

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.960 
daily basis it's not necessarily
practical<00:03:57.740> for<00:03:57.920> some<00:03:58.100> people<00:03:58.459> whether<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.850> be

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
practical for some people whether it be

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.360 
practical for some people whether it be
taste<00:03:59.270> or<00:03:59.630> you<00:04:00.080> know<00:04:00.200> price<00:04:00.890> if<00:04:01.130> they're<00:04:01.250> going

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
taste or you know price if they're going

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.190 
taste or you know price if they're going
to<00:04:01.430> get<00:04:01.520> wild<00:04:01.700> salmon<00:04:01.940> on<00:04:02.150> daily<00:04:02.330> basis<00:04:02.720> so

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
to get wild salmon on daily basis so

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.290 
to get wild salmon on daily basis so
what<00:04:03.380> do<00:04:03.440> we<00:04:03.500> do<00:04:03.680> we<00:04:03.920> supplement<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.640> there's

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
what do we do we supplement and there's

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.100 
what do we do we supplement and there's
nothing<00:04:05.420> wrong<00:04:05.720> with<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:05.959> the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
nothing wrong with it the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.870 
nothing wrong with it the
supplementation<00:04:06.770> is<00:04:07.070> great<00:04:07.340> because<00:04:07.520> what<00:04:07.760> we

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
supplementation is great because what we

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.750 
supplementation is great because what we
do<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.330> we<00:04:08.720> extract<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.530> omega-3s<00:04:10.310> from<00:04:10.640> the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
do is we extract the omega-3s from the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.850 
do is we extract the omega-3s from the
fish<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.270> we<00:04:11.720> put<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.020> in<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.290> supplement<00:04:12.770> and

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
fish and we put it in a supplement and

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.260 
fish and we put it in a supplement and
we<00:04:12.980> actually<00:04:13.130> filter<00:04:13.580> it<00:04:13.760> as<00:04:13.850> well<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.180> that's

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
we actually filter it as well and that's

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.349 
we actually filter it as well and that's
one<00:04:14.570> of<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.720> other<00:04:14.870> dynamics<00:04:15.800> about<00:04:16.640> having

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
one of the other dynamics about having

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.960 
one of the other dynamics about having
fish<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.410> you<00:04:18.620> have<00:04:18.859> toxins<00:04:19.489> that<00:04:19.700> are<00:04:19.760> in

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
fish is that you have toxins that are in

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.300 
fish is that you have toxins that are in
our<00:04:20.030> ocean<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.169> farm<00:04:21.410> raised<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.130> in

our ocean and in the farm raised and in

that<00:05:30.800> we<00:05:30.919> can<00:05:31.099> absorb<00:05:31.610> it<00:05:31.789> through<00:05:31.820> our<00:05:32.060> system

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
that we can absorb it through our system

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.120 
that we can absorb it through our system
this<00:05:32.479> is<00:05:32.659> part<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.470> digestive<00:05:33.680> process

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
this is part of the digestive process

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.120 
this is part of the digestive process
that's<00:05:35.090> great<00:05:35.449> the<00:05:35.690> only<00:05:35.870> question<00:05:36.050> is<00:05:36.470> how

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
that's great the only question is how

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.480 
that's great the only question is how
effective<00:05:37.849> is<00:05:38.060> your<00:05:38.389> digestive<00:05:39.139> system

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
effective is your digestive system

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.520 
effective is your digestive system
cleaning<00:05:40.490> isolating<00:05:41.479> and<00:05:41.570> breaking<00:05:42.229> down<00:05:42.409> the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
cleaning isolating and breaking down the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.290 
cleaning isolating and breaking down the
triglyceride<00:05:43.190> that<00:05:43.490> is<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.760> question<00:05:43.909> and

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
triglyceride that is the question and

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.770 
triglyceride that is the question and
unfortunately<00:05:45.050> as<00:05:45.260> we<00:05:45.620> get<00:05:45.830> older<00:05:46.070> our

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
unfortunately as we get older our

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.240 
unfortunately as we get older our
digestive<00:05:47.780> system<00:05:48.229> tends<00:05:48.949> to<00:05:49.130> become

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
digestive system tends to become

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.399 
digestive system tends to become
inhibited<00:05:49.970> and<00:05:50.000> it<00:05:50.150> as<00:05:50.270> a<00:05:50.300> result<00:05:50.810> of<00:05:50.990> that<00:05:51.050> our

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
inhibited and it as a result of that our

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.339 
inhibited and it as a result of that our
ability<00:05:52.280> to<00:05:52.310> break<00:05:52.820> down<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:53.349> triglyceride

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
ability to break down the triglyceride

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.969 
ability to break down the triglyceride
becomes<00:05:55.190> inhibited<00:05:55.699> as<00:05:55.820> well<00:05:56.060> and<00:05:56.570> so<00:05:57.050> are<00:05:57.710> we

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
becomes inhibited as well and so are we

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.560 
becomes inhibited as well and so are we
absorbing<00:05:58.729> a<00:05:58.789> hundred<00:05:59.030> percent<00:05:59.300> not

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
absorbing a hundred percent not

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.240 
absorbing a hundred percent not
necessarily<00:06:00.080> so<00:06:00.349> this<00:06:00.530> is<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.770> first<00:06:01.009> source

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
necessarily so this is the first source

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.460 
necessarily so this is the first source
the<00:06:01.400> triglyceride<00:06:02.000> we<00:06:02.630> are<00:06:02.810> body<00:06:03.020> cleaves<00:06:03.349> it

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
the triglyceride we are body cleaves it

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.830 
the triglyceride we are body cleaves it
and<00:06:03.620> as<00:06:03.889> we<00:06:04.099> talked<00:06:04.370> about<00:06:04.580> it<00:06:04.940> promotes<00:06:05.300> heart

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
and as we talked about it promotes heart

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.279
