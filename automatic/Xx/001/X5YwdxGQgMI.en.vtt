this have an immediate impact on his

this have an immediate impact on his
ranking<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.099> wait<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> little

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
bit if we have to wait and see and I

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.030 
bit if we have to wait and see and I
guess<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> probably<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.560> best<00:00:31.769> case

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
guess this is probably the best case

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.310 
guess this is probably the best case
this<00:00:32.369> arian<00:00:32.880> foster<00:00:33.390> even<00:00:33.570> LeSean<00:00:33.840> McCoy<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
this arian foster even LeSean McCoy to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
this arian foster even LeSean McCoy to
some<00:00:34.500> extent<00:00:34.829> why<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.040> don't<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.579> drafts<00:00:35.910> this

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
some extent why you don't do drafts this

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.420 
some extent why you don't do drafts this
early<00:00:36.510> wait<00:00:36.960> till<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.230> close<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.129> season

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
early wait till as close as the season

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.160 
early wait till as close as the season
as<00:00:38.550> possible<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.360> if<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> draft<00:00:39.960> night

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
as possible like if you do a draft night

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
hopefully it's not as serious as it was

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.369 
hopefully it's not as serious as it was

outside my top 25 at receiver I wasn't
high<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.260> him<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.500> thought<00:01:01.620> last<00:01:01.800> year<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
high on him I thought last year was a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
high on him I thought last year was a
bit<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.399> an<00:01:02.460> aberration<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.600> mean<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
bit of an aberration so I mean this is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
bit of an aberration so I mean this is
going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> kill<00:01:04.710> his<00:01:04.890> draft<00:01:05.100> stock<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.580> away

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
going to kill his draft stock right away

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.880 
going to kill his draft stock right away

someone like John from story I think it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
someone like John from story I think it
helps<00:01:55.020> them<00:01:55.170> obviously<00:01:55.500> reception<00:01:56.219> wise<00:01:56.369> Greg

Olson<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.390> much<00:01:57.570> benefited<00:01:58.049> by<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.170> but

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
Olson is very much benefited by this but

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
Olson is very much benefited by this but
you<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.399> they<00:01:59.880> were<00:01:59.939> gonna<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.390> him<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you know if they were gonna use him in

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.389 
you know if they were gonna use him in
the<00:02:00.840> red<00:02:00.990> zone<00:02:01.020> anyway<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.770> feel<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.280> they

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the red zone anyway I feel like they

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.800 
the red zone anyway I feel like they
would<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:02.939> some<00:02:03.119> point<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> don't

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
would have at some point so I don't

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.240 
would have at some point so I don't
think<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.229> oh<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.740> god<00:02:04.920> Kelvin

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
Benjamin said I have to have Greg Olson

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:07.760 
Benjamin said I have to have Greg Olson
I<00:02:07.110> don't<00:02:07.290> think<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.619> those

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I don't think it's one of those

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
I don't think it's one of those
scenarios<00:02:08.459> he<00:02:08.819> stole<00:02:09.000> my<00:02:09.090> number<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.599> tight

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
scenarios he stole my number for tight

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.330 
scenarios he stole my number for tight
end<00:02:10.050> he's<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.410> same<00:02:10.560> level<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.890> Kelsey

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
end he's on that same level with Kelsey

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.949 
end he's on that same level with Kelsey
I<00:02:11.489> mean<00:02:11.760> he<00:02:11.849> overachieved<00:02:12.390> last<00:02:12.629> year<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:12.870> he

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
I mean he overachieved last year if he

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.730 
I mean he overachieved last year if he
put<00:02:13.080> up<00:02:13.140> those<00:02:13.230> same<00:02:13.470> number

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
put up those same number

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.350 
put up those same number
I'd<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.130> very<00:02:14.250> happy<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.880> sure<00:02:15.150> that's

but<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> guess<00:02:43.260> right<00:02:43.440> now<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.010> take

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
but I guess right now you have to take

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.550 
but I guess right now you have to take
punches<00:02:44.400> despite<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.030> injury<00:02:45.450> later<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.410> in

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
punches despite the injury later on in

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.080 
punches despite the injury later on in
drafts<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.920> wouldn't<00:02:47.130> go<00:02:47.220> reaching<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.850> him<00:02:47.970> by

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
drafts I wouldn't go reaching on him by

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.730 
drafts I wouldn't go reaching on him by
any<00:02:48.270> means<00:02:48.570> maybe<00:02:48.780> pile<00:02:49.080> up<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.320> Philly<00:02:49.530> brown

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
any means maybe pile up a Philly brown

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.130 
any means maybe pile up a Philly brown
maybe<00:02:50.460> get<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.910> Jericho<00:02:51.360> khatri<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.960> back

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
maybe get a Jericho khatri on the back

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140 
maybe get a Jericho khatri on the back

games who actually steps into those

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.720 
games who actually steps into those
roles<00:02:58.770> then<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.370> make<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.490> more<00:02:59.700> informed

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730

choice and we'll get into this in the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.290 
choice and we'll get into this in the
second<00:03:01.920> segment<00:03:02.070> as<00:03:02.310> well<00:03:02.490> but<00:03:02.640> all<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.090> that

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
second segment as well but all of that

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.210 
second segment as well but all of that
just<00:03:03.630> how<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.780> erratic<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:04.500> receiving<00:03:05.010> corps

just how we erratic that receiving corps

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.610 
just how we erratic that receiving corps
is<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.610> why<00:03:05.850> Greg<00:03:06.150> Olson<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:06.750> valuable<00:03:07.080> he's

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
is is why Greg Olson is so valuable he's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.140 
is is why Greg Olson is so valuable he's
so<00:03:07.740> safe<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.670> know<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.030> he's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
so safe but you know that he's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.370 
so safe but you know that he's
entrenched<00:03:09.630> as<00:03:09.870> long<00:03:09.960> as<00:03:10.050> he<00:03:10.140> stays<00:03:10.320> healthy

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
entrenched as long as he stays healthy

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.860 
entrenched as long as he stays healthy
at<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.400> point<00:03:11.610> good<00:03:11.850> more<00:03:12.510> notes<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
at this point good more notes the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.180 
at this point good more notes the
Panthers<00:03:13.200> are<00:03:13.290> up<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.530> he<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:13.710> their<00:03:13.920> training

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
staff but he is safe and that is the big

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.260 
staff but he is safe and that is the big
appeal<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.310> Greg<00:03:17.490> Olson<00:03:17.760> he's<00:03:17.850> never<00:03:18.000> gonna<00:03:18.120> be

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
appeal of Greg Olson he's never gonna be

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.730 
appeal of Greg Olson he's never gonna be
the<00:03:18.300> number<00:03:18.540> one<00:03:18.570> tight<00:03:19.020> end<00:03:19.230> he's<00:03:19.560> never

the number one tight end he's never

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.830 
the number one tight end he's never
going<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.980> lead<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.490> tight<00:03:21.390> ends<00:03:21.570> and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
going to lead all tight ends and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.450 
going to lead all tight ends and
touchdowns<00:03:22.350> you'll<00:03:22.830> probably<00:03:23.040> never<00:03:23.190> leave

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
touchdowns you'll probably never leave

them<00:03:23.580> in<00:03:23.670> receptions<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.240> it'll<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.450> up<00:03:24.570> there

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
