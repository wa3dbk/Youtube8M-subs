gonna<00:02:27.870> go<00:02:28.080> do<00:02:28.349> some<00:02:28.530> side<00:02:28.799> comparisons<00:02:29.700> here

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
gonna go do some side comparisons here

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.570 
gonna go do some side comparisons here
coming<00:02:30.330> up<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.739> way<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.920> guys<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.549> a

coming up so that way you guys can get a
better<00:02:32.970> idea<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:35.599> how<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.780> looks<00:02:36.959> from<00:02:37.079> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
better idea of how it looks from the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.400 
better idea of how it looks from the
side<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.010> far<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.060> video<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.750> allowing<00:02:40.290> you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
side so far this video is allowing you

side so far this video is allowing you
guys<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.590> see<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.340> major<00:02:41.700> difference<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.569> the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
guys to see the major difference in the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.970 
guys to see the major difference in the
size<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:42.959> size<00:02:43.349> does<00:02:43.650> make<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> difference

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
size and size does make a difference

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.559 
size and size does make a difference
with<00:02:44.970> these<00:02:45.090> particular<00:02:45.390> laptops<00:02:47.150> with<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> 17

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
with these particular laptops with a 17

with these particular laptops with a 17
inch<00:02:48.750> um<00:02:49.049> it's<00:02:49.799> more<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.579> more<00:02:50.819> powerful<00:02:51.030> of

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
inch um it's more it's more powerful of

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.880 
inch um it's more it's more powerful of
course<00:02:51.870> there's<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.079> new<00:02:52.260> model<00:02:52.650> but<00:02:52.739> it's<00:02:52.859> a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
course there's a new model but it's a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.550 
course there's a new model but it's a
lot<00:02:53.069> more<00:02:53.220> powerful<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.690> lot<00:02:54.720> bigger<00:02:55.319> as

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
lot more powerful and a lot bigger as

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.789 
lot more powerful and a lot bigger as
you<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.829> see<00:02:56.930> here's<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.140> side<00:02:58.380> angles

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
you can see here's for the side angles

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.770 
you can see here's for the side angles
talking<00:02:59.160> about<00:02:59.370> coming<00:02:59.609> up

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.300 

big<00:03:05.350> comparison<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.900> still<00:03:08.200> powerful<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
big comparison but still powerful the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.210 
big comparison but still powerful the
important<00:03:09.700> X<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:09.970> still<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.330> great<00:03:10.690> machine

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
important X is still a great machine
