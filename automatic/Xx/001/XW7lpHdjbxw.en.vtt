so when we go to stir-fry it we just

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.100 
so when we go to stir-fry it we just
want<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> brown<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> pick<00:00:39.690> some<00:00:39.870> about

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.190 
want to brown it up to pick some about
olive<00:00:40.379> oil<00:00:42.770> put<00:00:43.770> them<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.129> hot<00:00:44.340> skillet

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
olive oil put them in my hot skillet

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.100 
olive oil put them in my hot skillet
about<00:00:46.200> half<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.489> maybe<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.570> quarter<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
about half so maybe about a quarter of a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.420 
about half so maybe about a quarter of a
cup<00:00:49.760> place<00:00:50.760> our<00:00:50.940> onions<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.420> there
