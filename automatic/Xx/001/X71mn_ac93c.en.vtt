00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.470
 the first time someone outside 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.770
 our activity of a trailer with 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.269
 American plant circulating through lÃ¡rraga 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.360
 usually ask us to see where they come from 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.360
 So many remains of pruning and the truth 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.180
 is that the pint that has these 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.920
 shoots leads to deception because in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 principle does not seem like a raw material 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.230
 very professions 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.430
 it's true it costs me a bit to understand what 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.500
 is this if you do not know what the topic is about 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.240
 current American lives are 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.870
 generally hybrids of species of 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.820
 wild vitis from america 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.440
 resistant to the well-known plague of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.400
 phylloxera that devastated almost all strains 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.650
 of vitis vinifera in europe division 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.450
 the fruits have no value is to endow 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.310
 our different breeds of grapes from a 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.860
 root system that supports the 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.710
 pecks 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.770
 of this microscopic bug but 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.570
 small but but very bully life 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.700
 American is one of the keys of the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.620
 activity in vivero villanueva because it is 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.199
 graft base capacity 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.550
 adaptation to the soil at this time of 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.950
 year we are in january 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.470
 all levels we are provisioning 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.030
 we plant material both shoots 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.820
 of American vines as varieties 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.800
 vinifera 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.690
 then what I was going at the moment is to 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.760
 show you how to select and cut 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.760
 the American life plant 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.970
 and fix the goods 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.899
 the rod must be clean of the 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.899
 castles and buds 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.870
 be cut flush with lower yolk and 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.840
 give it the right length 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.590
 that normally in Spain is around 40 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.079
 centimeters 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.220
 it is a laborious and carrying work 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.260
 a long time although as you see 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.020
 and since he has been with us for several years 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.020
 what an authentic expert implies 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.960
 get closer a little over there 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.960
 the details 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.170
 cleaning heel av 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.170
 natura 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.590
 always looking for the diameter of the rod 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.849
 is between 6 signs 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.849
 about 12,000 less 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.130
 and the most important thing now once 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.960
 obtained after obtaining the stake 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.680
 its conservation in cold chamber for 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.680
 avoid drying 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.210
 and we are lucky to have it 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.670
 very closely 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.670
 as close as this
