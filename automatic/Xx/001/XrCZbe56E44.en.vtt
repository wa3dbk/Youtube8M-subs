00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello everyone and everyone today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.160
 I want to share a very easy recipe 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.070
 do and it's just chocolate with 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.710
 marshmallows or with more mellow like them 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.870
 Say you are very easy to do and it is 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.730
 ideal for those days where we want with 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.770
 feel and stay in the house without 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.109
 do nothing else then if you want 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.060
 learn to do it the way I do 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.060
 what kitchen is watching this video 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.250
 to 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.769
 for this recipe what we are going to do is 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.489
 add two glasses of milk in a pot 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.710
 great then we add it to little latte 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.379
 in powder I used this one of milo but you 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.629
 you can use with wic slats or any 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.309
 other than chocolate powder then what 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.559
 we are going to mix very well so that 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.079
 there are lumps inside our sweet 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.140
 chocolate recipe I added milk 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.120
 condensed I just put half the jar 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 that was coming so it would not be so sweet 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.010
 and according to more mixing 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.550
 the sheet believes that half a bag of cream 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.090
 of milk 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.090
 Y 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.600
 says the imam exclaimed 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.390
 and finally use this utensil 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.220
 that reminds us well the name but one 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.700
 he uses it so that the chocolate he has is 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.759
 pumitas and then he does not all for that 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.830
 do not fall or can not water the marx 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.080
 I lose or more I like them as they want 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.270
 say and finally just expel the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.640
 chocolate is religious because they go 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.960
 melting with the heat and it is very 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.960
 rich chocolate 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.060
 so this is an excellent option 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.160
 to be able to share a day that is 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.229
 being very cold or that simply 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.500
 you want to be with the house watching 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.150
 movies watch television something very 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.100
 relaxed then I think it 's a 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.380
 excellent option is also a 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.970

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.970
 is that you are sick or you have a cold 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.099

 this recipe is super super easy 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.740
 simple and you do not need many things 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.410
 I think maybe if it's a little sweet 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.900
 but if you are one of those people who do not 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.940
 can take or eat things too 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.220
 sweet I recommend you then that the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.800
 sweet with a little stevia or something 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.590
 so to diminish like candy 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.570
 you put - marshmallows because like those 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.640
 they bring quite sweet then like that 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.160
