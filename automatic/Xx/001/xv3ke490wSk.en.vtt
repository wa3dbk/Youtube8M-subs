this<00:00:00.630> is<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.810> revised<00:00:01.260> of<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.920> walk<00:00:02.340> cycle

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
this is a revised of the walk cycle

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.880 
this is a revised of the walk cycle
forward<00:00:03.240> that<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.720> did<00:00:03.929> for<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.230> walker<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.650> little

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
forward that I did for a walker a little

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.270 
forward that I did for a walker a little
while<00:00:05.009> ago<00:00:05.270> I'm<00:00:06.270> gonna<00:00:06.480> try<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.750> use<00:00:06.839> my<00:00:07.280> or

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
while ago I'm gonna try and use my or

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.250 
while ago I'm gonna try and use my or
the<00:00:08.610> techniques<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.150> selgen<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.870> funks<00:00:10.139> my

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
the techniques that selgen and funks my

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.390 
the techniques that selgen and funks my
name<00:00:10.410> used<00:00:12.740> earlier<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:13.950> I'm<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> try

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
name used earlier but I'm going to try

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.820 
name used earlier but I'm going to try
it<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.700> forward<00:00:15.179> walking<00:00:15.420> character<00:00:15.929> so

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
it for a forward walking character so

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.349 
it for a forward walking character so
I've<00:00:16.980> removed<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.699> our<00:00:18.000> bones

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
I've removed all of our bones

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.750 
I've removed all of our bones
constraints<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> I'm<00:00:19.470> gonna<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.460> scale

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
constraints and I'm gonna use the scale

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.980 
constraints and I'm gonna use the scale
bone<00:00:21.060> tool<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.750> frame<00:00:22.560> 1<00:00:23.029> I'm<00:00:24.029> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.420> shrink

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
bone tool on frame 1 I'm going to shrink

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.460 
bone tool on frame 1 I'm going to shrink
her<00:00:25.320> leg<00:00:28.099> using<00:00:29.099> my<00:00:29.310> reference<00:00:29.699> boxes<00:00:30.470> right

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
her leg using my reference boxes right

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.569 
her leg using my reference boxes right
there<00:00:32.329> I'm<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.899> rotate<00:00:34.860> her<00:00:35.070> leg<00:00:35.370> in

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
there I'm going to rotate her leg in

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.380 
there I'm going to rotate her leg in
just<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.940> little<00:00:36.149> bit<00:00:36.270> also<00:00:38.750> rotate<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:39.870> torso

just a little bit also rotate or torso
to<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.460> tiny<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:46.100> don't<00:00:47.100> put

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
to the right just a tiny bit I don't put

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.189 
to the right just a tiny bit I don't put
our<00:00:47.309> arms<00:00:47.550> down<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.180> -<00:00:50.270> okay<00:00:51.270> go<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
our arms down a little bit - okay go to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.979 
our arms down a little bit - okay go to
frame<00:00:52.379> 13<00:00:54.559> do<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> opposite<00:00:56.719> okay<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> leg

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
frame 13 do the opposite okay to leg

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.859 
frame 13 do the opposite okay to leg
back<00:00:58.170> out<00:01:03.799> your<00:01:04.799> leg<00:01:05.420> back<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> its<00:01:06.780> original

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
back out your leg back to its original

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.280 
back out your leg back to its original
position<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.549> leg<00:01:12.290> using

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
position you know the right leg using

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.090 
position you know the right leg using
the<00:01:13.530> references<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.119> boxes<00:01:16.100> rotator

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the references here on the boxes rotator

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.850 
the references here on the boxes rotator
leg<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> little<00:01:17.670> bit<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:20.009> rotate<00:01:20.759> her<00:01:21.860> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
leg in a little bit and rotate her to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.760 
leg in a little bit and rotate her to
the<00:01:22.950> left<00:01:23.189> slightly<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
the left slightly now I'm going to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.050 
the left slightly now I'm going to
copy/paste<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.340> first<00:01:29.640> frame<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> 25th

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
copy/paste the first frame to the 25th

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.929 
copy/paste the first frame to the 25th
so<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:34.430> switch<00:01:35.430> movement

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so we have a little switch movement

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.539 
so we have a little switch movement
going<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.770> I'm<00:01:37.770> gonna<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> frame<00:01:38.720> 7<00:01:40.549> click

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
going on I'm gonna go to frame 7 click

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.190 
going on I'm gonna go to frame 7 click
the<00:01:41.670> bone<00:01:41.850> translate<00:01:42.479> tool<00:01:42.689> click<00:01:43.200> her<00:01:43.350> hip

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
the bone translate tool click her hip

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.380 
the bone translate tool click her hip
actually<00:01:46.200> make<00:01:46.710> sure<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.430> start

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
actually make sure I got a start

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:57.350 
actually make sure I got a start
keyframe<00:01:50.899> 7<00:01:52.579> lift<00:01:53.579> her<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.159> bit<00:01:56.369> so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
keyframe 7 lift her just a little bit so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.399 
keyframe 7 lift her just a little bit so
she's<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.780> top<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.290> reference<00:01:58.649> line

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
she's on top of this reference line

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.010 
she's on top of this reference line
select<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.680> two<00:02:02.479> keyframes<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.840> just

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
select the two keyframes that I just

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.219 
select the two keyframes that I just
made<00:02:04.229> copy<00:02:04.680> paste<00:02:05.810> 213<00:02:06.810> paste<00:02:07.740> 225<00:02:09.020> leap<00:02:10.020> this

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
made copy paste 213 paste 225 leap this

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.990 
made copy paste 213 paste 225 leap this
unwanted<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:11.750> we've<00:02:12.750> got

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
unwanted one we've got

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.340 
unwanted one we've got
a little<00:02:13.360> bounce<00:02:13.990> in<00:02:14.320> her<00:02:14.530> step<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:15.790> also<00:02:16.350> on

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
a little bounce in her step then also on

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.710 
a little bounce in her step then also on
frame<00:02:17.920> seven<00:02:19.560> I'm<00:02:20.560> going<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:21.430> use<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.450> scale

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
frame seven I'm going to use the scale

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.890 
frame seven I'm going to use the scale
bone<00:02:23.080> since<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.950> think<00:02:24.520> which<00:02:25.390> leg<00:02:25.660> goes

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
bone since I think which leg goes

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.300 
bone since I think which leg goes
forward<00:02:25.930> first<00:02:28.380> yeah<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.709> left<00:02:29.920> leg<00:02:30.130> goes

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
forward first yeah the left leg goes

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.949 
forward first yeah the left leg goes
forward<00:02:30.340> first<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.150> frame<00:02:31.360> seven<00:02:31.840> I'm

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
forward first so on frame seven I'm

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.960 
forward first so on frame seven I'm
going<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.640> use<00:02:33.640> scale<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:35.490> shrink<00:02:36.490> just

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.600 

or<00:02:39.970> scale<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.570> bone<00:02:43.380> go<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.440> frame<00:02:44.709> 19<00:02:45.250> do<00:02:45.489> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
or scale that bone go to frame 19 do the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.280 
or scale that bone go to frame 19 do the
same<00:02:45.820> for<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.180> one<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.660> see<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.080> looks

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
same for this one and see if it looks

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.229 
same for this one and see if it looks
like<00:02:47.440> she's<00:02:47.650> stepping<00:02:47.950> more<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:50.440> looks<00:02:50.620> better

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
like she's stepping more it looks better

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.920 
like she's stepping more it looks better
select<00:02:52.239> all<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.670> last<00:02:55.180> frames<00:02:55.450> on<00:02:55.630> frame

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
select all of the last frames on frame

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:04.740 
select all of the last frames on frame
25<00:02:56.730> cycle<00:03:02.280> yeah<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.489> looks<00:03:03.670> way<00:03:04.239> better<00:03:04.450> than

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
25 cycle yeah that looks way better than

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.470 
25 cycle yeah that looks way better than
the<00:03:04.959> original<00:03:07.170> walk<00:03:08.170> cycle<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.590> did<00:03:08.739> forward<00:03:09.480> so

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the original walk cycle I did forward so

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.560 
the original walk cycle I did forward so
let's<00:03:10.780> turn<00:03:11.230> off<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.410> reference<00:03:12.209> layers<00:03:13.209> and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
let's turn off the reference layers and
