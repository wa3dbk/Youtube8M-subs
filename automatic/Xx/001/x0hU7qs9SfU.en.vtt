00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
when you get down to the bead you'll

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
when you get down to the bead you'll
hear<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.469> cutting<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> wires<00:00:50.100> inside<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
hear it cutting the wires inside and of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
hear it cutting the wires inside and of
course<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.120> can't<00:00:51.300> cut<00:00:51.480> them<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:52.170> make

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
course it can't cut them just make

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
course it can't cut them just make
noises<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.910> cut<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> chunk<00:00:54.539> of

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
noises so you just cut the chunk of

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.560 
noises so you just cut the chunk of
rubber<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.570> well

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
rubber right out just like that well

some around the bead

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.780 
some around the bead
now<00:02:10.869> imagine<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.740> has<00:02:11.920> no<00:02:12.100> tire<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.670> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
now imagine that this has no tire on the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.540 
now imagine that this has no tire on the
rim<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.350> choose<00:02:14.590> any<00:02:14.800> place<00:02:15.069> on<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.370> rim

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
rim you just choose any place on the rim

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.670 
rim you just choose any place on the rim

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and lock a vise grip on the edge of the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.630 
and lock a vise grip on the edge of the
lip<00:02:18.569> well<00:02:19.740> then<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:20.860> just<00:02:20.890> start<00:02:21.250> peeling<00:02:21.459> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
lip well then you just start peeling the

of get it pushed on part way over the
edge<00:02:27.520> by<00:02:27.760> hand<00:02:28.090> vice<00:02:28.600> grips<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.110> locking<00:02:29.470> there

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
edge by hand vice grips a locking there

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.000 
edge by hand vice grips a locking there
for<00:02:29.830> example<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.840> then<00:02:32.200> just<00:02:32.440> peel<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.830> rest

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010

on this process is so easy all I do is

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.559 
on this process is so easy all I do is
jack<00:02:38.680> up<00:02:38.890> my<00:02:39.069> quad<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> wheels<00:02:40.390> are<00:02:40.480> a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
total job is about 10 minutes per wheel
