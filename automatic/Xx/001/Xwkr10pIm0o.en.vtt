00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.230
 Hi, what are you talking about? 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.200
 is to make a video lesson and how to create 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.789
 server of each of call of duty 4 by 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.180
 good galena let's go guys 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.679
 first of all I want to say here that the 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.540
 Seeing the staff, the staff is very 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.379
 difficulty setting up a server 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.510
 dedicated to the fourth place and the 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.309
 so I decided to do this video lesson there 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.800
 to show how it does 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.210
 despite the next game and has enough 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.010
 video on the internet to anyone 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.200
 difficulty finding 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.250
 so I decided to make a video as well 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.610
 explained 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.550
 It is first clear that you have to 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.270
 continue and registered baby is already there 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.609
 ready to play then play 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.239
 next of here 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.550
 the goalkeeper already configured to us 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.770
 click normal start as if it were 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.770
 Will not you play the game? 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.270
 Opening the game, we selected 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.520
 profile being had a normal brain 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.050
 Select game death as you want Boto 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.909
 name of your preference 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.659
 detail is still here dedicated 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.450
 usually the game at 25 no then the people 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.300
 boot wool this one is the server 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.840
 dedicated stayed with work sonar 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.610
 What is the difference from this server to the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.140
 Normal Normal server server we 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.979
 have to send the general commands through the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.750
 console 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.880
 if you keep giving the team all the time 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.990
 drop for general and staff to complain 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.600
 and will not give a gaming experience 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.270
 good pro staff is connected to a 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.369
 server put on wool 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.680
 it creates as a console in the area of 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.509
 so I work in and out in 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.970
 game now that wants not the general staff 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.320
 stay clear whether surfing the internet one 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.720
 video on youtube when you are 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.869
 open is that the staff is more 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.580
 When do we need someone to come? 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.230
 change a server configuration 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.140
 insurance created in wool when people 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.090
 enters and leaves the game in the merry 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.510
 Come on then, after setting it up 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.430
 here everything as we prefer, right? 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.430
 dedicated is not the one here is the option 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.670
 basic and we'll pick it up and select the map 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.320
 of start will open this console as well 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.720
 here on the desktop opening this 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.530
 console here the commands reaches all 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.030
 here respawn change time comment time 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.170
 decrease the number of players put 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.000
 went from a server 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.090
 finally I'll leave a list in the description 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.820
 of the video with one all the commands that 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.790
 put here a link to download 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:56.680
 pr with a great program to 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.700
 configure your koff Server 4.5 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.579
 also and some other games there then 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.769
 that the code a cut of 24 and an auditorium 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.650
 so the server is now created 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.989
 People entering here will not work. 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.239
 cases that works but in my case not 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.220
 It works for those who want to connect 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.390
 on our server we'll go icc 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.060
 unit of work 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.200
 if you do not go in the game part copy 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.870
 and glue on the desktop 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.830
 we enter the game by himself 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.299
 click here 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.620
 joined the game select profile game 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.769
 the server will appear only the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.819
 our why entering directly through icc 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.519
 unit of work 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.590
 We are not going through charisma 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.370
 in this fact will only appear around us 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.299
 So we come in here and it 's 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.689
 connected on our server galera there 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:58.930
 the name of an ass because of the sung 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:00.609
 It's good, that's it, everybody's alone. 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.700
 wait staff come in and good fun 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.579
