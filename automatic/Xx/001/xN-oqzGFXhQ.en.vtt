smaller sprocket for more speed and the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
smaller sprocket for more speed and the
the<00:00:52.290> neat<00:00:52.410> thing<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.950> two<00:00:53.460> piece

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the neat thing is is this two piece

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.500 
the neat thing is is this two piece
clutch<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.230> center<00:00:55.500> hub<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.770> solid<00:00:56.510> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
clutch here the center hub is solid this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.639 
clutch here the center hub is solid this
set<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.130> pads<00:00:59.130> have<00:00:59.880> a<00:01:00.360> weaker<00:01:00.899> spring<00:01:01.200> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
set of pads have a weaker spring and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.100 
set of pads have a weaker spring and
these<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.160> heavier<00:01:02.460> spring<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.630> the<00:01:03.750> weaker

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
these are heavier spring so the weaker

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.319 
these are heavier spring so the weaker
spring<00:01:04.379> comes<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.949> first<00:01:05.280> which<00:01:05.640> spins<00:01:06.149> this

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
spring comes on first which spins this

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.580 
spring comes on first which spins this
power<00:01:06.630> take-off<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:10.320> RPM

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
power take-off and then this as the RPM

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.270 
power take-off and then this as the RPM
goes<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:11.009> these<00:01:11.850> come<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.750> which<00:01:13.560> spin<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
goes up these come on which spin the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
goes up these come on which spin the
speaking<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.000> speed<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:17.090> then<00:01:18.090> once<00:01:18.330> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
speaking out for speed and then once it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.120 
speaking out for speed and then once it
starts<00:01:18.870> spinning<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.500> everything<00:01:19.920> spinning

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
starts spinning and everything spinning

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.969 
starts spinning and everything spinning
faster<00:01:20.670> than<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.690> this<00:01:22.620> will

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
faster than what this one is this will

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.080 
faster than what this one is this will
actually<00:01:24.590> solid<00:01:25.590> lock<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.190> spins<00:01:26.610> freely<00:01:26.880> as

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
actually solid lock it spins freely as

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.469 
actually solid lock it spins freely as
it<00:01:27.240> passes<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> speed<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it passes up on the speed you know so it

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.710 
it passes up on the speed you know so it
nothing<00:01:31.170> binds<00:01:31.470> pretty<00:01:32.280> cool<00:01:32.520> setup<00:01:32.790> that's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
nothing binds pretty cool setup that's

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
nothing binds pretty cool setup that's
