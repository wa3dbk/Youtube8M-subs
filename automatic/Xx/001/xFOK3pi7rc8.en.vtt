 why the ones where they grab the tablets to jump composer by as much as possible 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.390
 co-leader of one of these forms 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.769
 me Vienna

 Instruments near Emstunnel is and on the 4th 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.380
 I grew up in Paris my parents have 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.580
 both worked with children 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.460
 and while percent 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.570
 the thieves conviction 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.370
 Percent won 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
 Children no influence from the outside 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.910
 and hold that 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.990
 This will make everything trust 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.590
 her children won and for them it was clear that their children were not in the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 We did not have to go to school so we did not have to go to school 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.650
 but it is also important to know that they have the role of relatives more 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.410
 did not take over 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.970
 my parents have 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.170
 Not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.900
 we did not teach each other in the place of teaching no one has 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.430
 informed 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.670
 I have all my time I spend hours with the same topic 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.010
 can spend days loading 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.630
 for example, when I was about twelve years old 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.320
 namely infected for Mittal had ple 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.470
 did not read everything about what I read 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.780
 only thought at home and then have 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.650
 My Ellen and heartfelt master found that has accepted me that 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.230
 to show 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.330
 I could with half-measures I long meant I will Mittal driver 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.000
 Leonie percent 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.190
 Enke did not let it because I suddenly felt so much interest 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.680
 I also like music in detail 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 busy here 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.700
 my parents were against their own interests after the same thing 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.730
 because there is one of the children is interested in a matter there 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.179
 they have also opened the room 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.829
 Of course, bronze would be a different person 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.249
 if he is a former Schulz child 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:26.599
 now he would not compare with others has convictions and lives here 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.779
 according to these beliefs in a creative expert of the soul Ralph 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:36.239
 Fischer is actually enough money for the beaten balls 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.470
 you will probably find it here 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.630
 but they are not aware of me in the context of a rich life 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.649
 little happy and balanced 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.839
 And one day, I certainly discover a gap here and there 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.489
 for the guides 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.909
 One day I realized, "The numbers are not that high 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:55.739
 Not 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.940
 I do not have to sleep under it yet 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.979
 and then, after a boom of ice, the visit will show me that 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.979
 so many lovers of such Michael sent to the desert 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.849
 except one 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.359
 since his henchmen Switzerland 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.149
 I said I can choose 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.470
 show everything 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.289
 I can not teach it myself 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.739
 and so I was able to build my first guitar with him that was not good 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.289
 but it was good that she was not good but did not join one 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:23.369
 could build 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.089
 which was better 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:28.859
 and so and Lithuania as well as Cameroon he has me too 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.189
 subsequently made his advisor we work together since then 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.879
 because actually this under division 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.029
 Kienitz grow up well 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:54.629
 leisure 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.209
 Jobs vacation 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.700
 and above all, this subdivision does not hold this so absurdly unnatural 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.509
 play and learn 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.499
 I wrote this book because I think it's very important that 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:11.290
 young parents today learn about this possibility that they are experiencing 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:15.369
 that it is not true that one is without school as social that one without 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:19.180
 School illiterate remains that one grows up to a wild one I think that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.639
 is important that everyone can decide for themselves and for this celebration 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.639
 they need this information 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.400
 I am convinced that every child is in a comparable situation 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.020
 Take in percent 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.000
 similar 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.340
 rich 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.490
 and childhood 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.809
 we are now experiencing Â» 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:45.809
 and I want to give this to my children 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.610
 my child 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.879
 come in a few months in the world 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.469
 give this opportunity important so Fink does not think to school 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.400
 unless 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.689
 it absolutely wants it 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:04.659
 while
