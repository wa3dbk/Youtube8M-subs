my<00:00:03.060> shoes<00:00:03.510> with<00:00:03.899> one<00:00:04.200> hand<00:00:04.790> so<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:06.720> already<00:00:07.080> have

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
my shoes with one hand so I already have

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.589 
my shoes with one hand so I already have
them<00:00:07.350> on<00:00:07.500> obviously<00:00:08.030> so<00:00:09.030> just<00:00:09.240> start<00:00:09.450> by

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
them on obviously so just start by

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.499 
them on obviously so just start by
tightening<00:00:09.840> them<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.639> wore<00:00:11.940> leggings<00:00:12.179> so

tightening them and I wore leggings so

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.749 
tightening them and I wore leggings so
that<00:00:12.660> when<00:00:12.780> played<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.139> easy<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.860> so

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
that when played it's easy to see so

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.609 
that when played it's easy to see so
start<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> crossing<00:00:16.199> you're<00:00:16.500> gonna

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
start with the crossing you're gonna

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.689 
start with the crossing you're gonna
just<00:00:16.920> kind<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.250> hold<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.810> your<00:00:18.990> arm

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
just kind of hold it there with your arm

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.099 
just kind of hold it there with your arm
cross<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.910> over<00:00:21.710> tighten<00:00:23.689> and<00:00:24.689> then<00:00:24.750> make<00:00:25.080> one

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
cross it over tighten and then make one

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.700 
cross it over tighten and then make one
loop<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.830> hold<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.460> little<00:00:26.640> arm

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
loop and hold it with your little arm

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:50.000 
loop and hold it with your little arm
loop<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> around<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.400> your<00:00:29.550> left<00:00:29.730> hand<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
loop it around with your left hand so it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.439 
loop it around with your left hand so it
ultimately<00:00:50.129> comes<00:00:50.700> down<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.360> having

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
ultimately comes down to just having

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
ultimately comes down to just having
something<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.649> put<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:52.980> tension

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
something to kind of put like tension

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.880 
something to kind of put like tension
against<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.739> my

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
against so when it's this one with my

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.330 
against so when it's this one with my
left<00:00:56.100> foot

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
left foot

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.950 
left foot
I<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.579> my<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:56.940> thigh<00:00:57.289> but<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:59.870> have<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I use my right thigh but now I have to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.209 
I use my right thigh but now I have to
do<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> opposite<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.070> little

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
do the opposite one it's a little

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.910 
do the opposite one it's a little
different<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> put<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.739> over

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
different so I have to put this over

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.460 
different so I have to put this over
here<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> ground<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.750> tension<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.229> use

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
here on the ground and the tension I use

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.429 
here on the ground and the tension I use
is<00:01:07.680> then<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.070> foot<00:01:08.930> because<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> needs<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is then this foot because this needs to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.340 
is then this foot because this needs to
stay<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.770> place<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.280> big<00:01:11.460> taut<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.750> I'm

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
stay in place it's big taut so I'm

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
stay in place it's big taut so I'm
crossing<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.979> again<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:14.880> left<00:01:15.119> hand<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
crossing it again with my left hand and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.190 
crossing it again with my left hand and
this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.290> pulling<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.920> taut<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.900> then<00:01:18.900> same

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
this is pulling it taut and then same

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.190 
this is pulling it taut and then same
same<00:01:19.830> thing<00:01:20.070> again<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.840> hold<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> bunny<00:01:22.110> or

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
same thing again and hold the bunny or

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
just without doing the leg crossover

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.750 
just without doing the leg crossover
thing<00:02:46.510> now<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:47.650> can<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:47.950> cross<00:02:48.280> them<00:02:48.459> here

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
thing now you can just cross them here

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.900 
thing now you can just cross them here
and<00:02:48.940> just<00:02:49.180> use<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.560> calf<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.580> then<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.880> doesn't

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
and just use the calf so then it doesn't

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.020 
and just use the calf so then it doesn't
become<00:02:52.900> as<00:02:53.080> taut<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:53.890> like<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.340> said<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.760> still

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
become as taut but like I said it still

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.199 
become as taut but like I said it still
works<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.310> won't<00:02:57.550> work<00:02:57.730> very<00:02:57.760> well<00:02:58.060> with

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
works and it won't work very well with

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.640 
works and it won't work very well with
your<00:02:58.360> running<00:02:58.540> shoes<00:02:58.870> if<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.170> do<00:02:59.350> that

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
your running shoes if you do that

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.060 
your running shoes if you do that
because<00:02:59.860> it'll<00:03:00.070> get<00:03:00.190> crooked<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:02.140> just

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
because it'll get crooked but just

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.979 
because it'll get crooked but just
finish<00:03:03.370> with<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.580> running<00:03:03.820> shoes<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.480> that

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
finish with the running shoes and that

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.510 
finish with the running shoes and that
way<00:03:05.170> you're<00:03:05.410> done<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:05.980> didn't<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:06.370> to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
way you're done and you didn't have to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.450 
way you're done and you didn't have to
get<00:03:06.640> on<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> floor<00:03:07.120> at<00:03:07.300> work
