00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.780
 until recently the netbook was dead 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.179
 netbooks that were from that little led 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.670
 cups that you get in stores from 2007 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 could find one that didn't cost much but also 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.340
 not too much could 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.840
 and donkeys was the first with it 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.910
 epc 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.800
 the popularity of those laptops that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.350
 went from 2007 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.359
 enormously upward but in recent years 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.310
 which also went down a little and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.099
 calculated plaintiffs that appears with the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.969
 transformer book t100 that concept 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.969
 again to revive 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.900
 what is that transformer 200 then and why 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 it looks so much like a netbook 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.490
 to come does so initially 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.160
 that has economical and inexpensive hardware 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.510
 the is an intel atom processor in and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 it doesn't cost much either 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.880
 this system costs 350 euros and that would 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 should be enough for home use 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.690
 but something has changed since 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.430
 2007 the hardware that sits for example 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.860
 only in the screen which 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.690
 So you effectively a tablet on hold and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 the keyboard part that can leave you out 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.920
 don't need a trip and like others 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.930
 modern laptop also just sprite it 100 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.700
 windows 8 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.070
 the very first netbooks were still bad 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.780
 slow windows vista was already out but that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.990
 just don't drive so you tell them that 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.430
 usually stuck to windows xp or linux 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.790
 what about the hardware in the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.880
 200 to that is fairly fast the sitting one 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.340
 quad core better processor in from intel 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.500
 2 gigabytes of memory and 32 gigabytes 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.690
 storage memory and with that you can use windows 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 8 turn smoothly 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.630
 heavier programs run that can on 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.310
 you can do it for example 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.780
 run a photo shop 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.160
 but I would not recommend it because there 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.229
 hardware just isn't powerful 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.390
 enough for it is therefore mainly a laptop 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.369
 for office work and that comes 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.679
 nice because someday it delivers one 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.899
 license for office 2013 home and 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.869
 Students free with a so get word 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.280
 excel powerpoint and onenote 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.179
 and if you have to buy it separately as 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.979
 license 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.979
 quickly lose more than 100 euros 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.019
 Hey 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.400
 and yet we would not recommend the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.239
 comfortable all day with this book too 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.859
 to work 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.510
 the keyboard is not from 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.980
 High Quality 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.659
 if you spend some time on depth you notice 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.829
 that tests are somewhat smaller than you 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.769
 are used to a normal keyboard 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.480
 so that type is still on price and 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.459
 the entire keyboard also bounces 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.069
 the rhythm with which you type and in addition 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.810
 the touchpad is also quite small and feels 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.269
 also not really sturdy 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.010
 What also struck us in our test model 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.290
 that if the screen is at a certain angle 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.909
 put that the laptop then not flat 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.829
 the table stops but wiggled 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.079
 well you use such a thing of course 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.730
 not to tap away all epistles 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.680
 but just to note something once in a while 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.510
 or typing a small piece 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.739
 and the 200 is very good for that 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.030
 fit 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.250
 and if you then work for a while 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.079
 are in the 200 then a number fall 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.750
 things on the battery life 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.189
 for example is very good web browser can 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.359
 no less than 9 half an hour on one 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.609
 battery charge 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.189
 and also playing video 1080p 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.590
 material used for it could be eight and 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.549
 half hours on a battery charge and 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.889
 there good grades 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.449
 what was a bit disappointing that is the 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.639
 storage capacity 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.829
 that is 32 gigabytes of which almost the 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.569
 half is already used by windows 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.849
 then install again if is and what 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.280
 other programs and then it becomes 32 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.439
 gigabyte a bit tight and too 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.689
 on the screen it becomes free in terms of space 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:57.280
 the resolution is low quickly 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:59.319
 with 1360 by 768 pixels and that is possible 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.180
 of course not different because the thing 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.159
 only costs 350 euros 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.989
 and luckily asus still has that 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.540
 money and eps screen when assembling 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.519
 and that ensures good viewing angles 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.780
 you don't have to look very obliquely up 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.220
 the screen 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.409
 but if the two of you go to it 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.810
 screen then that can also be fine 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.359
 contrast ratio is 1150 on one 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.680
 nice and high and what we found against it 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.690
 that is falling off the screens 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.820
 brightness that is with 260 candelas per 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.229
 square meters quite low 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.699
 which especially notice when you use the tablet 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.699
 also want to use outside 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.250
 that we still speak the most about it 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.080
 are both 200 that is that price of 350 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.360
 euro because for that money you get one 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.160
 tablet and a laptop in one 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.070
 a full version of windows 8 and 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.080
 office 2013 and a battery that comes with browser 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.640
 nine and a half hours 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.440
 he may not be the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.570
 screen resolution is not high and the 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.790
 build quality is not super but that 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.190
 take the bargain for which EUR 350 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.940
 the only real drawback we face 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.520
 walked 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.320
 that is the 32 gigabyte storage that is 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.630
 very quickly full and you can do it 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.520
 expand with micro sd cards 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.530
 that is often awkward or disadvantageous 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.540
 for the speed 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.340
 one thing is clear now and that 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.620
 is that plaintiffs with the 200 really one 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.420
 lots of value for money 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.850
 you should not use it as your primary system 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.520
 but as a laptop or tablet for 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.120
 there is the 200 and very interesting 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.120
 device
