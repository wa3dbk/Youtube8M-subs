 The heart for a museum, this one for others. 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.589
 Do you believe in the possibility? 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.729
 I did not close my eyes 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:13.599
 Let's change the tone later. 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.549

 we have at the disposal of the channel of communication with the sky where 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.550
 can be but also 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.480
 Can I? 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089
 hoping that with the increase 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.489
 I will receive 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.260
 whenever we seek explanations that something we have of our 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.520
 limited references to time 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.140
 and to space 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.470

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.050
 without prayer 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.630
 the sky will shut up 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.500
 if for you the action were the chemical college kip garland for the hair 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.950

 the supernatural that satisfied with my devotion 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.550
 the answer is that often you do not shut up 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.670
 after all

 you asked over the course of your life was granted 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.410
 in this case the non-concession can be interpreted as 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.890
 the silence of the skies 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.190
 but 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.480

 while you question 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.990
 that they would be amazed at my revolt and would be intimidated by my

 in pursuit of wisdom and current footwear 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.690
 we are the nation 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.259
 we refuse 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.549
 in response 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.279

 I feel help but know 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.429
 what we know 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.719
