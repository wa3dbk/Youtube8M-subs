00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
every now and then so yeah the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.040 
every now and then so yeah the
frustration<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:53.970> very<00:01:54.210> frustrating<00:01:54.930> but

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
frustration is not very frustrating but

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.290 
frustration is not very frustrating but
uh<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.580> don't<00:01:56.580> know<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.760> can<00:01:56.970> be<00:01:57.060> frustrating

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
uh I don't know I can be frustrating

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.510

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.730 

it's<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.820> guess<00:02:03.150> it's<00:02:03.330> kind<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.900> challenging<00:02:04.200> or

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
it's I guess it's kind of challenging or

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.570 
it's I guess it's kind of challenging or
too<00:02:04.920> bad<00:02:05.100> though<00:02:07.070> yeah<00:02:08.070> it's<00:02:08.190> pretty<00:02:08.369> it's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
too bad though yeah it's pretty it's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.770 
too bad though yeah it's pretty it's
pretty<00:02:08.700> cool<00:02:09.060> game<00:02:09.980> the<00:02:10.980> graphics<00:02:11.780> they're

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
pretty cool game the graphics they're

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.040 
pretty cool game the graphics they're
all<00:02:12.990> right<00:02:13.260> but<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.720> could<00:02:15.840> tell

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
all right but just like you could tell

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.240 
all right but just like you could tell
that<00:02:16.200> they<00:02:16.470> could<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:16.770> done<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> lot<00:02:17.190> better

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
that they could have done a lot better

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.210 
that they could have done a lot better
