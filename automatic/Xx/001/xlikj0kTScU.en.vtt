down<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.659> if<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:39.840> grain<00:01:40.110> some<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.570> so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
down so if not grain some out of it so

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.870 
down so if not grain some out of it so
saddle<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> back<00:01:43.200> end<00:01:43.470> down<00:01:43.710> once<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> get

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
saddle the back end down once you get

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.749 
saddle the back end down once you get
the<00:01:45.000> back<00:01:45.149> end<00:01:45.210> down<00:01:45.799> this<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> optional

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the back end down this is the optional

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.539 
the back end down this is the optional
part<00:01:48.259> which<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.500> put<00:01:49.890> two<00:01:49.979> pair<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.250> pliers

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
part which just put two pair of pliers

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.480 
part which just put two pair of pliers
you<00:01:51.329> don't<00:01:51.509> need<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.409> i<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
you don't need to do it but i do it and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.819 
you don't need to do it but i do it and
take<00:01:53.700> loose<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.119> hose<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.630> here<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
take loose this hose right here the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
take loose this hose right here the
reason<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.820> crosses<00:01:57.240> right

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
reason is is because it crosses right

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.620 
reason is is because it crosses right
over<00:01:57.659> top<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.290> top<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:59.210> the<00:02:00.210> pump<00:02:00.450> chamber

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
over top on top of your the pump chamber

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.899 
over top on top of your the pump chamber
if<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.770> have<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> makes

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
if you have that out of the way it makes

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.130 
if you have that out of the way it makes
things<00:02:03.180> easier<00:02:04.310> next<00:02:05.310> thing<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> do

things easier next thing you want to do

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
things easier next thing you want to do
is<00:02:07.140> pull<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.710> line<00:02:07.979> off<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> top<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.610> the

tighten back that up put your clip back

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.670 
tighten back that up put your clip back
in<00:04:08.700> here<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.240> set<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.720> back<00:04:09.810> down<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.380> there

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
in here and set it back down in there

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.590 
in here and set it back down in there
the<00:04:11.100> reason<00:04:11.400> I've<00:04:11.520> gone<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:11.940> far<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.570> don't

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
the reason I've gone this far you don't

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.360 
the reason I've gone this far you don't
even<00:04:12.840> have<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.230> drop<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.620> tank<00:04:13.830> like<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
even have to drop the tank like this the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.949 
even have to drop the tank like this the
reason<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:14.730> have<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.060> because<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.510> had<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.690> wiring

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
reason I have is because I had a wiring

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.590 
reason I have is because I had a wiring
problem<00:04:16.500> right<00:04:16.680> here<00:04:16.859> my<00:04:17.820> pumps<00:04:18.120> not<00:04:18.239> reading

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
problem right here my pumps not reading

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.599 
problem right here my pumps not reading
my<00:04:18.720> fuel<00:04:18.959> gauge<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.169> not<00:04:19.440> reading<00:04:19.770> this<00:04:20.340> pulled

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
my fuel gauge is not reading this pulled

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.250 
my fuel gauge is not reading this pulled
out<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.000> little<00:04:21.270> plastic<00:04:21.480> loom<00:04:21.960> and

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
out of this little plastic loom and

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.020 
out of this little plastic loom and
there's<00:04:22.860> not<00:04:22.979> enough<00:04:23.280> there<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.520> solder<00:04:23.850> it

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
there's not enough there to solder it

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.909 
there's not enough there to solder it
back<00:04:24.060> together<00:04:24.390> so<00:04:24.690> I've<00:04:25.169> just<00:04:25.200> taken<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.740> piece

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
back together so I've just taken a piece

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.020 
back together so I've just taken a piece
of<00:04:26.100> wire<00:04:26.280> and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
of wire and

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.700 
of wire and
crammed<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.540> in<00:04:27.630> there<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.110> used<00:04:28.350> my<00:04:28.530> wife's

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
crammed it in there and I used my wife's

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.430 
crammed it in there and I used my wife's
hot<00:04:29.010> glue<00:04:29.280> gun<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.820> that's<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.840> extended<00:04:31.320> it

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
hot glue gun and that's it extended it

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.410 
hot glue gun and that's it extended it
out<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:31.980> now<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.430> can<00:04:32.820> just<00:04:33.000> go<00:04:33.060> ahead<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.330> put

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
out so now I can just go ahead and put

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.879 
out so now I can just go ahead and put
everything<00:04:33.600> back<00:04:33.840> together<00:04:34.050> I'll<00:04:34.470> just<00:04:34.680> strip

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
everything back together I'll just strip

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.890 
everything back together I'll just strip
this<00:04:35.070> back<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:35.820> just<00:04:36.389> put<00:04:36.540> a<00:04:36.570> coupler

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
this back and and just put a coupler

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.720 
this back and and just put a coupler
between<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.350> two<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.130> I'll<00:04:38.550> probably

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
between the two and and I'll probably

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.280 
between the two and and I'll probably
put<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> little<00:04:39.210> glue<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.720> too<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.169> know<00:04:40.260> I

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
put a little glue on that too you know I

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.100 
put a little glue on that too you know I
don't<00:04:40.500> like<00:04:40.560> anything<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.100> spark<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:42.300> if<00:04:42.990> you

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
don't like anything to spark so if you

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.290 
don't like anything to spark so if you
have<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.260> problem<00:04:43.440> with<00:04:43.620> your<00:04:43.710> fuel<00:04:43.919> gauge<00:04:44.300> that

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
have a problem with your fuel gauge that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.150 
have a problem with your fuel gauge that
could<00:04:45.510> be<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:45.810> or<00:04:45.990> maybe<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.470> float<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.770> bent

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
could be it or maybe this float is bent

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.460 
could be it or maybe this float is bent
a<00:04:47.400> little<00:04:47.730> bit<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.419> check<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.660> out<00:04:48.840> too<00:04:49.230> but

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
a little bit so check that out too but

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.440 
a little bit so check that out too but
and<00:04:49.710> they<00:04:50.070> should<00:04:50.580> just<00:04:50.730> hang<00:04:50.910> completely

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
and they should just hang completely

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.390 
and they should just hang completely
flat<00:04:51.720> just<00:04:52.050> like<00:04:52.230> that<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.680> should<00:04:52.860> run<00:04:53.070> even

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
flat just like that it should run even

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.250
