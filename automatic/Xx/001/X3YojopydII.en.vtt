00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
it tough for them to make the playoffs

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.260 
it tough for them to make the playoffs
oh<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.080> do<00:03:09.709> think<00:03:10.340> they<00:03:10.459> care<00:03:10.700> about<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:11.090> i<00:03:11.209> do

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
oh I do think they care about it i do

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.850 
oh I do think they care about it i do
think<00:03:11.570> they're<00:03:11.660> going<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.810> be<00:03:11.900> focused<00:03:12.350> but

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
think they're going to be focused but

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.170 
think they're going to be focused but
more<00:03:13.070> importantly<00:03:13.489> they're<00:03:13.760> going<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.970> try<00:03:14.150> to

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
more importantly they're going to try to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.630 
more importantly they're going to try to
win<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.590> that's<00:03:15.800> exactly<00:03:16.040> what<00:03:16.430> they<00:03:16.520> said

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
win and that's exactly what they said

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.160 
win and that's exactly what they said
they're<00:03:16.790> going<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.970> do<00:03:17.090> play<00:03:17.630> out<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.870> season

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
they're going to do play out the season

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.780 
they're going to do play out the season
trying<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.440> win<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.130> think<00:03:19.220> that's<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
trying to win so I think that's the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.400 
trying to win so I think that's the
number<00:03:20.060> one<00:03:20.150> objective<00:03:20.270> is<00:03:20.780> just<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:21.020> continue

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
number one objective is just to continue

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.320 
number one objective is just to continue
to<00:03:21.650> keep<00:03:21.770> winning<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.430> course<00:03:22.670> Nets<00:03:22.910> fans<00:03:23.090> will

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
to keep winning of course Nets fans will

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.729 
to keep winning of course Nets fans will
remember<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.750> last<00:03:23.930> time<00:03:24.080> they<00:03:24.350> played<00:03:24.380> the

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
remember the last time they played the

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.050 
remember the last time they played the
Knicks<00:03:24.920> at<00:03:25.070> Magic<00:03:25.370> Square<00:03:25.459> Garden<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:25.940> was

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
Knicks at Magic Square Garden that was

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.030

on martin luther king jr. day and it was

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.310 
on martin luther king jr. day and it was
a<00:03:28.130> blowout<00:03:28.430> affair<00:03:28.670> with<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.510> nets<00:03:29.720> one<00:03:30.020> there

journeys<00:03:47.120> last<00:03:47.360> couple<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.780> games<00:03:47.840> of<00:03:48.200> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
journeys last couple of games of the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.900 
journeys last couple of games of the
season<00:03:48.500> as<00:03:48.800> they<00:03:49.100> try<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.340> improve<00:03:49.700> their

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
season as they try to improve their

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.910 
season as they try to improve their
playoff<00:03:50.090> seedings<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.690> possibly<00:03:51.410> win<00:03:51.890> the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
playoff seedings and possibly win the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.350 
playoff seedings and possibly win the
Atlantic<00:03:52.310> Division<00:03:52.610> title<00:03:52.880> yeah<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.180> know<00:03:53.330> I

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
Atlantic Division title yeah you know I

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.000 
Atlantic Division title yeah you know I
think<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.660> big<00:03:53.810> part<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.200> focus<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.770> that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
think a big part of the focus is that

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.220 
think a big part of the focus is that
they've<00:03:55.430> won<00:03:55.760> 14<00:03:56.300> straight<00:03:56.570> games<00:03:56.810> at<00:03:57.050> home

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
they've won 14 straight games at home

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.500 
they've won 14 straight games at home
and<00:03:57.470> they<00:03:57.920> know<00:03:58.160> how<00:03:58.370> important<00:03:58.910> it<00:03:59.030> will<00:03:59.209> be

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
and they know how important it will be

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.150 
and they know how important it will be
and<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.989> for<00:04:00.260> them<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.560> get<00:04:00.650> home<00:04:00.890> court

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
and is for them to get home court

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.220 
and is for them to get home court
advantage<00:04:01.220> they<00:04:02.060> play<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:02.570> well<00:04:02.780> here<00:04:03.050> at<00:04:03.140> the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
advantage they play so well here at the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.530 
advantage they play so well here at the
Barclays<00:04:03.620> Center<00:04:03.950> for<00:04:04.670> them<00:04:04.850> to<00:04:05.090> be<00:04:05.239> able<00:04:05.269> to

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
Barclays Center for them to be able to

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.330 
Barclays Center for them to be able to
get<00:04:05.690> into<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.959> fourth<00:04:06.230> seed<00:04:06.530> maybe<00:04:06.950> up<00:04:07.160> into

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
get into the fourth seed maybe up into

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.250 
get into the fourth seed maybe up into
that<00:04:07.489> third<00:04:07.730> seed<00:04:08.060> would<00:04:08.540> be<00:04:08.630> great<00:04:08.959> for<00:04:09.140> them

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
that third seed would be great for them

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.810 
that third seed would be great for them
because<00:04:09.320> they<00:04:10.010> have<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.400> home<00:04:10.580> court

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
because they have that home court

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.130 
because they have that home court
advantage<00:04:10.880> they<00:04:11.270> play<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.540> well<00:04:11.810> here<00:04:12.020> at<00:04:12.110> home

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
advantage they play so well here at home

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.020 
advantage they play so well here at home
so<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:12.920> think<00:04:13.040> that's<00:04:13.340> going<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.640> be<00:04:13.760> part<00:04:13.940> of

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
so I think that's going to be part of

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.970 
so I think that's going to be part of
the<00:04:14.120> motivation<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.660> keep<00:04:14.870> winning<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.470> get

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
the motivation to keep winning is to get

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.810 
the motivation to keep winning is to get
that<00:04:16.130> home<00:04:16.280> court

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
that home court

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.940 
that home court
managed<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.750> again<00:04:18.020> Jason<00:04:18.440> Kidd<00:04:18.650> said

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
managed and again Jason Kidd said

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.250
