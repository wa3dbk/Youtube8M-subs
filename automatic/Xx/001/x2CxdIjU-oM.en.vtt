is you want to go to outer record and
set<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> around<00:01:55.619> one<00:01:55.950> second<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.820> half

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
set it to around one second or one half

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.920 
set it to around one second or one half
second<00:01:58.070> actually<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.189> half<00:01:59.490> second<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
second actually a half second so in this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.410 
second actually a half second so in this
case<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.170> set<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:02.040> second<00:02:02.460> because

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
case just set it to one second because

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
case just set it to one second because
basically<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.310> is

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
basically what we are going to do is

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.169 
basically what we are going to do is
with<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.140> will<00:02:07.640> capture<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.940> frame

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
with this on it will capture a frame

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.930 
with this on it will capture a frame
every<00:02:09.539> one<00:02:09.959> second<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.009> position<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
every one second of the position and the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.199 
every one second of the position and the
rotation<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> cam

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
rotation of the cam

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.679 
rotation of the cam
so<00:02:14.200> basically<00:02:15.159> later<00:02:15.519> on<00:02:15.760> when<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.540> start

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
so basically later on when we start

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.170 
so basically later on when we start
flying<00:02:17.319> it<00:02:17.680> will<00:02:18.159> capture<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.579> frame<00:02:18.640> every

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
flying it will capture a frame every

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.539 
flying it will capture a frame every
second<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.689> then<00:02:19.900> we<00:02:20.109> can<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:20.500> smooth<00:02:21.129> those

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
second and then we can just smooth those

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.940 
second and then we can just smooth those
frames<00:02:21.879> to<00:02:22.390> make<00:02:22.420> everything<00:02:22.870> look<00:02:23.170> nice<00:02:23.709> and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
frames to make everything look nice and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.839 
frames to make everything look nice and
smooth<00:02:24.159> so<00:02:25.680> let's<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:26.950> start<00:02:27.189> recording<00:02:27.700> so

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
smooth so let's just start recording so

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.390 
smooth so let's just start recording so
first<00:02:28.719> of<00:02:28.900> all<00:02:29.049> make<00:02:29.530> sure<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.859> your<00:02:30.040> speed

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
first of all make sure that your speed

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.209 
first of all make sure that your speed
is<00:02:30.549> not<00:02:30.730> too<00:02:30.879> high<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.290> want<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.769> set<00:02:32.980> mine<00:02:33.189> to

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.219 
is not too high so I want to set mine to

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:39.149 
is not too high so I want to set mine to
something<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:36.870> 0.05<00:02:37.870> something<00:02:38.859> like<00:02:39.010> that

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
something like 0.05 something like that

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.309 
something like 0.05 something like that
will<00:02:39.340> be<00:02:39.370> good<00:02:39.670> well<00:02:40.299> actually<00:02:40.480> let's<00:02:41.079> make<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
will be good well actually let's make it

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.099 
will be good well actually let's make it
so<00:02:41.739> 6<00:02:42.129> because<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.790> don't<00:02:43.420> want<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.689> spend<00:02:43.930> too

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
so 6 because I don't want to spend too

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.199 
so 6 because I don't want to spend too
much<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.590> time<00:02:44.620> because<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.700> pretty<00:02:45.909> big

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
much of time because it's a pretty big

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.309 
much of time because it's a pretty big
level<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.780> then<00:02:47.769> all<00:02:47.980> we<00:02:48.189> need<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.370> do<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:49.319> well

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
level and then all we need to do is well

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.339 
level and then all we need to do is well
actually<00:02:51.310> when<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.269> have<00:02:52.299> camera<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.870> make

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
actually when you have camera to make

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.649 
actually when you have camera to make
sure<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.829> your<00:02:54.370> camera<00:02:54.579> movement<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.269> not<00:02:55.450> on

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
sure that your camera movement is not on

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.589 
sure that your camera movement is not on
in<00:02:56.290> my<00:02:56.470> case<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.889> is<00:02:56.919> nothing<00:02:57.370> but<00:02:57.730> sometimes

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
in my case it is nothing but sometimes

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.559 
in my case it is nothing but sometimes
it<00:02:58.840> can<00:02:58.989> be<00:02:59.049> on<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.620> just<00:02:59.859> a<00:03:00.069> jacket<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:01.419> once

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
it can be on so just a jacket and once

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.270 
it can be on so just a jacket and once
you've<00:03:01.719> done<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:01.930> make<00:03:02.139> ready<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.980> start

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
you've done that make ready to start

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.679 
you've done that make ready to start
just<00:03:04.120> flying<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:05.260> normal<00:03:05.769> in<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.689> interview

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
just flying like normal in the interview

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.319 
just flying like normal in the interview
by<00:03:08.349> pressing<00:03:08.799> your<00:03:08.919> right<00:03:09.250> mouse<00:03:09.700> button<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
by pressing your right mouse button and

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.000 
by pressing your right mouse button and
then<00:03:10.599> with<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.989> way<00:03:11.560> RSD<00:03:12.750> keys<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.680> they<00:03:14.709> we

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
then with the way RSD keys so they we

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.059 
then with the way RSD keys so they we
want<00:03:15.219> to<00:03:15.370> just<00:03:15.579> pass<00:03:15.849> how<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.329> record<00:03:17.069> anyone

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
want to just pass how to record anyone

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.740 
want to just pass how to record anyone
just<00:03:18.659> start<00:03:19.659> flying<00:03:20.669> so<00:03:21.669> I<00:03:21.970> can<00:03:22.239> already<00:03:22.389> see

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
just start flying so I can already see

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.659 
just start flying so I can already see
that<00:03:22.780> my<00:03:23.169> speed<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.889> bit<00:03:24.310> too<00:03:25.530> fast<00:03:26.530> but<00:03:27.519> that

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
that my speed is a bit too fast but that

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.879 
that my speed is a bit too fast but that
doesn't<00:03:28.000> matter<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.329> much<00:03:28.569> because<00:03:29.049> this<00:03:29.739> is

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
doesn't matter so much because this is

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.360 
doesn't matter so much because this is
just<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.250> footage<00:03:30.790> tutorial<00:03:31.329> but<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.049> would

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
just a footage tutorial but I would

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.369 
just a footage tutorial but I would
suggest<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.760> get<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.120> perfect<00:03:34.689> speed<00:03:34.930> for

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
suggest you get the perfect speed for

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.210 
suggest you get the perfect speed for
your<00:03:35.909> flight<00:03:36.909> route<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:38.169> nice<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.739> slow<00:03:38.829> so

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
your flight route so nice and slow so

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.780 
your flight route so nice and slow so
you<00:03:39.250> can<00:03:39.549> see<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> lot<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.209> detail<00:03:40.889> so<00:03:41.889> what<00:03:42.639> is

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
you can see a lot of detail so what is

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.789 
you can see a lot of detail so what is
also<00:03:43.209> nice<00:03:43.389> is<00:03:43.689> for<00:03:43.930> example<00:03:44.049> when<00:03:44.409> you<00:03:44.500> get<00:03:44.680> to

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
also nice is for example when you get to

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.460 
also nice is for example when you get to
a<00:03:44.829> focal<00:03:45.430> point<00:03:45.459> like<00:03:46.030> this<00:03:46.209> chicken<00:03:46.629> to<00:03:47.199> just

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
a focal point like this chicken to just

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.800 
a focal point like this chicken to just
stand<00:03:48.009> still<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.729> just<00:03:49.030> look<00:03:49.629> around

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
stand still and you just look around

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.819 
stand still and you just look around
because<00:03:50.650> then<00:03:51.069> with<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:52.030> smoothness<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:53.530> it

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
because then with the smoothness to it

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.009 
because then with the smoothness to it
later<00:03:54.099> on<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.939> will<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.269> give<00:03:55.569> a<00:03:55.599> nice<00:03:55.840> effect

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
later on it will I give a nice effect

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.189 
later on it will I give a nice effect
off<00:03:56.439> of<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.250> camera<00:03:57.489> standing<00:03:58.000> still<00:03:58.299> looking

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
off of the camera standing still looking

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.899 
off of the camera standing still looking
around<00:03:59.290> very<00:03:59.769> smooth<00:04:00.099> and<00:04:00.310> then<00:04:00.430> going<00:04:00.759> on

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
around very smooth and then going on

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.219 
around very smooth and then going on
with<00:04:01.419> its<00:04:01.629> business<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.819> I'm<00:04:04.599> not<00:04:04.870> going<00:04:05.109> to

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
with its business so I'm not going to

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.270

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
and then we will stop with this noise so

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.140 
and then we will stop with this noise so

let me meet the audio so you can hear me
better<00:04:33.730> so<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.690> want<00:04:35.170> to<00:04:35.350> just<00:04:35.620> press<00:04:35.890> the

better so you want to just press the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.710 
better so you want to just press the
record<00:04:36.430> button<00:04:36.670> again<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.360> stop<00:04:37.690> recording

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
record button again to stop recording

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.250 
record button again to stop recording
and<00:04:38.290> now<00:04:38.950> if<00:04:39.160> we<00:04:39.310> control<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.480> slider<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:41.050> can

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
and now if we control the slider you can

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.340 
and now if we control the slider you can
see<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:42.130> is<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:43.570> actually<00:04:43.930> recorded

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
see that it is it actually recorded

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.430 
see that it is it actually recorded
everything<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.880> if<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.450> play<00:04:46.690> this<00:04:46.870> now<00:04:47.050> by

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
everything so if we play this now by

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.710 
everything so if we play this now by
pressing<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:48.070> play<00:04:48.400> button<00:04:48.430> over<00:04:48.940> here<00:04:49.120> you

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
pressing the play button over here you

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.110 
pressing the play button over here you
would<00:04:49.870> see<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.290> it<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.680> very<00:04:51.340> shocking<00:04:51.790> and

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
would see that it is very shocking and

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.200 
would see that it is very shocking and
really<00:04:52.900> doesn't<00:04:53.110> look<00:04:53.320> any<00:04:53.560> look<00:04:54.070> good<00:04:54.340> so

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
really doesn't look any look good so

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.390 
really doesn't look any look good so
basically<00:04:55.540> what<00:04:55.780> you<00:04:55.900> want<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.140> do<00:04:56.290> is<00:04:56.560> you

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
basically what you want to do is you

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.390 
basically what you want to do is you
want<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.610> drag<00:04:58.390> up<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.750> track<00:04:59.020> view<00:04:59.370> then<00:05:00.370> you

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
want to drag up the track view then you

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.220 
want to drag up the track view then you
want<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.790> go<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.900> few<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:03.660> check<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.840> curve

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
want to go to a few and check the curve

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.130 
want to go to a few and check the curve
editor<00:05:05.470> so<00:05:06.010> we<00:05:06.040> have<00:05:06.340> this<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.960> basically<00:05:07.960> in

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
editor so we have this and basically in

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.180 
editor so we have this and basically in
the<00:05:08.380> position<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:09.930> here<00:05:10.930> we<00:05:11.140> have<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.410> X<00:05:11.620> Y<00:05:11.920> Z

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
the position so here we have the X Y Z

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.840 
the position so here we have the X Y Z
position<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:13.440> we<00:05:14.440> have<00:05:14.530> our<00:05:14.770> rotation<00:05:15.430> the

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
position and we have our rotation the

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.340 
position and we have our rotation the
XYZ<00:05:16.450> rotation<00:05:17.320> so<00:05:18.250> if<00:05:18.520> we<00:05:18.700> go<00:05:18.850> to<00:05:18.910> position<00:05:19.360> we

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
XYZ rotation so if we go to position we

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.100 
XYZ rotation so if we go to position we
want<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.740> select<00:05:21.190> everything<00:05:21.880> like<00:05:22.630> this<00:05:22.840> and

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
want to select everything like this and

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.170 
want to select everything like this and
then<00:05:24.070> we<00:05:24.190> just<00:05:24.370> want<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.669> press<00:05:24.850> this<00:05:24.970> little

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
then we just want to press this little

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.290 
then we just want to press this little
button<00:05:25.530> called<00:05:26.530> set<00:05:26.980> in<00:05:27.190> our<00:05:27.520> tangents<00:05:28.180> to

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
button called set in our tangents to

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.409 
button called set in our tangents to
outer<00:05:28.560> click<00:05:29.560> it<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:29.919> do<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:31.000> same<00:05:31.030> for

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
outer click it and do the same for

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.570 
outer click it and do the same for
rotation<00:05:31.960> rotation<00:05:32.470> is<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.860> most<00:05:33.070> important

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
rotation rotation is the most important

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.230 
rotation rotation is the most important
one<00:05:33.730> because<00:05:33.940> not<00:05:34.330> have<00:05:34.630> a<00:05:34.810> smooth<00:05:35.350> rotation

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
one because not have a smooth rotation

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.219 
one because not have a smooth rotation
and<00:05:37.240> click<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.720> so<00:05:38.650> now<00:05:39.340> if<00:05:39.669> we<00:05:40.419> look<00:05:40.630> back<00:05:41.020> to

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
and click it so now if we look back to

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.330 
and click it so now if we look back to
our<00:05:41.560> scene<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:42.790> we<00:05:43.300> press<00:05:43.570> play<00:05:44.010> you<00:05:45.010> will<00:05:45.160> see

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
our scene and we press play you will see

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.280 
our scene and we press play you will see
that<00:05:45.490> it<00:05:45.669> will<00:05:45.820> have<00:05:46.030> a<00:05:46.240> nice<00:05:46.570> and<00:05:46.990> smooth

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
that it will have a nice and smooth

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.250 
that it will have a nice and smooth
result<00:05:47.770> when<00:05:48.370> fly<00:05:48.640> too<00:05:48.700> of<00:05:49.150> course<00:05:49.720> you<00:05:50.080> can

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
result when fly too of course you can

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.370 
result when fly too of course you can
see<00:05:50.440> that<00:05:50.590> I'm<00:05:50.740> going<00:05:51.070> a<00:05:51.160> bit<00:05:51.340> too<00:05:51.610> fast<00:05:51.970> and

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
see that I'm going a bit too fast and

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.630 
see that I'm going a bit too fast and
there<00:05:53.380> you<00:05:53.470> will<00:05:53.560> see<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.890> the<00:05:54.040> detail<00:05:54.430> will

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
there you will see that the detail will

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.690 
there you will see that the detail will
have<00:05:54.850> some<00:05:55.120> trouble<00:05:55.510> showing<00:05:55.870> up<00:05:56.700> but

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
have some trouble showing up but

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.040 
have some trouble showing up but
basically<00:05:58.150> now<00:05:58.870> we<00:05:58.930> have<00:05:59.140> this<00:05:59.290> nice<00:05:59.500> fly<00:06:00.220> too

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
basically now we have this nice fly too

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.580 
basically now we have this nice fly too
so<00:06:02.050> if<00:06:02.410> we<00:06:02.800> would<00:06:02.950> lower<00:06:03.580> down<00:06:03.880> of<00:06:04.590> course

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
so if we would lower down of course

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.130 
so if we would lower down of course
maybe<00:06:05.919> we<00:06:06.310> can<00:06:06.460> set<00:06:06.640> speed<00:06:06.970> -<00:06:07.240> so<00:06:07.810> you<00:06:07.870> can<00:06:08.110> just

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
maybe we can set speed - so you can just

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.920 
maybe we can set speed - so you can just
see<00:06:08.470> that<00:06:08.620> it<00:06:08.800> captured<00:06:09.400> everything<00:06:09.880> so<00:06:10.630> here

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
see that it captured everything so here

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.290 
see that it captured everything so here
we<00:06:11.080> stand<00:06:11.350> still<00:06:11.620> we<00:06:12.400> look<00:06:12.640> at<00:06:12.760> the<00:06:12.880> chickens

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
we stand still we look at the chickens

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.560 
we stand still we look at the chickens
and<00:06:13.540> then<00:06:14.260> we<00:06:14.380> can<00:06:14.560> go<00:06:14.740> on<00:06:14.770> again<00:06:15.190> and<00:06:15.850> like

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
and then we can go on again and like

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.140 
and then we can go on again and like
this<00:06:16.750> you<00:06:17.200> can<00:06:17.440> record<00:06:17.890> an<00:06:18.160> entire<00:06:18.460> you<00:06:19.000> can

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
this you can record an entire you can

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
you can add it in a video program but

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.160 
you can add it in a video program but
basically<00:07:15.820> that's<00:07:16.060> how<00:07:16.210> you<00:07:16.360> make<00:07:16.630> a<00:07:16.810> flight
