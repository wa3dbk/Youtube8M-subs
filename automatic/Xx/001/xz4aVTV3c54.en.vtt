00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.960
 but you're a jerk I 'll take an hour 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.670
 put everything back in place 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.440
 good evening in one day everyone is here 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.060
 to present you a role-playing game that 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.510
 is taking enough foot in this 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.700
 period 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.830
 the game in question is cross master 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.280
 cross master is taken from a series 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.980
 French call to an animated series ed 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.690
 is a role-playing game that is played in one 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.480
 chessboard how can they say let's go to 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.330
 see the scenic elements of the field there 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.710
 are trees bushes class stores and 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.659
 nickels 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.089
 let's go find what everyone is doing 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.640
 these trees will serve as 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.140
 protection and will block the line of 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.360
 shot 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.610
 the cases are also crimes on the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.650
 which one can you climb to take a 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.530
 longer range for attacks 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.460
 of stanic from the shops through the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.979
 coins unlocked by going over it and 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.110
 by paying them you can get them 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.119
 I don't know if the skills are different 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.590
 unfortunately they are still there 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.890
 rewards three coins from three 612 coins 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.250
 then the game as it is formed is created 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.530
 a team that must have a maximum of 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.200
 points in this case you say so 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.180
 every life at a cost that can vary 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.520
 from 1 to 6 points 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.260
 then a team is formed having 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.850
 exactly twelve points 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.910
 neither more nor less each player at 6 days 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.420
 the senses what they are practically are i 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.670
 your life points essentially we start 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.330
 a moment with how to position yourself in a cross 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.760
 master in cross munster there are at each 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.000
 side of the field of bays 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.420
 at a distance of two on your side then 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.590
 deploy your units and then we leave 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.269
 with the deployment 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.390
 let's take an example 1 2 and 3 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:25.360
 well our are lined up each unit 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.420
 to a card that gives you the cost 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.390
 the initiative 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.780
 moving points in life and in points 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.590
 mediation because the point in a moment 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.660
 movement is clear they serve for as for 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.569
 see how many boxes you can move 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.180
 our goal the life points to what 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.090
 the negative is also needed and clear i 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.730
 life points are the barrel in short can 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.790
 take our life and action points 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.750
 every action in this case yes 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.519
 would call attacks every action to a 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.350
 given course in this case 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.730
 we can give up the knight for a moment 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.970
 darkness to an attack that costs 4 5 6 and 7 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.239
 and he at a maximum of 7 skill points 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.030
 ok at the beginning of the round except the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.480
 player who makes the first the first name 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.760
 for tourism can pull two data into 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.269
 this game there are also give it the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.910
 I gave all the data to a thor of fans 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:32.180
 and has drawings that are critical 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.700
 critique and armor slipper and docus that 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.760
 it makes you go down there is no escape that is one 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.500
 shoe and contrast that is a welcome one 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.010
 let's make an example I start by 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.010
 second 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.829
 critical welcome yet I can 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.769
 assign this data to my units for 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.930
 let him take certain skills 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.900
 otherwise critical for example to mine 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.480
 knight seems to be able to make him move and 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.280
 when he attacks he will not pull only one 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.079
 given because whenever it seems and that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.049
 it attacks accomplices defends itself from a 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.049
 attack you can throw a dart in this 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.890
 chance the critic for when he attacked me 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.660
 will do 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.660
 it is not clear 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.780
 but two then one can pull two ships 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.260
 whenever this shot I can do 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.150
 and I can do damage 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.880
 whenever I live critically I will add 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.760
 more damage to what it does than basic 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.810
 but the attack up to here we are well 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.030
 if instead I am attacked and I have given every 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.340
 drive anyway when I get an attack 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.430
 it appears with a die and if it comes shield 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.880
 receives less damage if I have a unit 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.250
 crew an armor die the al 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.020
 place of a datum will pull 2 ​​for 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.540
 defend yourself every second unit a 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.090
 depending on the climate according to its own 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.190
 character will rehabilitate in short 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.340
 even the resistances there are attacks 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.620
 elementary we remember air terra fuoco e 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.070
 water are these four elements that 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.740
 joined not in the game when I do mine 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.120
 I pull in tension and ask my two 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.920
 damage for the turn if a double comes 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.980
 like a double double armor 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.740
 critical w contrast a double escape 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.560
 each player will lose one gigi or each 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.250
 once united he dies and for all his 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.760
 points fingers the opponent gain and gigi 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.950
 equal to the cost of the unit so I died 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.860
 knight calls that it costs 3 I have to 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.190
 give 3 cc to my opponent and am 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.169
 only this means what it means 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.780
 simply say that when he has 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.700
 remembered Gigi I lost the game 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.470
 guys this ebboc is also the 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.419
 tutorial on how the game works 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.330
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.790
