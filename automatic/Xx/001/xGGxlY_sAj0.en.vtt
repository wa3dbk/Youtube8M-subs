00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.350
 has invested more and more 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.940
 reforestation in the Paraná land 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.349
 which is very good for sustainable use 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.630
 from soil 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.030
 now there has recently been a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.990
 concern with specific cultivation of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.270
 eucalyptus almost invisible danger has 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.730
 worried farmers from Paraná who 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510
 cultivate eucalyptus josé bernardi is a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.859
 their 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.500
 the small farmer planted 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.460
 approximately 28 thousand feet in its 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.740
 property 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.809
 in recent months has noticed that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.329
 eucalyptus trees were only 30 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.300
 centimeters when they should already measure 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.760
 meters sent samples of the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.520
 plants for laboratory analysis and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 The result confirmed that the culture had 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.440
 been a victim of a plague and unfortunately 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.989
 there was no way and Mr. Joseph had to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.719
 interrupt production and burn all 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.670
 the trees both work turned gray 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.340
 and to the despair of the producer a 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.649
 enormous damage since in addition to the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.500
 also has an investment in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.500
 inputs that are stuck spoiling in the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.350
 barn now did not come out in favor 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.979
 of November that dunga donkey appears a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.500
 even though it's not easy and the bug 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.509
 training but the plague did not 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.820
 only eucalyptus of his Jose 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.030
 on this other property she also did 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.700
 a great deal of damage here has not escaped nor 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.450
 the largest trees planted for more than 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.030
 one year 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.850
 It's worrisome that we worry 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 We know we can, I do not know, there is everything. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.180
 complicated 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.920
 is complicated to such a plague that has taken 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.780
 farmers' sleep is being 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 called gaia wasp 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.579
 according to the agronomists she has little 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.189
 more than one millimeter in length is 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.810
 Australian origin so far is not known 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.790
 How did you get to Brazil? 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.700
 the only certainty is about the power of 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.960
 destruction of it is estimated that each time 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.790
 can attack up to 200 feet in a few days 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.369
 this agronomist who has studied 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.409
 behavior of the wasps explains how 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.140
 they damage the growth of the plant 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.260
 and what are the signs left by them 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.560
 very salient actions are very much 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.489
 lining 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.340
 the overlap of the plant is not 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.340
 and also the death of the hands of this 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.050
 plant and in future the entire plant 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.180
 wasps have already been recorded in 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.500
 deployments in almost all states 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.480
 from the country 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.900
 the first focus was found at some 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.120
 years in the bay since then it is not only 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.470
 farmers who care about 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.510
 this company that works in the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.269
 processing of grains and the slaughter of 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.630
 animals for example uses per day about 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.239
 80 cubic meters of firewood is 100% 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.310
 eucalyptus this material will be missing 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.640
 I need to find other fuels like 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.040
 gas to maintain the furnaces operating 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.660
 which can increase the final product 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.480
 confirmed it ends up reaching the consumer 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.519
 This is it and if they spend it will take a while 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.709
 more and certainly would arrive we hope 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.380
 this does not happen to be some 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.040
 varieties you get quickly 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.290
 solve the situation 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.360
 technicians are currently working against the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.250
 time to find a way out 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.280
 because it is not yet known exactly 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.070
 how to combat wasp do not exist 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.109
 registered products that may cause us to 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.250
 we can use in agriculture to do 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.890
 this control 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.810
 then probably in the next days 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.660
 defined by means of a 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.519
 Emergency legislation is products 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.489
 control at least 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.799
 nurseries and the early stages of 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.209
 on Tuesday agronomists and 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.069
 representatives of the Ministry of 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.260
 agriculture must meet in 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.750
 curitiba to discuss the question who 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.920
 know there a solution out let's hope 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.920
 not even your videos
