and then I always like to start at the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.569 
and then I always like to start at the
side<00:01:29.610> seams<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.930> I'll<00:01:31.740> start<00:01:32.009> pinning<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.610 

the<00:01:41.570> good<00:01:41.720> thing<00:01:41.840> about<00:01:41.900> using<00:01:42.230> curtain

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
the good thing about using curtain

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.200 
the good thing about using curtain
panels<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.070> they're<00:01:43.310> already<00:01:43.640> lined<00:01:43.910> and

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
panels is that they're already lined and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.470 
panels is that they're already lined and
so<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.450> don't<00:01:44.630> have<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.930> add<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.080> lining<00:01:46.480> you

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
so you don't have to add a lining you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.640 
so you don't have to add a lining you
want<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.690> make<00:01:47.780> sure<00:01:47.900> that<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.110> don't<00:01:48.230> pin<00:01:48.500> the
