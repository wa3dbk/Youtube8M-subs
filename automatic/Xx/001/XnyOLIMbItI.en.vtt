 Hello dear friends with you game 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.799
 captive and this is a review on the game rabbids big 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.509
 bang 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.450
 yes yes we waited for her for so long and she 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.809
 finally appeared new welled up 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.849
 mad rabbits from reiman and now they 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.740
 went to space let's see 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.690
 on this game before starting i would 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 I wanted to show you a couple of easter eggs that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.230
 present in the main menu 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 first easter eggs if we click on 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.760
 Rabbit he in his style of mad 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.710
 bunny yell second easter egg 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.929
 different in that we will 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.120
 get on the screen here this rabbit here 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.890
 will be 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.600
 using your backpack fly in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.329
 direction in which he is now 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.149
 but we are exactly the same 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.640
 will and manage the rabbit during his 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.710
 flight in outer space let's click 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.950
 play and see what this data consists of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 the game consists of 10 packs with levels i 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.670
 passed already three bye and settled on 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.160
 fourth in each park with 15 missions and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 if we multiply 10 by 15 then we get 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.040
 150 great missions that are waiting for you 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.439
 new worlds also promise soon 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.520
 so while you think you will pass all 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.170
 missions new worlds just do come in time 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.780
 let's go through a couple of missions and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.850
 look at the whole game what it is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.590
 what is its essence 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.479
 let's start with the second mission of 3 for now and that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.140
 we see we see two rabbits 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.790
 one serves and the other is our main 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.320
 which will do the job by the way 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.229
 task is written below 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.610
 need to pick up 8 fuel ball in 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.340
 melted and balls are these here 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 green balls that are flying around it 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.369
 and press pause we will see the whole 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.220
 the galaxy in which we have carried 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.680
 this action is by the way to the galaxy 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.320
 depends on what kind of bug you have with missions 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.329
 go through that is here in this soldering all 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.610
 missions will be exclusively in this 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.490
 galaxy occur the farther away these 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.070
 galaxies are steeper than emissions there 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.290
 correspondingly harder 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.670
 by the way we have button stores in 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.869
 which we can pump our ours 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.800
 how to say appliances 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.190
 this is such a racket beat out for 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.770
 Padawan me and y. which is its 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.040
 to a kind of jetpack originally 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.710
 there was a bit then there was a plunger afterwards 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.800
 then I don’t remember what happened and now 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.400
 I became like this 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.430
 carpets 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.040
 and here we had the usual space 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 satchel then there was a can of soda 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.120
 now here's a point here 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.070
 naturally they are much cooler more powerful 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.320
 to pump them completely 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.620
 improve them by clicking on this button and 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.260
 when you next improve on it 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.120
 upgrade to the next view well 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.260
 let's call this weapon also here 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.470
 buy outfits cone protection glasses 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.350
 In general, everything is all to customize 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.980
 somehow your players and so let's 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.630
 try to run our bunny for 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.700
 In order to run it we need 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.520
 choose the direction of the blow it is done 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.680
 in this elementary way, let's 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.680
 wait for this fuel 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.290
 ball and try to start immediately and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.850
 pick them up as much as possible with us 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.980
 there is a button 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.820
 use of our jet pack 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.880
 but here we are shown by the way 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.750
 reserve of this energy and we need 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.630
 take this into account 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.820
 there is a timer on top so you can perform 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.340
 the task for 3 rabbits is necessary 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.070
 meet at a certain time 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.350
 if you do n't hit it then 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.090
 will need to click 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.170
 restart level and all at once 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.320
 instantly start over no need to wait 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.180
 hour minute second game right away 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.140
 starts what makes her the most 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.510
 attractive because the games in 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.210
 who need to wait long enough 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.900
 to replay the mission just not 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.000
 spring me and generally cause wildly and 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.400
 reluctance to play them is the same toy 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.980
 I pulled in and as I showed you I 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.930
 passed forty-five missions and all these 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.530
 the mission was literally a breeze 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.100
 I'm not for how much I played maybe an hour 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.370
 one and a half 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.210
 but the toy is really worth the way 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.400
 at the end of each one this 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.380
 there is a super mission which 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.150
 need to perform what it is 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.590
 it lies in the fact that 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.170
 you need to collect 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.840
 rolls of toilet paper let's by the way 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.700
 we will try to collect them and I don’t 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.950
 said that we have bonuses we 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.240
 we can hardly buy them at every level 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.890
 this is a bonus which increases the volume 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.650
 ball in fuel bonus which 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.180
 allows you to hit a bonus more 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.100
 from which will fly faster rocket 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.420
 a magnet that is a magnet which will 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.300
 collect coins 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.580
 and so on like that bonus here 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.980
 unnaturally paid but in principle 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.280
 can recoup 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:14.130
 so it is necessary to get this one 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.100
 I do not know what tr. toilet and let's 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.140
 try to pass this mission here he 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.100
 necessary in a certain order 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.590
 collect toilet paper to 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.690
 complete this mission 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.090
 by the way here are such small planets 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.070
 they are the opposite reflectors not 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.760
 attract and smiles if you are to them 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.760
 fly up and 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:40.890
 then you will push them away with the help of force 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.420
 gravity and then go on 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.240
 any planet which is the opposite 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.030
 will attract you like this 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.660
 in an easy way I went through this one now 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.900
 the mission 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.630
 toys are beautiful i don't know 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.620
 did i have to show it to you and 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.030
 prove but really really cool 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.850
 done 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.900
 work here is present and physics and 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.820
 gravity needs everything to be clear 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.800
 count and think by the way 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.650
 originally when i started playing u 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.440
 I did not work terribly I was furious but 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.900
 then, in principle, I understood the meaning of learning 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.970
 to manage this bunny which is just 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.220
 chaotically moves on space 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.740
 space has learned to count 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.990
 correctly gravity is interesting 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.030
 By the way what will happen if our bunny gets 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.730
 in the sun I have never played this 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.250
 paki but I think nothing good with him 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.800
 will the sun naturally gravity 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.670
 much stronger and you need her right 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.410
 use 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.660
 by the way in me said if you 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.650
 runs out of fuel then you can right it 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.600
 during the flight 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.990
 immediately buy over thirty gold 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:51.350
 coins toy paid therefore donata 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.620
 everything is not here everything is played enough 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:59.290
 easy pleasant and carefree in general 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.290
 great game from great developer
