00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
strafe jump if you try to run and then
jump<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.290> turn<00:00:34.530> you're<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.770> gonna<00:00:34.920> make<00:00:35.130> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
jump in in turn you're not gonna make it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.100 
jump in in turn you're not gonna make it
so<00:00:36.000> um<00:00:36.149> that's<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.660> tip<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:36.989> you're

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
so um that's just a tip if you're

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.450 
so um that's just a tip if you're
struggling<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.800> because<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> very

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
struggling with this because it's a very

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.970 
struggling with this because it's a very
difficult<00:00:38.700> jump<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.239> first

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
difficult jump at first

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.069 
difficult jump at first
so<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.280> said<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.520> want<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> run<00:00:42.210> turn<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
so like I said you want to run turn and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.950 
so like I said you want to run turn and
then<00:00:43.320> jump<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.940> should<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.660> top

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
then jump and you should make it on top

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920 
then jump and you should make it on top
of<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.260> roof<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.640> then<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.840> can

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
of this roof like so and then as you can

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.389 
of this roof like so and then as you can
see<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> pretty<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.070> spot<00:00:50.340> for

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
see here this is a pretty good spot for

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.180 
see here this is a pretty good spot for
a<00:00:50.940> lot<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> game<00:00:51.449> types<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.710> stay<00:00:52.920> out

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
a lot of game types if you can stay out

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
a lot of game types if you can stay out
of<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.149> people's<00:00:54.480> vision<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.050> then

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
of you know people's vision and then

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.279 
of you know people's vision and then
basically<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:56.670> outside<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> map<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:58.020> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
basically to get outside the map all you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.020 
basically to get outside the map all you
do<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> come<00:00:58.739> back<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.370> corner<00:00:59.730> and

do is come back here to this corner and
then<00:01:00.210> fall<00:01:00.510> off<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.289> you'll<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.559> outside

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.490 
then fall off and then you'll be outside
the<00:01:02.129> map<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.290> just
