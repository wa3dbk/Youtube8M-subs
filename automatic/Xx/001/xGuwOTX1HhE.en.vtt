awani I got this at a local market so
it's<00:00:25.529> actually<00:00:25.830> locally<00:00:26.279> made<00:00:27.240> honey<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.900> I

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it's actually locally made honey and I

it's actually locally made honey and I
asked<00:00:29.010> him<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.189> give<00:00:29.429> me<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.609> deal<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.480> each<00:00:31.080> one

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
asked him to give me a deal so each one

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.900 
asked him to give me a deal so each one
of<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:31.560> would<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.859> been<00:00:31.949> thirty<00:00:32.399> dollars

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
of these would have been thirty dollars

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.569 
of these would have been thirty dollars
but<00:00:33.780> they<00:00:33.870> give<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.290> me<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.590> 25<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.460> when

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
but they give them to me for 25 and when

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.660 
but they give them to me for 25 and when
I<00:00:35.610> went<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.350> brew<00:00:37.350> store<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:38.190> did<00:00:38.460> have

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
I went to the brew store they did have

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.830 
I went to the brew store they did have
the<00:00:39.660> same<00:00:39.899> size<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.460> $30<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.480> too

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the same size and it was $30 there too

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.319 
the same size and it was $30 there too
so<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.410> was<00:00:43.800> able<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.070> save<00:00:44.309> myself<00:00:44.489> 15<00:00:44.910> bottles

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
so I was able to save myself 15 bottles

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.740 
so I was able to save myself 15 bottles
remember<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.110> always<00:00:46.559> run<00:00:46.829> by<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.750> philosophy

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
remember I always run by the philosophy

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.720 
remember I always run by the philosophy
that<00:00:48.780> everything<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.620> negotiable<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that everything is in negotiable so I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
that everything is in negotiable so I
try<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.149> negotiate<00:00:51.539> whatever<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.289> can

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
try to negotiate whatever I can

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.069 
try to negotiate whatever I can
we<00:00:53.309> had<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:53.610> Jetson<00:00:54.149> okay<00:00:54.809> we're<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
we had some Jetson okay we're going to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.340 
we had some Jetson okay we're going to
use<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> little<00:00:55.440> acid<00:00:55.680> blend<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:57.050> we<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.170> some

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
use a little acid blend and we have some

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.290 
use a little acid blend and we have some
Irish<00:00:58.559> moss<00:00:59.239> right<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> our

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
Irish moss right here and here is our

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.910 
Irish moss right here and here is our
yeast<00:01:03.300> we're<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> use<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.500> actually<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
yeast we're going to use it's actually a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.789 
yeast we're going to use it's actually a
dry<00:01:05.430> wine<00:01:06.020> let's<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.170> how<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> say<00:01:07.619> that

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
dry wine let's see how do you say that

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.870 
dry wine let's see how do you say that
that's<00:01:08.040> French<00:01:08.310> cote<00:01:09.000> des<00:01:09.869> belongs<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.159> then

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that's French cote des belongs and then

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.899 
that's French cote des belongs and then
we<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.180> some<00:01:12.450> yeast<00:01:13.189> nutrient<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.760> want

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
we have some yeast nutrient I just want

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.070 
we have some yeast nutrient I just want
to<00:01:14.970> make<00:01:15.030> sure<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.479> gets<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.840> really

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
to make sure that this gets a really

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.060 
to make sure that this gets a really
good<00:01:17.180> fermentation<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.799> honey<00:01:19.799> doesn't

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
good fermentation because honey doesn't

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.649 
good fermentation because honey doesn't
give<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> same<00:01:20.880> yeast<00:01:21.650> nutrients<00:01:22.650> --is<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
give the same yeast nutrients --is that

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.359 
give the same yeast nutrients --is that
you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.840> would<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.350> from<00:01:25.710> something

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
you know you would get from something

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.999 
you know you would get from something
else<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:27.210> mall<00:01:27.689> okay<00:01:28.140> let<00:01:28.439> me<00:01:28.530> show<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.829> what

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
else like mall okay let me show you what

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.670 
else like mall okay let me show you what
I<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.990> I'm<00:01:30.990> boiling<00:01:31.290> my

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
I have going on here I'm boiling my

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.450 
I have going on here I'm boiling my
water<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.400> over<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.900> stuck<00:01:34.650> my<00:01:34.680> honey<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
water and over here I stuck my honey in

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.050 
water and over here I stuck my honey in
another<00:01:35.729> pot<00:01:36.079> I<00:01:37.079> didn't<00:01:38.009> boil<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.579> water<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
another pot I didn't boil this water I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.630 
another pot I didn't boil this water I
just<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> warm<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> water<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.460> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
just kind of warm the water up so that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
just kind of warm the water up so that
it's<00:01:41.790> easier<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> honey<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it's easier to get the honey out now a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.429 
it's easier to get the honey out now a
lot<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:43.979> recipes<00:01:44.399> will<00:01:45.090> tell<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.049> even<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
lot of recipes will tell you not even to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.649 
lot of recipes will tell you not even to
boil<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.890> water<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.850> totally<00:01:48.149> paranoid

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
boil the water but I'm totally paranoid

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.230 
boil the water but I'm totally paranoid
about<00:01:48.990> getting<00:01:49.409> anything<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.130> so

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
about getting anything in there so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.760 
about getting anything in there so
boiling<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> good<00:01:51.570> method<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.439> making

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
boiling is a good method of me making

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.289 
boiling is a good method of me making
sure<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.799> nothing<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.579> don't<00:01:57.090> get

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
sure that you know nothing I don't get
