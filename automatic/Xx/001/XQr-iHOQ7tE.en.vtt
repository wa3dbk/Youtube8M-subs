00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
to build that direction unless i add

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.809 
to build that direction unless i add
sand<00:03:34.099> at<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.310> bottom<00:03:34.489> because<00:03:36.760> by<00:03:37.760> this

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
sand at the bottom because by this

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.310 
sand at the bottom because by this
little<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.920> outside
