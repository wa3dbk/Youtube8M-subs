flashbang at me it's gonna last for

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.019 
flashbang at me it's gonna last for
about<00:00:27.420> 4<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:27.750> 5<00:00:27.840> seconds<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.369> at<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
about 4 or 5 seconds but at this

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.290 
about 4 or 5 seconds but at this
distance<00:00:30.510> which<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.109> don't<00:00:31.470> know<00:00:31.790> 25<00:00:32.790> 30<00:00:32.940> feet

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
distance which I don't know 25 30 feet

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.600 
distance which I don't know 25 30 feet
away<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:33.690> me<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:34.320> also<00:00:34.530> affecting<00:00:35.070> him<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
away from me it's also affecting him so

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.750 
away from me it's also affecting him so
here<00:00:35.850> he'll<00:00:36.059> throw<00:00:36.239> another<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:37.489> I'm<00:00:38.489> getting

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
here he'll throw another one I'm getting

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.569 
here he'll throw another one I'm getting
flashed<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.800> he<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.129> well<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:43.399> they<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
flashed and he is as well so they have a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.090 
flashed and he is as well so they have a
greater<00:00:44.850> radius<00:00:45.090> then<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> stun<00:00:45.930> grades<00:00:46.200> stun

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
greater radius then the stun grades stun

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.279 
greater radius then the stun grades stun
grenades<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> smaller<00:00:48.030> radius

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
grenades will have a smaller radius

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
grenades will have a smaller radius
it<00:00:49.680> doesn't<00:00:50.070> blind<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.579> long<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
it doesn't blind for as long but it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
it doesn't blind for as long but it
affects<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> target<00:00:52.140> ability<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> move<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
affects the target ability to move it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
affects the target ability to move it
slows<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.730> down<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.260> again<00:00:55.530> I'll<00:00:55.649> throw

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
slows them down so here again I'll throw

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
slows them down so here again I'll throw
a<00:00:55.949> grenade<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.399> me<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:57.660> time<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> stun

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
a grenade at me this time it's a stun

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
a grenade at me this time it's a stun
grenade<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> screen

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
grenade and you can see the screen

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.660 
grenade and you can see the screen
shaking<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.530> am<00:01:01.680> moving<00:01:01.980> slower<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
shaking and I am moving slower than I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.090 
shaking and I am moving slower than I
would<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:03.530> than<00:01:04.530> normal

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
would be than normal

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.580 
would be than normal
but<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> range<00:01:06.299> he's<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.840> being<00:01:07.140> stunned

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
but at this range he's not being stunned

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.969 
but at this range he's not being stunned
so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.990> would<00:01:09.990> use<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> stun<00:01:10.500> grenades<00:01:10.799> at

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
so I would use the stun grenades at

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.609 
so I would use the stun grenades at
close<00:01:11.490> quarter<00:01:11.939> combat<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
close quarter combat or when a lot of

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.719 
close quarter combat or when a lot of
times<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:13.950> enemies<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.280> grouped<00:01:14.610> together

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
times when enemies are grouped together

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.999 
times when enemies are grouped together
like<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.570> game<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.409> domination

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
like it got a game like domination

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.289 
like it got a game like domination
whether<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> flag<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> stun<00:01:18.180> would

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
whether on the flag a stun would

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.690 
whether on the flag a stun would
probably<00:01:18.600> good<00:01:18.780> there<00:01:19.400> since<00:01:20.400> I'd<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
probably good there since I'd like to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.039 
probably good there since I'd like to
snipe<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> generally<00:01:21.720> keep<00:01:21.869> my

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
opponents at a distance I generally use

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.550 
opponents at a distance I generally use
flash<00:01:25.890> grenades

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560

the<00:02:03.659> right<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> escalator<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.430> that's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the right on the escalator so that's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.109 
the right on the escalator so that's
actually<00:02:05.790> stunning<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:07.500> opponent<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.970> lot

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
actually stunning the opponent and a lot

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.460 
actually stunning the opponent and a lot
of<00:02:09.239> people<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.569> their<00:02:09.690> flashes<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.200> stun<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
of people in their flashes are stun the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:20.990 
of people in their flashes are stun the
lay<00:02:10.619> down<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.009> ground<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.459> make<00:02:11.610> sure<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:20.430> in

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
lay down the ground so make sure and in

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.839 
lay down the ground so make sure and in
this<00:02:21.150> game<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> think<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.959> won<00:02:22.680> with<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.010> score

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
this game I think we won with this score

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.500 
this game I think we won with this score
better<00:02:24.239> than<00:02:24.360> two<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:27.330> two

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
better than two to one and the two

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.360 
better than two to one and the two
people<00:02:27.780> I'm<00:02:27.840> partied<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.650> use<00:02:28.800> flash

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
people I'm partied up with we use flash

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.550 
people I'm partied up with we use flash
and<00:02:29.430> stun<00:02:30.269> grenades<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.780> constantly<00:02:31.349> we

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and stun grenades it's constantly we

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.350 
and stun grenades it's constantly we
throw<00:02:31.800> them<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:32.400> that's<00:02:32.879> one<00:02:33.060> person

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
throw them in and then that's one person

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.920 
throw them in and then that's one person
throwing<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> other<00:02:33.989> ones<00:02:34.140> firing<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
throwing in the other ones firing the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.300 
throwing in the other ones firing the
other<00:02:37.050> team<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.440> don't<00:02:37.650> think<00:02:37.890> we<00:02:37.950> were<00:02:38.040> flashed

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
other team I don't think we were flashed

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.470 
other team I don't think we were flashed
in<00:02:38.489> single<00:02:38.760> time<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> don't<00:02:39.239> think<00:02:39.360> they<00:02:39.450> use

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
in single time I don't think they use

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.820 
in single time I don't think they use
them<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.810> all<00:02:39.930> they<00:02:40.230> definitely<00:02:40.470> make<00:02:40.800> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
them at all they definitely make a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.420 
them at all they definitely make a
difference<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.340> gameplay<00:02:41.569> my<00:02:42.569> teammate<00:02:43.430> throw

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
difference in gameplay my teammate throw

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.750 
difference in gameplay my teammate throw
flash<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.970> same<00:02:45.150> time<00:02:45.390> here<00:02:45.660> so

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
flash at the same time here so

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.130 
flash at the same time here so
definitely<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.330> should<00:02:48.720> probably<00:02:48.989> be

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
definitely you should probably be

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.380 
definitely you should probably be
getting<00:02:49.290> wanted<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.400> assist<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.849> game<00:02:51.060> if<00:02:51.300> not

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
getting wanted to assist a game if not

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.059 
getting wanted to assist a game if not
more<00:02:51.810> if<00:02:52.200> you're<00:02:52.410> not<00:02:52.500> getting<00:02:52.650> at<00:02:52.800> least<00:02:52.860> one

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
more if you're not getting at least one

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.320 
more if you're not getting at least one
or<00:02:53.160> two<00:02:53.190> assists<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:53.730> you're<00:02:53.910> probably<00:02:54.060> not

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
or two assists but you're probably not

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.940 
or two assists but you're probably not
using<00:02:54.599> your<00:02:54.690> specimen<00:02:55.110> aids<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.410> enough<00:02:55.680> I

grenades so I wouldn't suggest that not
even<00:03:22.110> trying<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.680> easiest<00:03:22.920> thing<00:03:23.129> to<00:03:23.159> do<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
even trying the easiest thing to do is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.369 
even trying the easiest thing to do is
either<00:03:24.209> get<00:03:24.450> up<00:03:24.480> behind<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.140> knife<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.560> or

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
either get up behind it and knife it or

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.320 
either get up behind it and knife it or
