are predictions I think they're just

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.880 
are predictions I think they're just
having<00:00:14.309> fun<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.790> them<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.440> they<00:00:16.440> are<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
having fun with them but they are and

having fun with them but they are and
I'm<00:00:17.190> gonna<00:00:17.400> talk<00:00:17.640> about<00:00:17.880> each<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.390> every<00:00:18.690> one

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I'm gonna talk about each and every one

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.189 
I'm gonna talk about each and every one
of<00:00:18.930> them<00:00:19.109> first<00:00:19.350> John<00:00:20.010> Cena<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.630> general

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
of them first John Cena as the general

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
of them first John Cena as the general
manager<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:23.130> Raw<00:00:23.880> not<00:00:24.449> as<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:25.380> villain<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.250> a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
manager on Raw not as a villain but as a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.859 
manager on Raw not as a villain but as a
hero<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.689> fair<00:00:28.550> general<00:00:29.550> manager<00:00:30.179> who<00:00:30.599> makes

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
hero a fair general manager who makes

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.110 
hero a fair general manager who makes
things<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:31.980> his<00:00:32.369> wrestling<00:00:32.850> days

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
things right because his wrestling days

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.959 
things right because his wrestling days
are<00:00:33.360> basically<00:00:33.989> done<00:00:34.230> although<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.100> far<00:00:35.880> as

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
are basically done although as far as

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.000 
are basically done although as far as
this<00:00:36.090> prediction<00:00:36.480> goes<00:00:36.840> he<00:00:37.020> does<00:00:37.320> wrestle<00:00:37.890> on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
this prediction goes he does wrestle on

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
this prediction goes he does wrestle on
major<00:00:38.280> events<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.960> WrestleMania

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
major events like WrestleMania

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.830 
major events like WrestleMania
so<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.860> was<00:00:41.040> by<00:00:41.250> Kevin<00:00:41.700> powers<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.390> think

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
so that was by Kevin powers I do think

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
so that was by Kevin powers I do think
John<00:00:43.079> Cena<00:00:43.410> would<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.670> role

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
John Cena would be good in that role

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.690 
John Cena would be good in that role
because<00:00:45.239> he<00:00:45.680> should<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:46.980> Raw<00:00:47.190> every<00:00:47.489> week

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
because he should be on Raw every week

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.880 
because he should be on Raw every week
and<00:00:47.969> he's<00:00:48.149> loyal<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> company<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.410> he

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and he's loyal to the company and he

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.380 
and he's loyal to the company and he
would<00:00:50.010> probably<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.550> even<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.940> screentime

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
would probably get even more screentime

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.540 
would probably get even more screentime
and<00:00:51.809> people<00:00:52.110> tend<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> watch<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:53.010> John<00:00:53.250> Cena

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and people tend to watch when John Cena

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.850 
and people tend to watch when John Cena
is<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> show<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.420> also<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.320> John<00:00:55.530> Cena

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
is on the show I also think John Cena

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.689 
is on the show I also think John Cena
would<00:00:55.980> make<00:00:56.190> an<00:00:56.309> excellent<00:00:56.910> commentator<00:00:57.780> his

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
would make an excellent commentator his

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.760 
would make an excellent commentator his
passionate<00:01:00.199> interviews<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> he<00:01:01.559> currently

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
passionate interviews that he currently

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.729 
passionate interviews that he currently
has<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.879> much<00:01:03.120> intensity<00:01:03.840> would<00:01:04.559> add

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
has with so much intensity would add

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.070 
has with so much intensity would add
drama<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.760> these<00:01:05.939> matches<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:06.930> it's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
drama to these matches and I think it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.200 
drama to these matches and I think it's
definitely<00:01:07.290> worth<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.979> try<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.580> John<00:01:08.820> Cena

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
definitely worth a try to have John Cena

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.929 
definitely worth a try to have John Cena
on<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> entire<00:01:10.260> three<00:01:11.220> hours<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.790> all

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
on for the entire three hours or all

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.810 
on for the entire three hours or all
will<00:01:12.090> probably<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.630> five<00:01:12.900> hours<00:01:12.930> by<00:01:13.590> 2019<00:01:14.250> but

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
will probably be five hours by 2019 but

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
will probably be five hours by 2019 but
that's<00:01:15.360> neither<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.659> nor<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.110> another

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that's neither here nor there another

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.620 
that's neither here nor there another
prediction<00:01:17.460> by<00:01:18.240> John<00:01:18.720> clap<00:01:19.850> John<00:01:20.850> clap<00:01:21.210> feels

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
prediction by John clap John clap feels

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.210 
prediction by John clap John clap feels
that<00:01:21.869> Roman<00:01:22.290> reigns<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.070> an

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that Roman reigns will have an

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.570 
that Roman reigns will have an
undefeated<00:01:24.180> streak<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:25.070> WrestleMania<00:01:26.070> he'll

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
undefeated streak at WrestleMania he'll

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.679 
undefeated streak at WrestleMania he'll
be<00:01:26.729> seven<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.180> oh<00:01:27.330> by<00:01:27.630> 2019<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.450> not<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
be seven and oh by 2019 and not to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
be seven and oh by 2019 and not to
mention<00:01:32.030> he<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.979> also<00:01:36.590> be<00:01:37.590> champion<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:38.460> some

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
mention he will also be champion at some

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.080 
mention he will also be champion at some
point<00:01:39.740> but<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.220> neither<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.640> nor<00:01:41.880> there

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
point but that's neither here nor there

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.200 
point but that's neither here nor there
I<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.710> Roman<00:01:44.579> reigns<00:01:44.610> does

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
I do think that Roman reigns does

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.940 
I do think that Roman reigns does
definitely<00:01:46.579> have<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.079> candidacy<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.259> having

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
definitely have the candidacy of having

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.920 
definitely have the candidacy of having
a<00:01:50.040> streak<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.880> Undertaker<00:01:51.180> maybe<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
a streak like the Undertaker maybe it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.810 
a streak like the Undertaker maybe it
won't<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.470> long<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.189> Undertaker's<00:01:53.670> but

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
won't go as long as the Undertaker's but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.219 
won't go as long as the Undertaker's but
right<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.180> Undertaker<00:01:54.479> doesn't<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
right now the Undertaker doesn't have a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.730 
right now the Undertaker doesn't have a
streak<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.040> streaks<00:01:56.340> over<00:01:57.380> now<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:58.500> could

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
streak the streaks over now they could

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.740 
streak the streaks over now they could
even<00:01:58.860> make<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> more<00:01:59.640> than<00:02:00.119> seven<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.600> at

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
even make it more than seven know at

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
even make it more than seven know at
that<00:02:00.780> point<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.409> Roman<00:02:02.159> reigns<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.520> able<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that point if Roman reigns is able to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300 
that point if Roman reigns is able to
win<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.299> couple<00:02:03.659> times<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.619> couple<00:02:05.159> of

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
win a couple times at a couple of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.300 
win a couple times at a couple of
WrestleManias<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.270> example<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.840> year<00:02:07.310> say
