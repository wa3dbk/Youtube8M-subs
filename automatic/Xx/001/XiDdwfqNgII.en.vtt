00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.140
 create rpg server and that is in 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.490
 It's not that difficult to open 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.680
 for once the feed the beast 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.510

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.090
 then just click here 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.260
 the due comes there we show 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.060
 namely like this installation 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.590
 works we just go now 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.420
 from that we already know it all 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.239
 have installed and click here now 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.070
 in the fashion pack select left on rpg 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.830
 in the virgin pack that's the name of this design 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.510
 sometimes rpg pack and now 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.980
 Let's click on the download server up there 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.480
 then we will in our browser 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.400
 forwarded where we get a file 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.690
 You can download this occurs in the zip 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.180
 format on that we can for example 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.590
 with winrar or is they open and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.030
 We'll do that smoothly once and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.320
 in it we find some files that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.939
 we push now in a new folder 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.100
 that's what we mean on our computer 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.270
 Create a new folder for me 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.619
 in this case just server 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.450
 We simply submit by drag and drop 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.320
 drop the files from the zip file into 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.729
 the folder 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.650
 when we did that, we do 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.450
 doubleclick on the lounge.de at 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.310
 file then usually opens 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 a black one and shortly thereafter a white one 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.020
 window this is not the case with you 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.030
 then yes, just have a look at our Stadtbad 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.560
 fix bug tutorial there 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.270
 Hopefully these questions clarified that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.069
 also links to the right 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 starts the whole but perfectly 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.100
 if we can then in the console 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.749
 stands the whole with the command stop 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.189
 also stop right now and 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.079
 then we need it now 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.020
