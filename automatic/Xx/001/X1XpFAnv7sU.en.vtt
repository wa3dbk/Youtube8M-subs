00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.790
 we depend on us and that 's 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.099
 important is also important this the 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.929
 confidence that the team is having in 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.480
 base to light to the results that goes 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.710
 pulling out and we know that this is going to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.660
 define on the last date then 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.400
 we have to first prepare for 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.769
 for this game that for us is 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.990
 a final the fact that he plays in 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.470
 matches this noronha one by one 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.019
 characteristic if it does not have us 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.610
 the reference of area and we have to 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:39.180
 have one more game 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.320
 let's say as to associate and as 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.100
 more than looking for empty spaces and not 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.050
 both a culminated and a mauro of plays 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 by the sides but not playing 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.339
 hit by the pitch is something else 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.840
 they are recovered 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.390
 logically they are not one hundred percent 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.180
 are recovered and of 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.460
 because they are training with us 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.040
 medically they have the discharge but I'm going to 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.680
 define it on 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.450
 I am tomorrow if yes they are going to be 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.450
 the game or not today tomorrow 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.260
 As for the trick, I have not 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.210
 I felt nothing and nobody consulted me 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.270
 nothing that seemed the gesture of command 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.369
 south 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.960
 helping the victims of chosica 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.370
 teacher 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.620
 they are all this 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.770
 important gestures 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.770
 not only this case of chosica but 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.659
 that there are a lot of people out there 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 need you need help 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.490
 and good this in this case in the club 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.300
 fans players we can all of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.090
 some way or another 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.759
 give them 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.880
 not always with material things 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.560
 but I 'm often doing 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.920
 shows going to sign autographs 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.890
 as to the players 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.890
 and well we are willing to those friends
