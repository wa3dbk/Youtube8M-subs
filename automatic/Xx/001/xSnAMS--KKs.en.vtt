for removing our radiator hoses from the
radiator<00:00:16.220> now<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.580> kind<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.850> clamp<00:00:18.090> as<00:00:18.240> you

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
radiator now this kind of clamp as you

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.970 
radiator now this kind of clamp as you
can<00:00:18.420> see<00:00:18.539> doesn't<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.960> screw<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.500> this

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
can see doesn't have a screw on it this

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.890 
can see doesn't have a screw on it this
is<00:00:20.189> called<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.550> permanent<00:00:20.939> tension<00:00:21.510> spring

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
is called a permanent tension spring

clamp<00:00:22.550> my<00:00:23.550> favorite<00:00:23.910> tool<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.240> these<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
clamp my favorite tool for these is a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240 
clamp my favorite tool for these is a
good<00:00:24.840> pair<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> long<00:00:25.320> handle<00:00:25.710> channel<00:00:26.070> locks

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
good pair of long handle channel locks

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.720 
good pair of long handle channel locks
just<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.830> they<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.949> grab<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> hold<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.580> it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
just like so they can grab a hold of it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.260 
just like so they can grab a hold of it
and<00:00:30.019> squeeze<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.199> off<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:32.759> longer<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and squeeze it off the longer the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.760 
and squeeze it off the longer the
handles<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.780> your<00:00:33.899> channel<00:00:34.170> locks<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.590> more

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
handles on your channel locks the more

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.080 
handles on your channel locks the more
mechanical<00:00:35.340> advantage<00:00:35.730> you're<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.030> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
mechanical advantage you're going to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.690 
mechanical advantage you're going to
have<00:00:36.710> it'll<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> easier<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
have it'll make it easier for you to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.380 
have it'll make it easier for you to
squeeze<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.270> sucker<00:00:39.570> shut<00:00:43.850> just<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.120> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
squeeze that sucker shut just like so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
squeeze that sucker shut just like so
once<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.620> squeezed<00:00:46.890> you're<00:00:47.070> going

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
once you have it squeezed you're going

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.560 
once you have it squeezed you're going
to<00:00:47.280> move<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
to move it out of the way and with a

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.750
