00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.520
 to finish with the day of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.559
 Provi caÃ±as let's share now the 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.750
 field dynamics where we are going to know 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.730
 two new affirmation harvesters 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.110
 direct one with the particularity of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.110
 harvest double grooves 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.350
 ah 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.470
 with ignacio second provi meeting 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.390
 reeds against our near this 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.110
 project so interesting how it came up 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.600
 the idea the idea arises 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.660
 precisely because of the vision of the 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.450
 customer and center dealer 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.930
 sugar bowl that still the cane 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.510
 I needed a turn in a rethought 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.870
 on how to produce more how to produce more 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.090
 efficiently and this came about that I 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.470
 can not offer a complete solution 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.250
 not only in what is this 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.240
 in the harvest which is what typically 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 typically in our support but that 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.930
 now the complete solution integrates the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.550
 drip irrigation in the plantation of the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.550
 cane the harvest of the cane 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.280
 and then with other solutions that 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.950
 have where to go associated 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.439
 probably later integrate 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.539
 as funding also through 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.090
 our financial company with which 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.310
 there is an integration of ideas that 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.740
 which point is to more productivity and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.520
 above all to a sustainable work in 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.710
 the cane we have made an agreement between 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.310
 render the safra dealer and the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.110
 experimental station bishop colombres 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.460
 so that they are the ones who give me the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.039
 result of this integration 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.689
 technological and good today we had the 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.509
 chance that they will present us 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.340
 first results that although it takes 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.259
 province because we are thinking 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.409
 finish on the bicentennial of the 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.959
 independence in 2016 the fall of a 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.030
 long process with which this is the 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:57.739
 first stage of a five project 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.390
 years that we are going to go measuring the 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.060
 evolution of this project and as you see 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.360
 from the impact on the response by 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.920
 part of the producers 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.020
 and the acceptance of this proposal 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.910
 whole is look I will answer with a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.610
 with a comment that we made this 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.580
 people that are not Argentines that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.020
 they value very much the capacity that 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.170
 Argentine producer to incorporate 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.700
 technologies quickly made both 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.010
 in cane as in other businesses as in 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.950
 grains or corn in soy the things that are 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.290
 present in the USA this year 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.540
 already in the first holy quarter are 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.220
 entering Argentina with which 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.500
 the Argentine product is this 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.150
 probably one of the leaders in the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.580
 incorporate technology and especially in 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.510
 think how to produce more and meet 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.930
 this mission that we have as 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.580
 farmers can offer to the world 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.560
 which has the growing demand for 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.870
 food and energy to offer them to 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.240
 cover that demand through the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.040
 professions products today we have five 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.200
 fields with 800 hectares where we are 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.270
 doing this experiment or this 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.680
 project and the results are so good 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.120
 that maybe they will accelerate the times for 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.360
 replicate it in other parts of the world 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.490
 but without a doubt Brazil will be next 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.480
 step and probably peru 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.480
 the next 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.790
 good but with so about the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.950
 harvesters that is offering to the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.380
 signatures for cultivating sugarcane 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.739
 in the harvesters we are offering 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.640
 the model 3.520 that is a there where to go 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.910
 for a conventional groove and now the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.519
 new market tends to make a harvest 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.330
 for double groove where it would go into 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.750
 I play the machine 35 22 that has some 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.300
 characteristics enough differences of 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.370
 regarding the 35 20 there has to be a 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.370
 different plantation with some furrows 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.860
 doubles you have to design the field for that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.769
 type of groove and thus comes into play 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.650
 harvester there is a significant saving in 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.110
 both in hours in plan works 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.780
 work done and especially in the 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.510
 maintenance costs and costs 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.209
 fixed fuel because it 's the one that 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.280
 more often technology influences 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.319
 by jhon deere in ms 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.950
 that already comes several years ago 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.959
 we implemented them and well as they saw the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.180
 machine harvested with the pilot 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.200
 automatic that part from the design of 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.510
 the fields since it plows the earth with 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.389
 autopilot via satellite 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.090
 until it harvests that benefits 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:35.919
 gives the autopilot the accuracy 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.320
 and drive the GPS or when you make your map 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.139
 about that map harvested from outside then 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.280
 the margin of errors is zero but 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:49.200
 you can also adapt it 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.460
 if it does not come up with the most let's say 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.110
 harvest marks the reference greatly 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.419
 it is harvested alone with the autopilot 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.200
 the only thing the operator does is to 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.529
 output maneuver the machine in ways 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.869
 Quick 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:07.479
 we had the possibility to see the 35 20 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:11.919
 the 35 22 have the same engine own the 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:14.050
 Same motor are going from 9.0 liters with 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.139
 24 valves 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.520
 and has has a feature that 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:25.560
 has the pistons forged 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:29.069
 it's a cheaper engine than the version 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.099
 previous 8.1 liters the difference is 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.720
 the number of valves especially new 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.750
 the amount of valve that makes it more 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.300
 economic and with a plus of 10 10 per 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.910
 power cent calculate that is 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.160
 driving a power of 337 hp 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.260
 and they can give you one more 10 in 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.600
 unfavorable conditions 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.360
 then it is where the true 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.460
 engine power then what's favorable is the 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.770
 fuel savings and the increase in 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.020
 power and when you need it 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.720
 we are not trying to sell anything today 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.090
 for today we are trying to show that 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.830
 there is a way to make this more efficient 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.039
 and more productive the solutions that 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.650
 are associated is drip irrigation and 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.569
 fertigation planting the cane 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.610
 that is typically done by hand in this 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:19.300
 Case is made mechanized with a machine 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.069
 that distributes the pieces of cane and in 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.800
 reality what is done is to work in 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.710
 two parallel grooves spaced at 90 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.100
 centimeters one from another that that's a 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.700
 great novelty 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.250
 the other novelty is the agriculture of 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.410
 precision because both the buried of 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.970
 the hoses for the drip as the 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.920
 planted the cane is done with 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.770
 precision agriculture means that 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.300
 it goes with an accuracy of two centimeters 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.580
 is working satellite with what 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.350
 which when we plant we know 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.880
 exactly where is the hose and 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.050
 we decide if we're going to want it two 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.900
 centimeters to the left 2 to the 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.950
 right two higher or lower 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.120
 then the integration as I said 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:01.430
 was irrigation and sowing agriculture 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.680
 precision and harvest with a novelty 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.350
 consellera who harvests two furrows together 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.030
 simultaneously today in Argentina not 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.390
 there is such a technology to this one 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.700
 there are in principle only 55 farms with 800 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.990
 hectares when this grows the 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.530
 restriction is not next to the offer 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.630
 that is, the machine is available and if 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.790
 there would be demand we could bring it without 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:26.180
 problems we are generating if a mass 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.500
 criticism so for how this points to 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.360
 efficiency would not make much sense 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.560
 have so many machines and few hectares 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.180
 to harvest 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.630
 today with the machines that we have 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:38.440
 reach to cover that area but this 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.000
 yes no doubt with what happened today there are already 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.350
 many producers asking for 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.350
 be able to incorporate technologies soon
