 I dont know 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.370

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.140
 attack her because she will not touch 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.940
 ladies and gentlemen two and a half minutes 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 natural 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.640
 the oral narration called for serenity 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.769
 simple because he just left very hurried 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.199
 centurion maneuver the auction the 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.920
 bouncing and bouncing away the mind of 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.930
 rebound near the goalkeeper great pocho 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.470
 centurion maneuver is on the way 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.240
 first that air then they keep going 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.520
 the men of color the auction the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.210
 Rebounding goalkeeper and scorer that 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.210
 shortens the difference 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.220
 to 0 winning racing 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.130
 the maneuver Núñez is being sought 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.370
 to take period in front of our cabin 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.650
 and josh to reject that ball for something 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.890
 he asked for quiet tranquility he saw that the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.170
 team went into the nervousness that 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.500
 imposed the party the set of 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.060
 zubeldía that has been winning 1 to 0 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.780
 just at the beginning 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.760
 to get the ball 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.409
 with that there I do not agree so much but 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.440
 surely that is from someone who 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.130
 contributes is someone who saw him a lot in 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.040
 that club I'm talking about artime that in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.890
 river not even an independent thing 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.619
 he scored independent anthology goals 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.290
 some goals a great river definer 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.930
 also but we are talking about a 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.670
 man who cut the point were ladies 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.670
 and gentlemen the cougar is coming 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.370
 do not 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.910
 as did football cigliotti to the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.780
 20 minutes of the second half is left 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.550
 come is very open russell 11 was another 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.290
 racing team we point it out from the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.270
 first minute until the 15 we told them 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.550
 a little while ago there is a team that 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.660
 recovered the memory remembers the 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.820
 simple and I was going to tell you guys 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.370
 think of the silver and holy faith that 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.810
 we play in another way a team that 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.850
 stopped racing that had run a lot and 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.660
 another that had santa colon activity 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.440
 faith pill won wins again brown 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.380
 for a magnificent magnificent pass is for 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.870
 gigliotti that starts it goes and goes to 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.660
 define very well an archer who tries to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.120
 escape is about bailing and cigliotti 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.030
 with all the nose of the great scorer goes 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.790
 to look it looked at it you know where it is 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.740
 look again and throw it down now 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.230
 you just have to make two goals to go 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.240
 two more goals to go to penalties is 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.070
 the second goal that cigliotti makes with the 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.500
 colored t-shirt both of visitor 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.300
 this against racing and the other for the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.640
 local tournament against san martín de san 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.190

 income and this with the number 20 and you 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.170
 say there is concern about what 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.880

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.480
 a while ago I highlighted it first 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.770
 Mariano with some detail of what 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.230
 I was doing in the second half 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.570
 one minute ago because he lost 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.960
 down the arch and here it seems to me that with 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.690
 help feels with help ends but 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.480
 has that appetite the sweet tooth likes the 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.139
 arch turns the captain puts it to 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.169
 colom to top 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.849
 he screams dark with his people ends 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.629
 being a bolazo it is true that it deviates 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.249
 the ball in corbalan the confusion 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.909
 archer by the way the 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:49.740
 ball no longer so much in the replay when 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:53.099
 enter the slow motion play from the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.710
 court from afar the auction enters by 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:05:00.349
 up in a little while, colom recovered the 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.349
 memory and is winning the match
