00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750 

your<00:00:00.269> take<00:00:00.510> on<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.840> delay<00:00:01.199> of<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.530> galaxy<00:00:02.220> s4

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
your take on this delay of the galaxy s4

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.309 
your take on this delay of the galaxy s4
I<00:00:02.790> mean<00:00:03.030> if<00:00:03.149> I<00:00:03.270> remember<00:00:03.629> correctly<00:00:03.659> there

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
I mean if I remember correctly there

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.110 
I mean if I remember correctly there
were<00:00:04.529> delays<00:00:04.710> when<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.100> iphone<00:00:05.220> 5<00:00:05.640> came<00:00:05.940> out

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
were delays when the iphone 5 came out

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.810 
were delays when the iphone 5 came out
as<00:00:06.299> well<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.560> if<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:07.859> fact<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> delay<00:00:08.790> of

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
as well and if in fact it is a delay of

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.669 
as well and if in fact it is a delay of
only<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.269> couple<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.809> weeks<00:00:09.990> or<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> few<00:00:10.349> weeks

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
only a couple of weeks or a few weeks

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.799 
only a couple of weeks or a few weeks
it's<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.340> trivial<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.969> insignificant<00:00:12.300> in

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
it's really trivial and insignificant in

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.660 
it's really trivial and insignificant in
the<00:00:12.870> grand<00:00:13.110> scheme<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.440> things<00:00:13.639> Samsung<00:00:14.639> is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the grand scheme of things Samsung is

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.450 
the grand scheme of things Samsung is
well<00:00:15.089> ahead<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.480> any<00:00:15.900> peak<00:00:16.260> sales<00:00:16.560> seasons<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
well ahead of any peak sales seasons and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.400 
well ahead of any peak sales seasons and
so<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> think<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.600> long<00:00:18.750> as<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.020> does<00:00:19.170> come

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
so I think that as long as it does come

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.050 
so I think that as long as it does come
out<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.800> all<00:00:19.859> indications<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
out and all indications from the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.519 
out and all indications from the
supplier<00:00:21.449> channel<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.320> will<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
supplier channel is that it's will I

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.670 
supplier channel is that it's will I
haven't<00:00:23.130> heard<00:00:23.340> anything<00:00:24.140> overly<00:00:25.140> ominous<00:00:25.529> in

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
haven't heard anything overly ominous in

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.960 
haven't heard anything overly ominous in
terms<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> being<00:00:26.250> delayed<00:00:26.699> indefinitely

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
terms of it being delayed indefinitely

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.810 
terms of it being delayed indefinitely
and<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.650> comes<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.550> well

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and so I do think it comes it's well

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.790 
and so I do think it comes it's well
ahead<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> iphone<00:00:30.720> 5s<00:00:31.199> or<00:00:31.410> whatever<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
ahead of the iphone 5s or whatever the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
ahead of the iphone 5s or whatever the
next<00:00:31.949> version<00:00:32.219> iphone<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.239> i<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
next version iphone is and i think that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
next version iphone is and i think that
does<00:00:34.110> give<00:00:34.320> Samsung<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.950> near<00:00:35.100> term<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.430> yet

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
does give Samsung the near term of yet

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
does give Samsung the near term of yet
and<00:00:35.760> yet<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.149> about<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> reviews<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.350> phone

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and yet what about the reviews a phone

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.569 
and yet what about the reviews a phone
with<00:00:38.070> no<00:00:38.309> soul<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:39.120> harsh<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:41.040> think

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
with no soul that's harsh so I think

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.160 
with no soul that's harsh so I think
that<00:00:41.790> might<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.239> bit<00:00:42.420> extreme<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that might be a bit extreme it's a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
that might be a bit extreme it's a
beautiful<00:00:43.620> piece<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.920> hardware<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.550> does<00:00:44.760> puts

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
beautiful piece of hardware it does puts

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.150 
beautiful piece of hardware it does puts
the<00:00:45.210> limits<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.629> display<00:00:46.079> technology<00:00:46.739> imaging

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the limits on display technology imaging

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
the limits on display technology imaging
technology<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.420> got<00:00:48.660> faster<00:00:49.140> internal

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
technology it's got faster internal

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.049 
technology it's got faster internal
hardware<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.219> got<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> qualcomm

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
hardware it's got the qualcomm

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.180 
hardware it's got the qualcomm
snapdragon<00:00:51.270> cpu<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> qualcomm<00:00:52.980> just

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
snapdragon cpu in it qualcomm just

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.340 
snapdragon cpu in it qualcomm just
reported<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> favorable<00:00:54.059> number<00:00:54.329> today<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
reported a favorable number today and so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.439 
reported a favorable number today and so
i<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.730> move<00:00:56.940> forward<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
i think that it is a move forward and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.240 
i think that it is a move forward and
smartphone<00:00:57.899> technology<00:00:58.079> i<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.010> still

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
smartphone technology i think it still

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
smartphone technology i think it still
is<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> revolutionary<00:01:00.329> category<00:01:00.960> maybe<00:01:01.559> this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
is a revolutionary category maybe this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.619 
is a revolutionary category maybe this
is<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:01.949> an<00:01:02.309> evolutionary<00:01:03.149> phone<00:01:03.390> within

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
is just an evolutionary phone within

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
is just an evolutionary phone within
that<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.010> either<00:01:05.580> way

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that we do see that so either way

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.850 
that we do see that so either way
Samsung<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.630> giving<00:01:06.900> Apple<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> run<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.740> its

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
Samsung is giving Apple a run for its

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.310 
Samsung is giving Apple a run for its
money<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.280> you've<00:01:08.580> been<00:01:08.610> pouring<00:01:09.090> through

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
money I know you've been pouring through

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
money I know you've been pouring through
Apple's<00:01:10.320> numbers<00:01:10.619> from<00:01:10.890> yesterday<00:01:11.430> what's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
Apple's numbers from yesterday what's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.670 
Apple's numbers from yesterday what's
your<00:01:12.180> biggest<00:01:12.420> take<00:01:12.720> away<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> think

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
your biggest take away what do you think

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
your biggest take away what do you think
is<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> most<00:01:14.119> important<00:01:15.119> thing<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.360> we

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
is the most important thing that we

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.940 
is the most important thing that we
should<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.869> paying<00:01:16.110> attention<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.650> from

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
should be paying attention to from

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
should be paying attention to from
Apple's<00:01:17.220> last<00:01:17.369> quarter<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.570> its

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
Apple's last quarter I really think its

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
Apple's last quarter I really think its
execution<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.619> execution<00:01:20.310> relative<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
execution and execution relative to the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.730 
execution and execution relative to the
competition<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.140> they've<00:01:22.350> got<00:01:22.530> two

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
competition and so they've got two

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
competition and so they've got two
problems<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> they're<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.210> against<00:01:24.630> lower

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
problems one is they're up against lower

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.359 
problems one is they're up against lower
margin<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:26.100> innovative<00:01:27.049> Android

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
margin and more innovative Android

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.499 
margin and more innovative Android
competition<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> other<00:01:29.880> fact<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
competition and the other fact is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.300 
competition and the other fact is
they've<00:01:30.720> moved<00:01:30.869> away<00:01:31.079> from<00:01:31.229> Samsung<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> low

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
they've moved away from Samsung as a low

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
they've moved away from Samsung as a low
cost<00:01:32.490> component<00:01:33.180> supplier<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.840> they're

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
cost component supplier so they're

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
cost component supplier so they're
getting<00:01:34.229> squeezed<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.740> both<00:01:34.920> ends<00:01:35.189> higher

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
getting squeezed on both ends higher

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.580 
getting squeezed on both ends higher
component<00:01:36.030> costs<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.540> lower<00:01:36.590> cost

examining<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:14.220> maybe<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> bit<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
examining it so maybe this is a bit of a

this<00:03:10.470> show<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:10.950> he<00:03:11.160> he<00:03:11.670> used<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> be<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> head

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
this show but he he used to be the head

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.930 
this show but he he used to be the head
of<00:03:12.390> google<00:03:12.870> china<00:03:13.200> he<00:03:13.830> worked<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.519> Apple<00:03:14.640> in

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
of google china he worked at Apple in

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.090 
of google china he worked at Apple in
China<00:03:15.180> Microsoft<00:03:16.050> he<00:03:16.500> doesn't<00:03:16.830> think<00:03:16.980> a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
China Microsoft he doesn't think a

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.830 
China Microsoft he doesn't think a
cheaper<00:03:17.430> iPhone<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.940> really<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.630> solution

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
cheaper iPhone is really the solution

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.690 
cheaper iPhone is really the solution
for<00:03:19.410> Apple<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.860> China<00:03:20.100> because<00:03:20.430> there<00:03:20.579> are

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
for Apple in China because there are

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.120 
for Apple in China because there are
just<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.239> many<00:03:21.530> low-cost<00:03:22.530> Android

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
just so many low-cost Android

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.280 
just so many low-cost Android
competitors<00:03:24.060> how<00:03:24.630> would<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.870> respond<00:03:25.230> to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
competitors how would you respond to

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.979 
competitors how would you respond to
that<00:03:25.470> well<00:03:26.100> if<00:03:26.400> Apple<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.299> doing<00:03:27.510> its<00:03:27.630> homework

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
that well if Apple is doing its homework

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.600 
that well if Apple is doing its homework
and<00:03:28.170> I'm<00:03:28.230> sure<00:03:28.440> they<00:03:28.590> are<00:03:28.620> they<00:03:29.130> will<00:03:29.310> come<00:03:29.489> to

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
and I'm sure they are they will come to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.100 
and I'm sure they are they will come to
that<00:03:29.700> determination<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.570> their<00:03:30.690> own<00:03:30.840> and

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
that determination on their own and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.390 
that determination on their own and
that's<00:03:31.470> why<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> say<00:03:31.739> what<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:31.950> do<00:03:32.040> know<00:03:32.370> is

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
that's why I say what I do know is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.190 
that's why I say what I do know is
they're<00:03:32.760> going<00:03:32.880> after<00:03:33.180> technology<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.049> can

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
they're going after technology that can

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.370 
they're going after technology that can
capitalize<00:03:34.860> on<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.760> TDD<00:03:36.090> LTE<00:03:36.120> 4G<00:03:37.019> network

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
capitalize on the TDD LTE 4G network

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.690 
capitalize on the TDD LTE 4G network
there<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.739> China<00:03:37.980> whether<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.430> ends<00:03:38.549> up<00:03:38.670> being

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
there in China whether it ends up being

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.789 
there in China whether it ends up being
a<00:03:38.910> cheaper<00:03:39.209> phone<00:03:39.420> or<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.780> better<00:03:40.320> phone<00:03:40.620> or

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
a cheaper phone or a better phone or

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.620 
a cheaper phone or a better phone or
again<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> larger<00:03:41.610> screen<00:03:41.880> size<00:03:41.910> phone<00:03:42.299> because

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
again a larger screen size phone because

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.940 
again a larger screen size phone because
I<00:03:42.720> do<00:03:42.780> believe<00:03:43.140> they<00:03:43.290> are<00:03:43.320> looking<00:03:43.709> at<00:03:43.829> that

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
I do believe they are looking at that

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.280 
I do believe they are looking at that
category<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:45.299> could<00:03:45.660> be<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.959> answer<00:03:46.049> for

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
category that could be the answer for

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.470 
category that could be the answer for
them<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.950> what<00:03:47.160> about<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> SmartWatch<00:03:47.940> what

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
them so what about a SmartWatch what

them so what about a SmartWatch what
about<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.720> TV<00:03:49.049> one<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.040> these<00:03:50.160> things<00:03:50.340> gonna

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
about a TV one of these things gonna

a<00:04:00.600> software<00:04:01.170> move<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.470> what<00:04:01.620> really<00:04:01.950> launched

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
a software move is what really launched

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.110 
a software move is what really launched
this<00:04:02.880> story<00:04:03.500> most<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.620> decade<00:04:04.920> ago<00:04:05.010> now<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.489> so

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
this story most a decade ago now and so

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.900 
this story most a decade ago now and so
does<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.810> come<00:04:07.019> from<00:04:07.230> some<00:04:07.890> new<00:04:08.400> software

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
does it come from some new software

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.599 
does it come from some new software
approach<00:04:09.540> some<00:04:10.260> new<00:04:10.410> approach<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.430> TV

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
approach some new approach to the TV

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.250 
approach some new approach to the TV
because<00:04:11.820> apple<00:04:12.209> TV<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.540> happening<00:04:13.109> in<00:04:13.200> the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
because apple TV is happening in the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.020 
because apple TV is happening in the
background<00:04:13.350> already<00:04:13.980> maybe<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:14.489> get<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.640> TV<00:04:14.850> but

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
background already maybe we get a TV but

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.659 
background already maybe we get a TV but
we<00:04:15.150> already<00:04:15.299> have<00:04:15.600> apple<00:04:16.470> TV<00:04:16.829> set-top<00:04:17.100> boxes

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
we already have apple TV set-top boxes

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.279 
we already have apple TV set-top boxes
we<00:04:17.820> have<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.150> content<00:04:18.600> going<00:04:18.840> out<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.140> its

we have the content going out to its

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.320 
we have the content going out to its
devices<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:20.250> these<00:04:20.400> things<00:04:20.609> are<00:04:20.789> happening<00:04:21.269> in

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
devices so these things are happening in

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.760 
devices so these things are happening in
the<00:04:21.390> background<00:04:21.539> i'd<00:04:21.930> like<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.289> see<00:04:22.470> something

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
the background i'd like to see something

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.370 
the background i'd like to see something
bigger<00:04:23.220> than<00:04:23.550> simply<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.599> new<00:04:24.900> hardware

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
bigger than simply a new hardware

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.520 
bigger than simply a new hardware
variant<00:04:25.830> on<00:04:25.979> something

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
already doing maybe it's something like

analysts have said actually Apple could

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.070 
analysts have said actually Apple could
vastly<00:04:32.620> improve<00:04:33.250> on<00:04:33.460> exactly<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.420> execution

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080

can<00:04:48.100> make<00:04:48.280> just<00:04:48.520> on<00:04:48.730> some<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:49.060> those

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
can make just on some of those

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.430 
can make just on some of those
initiatives<00:04:49.570> that<00:04:49.870> they've<00:04:50.050> already<00:04:50.230> gotten

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
initiatives that they've already gotten

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.570 
initiatives that they've already gotten
started<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.889> then<00:04:50.980> you'd<00:04:51.130> like<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.370> think

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
started and then you'd like to think

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.879 
started and then you'd like to think
that<00:04:51.610> Apple<00:04:52.000> still<00:04:52.210> has<00:04:52.389> it<00:04:52.570> within<00:04:53.139> itself<00:04:53.590> to

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
that Apple still has it within itself to

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.440 
that Apple still has it within itself to
dream<00:04:54.160> up<00:04:54.310> something<00:04:54.550> we<00:04:54.850> haven't<00:04:55.120> thought<00:04:55.389> of

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
dream up something we haven't thought of

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.970 
dream up something we haven't thought of
but<00:04:55.960> there<00:04:56.050> are<00:04:56.110> other<00:04:56.200> things<00:04:56.440> going<00:04:56.620> on<00:04:56.740> for

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
but there are other things going on for

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.590 
but there are other things going on for
Apple<00:04:57.250> as<00:04:57.370> well<00:04:57.550> it's<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.180> vertically

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
Apple as well it's a vertically

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.480 
Apple as well it's a vertically
integrated<00:04:58.630> story<00:04:59.350> some<00:04:59.800> of<00:04:59.919> its<00:05:00.040> competition

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
integrated story some of its competition

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.760 
integrated story some of its competition
like<00:05:00.820> Samsung<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.450> capitalizing<00:05:02.260> on<00:05:02.350> using

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
like Samsung is capitalizing on using

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.500 
like Samsung is capitalizing on using
chips<00:05:03.040> like<00:05:03.190> Qualcomm<00:05:03.669> that<00:05:03.880> just<00:05:04.060> reported

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
chips like Qualcomm that just reported

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.420 
chips like Qualcomm that just reported
and<00:05:04.660> that's<00:05:05.590> allowing<00:05:06.040> them<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.220> get<00:05:06.310> to

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
and that's allowing them to get to

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.040 
and that's allowing them to get to
market<00:05:06.610> faster<00:05:06.730> them<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:07.330> maybe<00:05:07.540> even<00:05:07.630> Apple

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
market faster them so maybe even Apple

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.659 
market faster them so maybe even Apple
needs<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.470> change<00:05:08.830> its<00:05:08.980> business<00:05:09.310> model<00:05:09.340> and

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
needs to change its business model and

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.570 
needs to change its business model and
business<00:05:10.000> thinking<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.360> little<00:05:10.450> bit
