00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
just as much as where you're going

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.120 
just as much as where you're going
especially<00:02:04.520> with<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.620> compliance<00:02:06.620> box<00:02:06.890> that

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
go on everything the rearview version

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.930 
go on everything the rearview version
however<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:10.040> completely<00:02:10.160> different

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
however is completely different

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.670 
however is completely different
there's<00:02:11.420> no<00:02:11.540> obstruction<00:02:12.140> there<00:02:12.290> at<00:02:12.440> all

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
there's no obstruction there at all

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.800 
there's no obstruction there at all
maybe<00:02:13.070> slightly<00:02:13.790> from<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.090> headrest<00:02:14.510> but

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
maybe slightly from the headrest but

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.580 
maybe slightly from the headrest but
nothing<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.230> any<00:02:16.160> great<00:02:16.520> degree<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.470> think

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
nothing of any great degree so I think

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.900 
nothing of any great degree so I think
really<00:02:18.980> they<00:02:19.250> could<00:02:19.460> have<00:02:19.550> put<00:02:19.700> bigger

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
really they could have put bigger

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.270 
really they could have put bigger
mirrors<00:02:20.240> on<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> side<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.860> know<00:02:21.980> I'd<00:02:22.130> rather
