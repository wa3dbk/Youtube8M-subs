00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.820
 and then people finally arrived the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.039
 expected and saw from the epcot that you prevent 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.260
 400 million times I delayed 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.330
 do what I wanted to make sure that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.000
 my opinions were the same lines 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.010
 a year from now in two years I think 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.660
 that I reached a point of maturity with 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.880
 a product that I'll be able to 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 turn my opinion on it 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.270
 accurately and it will not change that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.399
 that he had delivered the product 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.829
 and also in love with him because I 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.930
 Now I'm avoiding doing analysis of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.129
 products as soon as I receive without 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.750
 Later on, let's take a look at the boxwood 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.910
 Good people stay until four in the morning. 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.219
 agreed to buy the package a model 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.809
 It's worse, sport is the cheapest and I 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.960
 I really do not recommend that you spend 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.699
 more than you would spend with a model 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.370
 of these because it is a product 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.739
 who will receive an update 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.360
 probably annual then spend a lot 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.460
 money with something that will become obsolete 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.400
 it's never really a smart thing 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.119
 so epcot it is expensive even model 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.990
 input 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.900
 we make him become a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.180
 product very curious because it not only 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.880
 is a technological device as well as 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.159
 he is a famous fashion lord of people 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.810
 of the fashion world were obviously paid 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.509
 to use the push then they are 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.670
 positioning a way that is not just the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.579
 technological partner as well as a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.659
 fashion accessory and yes it is a watch 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.630
 very beautiful 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.000
 only I think frankly none 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.189
 another clock will be more significant 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 for me at least 50 than the clock 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.700
 that my millionth girlfriend who is today 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.220
 will not be outdated in a year 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.439
 so why am I only fashion although the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 design is not bad for more than 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.240
 I do not like the square design I prefer 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.690
 a round clock for your staff at 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.170
 fashion item the package is not 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.080
 consistent but in the technology 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.840
 I've really liked him and he's something. 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.850
 practical does not have to deny it makes 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.830
 My life is easier, wanting or not. 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.290
 is a product for everyone of course 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.120
 not it is essential much less what it is 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.380
 essential to live as we are the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.120
 water is p food and it is a shelter so I 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.620
 I think the package is not essential to 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.650
 No one but he can help 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.540
 you can see on your profile it can be 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.340
 useful for you and you what I like 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.510
 in it and there you see if this can 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.610
 engage professional 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.380
 I'm the kind of person who keeps watching. 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.970
 notifications and war with the feeling 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.980
 so often even when people 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.130
 We do not have a notification, we'll call you. 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.360
 only promise one thing there with the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.790
 You may not realize this we 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.990
 do this several times a day 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.090
 after I started using the package 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.950
 although I have used it since the first 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.380
 Take the version of what's in it for me. 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.180
 I have a review here on the channel itself. 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.460
 so it's very funny professional 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.750
 there at the beginning is a new technology this 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.490
 I do not have to deny and all 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.420
 new technologies are crawling a first 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.360
 ipad 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.209
 the first iphone you remember teaching 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.100
 he remembered they were much much worse than 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.840
 that the models today imagine that the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.020
 second hospitalization of the package is the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.739
 better for people to buy if it is 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.540
 Of course they are not like me. 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.010
 nor obsessed by technology 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.080
 if you like it very much and I cross with it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.150
 You eat because today I'm very 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.440
 more detached on the cell phone 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.030
 so that I can leave it in the 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.820
 backpack I left my pocket 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.600
 I need to see him all the time. 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.070
 finally I get half in quotes 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.920
 satisfied by can then it is basically 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.360
 an extension of your cell phone in the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.910
 that you can receive the notifications 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.860
 on your wrist and this is much more 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.690
 that many people imagine I would not say 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.480
 the package is much more than purely 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.519
 this mainly in the fitness sector 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.410
 that they have positioned themselves as 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.840
 stronger than the EPCOT monitors 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.790
 heartbeats and 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.260
 completely useless there is no 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.790
 fitness bracelet today that really 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.709
 can monitor your beat 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.080
 cardiac artery that is completely 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.420
 essential to know your spending 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.970
 caloric and physical effort and 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.920
 accurately measure your 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.690
 physical activity any problem 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.580
 when you get sweaty and may no longer 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.569
 they can get into the heart 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.269
 it's not just him 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.430
 we have the top line bracelet as already the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.229
 Level 3 that you just launched that also 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.330
 they can not keep their beat 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.490
 heart when you start to get under 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.650
 also the applications are actually was 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.990
 the ornaments on the bridge today are not much 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.610
 I finally believe that the ipod is 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.680
 useful I did not regret buying 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.330
 it's just that you keep in mind that 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.680
 especially for those who like to stay 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.260
 looking at cell phone notification time 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.280
 and think that buying an ipod is a 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.380
 solution 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.750
 I would say yes is a solution but I 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.180
 I invite you to think about how he 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.760
 solve this problem can solve the problem 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.080
 Your Notification View Issue 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.030
 attaching an appliance that 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.550
 Can you see everything that happens in the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.010
 your cell phone on your wrist then it ends 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.190
 being an even more invasive way of 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.720
 show notifications but resolve the 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.360
 problem picking your side dreads having 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.530
 Yes, this was the analysis of the hotel. 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.510
 that you have enjoyed 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.500
 I am andrÃ© pineli all very nice 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.070
 so cool 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.070
 bye
