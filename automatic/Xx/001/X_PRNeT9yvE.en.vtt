I<00:00:32.520> mostly<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> secret<00:00:33.630> spots<00:00:33.870> which<00:00:34.050> could

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
I mostly have a secret spots which could

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.440 
I mostly have a secret spots which could
be<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> bit<00:00:34.559> tricky<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> bit<00:00:35.910> hard

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
be a bit tricky to get to a bit hard

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.150 
be a bit tricky to get to a bit hard
maybe<00:00:37.219> technique<00:00:39.410> perfecting<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:41.040> know

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
maybe technique perfecting you know

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.000 
maybe technique perfecting you know
doing<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> few<00:00:41.730> times<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.950> this<00:00:43.950> one

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
doing it a few times to get to this one

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.610 
doing it a few times to get to this one
is<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.329> simple<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.200> very

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is really really simple and very

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.170 
is really really simple and very
effective<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> show<00:00:48.149> you

effective so I'm just going to show you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.299 
effective so I'm just going to show you
the<00:00:48.800> surroundings<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.280> know

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the surroundings just so you know

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.520 
the surroundings just so you know
exactly<00:00:50.550> where<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:52.020> should<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.379> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
exactly where it is you should know this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.869 
exactly where it is you should know this
spot<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.039> lot<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.219> people<00:00:53.460> come<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.730> in

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
spot because a lot of people come up in

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.540 
spot because a lot of people come up in
here<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.780> look<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> guard<00:00:56.010> tower<00:00:56.070> over

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
here so we look in the guard tower over

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.569 
here so we look in the guard tower over
there<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
there and you can get up to it up this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.290 
there and you can get up to it up this
hill<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.090> also<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> hill<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> came<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.309> once

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
hill and also the hill I came up so once

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.670 
hill and also the hill I came up so once
again<00:01:03.480> you're<00:01:03.899> gonna<00:01:03.960> come<00:01:04.229> over<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.530> this

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
again you're gonna come over to this

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.820 
again you're gonna come over to this
rock<00:01:05.309> over<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.619> between

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
rock over here and just there in between

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.149 
rock over here and just there in between
the<00:01:08.040> two<00:01:08.310> branches<00:01:08.810> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.200> solid<00:01:10.619> area

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the two branches which is a solid area

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.940 
the two branches which is a solid area
where<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.820> land<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
where you can land on there you go you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.700 
where you can land on there you go you
don't<00:01:14.070> need<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:15.119> sprint<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.810> leap<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't need to really sprint and leap and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
don't need to really sprint and leap and
go<00:01:16.770> Fricks<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.299> straight

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
go Fricks if we do you will go straight

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.060 
go Fricks if we do you will go straight
past<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> land<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> map<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.509> die

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
past it and land out of the map and die

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.950 
past it and land out of the map and die
so<00:01:23.070> why<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.780> just

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
so why are you in it you can see just

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
so why are you in it you can see just
down<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.380> very<00:01:25.650> well<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.070> branches<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
down there very well that branches in

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
down there very well that branches in
the<00:01:26.700> Weibull<00:01:27.380> turnarounds<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the Weibull turnarounds you can see the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.950 
the Weibull turnarounds you can see the
hole<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.280> area<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.479> good<00:01:30.750> for

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
hole in this area it really is good for

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
hole in this area it really is good for
that<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.290> no<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.189> expect<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.729> there

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that and no one will expect you up there

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.230 
that and no one will expect you up there
and<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.900> also<00:01:34.079> jump<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.909> take<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and you can also jump up here and take a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.539 
and you can also jump up here and take a
few<00:01:36.420> shots<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.810> people<00:01:36.990> driver<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.220> take

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
few shots of people driver you can take

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
few shots of people driver you can take
your<00:01:38.670> blocks<00:01:38.909> straight<00:01:39.119> away<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.439> can

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
your blocks straight away if not you can

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.170 
your blocks straight away if not you can
shoot<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.460> kill<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:41.939> they'll

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
shoot if you don't kill them they'll

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.520 
shoot if you don't kill them they'll
probably<00:01:42.210> think<00:01:42.570> no<00:01:42.720> they<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:42.960> shot<00:01:43.200> me<00:01:43.350> then

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
probably think no they all shot me then

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.310 
probably think no they all shot me then
just<00:01:44.399> come<00:01:44.970> over<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.270> investigate<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
just come over and investigate and you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080 
just come over and investigate and you
can<00:01:46.470> take<00:01:46.619> them<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:47.310> once<00:01:47.909> people

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
can take them out just then once people

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
can take them out just then once people
know<00:01:48.329> you're<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.570> though<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:49.079> careful

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
know you're up there though be careful

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.280 
know you're up there though be careful
because<00:01:49.880> they<00:01:50.880> will<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.360> gone<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.840> fear<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
because they will be gone in fear so

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.980 
because they will be gone in fear so
this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.159> gonna<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.640> from<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.000> perspectives

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
this is gonna be from the perspectives

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.300 
this is gonna be from the perspectives
of<00:01:55.140> people<00:01:55.200> running<00:01:55.740> around<00:01:55.799> these<00:01:56.040> corners

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
of people running around these corners

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100 
of people running around these corners
