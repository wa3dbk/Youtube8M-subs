fun for the kids to do all the research
so<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.800> think<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.070> big<00:02:51.220> question<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:52.360> this

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
so I think the big question is is this

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.690 
so I think the big question is is this
game<00:02:52.870> worth<00:02:53.140> having<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> buy<00:02:53.710> a<00:02:53.740> setup<00:02:54.130> kit<00:02:54.460> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
game worth having to buy a setup kit and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.910 
game worth having to buy a setup kit and
having<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.720> buy<00:02:55.840> individual<00:02:56.440> characters

in<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.310> well<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.700> does<00:03:00.940> get<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:01.240> little

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
in it well it does get a little

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.960 
in it well it does get a little
expensive<00:03:01.750> but<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.710> fun<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.250> going<00:03:03.460> to<00:03:03.700> store
