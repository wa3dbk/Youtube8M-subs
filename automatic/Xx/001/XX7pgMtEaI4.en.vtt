the<00:04:40.140> pineapple<00:04:41.140> I<00:04:42.000> think<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.060> only<00:04:43.120> problem<00:04:43.660> I

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
the pineapple I think the only problem I

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.350 
the pineapple I think the only problem I
had<00:04:43.930> with<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:45.190> dog<00:04:45.490> although<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.000> tasted

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
had with this dog although it tasted

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.330 
had with this dog although it tasted
great<00:04:46.480> it<00:04:47.050> was<00:04:47.200> nine<00:04:47.410> dollars<00:04:47.890> just<00:04:48.070> for<00:04:48.190> the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
great it was nine dollars just for the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
great it was nine dollars just for the
hot<00:04:48.490> dog<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:49.450> I<00:04:49.930> think<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.770> was<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.360> little

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
hot dog and I think that was a little

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.230 
hot dog and I think that was a little
over<00:04:52.600> priced<00:04:53.050> by<00:04:53.500> about<00:04:53.770> ford<00:04:54.550> i<00:04:54.670> would<00:04:55.000> i

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
over priced by about ford i would i

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.970 
over priced by about ford i would i
would<00:04:55.360> probably<00:04:56.020> paid<00:04:56.200> five<00:04:56.230> dollars<00:04:56.830> no

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
would probably paid five dollars no

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.310 
would probably paid five dollars no
problem<00:04:57.370> for<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.700> dog<00:04:57.910> but<00:04:58.510> nine<00:04:58.810> dollars

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
problem for that dog but nine dollars

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.170 
problem for that dog but nine dollars
and<00:04:59.680> I<00:05:00.040> didn't<00:05:00.250> really<00:05:00.370> want<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.670> get<00:05:00.820> into<00:05:00.880> it

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.900 
and I didn't really want to get into it
in<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.630> video<00:05:01.930> maybe<00:05:02.290> I<00:05:02.380> should<00:05:02.790> but<00:05:03.790> I<00:05:03.850> think

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
in the video maybe I should but I think

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.360
