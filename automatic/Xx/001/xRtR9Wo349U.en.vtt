00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.390 
on this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:06.060> install<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:07.319> continuous<00:00:07.890> ink<00:00:08.160> system

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
to install the continuous ink system

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.180 
to install the continuous ink system
from<00:00:08.849> city<00:00:09.179> ink<00:00:09.330> Express<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.740> abscence

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
from city ink Express on the abscence

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.039 
from city ink Express on the abscence
file<00:00:11.550> SDX<00:00:12.650> 9400<00:00:14.059> so<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.269> open<00:00:15.570> up<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> lint

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
file SDX 9400 so going open up the lint

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.109 
file SDX 9400 so going open up the lint
and<00:00:16.970> we're<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> select<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:20.119> change

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and we're going to select the change

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.630 
and we're going to select the change
cartridge<00:00:21.869> button<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.070> purely<00:00:23.340> just

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
cartridge button so that is purely just

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.089 
cartridge button so that is purely just
to<00:00:23.820> get<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> cartridge<00:00:24.660> block<00:00:24.960> over<00:00:25.710> into<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
to get the cartridge block over into the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.670 
to get the cartridge block over into the
middle<00:00:26.369> over<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> first

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
middle over here so one of the first

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
middle over here so one of the first
things<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.460> do<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> remove<00:00:30.179> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
things we need to do is remove this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.840 
things we need to do is remove this
cartridge<00:00:31.050> cover<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.279> has<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.730> be

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
cartridge cover so this has to be

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.840 
cartridge cover so this has to be
removed<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.630> get<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> ink<00:00:35.040> lines<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.640> allow

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
removed to get the ink lines to allow

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.240 
removed to get the ink lines to allow
enough<00:00:36.090> room<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.690> ink<00:00:36.899> lines<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.950> over

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
enough room for the ink lines so over

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
enough room for the ink lines so over
here<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:38.879> hand<00:00:38.910> side<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> car

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
here on the right hand side is the car

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
here on the right hand side is the car
is<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> clamp<00:00:40.800> basically<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.820> need<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.030> put<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
is the clamp basically we need to put a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.779 
is the clamp basically we need to put a
screwdriver<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.440> twist<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
screwdriver in here twist it to the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150 
screwdriver in here twist it to the
right<00:00:44.969> hand<00:00:45.270> side<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.530> pop<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> cover

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
right hand side and then pop the cover

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
right hand side and then pop the cover
off<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.270> very<00:00:48.390> important<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.170> do

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
off so it's very important when you do

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.170 
off so it's very important when you do
this<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.129> try<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> slowly

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
this that you do try and do it slowly

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
this that you do try and do it slowly
because<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> possible<00:00:52.230> sometimes<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
because it is possible sometimes to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.470 
because it is possible sometimes to
break<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> pin<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.260> lid<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> too

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
break a pin on the lid if you do it too

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.200 
break a pin on the lid if you do it too
quickly<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:59.489> put<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.789> screwdriver<00:01:00.420> in

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
quickly so you put your screwdriver in

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.320 
quickly so you put your screwdriver in
force<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.390> over<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:04.049> hand<00:01:04.260> side<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
force it over to the right hand side and

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.200 
force it over to the right hand side and
twist<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> clamp<00:01:08.130> off

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.170 

and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.860> pull<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.890> cover<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.520> light

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and then just pull the cover off light

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.560 
and then just pull the cover off light
side<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.440> put<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.800> to<00:01:17.010> one<00:01:17.160> side<00:01:17.570> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
side so you can put that to one side and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.390 
side so you can put that to one side and
save<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.110> ever<00:01:19.350> needs<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.950> back<00:01:20.190> on

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
save it if ever needs to go back on

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.219 
save it if ever needs to go back on
again<00:01:22.790> but<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.000> while<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.510> this<00:01:24.660> position

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
again but so while it's in this position

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.420 
again but so while it's in this position
what<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.470> need<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.250> need<00:01:26.370> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
what we need to do is we need to

what we need to do is we need to
manually<00:01:26.970> push<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.420> over<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> left<00:01:29.090> just

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
manually push it over to the left just

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.080 
manually push it over to the left just
out<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> way<00:01:30.690> for<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.990> second<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:32.970> we

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090

left hand side of the printer there we

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.680 
left hand side of the printer there we
are<00:03:21.700> I'm<00:03:22.700> going<00:03:22.879> to<00:03:22.940> leap<00:03:23.120> up<00:03:23.329> while<00:03:23.540> we're

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
are I'm going to leap up while we're

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and have it just took down this side

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.110 
and have it just took down this side
here<00:03:31.180> neatly<00:03:32.180> there<00:03:32.989> we<00:03:33.079> are<00:03:33.639> file<00:03:34.639> I'm<00:03:34.909> going

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
here neatly there we are file I'm going

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.629 
here neatly there we are file I'm going
to<00:03:35.299> pop<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.480> laughing<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:37.010> what<00:03:37.190> we<00:03:37.310> need<00:03:37.489> to

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
to pop that laughing so what we need to

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.789 
to pop that laughing so what we need to
check<00:03:37.849> actually<00:03:38.299> before<00:03:38.450> we<00:03:38.810> continue<00:03:39.049> is

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
check actually before we continue is

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.369 
check actually before we continue is
that<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.639> cartridge<00:03:41.090> block<00:03:41.389> can<00:03:41.720> move<00:03:41.989> all

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
that the cartridge block can move all

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.530 
that the cartridge block can move all
the<00:03:42.440> way<00:03:42.650> over<00:03:43.129> to<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.459> left-hand<00:03:43.909> side<00:03:44.030> and

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
the way over to the left-hand side and

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.110 
the way over to the left-hand side and
the<00:03:45.200> right-hand<00:03:45.230> side<00:03:45.980> without<00:03:46.340> causing<00:03:46.940> any

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
the right-hand side without causing any

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.899 
the right-hand side without causing any
problems<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:48.650> make<00:03:48.889> sure<00:03:48.920> that's<00:03:49.280> down<00:03:49.579> firmly

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
problems so make sure that's down firmly

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.930 
problems so make sure that's down firmly
we're<00:03:50.750> going<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.930> manually<00:03:51.230> push<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.909> all<00:03:52.909> the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
we're going to manually push it all the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.420 
we're going to manually push it all the
way<00:03:53.090> over<00:03:53.299> to<00:03:53.599> the<00:03:53.720> left<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.980> then<00:03:55.280> we're

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
way over to the left and then we're

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.509 
way over to the left and then we're
going<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.639> pull<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.030> back<00:03:56.120> out<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:57.519> we're

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
going to pull it back out and we're

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.289 
going to pull it back out and we're
going<00:03:58.699> to<00:03:58.730> manually<00:04:01.579> all<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.940> way<00:04:02.030> over

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
going to manually all the way over

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.330 
going to manually all the way over
to<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.599> right<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.590> what<00:04:03.680> you're<00:04:03.829> checking<00:04:04.099> is

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
to the right so what you're checking is

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.129 
to the right so what you're checking is
that<00:04:04.549> these<00:04:04.760> ink<00:04:05.030> light<00:04:05.209> this<00:04:05.510> ink<00:04:05.750> line<00:04:05.930> is

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
that these ink light this ink line is

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.580 
that these ink light this ink line is
not<00:04:06.319> too<00:04:06.560> tight<00:04:06.859> or<00:04:07.609> too<00:04:07.669> loose<00:04:08.109> if<00:04:09.109> it's<00:04:09.319> too

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
not too tight or too loose if it's too

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.530 
not too tight or too loose if it's too
tight<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:10.250> won't<00:04:10.549> reach<00:04:10.790> when<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.180> comes<00:04:11.359> back

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
tight it won't reach when it comes back

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.629 
tight it won't reach when it comes back
there<00:04:11.840> if<00:04:12.139> it's<00:04:12.319> too<00:04:12.620> loose<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:14.690> will<00:04:14.750> snag<00:04:15.639> so

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
there if it's too loose it will snag so

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.849 
there if it's too loose it will snag so
again<00:04:16.970> just<00:04:17.000> repeat<00:04:17.449> the<00:04:17.780> process<00:04:18.019> over<00:04:18.560> to

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
again just repeat the process over to

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.230 
again just repeat the process over to
the<00:04:18.979> right<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:20.030> over<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.810> left<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.970> like

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
the right and over to the left so like

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.230 
the right and over to the left so like
that's<00:04:23.780> at<00:04:24.139> just<00:04:24.470> right<00:04:24.710> now<00:04:24.979> so<00:04:25.789> after<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.180> did

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
that's at just right now so after I did

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.270 
that's at just right now so after I did
this<00:04:26.539> cable<00:04:26.960> up<00:04:27.050> down<00:04:27.289> here<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:27.889> one<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.099> the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
this cable up down here so one of the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.159 
this cable up down here so one of the
next<00:04:28.400> things<00:04:28.610> we<00:04:28.940> need<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.150> do<00:04:29.419> is<00:04:29.630> on<00:04:29.780> top<00:04:30.020> of

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
next things we need to do is on top of

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.710 
next things we need to do is on top of
the<00:04:30.229> continuous<00:04:30.800> ink<00:04:31.010> system<00:04:31.449> so<00:04:32.449> you<00:04:32.510> will

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
the continuous ink system so you will

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.100 
the continuous ink system so you will
see<00:04:33.159> four<00:04:34.159> large<00:04:34.430> plugs<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.150> four<00:04:35.449> small<00:04:35.810> plug

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
see four large plugs and four small plug

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.050 
see four large plugs and four small plug
so<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.470> large<00:04:36.680> plugs<00:04:37.010> are<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:37.340> refill<00:04:37.729> holes

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
so the large plugs are you refill holes

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.270 
so the large plugs are you refill holes
so<00:04:38.900> when<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.139> need<00:04:39.289> to<00:04:39.440> top<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.770> continuous

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
so when you need to top the continuous

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.700 
so when you need to top the continuous
ink<00:04:40.490> system<00:04:40.699> up<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.659> take<00:04:41.900> this<00:04:42.050> large<00:04:42.349> plug

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
ink system up you take this large plug

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.830 
ink system up you take this large plug
out<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:43.159> pour<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.580> in<00:04:43.789> or<00:04:44.060> use<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.300> syringe

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
out and pour it in or use a syringe

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.490 
out and pour it in or use a syringe
these<00:04:45.770> four<00:04:46.099> wholes<00:04:46.340> are<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.639> air<00:04:46.760> balance

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
these four wholes are the air balance

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.680 
these four wholes are the air balance
chambers<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:49.190> we<00:04:49.370> need<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.669> remove<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.449> small

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
chambers so we need to remove the small

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.010 
chambers so we need to remove the small
flat<00:04:51.050> plugs<00:04:51.349> from<00:04:51.560> these<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.750> then<00:04:53.900> we're

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
flat plugs from these and then we're

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.580 
flat plugs from these and then we're
going<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.199> need<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.470> install<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:55.520> air<00:04:55.669> filters

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
going to need to install the air filters

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.990 
going to need to install the air filters
so<00:04:57.590> when<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.770> air<00:04:57.889> filters<00:04:58.340> arrive<00:04:58.639> when<00:04:58.909> you

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
so when the air filters arrive when you

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.760 
so when the air filters arrive when you
look<00:04:59.180> at<00:04:59.330> them<00:04:59.510> they<00:05:00.229> have<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.469> narrow<00:05:00.830> pointed

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
look at them they have a narrow pointed

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.430 
look at them they have a narrow pointed
and<00:05:02.069> then<00:05:02.280> assured<00:05:02.759> fattened<00:05:03.449> they<00:05:04.110> need<00:05:04.289> to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
and then assured fattened they need to

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.399 
and then assured fattened they need to
be<00:05:04.560> inserted<00:05:05.300> short<00:05:06.300> fat<00:05:06.599> end<00:05:06.870> down<00:05:09.229> just<00:05:10.229> like

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
be inserted short fat end down just like

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:17.330 
be inserted short fat end down just like
our<00:05:14.300> three<00:05:15.300> any<00:05:16.289> well<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:16.770> then<00:05:17.129> we're<00:05:17.220> going

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
our three any well and then we're going

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.089 
our three any well and then we're going
to<00:05:17.370> pop<00:05:17.580> this<00:05:18.289> over<00:05:19.289> on<00:05:19.379> the<00:05:19.530> left-hand<00:05:19.979> side

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
to pop this over on the left-hand side

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.270 
to pop this over on the left-hand side
like<00:05:21.060> so<00:05:21.139> so<00:05:22.139> it's<00:05:22.289> very<00:05:22.440> important<00:05:23.039> that<00:05:23.190> the

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
like so so it's very important that the

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.909 
like so so it's very important that the
continuous<00:05:23.819> ink<00:05:24.030> system<00:05:24.419> is<00:05:24.599> sat<00:05:24.900> in<00:05:25.349> the<00:05:25.710> same

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
continuous ink system is sat in the same

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.770 
continuous ink system is sat in the same
level<00:05:26.310> as<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.639> base<00:05:26.819> of<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.180> printer<00:05:27.569> like

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
level as the base of the printer like

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.249 
level as the base of the printer like
this

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
this

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.159 
this
if<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:28.889> system<00:05:29.069> is<00:05:29.340> raised<00:05:29.750> we<00:05:30.750> put<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.050> on

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
if the system is raised we put it on

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.469 
if the system is raised we put it on
shelves<00:05:31.620> above<00:05:31.740> it<00:05:32.220> will<00:05:32.490> flood<00:05:32.789> your<00:05:32.819> printer

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
shelves above it will flood your printer

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.749 
shelves above it will flood your printer
so<00:05:33.690> it's<00:05:33.810> very<00:05:33.990> important<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:35.220> kept<00:05:35.520> on

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
so it's very important that is kept on

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.399 
so it's very important that is kept on
the<00:05:35.880> same<00:05:36.120> level<00:05:36.330> as<00:05:36.659> the<00:05:36.870> base<00:05:37.050> of<00:05:37.080> the

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
the same level as the base of the

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.010 
the same level as the base of the
printer<00:05:37.940> so<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.300> main<00:05:39.479> part<00:05:39.780> of<00:05:39.900> the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
printer so that the main part of the

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.710 
printer so that the main part of the
system<00:05:40.380> is<00:05:40.530> now<00:05:40.800> installed<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:42.210> we<00:05:42.330> just<00:05:42.509> need

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
system is now installed so we just need

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.309 
system is now installed so we just need
to<00:05:42.990> accept<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.830> cartridges<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:45.229> then<00:05:46.229> we're

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
to accept the cartridges and then we're

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.170 
to accept the cartridges and then we're
going<00:05:46.440> to<00:05:46.470> do<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.680> scan<00:05:47.099> and<00:05:47.370> just<00:05:47.789> to<00:05:47.909> show<00:05:48.120> you

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
going to do a scan and just to show you

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.899 
going to do a scan and just to show you
that<00:05:48.449> it<00:05:48.569> does<00:05:48.960> actually<00:05:49.110> work<00:05:49.380> okay<00:05:50.099> so<00:05:52.909> we

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
that it does actually work okay so we

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.459 
that it does actually work okay so we
can<00:05:54.090> now<00:05:54.240> close<00:05:54.569> the<00:05:54.870> scanner<00:05:55.139> lid<00:05:57.319> so<00:05:58.319> that

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
can now close the scanner lid so that

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.559 
can now close the scanner lid so that
little<00:05:58.800> noise<00:05:58.949> you<00:05:59.250> heard<00:05:59.430> there<00:05:59.819> that<00:06:00.389> was

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:00.569 
little noise you heard there that was

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.180 
little noise you heard there that was
just<00:06:00.599> basically<00:06:00.990> wearing<00:06:01.440> this<00:06:01.650> coming<00:06:02.009> down

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
just basically wearing this coming down

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.610 
just basically wearing this coming down
on<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.520> incline<00:06:02.940> it's<00:06:03.629> not<00:06:03.900> enough<00:06:04.169> to<00:06:04.349> trap

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
on the incline it's not enough to trap

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.089 
on the incline it's not enough to trap
it<00:06:04.860> it's<00:06:05.069> not<00:06:05.310> going<00:06:05.490> to<00:06:05.580> stop<00:06:05.819> these<00:06:06.000> in<00:06:06.509> gray

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
it it's not going to stop these in gray

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.909 
it it's not going to stop these in gray
so<00:06:08.099> at<00:06:08.219> the<00:06:08.340> moment<00:06:08.520> it's<00:06:08.849> just<00:06:08.940> charging<00:06:09.659> the

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
so at the moment it's just charging the

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.649 
so at the moment it's just charging the
as<00:06:10.919> soon<00:06:11.130> as<00:06:11.250> it's<00:06:11.400> done<00:06:11.610> that<00:06:11.880> I'll<00:06:12.150> run<00:06:12.599> a

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
as soon as it's done that I'll run a

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.249 
as soon as it's done that I'll run a
photocopy<00:06:13.349> off<00:06:14.180> so<00:06:15.180> it's<00:06:15.449> not<00:06:15.630> connected<00:06:16.139> to

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
photocopy off so it's not connected to

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.809 
photocopy off so it's not connected to
computer<00:06:16.740> so<00:06:16.889> we're<00:06:17.009> just<00:06:17.039> going<00:06:17.370> to<00:06:17.400> use<00:06:17.460> the

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
computer so we're just going to use the

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.600 
computer so we're just going to use the
scanner<00:06:18.120> on<00:06:18.419> this<00:06:18.779> system<00:06:19.310> we're<00:06:20.310> going<00:06:20.400> to<00:06:20.460> do

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
scanner on this system we're going to do

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.480 
scanner on this system we're going to do
a<00:06:20.639> photocopy<00:06:21.409> so<00:06:22.409> the<00:06:22.529> ink<00:06:22.710> cartridges<00:06:23.279> are

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
a photocopy so the ink cartridges are

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.040 
a photocopy so the ink cartridges are
recognized<00:06:26.090> we<00:06:27.090> just<00:06:27.300> gotta<00:06:27.479> wait<00:06:27.630> for<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:27.900> to

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
recognized we just gotta wait for it to

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.860

the side or up this way the crack
position<00:06:49.889> is<00:06:50.069> bang<00:06:50.520> in<00:06:50.699> the<00:06:50.819> center<00:06:51.240> here

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.220 

so<00:06:54.850> we'll<00:06:55.060> actually<00:06:55.420> run<00:06:55.630> the<00:06:55.750> coffee<00:06:55.960> with

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
so we'll actually run the coffee with

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.050 
so we'll actually run the coffee with
the<00:06:56.260> lid<00:06:56.500> open<00:06:56.680> so<00:06:57.040> you<00:06:57.160> can<00:06:57.400> see<00:06:57.610> it<00:06:57.760> moving

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
the lid open so you can see it moving

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.540

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.640 

I<00:07:03.580> think<00:07:04.180> they<00:07:04.300> are<00:07:04.450> its<00:07:04.750> own<00:07:04.930> ink<00:07:05.230> cartridge

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
okay so this is how it normally runs it

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.050 
okay so this is how it normally runs it
it's<00:07:23.770> just<00:07:23.920> copying<00:07:24.310> that<00:07:24.580> and<00:07:24.820> you<00:07:24.910> will<00:07:25.030> see
