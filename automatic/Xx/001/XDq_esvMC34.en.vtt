00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.830
 It should be noted two features of Windows 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.070
 expert 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.240
 firstly this is the full version of windows extreme 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.370
 working inside windows like any 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.320

 in this window you can run 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.830
 most actions usually for windows

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 windows 7 programs 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.050
 let's say in advance that Vendor's mode 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.840
 back is designed for the program 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.090
 intensively consuming 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.570
 graphically resources such as three-dimensional 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.330
 games or using special 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.520
 equipment for example tv from here 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.359
 In addition, $ 1 is required. 7

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.200
 maximum 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.950
 and the computer processor should 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.770
 support technology 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.330
 virtualization 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.840
 first visit and the web site listed on 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.579
 the screen 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.509
 and check your compatibility 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.040
 processor 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.130
 setup by vendor back mode 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.960
 more than two stages 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.170
 in opera you download and install in 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.520
 the program of the Windows helicopter thousand series 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.030
 to run virtual 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.660

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.830

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.299
 trick update pack 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.909
 I already found out that my computer 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.370
 supports Pindos Caspian mode and and 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.639

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.529
 pixel virtual 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:36.899
 now I have to confirm 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.669
 installation and accept terms 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.789

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.859
 after installation is complete 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.759
 to restart a computer 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.389
 after rebooting Pindos helicopter pension 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.480
 appears in the list of programs 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.300
 there is a ventus expert mode in the list but he 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.009
 not yet installed 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.649
 I still bite him. A request appears. 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.769
 Bend mode speaker download 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.839
 hiding the page on which we were 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:03.119
 earlier 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.599
 I answer a few more questions and 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.749
 pressing this button to load itself 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.489
 Windows Expert Mode 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.889
 these are large files therefore recommend 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.939
 save it on your computer first 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.249
 case if in the future it is required 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:17.519
 reinstall 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.760
 after the download is complete I open 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.339

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:22.399

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.069
 virtual hard disk used in 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.559

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.470
 explay windows mode files 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.379
 and enter the password 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.739
 this put must be installed to 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.430
 did not have to enter the password when 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.430
 every run of juventus expert mode 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.519

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.219

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:50.639
 Juventus expert 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.579
 I think this is a good idea 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.419
 when the last setup steps 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.629
 made before us mode wines boards 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.609
 Caspian 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.809
 we set up the mode speaker now 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.499
 the old program is installed in it 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.349
 insert the installation disk and in 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.759
 nine drive and here's my windows mode 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.759
 expert caraway him 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:14.850
 double click installation file 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.850
 and install the program 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.600
 This program can be run in mode. 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.530
 Juventus and in the back would be more convenient 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.419
 use it like any other 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.419
 programs in the interface gendol 7 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.999
 before opening any program 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.700
 Juventus regime industry experts 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.690
 first close windows mode 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.389
 experts 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.090
 then press start button jingle 7 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.590
 select application support for mode 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.590
 1 dose expert and open program 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.319
 and it will open 1 to 7 like any other 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.490
 program 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.400
 a couple of small differences 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.050
 transparent borders are not supported and 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.770
 on the taskbar instead of the button 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.780
 apps displayed with a button 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.000
 windows swearing oath around 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.100
 the rest of the program is no different 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.169
 from other programs installed 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.370
 windows l 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.660
 so if you really need an old one 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.349
 program for Windows peak back 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.900
 and install and windows 7 fails 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.250
 use the windows explay mode and you 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.919
 get the best combinations of the two 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:16.550
 systems
