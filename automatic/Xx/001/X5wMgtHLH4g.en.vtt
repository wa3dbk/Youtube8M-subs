tired and may not be I have no idea but

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.959

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's pretty soft it's actually thinner

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
it's pretty soft it's actually thinner
than<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.420> thought<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.649> pretty

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
than I thought it would be that's pretty

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.760 
than I thought it would be that's pretty
cool<00:00:59.160> because<00:01:00.140> that'll<00:01:01.140> probably<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.530> lot

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
cool because that'll probably be a lot

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.549 
cool because that'll probably be a lot
more<00:01:01.829> comfortable<00:01:02.250> than<00:01:03.110> inaudible<00:01:04.110> shirt

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
more comfortable than inaudible shirt

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.850 
more comfortable than inaudible shirt
would<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:06.470> yeah<00:01:07.470> scoop<00:01:08.250> neck<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.680> how<00:01:10.680> good

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
would and yeah scoop neck and how good
