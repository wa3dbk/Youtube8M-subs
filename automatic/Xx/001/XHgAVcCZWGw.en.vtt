00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.440
 I am fire 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 he dodged the gangs as they are 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.080
 reporting once again we are waiting 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.380
 that they are very well today 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.000
 there is me doing a double short 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.620
 playing playing ends what they are going to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.510
 to be seeing today is a fad 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.570
 playing good as the terminal arrived 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.480
 they all see me using the super 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 weapon of all time that all the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.379
 world used in morÃ³n etcetera mp7 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.900
 with silenced I think that by authorizing 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.000
 and load the load used the truth does not 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.920
 I remember very well there are nuances web by 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.570
 picture gang talking to me a little bit 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.479
 of gameplay I wanted to talk to you about another 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.190
 topic already about what happened in the extreme 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.720
 yesterday's Sunday an extreme that 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.360
 it serves as being in the morning some 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 there were about 50 people watching there but 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.930
 Well, I guess some are not the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.510
 they are always there since normally 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 I do the streams out there at night and 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.350
 this time it was stuck what I wanted 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 make an extreme a very early stress 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.340
 it worked in the morning most of the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.010
 people who are at home resting 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.299
 maybe, but good, how did they reach 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.190
 to notice those who were there then 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.680
 according to failure with my captor stopped 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.810
 to work the reason the truth I do not know which one 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 beech 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 already 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.490
 at the beginning it had stopped working 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.869
 with the program he used to do 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.579
 streaming by now it stopped 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.700
 work completely I do not have 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.250
 capturing and that means just one 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.829
 thing that I will not be able to do streaming 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.860
 during which I could do one or two 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.350
 weeks maybe maybe a week two 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.179
 weeks in what I buy one of all 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.609
 ways that does not mean that I'm not going to 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.369
 upload any kind of video because videos 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.829
 I have saved in my computer I have 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.679
 a few good gameplays rankings 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.099
 I know that now that the demo was 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.480
 there goes now that I was wanda is a 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.459
 good stream I took advantage for that is not 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.750
 100 I was also there when with the band 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.670
 that I had the demo I hope they have 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.069
 enjoyed the demo that I think was a 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.510
 good idea aside from that already as that the 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.519
 decorators are watching medium 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.290
 desperate because tomorrow 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.940
 would you let it and fail many and 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.549
 some of you are excited the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.099
 truth I not so much because for the xbox 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.500
 360 grow leaves until the 28th so that 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.569
 they 're just going to enjoy the game 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.670
 who have the xbox one 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.950
 those who plan to buy the game for the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.079
 computer in my case like nothing else 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.239
 I have at the moment the 360 because I have 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.370
 to wait for me almost this month so 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.870
 which is also not a game that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.219
 He drew attention as you are of the fact 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.230
 therefore it is a game that is waiting 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.359
 with a lot of desire I liked with what 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.769
 I saw it my I got to see how little 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.049
 I came to understand but I was not 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.470
 dying of the desire for the moment 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.200
 You can continue when kohl october 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.420
 anything else you have there in 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.730
 right now that I had thought of buying a 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.160
 different game for this album is the one 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.840
 decomposes the catcher hahaha as 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.000
 that something wants I do not bring variety 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.190
 of the channel something will be but good as 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.020
 I'll tell you, tomorrow, titans fan and 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.120
 facts of sanity like walking in the middle 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.010
 despaditos knowing that they are going to lose 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.960
 Many people see how my trees in my 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.180
 chair and I really do not know how but 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.700
 good 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.469
 they already lowered the price of the goal on this 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.510
 like 39 dollars 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.819
 apart from a demo for all the 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.400
 people but those people who did not have the 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.019
 game and maybe I would buy it but hey 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.359
 that's just a little bit of what 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.250
 I wanted to talk, gang the truth, I eat 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.840
 I tell them what caught my attention 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.219
 which are the new maps so it's going to 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.409
 buy later not a pro 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.750

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.849
 to tell Ivan what hits were talking 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.670
 well sexy sexy concludes a little game of 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.489
 against everyone playing in terminal one of 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.079
 the favorite maps of all the people 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.579
