 For many centuries, imitators have been a nuisance to mankind 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 This year, a law was finally passed 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.300
 To prevent imitators from performing in front of the public 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.300
 Since then 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.200
 Imitators tried to do other things 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.000
 They failed miserably 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.900

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.500
 I think he says that we throw him at the White House 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.300

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.400
