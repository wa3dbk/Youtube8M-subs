00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.750
 I win independently 2 to 1 and I win well 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.520
 I do not justify it according to the development 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.709
 of the party a superb first time 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.010
 of the super syrup team 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.440
 completely surpassing a quilmes to 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.660
 the drift that could not recover the 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.520
 ball that could not reach that there was 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.190
 isolated his two forwards and we counted 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.590
 with good note more advanced and that 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.690
 you could not defend well either 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.200
 example the clear example of the superior 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.050
 independent can be warned 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.760
 reviewing the first goal a succession of 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.550
 we counted 16 passes there may be some 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.960
 more some less but there were 16 passes 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.690
 taking the ball all over the court 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.909
 associating with pisa not with mancuello 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.920
 that came off with independent the 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.300
 that involved all his 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.460
 players until you get to that splendid 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.499
 mancuello shot to put in one to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.999
 zero after a play a shot at 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.159
 side of the group and gomez puts the one to one 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.069
 but independent an idea was seen 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.109
 solid game collective well applied 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.760
 by the players who could not 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.380
 counteract at no time quilmes 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.509
 of the second time 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.399
 more distributed the thing already independent 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.710
 change the party profile 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.570
 independent went a little longer 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.970
 the party was presented more to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.899
 counterattack and in one of those 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.720
 counterattacks just a ball 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.229
 stopped in quilmes a corner had not 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.149
 nobody for the independent bouncing wove 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.240
 three or four passes went out to the opponent's field 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.000
 and there was organized the play of a very 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.119
 good also albertengo to seal the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.759
 result 2-1 I think it's a result and 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.590
 a performance above all that invites the 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.250
 optimism because independent 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.950
 clearly played what he wanted 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.200
 he clearly taught his letters in this 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.210
 match quilmes also for another 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.770
 part as we said that I was optimistic 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.840
 the independents was disappointing of 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.360
 a team with no direction that lost in what 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.759
 basic on issues that should be 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.560
 pretty well oiled by teams like 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.140
 trainers like falcioni and not 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.119
 it does not really invite us to optimism 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.159
 but this soccer is changing is not 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.050
 linear luck and performance 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.789
 even if it is sporadically a team what 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.989
 you can find in any of the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.989
 party of these
