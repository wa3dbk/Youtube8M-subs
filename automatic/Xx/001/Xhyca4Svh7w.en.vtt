00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.000
 Good night, you rascals, how are you? 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.670
 you are welcome one more Tuesday here 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.260
 the indie section in the channel section 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.090
 indie that this week I think it brings 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.560
 another pretty remarkable title of these 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.619
 that pretty much everyone around them 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.840
 it sounds like it's hotline miami on the line 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.070
 hot from miami hot line 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.689
 you will see it now when we talk a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.920
 little bit because the games are good 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.529
 phone on which they are ringing 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.480
 different commissions we are there is a murderer 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.940
 paid that has to meet different 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.560
 missions good a game I also wanted to 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.650
 take out this week because just the week 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.020
 last a trailer came out a new trailer 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.520
 of hotline miami 2 that you know that this 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.180
 game to have second part 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 that the launch date I think it's 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 September after the summer tells us 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.310
 October but that this game is going to have 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.290
 a second part above all because 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.550
 to that the success he has had is a game 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.680
 very well considered within the scene 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.750
 indie and well it is a game in addition 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 uses a series of elements not 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.310
 only at the playable level but at the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.409
 also environmental sound that reminds 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.360
 very much to the decade of the 80s to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.950
 the games of that time and good is 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.140
 now we will see it little by little 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.159
 in the analysis it is worth everything that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.950
 keep in mind 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.140
 the second part of this game this 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.149
 year 2014 after summer so 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.100
 today I will put images as always 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.689
 speaking then of music graphics 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 which is a very prominent section of this 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.329
 hotline miami and see if you think a 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.329
 pimp 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 Well, good girls, here you have 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.259
 images of this hotel in miami east 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.540
 game has appeared at the end of the year 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.490
 2012 that as the comment I think is a 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 pretty well-known game within the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.159
 indie scene I think is a game that has 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.720
 had repercussion has been in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.090
 vandellós has a lot of people in 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.830
 steam and it's a game because I do not know 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.049
 is going to have second part is logical 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.240
 think that you had enough ball 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.560
 within what is the world is a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
 game that is also available that is not 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.100
 I have told you at the beginning in Morón 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.140
 almost any digital platform that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.420
 you want is in steam is in xbox live 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.060
 is on the playstation network so 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 good you have the system that you have is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.909
 easy that you can find this hot the and 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.710
 Miami chains in a game that 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.269
 It is usually at a very good price and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.120
 especially in pc as I say has left 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.910
 in a lot of valdés is worth this 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.220
 game tries to reflect a little the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.900
 environment of the 80s 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.600
 well I do not know if he wants it or not but 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.190
 least you get it not for nothing in 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.230
 concrete but it is true that the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.850
 global impression that comes out of this 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.549
 game is that we are at that time 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.440
 I say do not do it concrete because no 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.060
 is it reminds me of no movie in 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.050
 special nor does it remind me of any 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.600
 special situation but 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.210
 the set of all the color the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.190
 good music even as the kind of 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.380
 missions make you feel as if 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.660
 you were in a gangster movie 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.550
 or of typical salaried assassins of 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.230
 Hollywood not from that decade so 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.150
 well it's not a game that by crowd of 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.010
 elements remember all this that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.560
 commented is a game uses a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.940
 overhead perspective a perspective 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.820
 from above as for example you can 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.660
 use cell or gauntlet games that 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.010
 style 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.810
 to me the jo the truth that reminds me 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.750
 a lot maybe for being a shooting game 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.790
 as it is logical to the shooters these of 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.950
 multidirectional scroll that also 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.290
 they had their time of their little moment 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.660
 of glory in the early 90's with 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.770
 games like for example someone brit of 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.150
 friend who knows she is one of the best 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.890
 favorite and also then it is not used 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.780
 that kind of perspective and that 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.510
 possibility of shooting in a multitude of 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.549
 directions of agreement 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.620
 and the levels are also divided from 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.269
 One way that I really like is a game 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.040
 that has quite a few levels but it 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.290
 divided into small sections and what 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.170
 I like it is that the sections each 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.510
 of them are quite short what happens 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.730
 that are short but complicated is to say 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.560
 you have to plan very well of what 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.480
 way you will overcome the area because at 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.110
 you better have 8 or 10 enemies in that 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.000
 section 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.829
 and of course, if you shoot with the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.420
 First, all of them come automatically 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.650
 the others come after you and kill you with 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.060
 quite easily done in this 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.370
 I want to tell you that it is quite 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.079
 simple dying hit us and 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.540
 we are dead is worth then you have to 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.129
 plan very well as I say the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.720
 actions that we are going to do the game for 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.280
 so to speak it allows you the possibility of 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.739
 face it in a much more way 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.139
 direct much more by the slope of the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.319
 action or in a more focused way towards 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.659
 the stealth of going killing one by one 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.880
 space to enemies and in that way 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.400
 then do not create noise in fact for example 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.370
 the white arms in the body weapons 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.020
 to body they do not make noise and for example 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.360
 when we have a shot as I say 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.320
 the rest of the enemies in the area come to 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.090
 for us 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.100
 and is a game that already say it's a 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.590
 game is also very much based on the essay 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.870
 and error in proving what strategy can 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.640
 be more effective in defeating 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.440
 the enemies of that area in order not to 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.900
 it's a game that you directly get into now 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.100
 and the first time you're going to pass that area 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.110
 but surely have to try 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.130
 at least two or three times but 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.230
 also for that reason for that 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.120
 circumstance the game has I create a 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.070
 very high replay factor 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.200
 because in addition to each mission 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.880
 you choose what mask you are going to wear that each 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.520
 Mask has different qualities 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.410
 you choose what type of weapon you are going to carry and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.660
 also good at the end of each zone 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.610
 they give you a score considering 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.440
 several parameters of how you have done 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.180
 they tell you for example, you have a bird 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.190
 uses the American system of 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.830
 Ok, you have one time 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.530
 It is therefore clear if you have spent a 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.780
 area you always have the possibility of 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.070
 some of trying to play it and get 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.010
 good good scores indeed 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.390
 I will put here a small picture of 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.190
 scores that have people who are 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.050
 in my friends list of steam a little 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.150
 man because I guess it will make them a lot 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.010
 illusion seen in the table of 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.230
 scores even a few seconds 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.370
 but good and nothing the game visually 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.620
 it attracts a lot of attention 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.150
 aesthetic and also very very ochentera 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.790
 but pulling rather for the part of the 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.229
 psychodelia a few colors so very much like 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.290
 was the tea or drugged in all 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.910
 moment and well, it also has a 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.169
 story that is pretty well taken 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.540
 that they are telling you as if 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.160
 were comic book vignettes as animation and 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.110
 so the truth is that it's pretty good 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.729
 but the truth is that I have a lot 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.770
 well at least also with the 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.020
 story and it's a game in addition to level 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.880
 playable I want to say that it is fluid is 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.160
 direct that is something that I too 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.540
 I want it to be clear for that 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.460
 people who are a little indecisive is 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.590
 say to our improvement this game is 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.630
 a bit basic has a pretty look 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.789
 primitive which is an aspect in addition to 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.440
 as pixelated nothing do not worry about the 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.020
 I play the truth that has all the 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.120
 mechanics playable to the last and it 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.740
 plays great and good for later 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.350
 special mention also of course 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.810
 for the soundtrack that I think is a 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.850
 passed totally in line with what 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.680
 what is the game and also helps not 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.510
 make that mattress that I do many 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.860
 times reference they have to make 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.840
 the good soundtracks do not make a 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.430
 mattress below everything you 're 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.740
 watching on screen to give it a support 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.460
 and a stability to what you are 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.680
 Playing 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.600
 and finally also special mention to 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.090
 the violence that this game has 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.979
 fact is a very violent and good game to 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.349
 enemies you load it with shapes 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.639
 absolutely cruel and there is always 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.680
 there is the pool of blood on the floor 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.509
 what this quentin movie looks like 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.639
 tarantino and good for now that I 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.870
 it seems a very complete game very well 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.130
 work some sections maybe the only 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.229
 inconvenience is that it's a little bit 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.849
 repetitive but personally if you 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.130
 like this kind of games if you like what 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.479
 that proposes more than repetitive what you 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.380
 you want is because I want more because 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.630
 it's not like it's a game either 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.910
 excessively long is worth so 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.740
 recommendation that surely many of the 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.000
 channel you will know but it is never 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.530
 more since always some clueless 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.330
 always someone who has missed some 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.009
 of these or that maybe he bought it 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.750
 at the time in the bandes and then 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.070
 he has not yet dedicated the amount of 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.229
 hours that the game really deserves 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.360
 so here is the recommendation for 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.889
 I am telling you today in the end 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.930
 we can go up system shock 2 ok but 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:34.759
 do not worry that at some point in the 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.289
 week in some day I do not know if tomorrow 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:38.690
 Wednesday or pidal Thursday 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:40.819
 it's mid-afternoon at 5 or so 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.229
 up episode that is pending 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:45.020
 all this week's existence by not 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.610
 let it go another week so come 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.349
 a very big hug that is 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.310
 and a lot and see you tomorrow by team 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:51.310
