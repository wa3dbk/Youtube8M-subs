00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
cycles i think i think most important

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
cycles i think i think most important
thing<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.350> no<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.650> deals<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.310> this

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
thing is that no one deals in this

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.060 
thing is that no one deals in this
situation<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.390> way<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.619> writers

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
situation the same way and the writers

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
situation the same way and the writers
they<00:01:14.280> want<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:14.850> sure<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.299> they<00:01:15.420> give

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
they want to make sure that they give

slightly worse for it but I know I was

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.800 
slightly worse for it but I know I was
hoping<00:01:35.189> you'd<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.400> bald<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.820> well<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.450> we're

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that and found that I was stage three

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.290 
that and found that I was stage three
which<00:02:13.860> i<00:02:13.950> think<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.670> your<00:02:14.850> character<00:02:15.000> is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
which i think is what your character is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.110 
which i think is what your character is
going<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> be<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:17.400> think<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:17.970> main<00:02:18.060> thing

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
going to be and I think the main thing

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.900 
going to be and I think the main thing
is<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:18.930> puts<00:02:19.110> your<00:02:19.230> life<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.620> hold<00:02:19.850> yeah<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
is it just puts your life on hold yeah I

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.550 
is it just puts your life on hold yeah I
think<00:02:21.120> that's<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.990> know<00:02:22.050> different<00:02:22.470> people

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
think that's you know different people

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.900 
think that's you know different people
deal<00:02:22.920> with<00:02:22.950> treatments<00:02:23.520> differently

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
deal with treatments differently

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.030 
deal with treatments differently
depending<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.390> how<00:02:24.600> fit<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.590> well<00:02:25.800> and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
depending on how fit and well and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.300 
depending on how fit and well and
positive<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.300> are<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.190> think

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
positive and you are but it's I think

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.410 
positive and you are but it's I think
it's<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.580> fact<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.970> puts<00:02:30.120> everything<00:02:30.210> on

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
it's the fact that it puts everything on

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.850 
it's the fact that it puts everything on
hold<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.870> can't<00:02:31.020> go<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.200> holidays<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.650> can't

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
hold you can't go and holidays you can't

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.130 
hold you can't go and holidays you can't
plan<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.460> can't<00:02:32.670> do<00:02:32.850> any<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.630> those<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:34.020> know

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
plan you can't do any of those you know

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.780 
plan you can't do any of those you know
do<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.380> any<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.740> those<00:02:34.830> aspects<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.550> that

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
do with any of those aspects but that

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.750 
do with any of those aspects but that
was<00:02:35.940> ten<00:02:36.240> years<00:02:36.300> ago<00:02:36.630> was<00:02:36.930> no<00:02:37.020> 999<00:02:37.920> yeah<00:02:38.340> that's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
was ten years ago was no 999 yeah that's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.790 
was ten years ago was no 999 yeah that's
diagnose<00:02:39.270> yeah<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.260> thought<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.710> were

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
diagnose yeah then you thought you were

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.560 
diagnose yeah then you thought you were
clear<00:02:41.160> because<00:02:41.730> five<00:02:42.060> years<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
clear because five years is the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.600 
clear because five years is the
generally<00:02:43.470> exhibit<00:02:43.680> amount<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.190> time<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
generally exhibit amount of time that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.850 
generally exhibit amount of time that
the<00:02:44.820> measure<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.330> then<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.170> came<00:02:46.290> back<00:02:46.350> again

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the measure and then it came back again

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.430 
the measure and then it came back again
yes<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.820> didn't<00:02:47.970> come<00:02:48.090> back<00:02:48.240> quite<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:48.960> bad<00:02:49.110> and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
yes it didn't come back quite so bad and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.560 
yes it didn't come back quite so bad and
came<00:02:49.590> back<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.070> area<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.450> was

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
came back in just one area but it was

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.040 
came back in just one area but it was
still<00:02:51.840> 10<00:02:52.200> x<00:02:52.410> 7<00:02:52.860> centimeters<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.790> tumor<00:02:54.480> which

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
still 10 x 7 centimeters the tumor which

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.870 
still 10 x 7 centimeters the tumor which
was<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.590> know<00:02:55.620> fairly<00:02:55.950> large<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.730> only

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
was you know fairly large and the only

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.070 
was you know fairly large and the only
reason<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.180> knew<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.390> was<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:57.930> had

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
reason I knew it was there is that I had

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.480 
reason I knew it was there is that I had
pain<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.590> i<00:02:58.620> thought<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:58.860> was<00:02:58.920> kidney<00:02:59.220> stones

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
pain and i thought it was kidney stones

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.790 
pain and i thought it was kidney stones
and<00:02:59.760> that's<00:02:59.880> what<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.030> hope<00:03:00.710> unfortunately<00:03:01.710> I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
and that's what I hope unfortunately I

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.320 
and that's what I hope unfortunately I
had<00:03:01.920> come<00:03:02.100> back<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.490> it's<00:03:02.640> been<00:03:02.820> zapped<00:03:03.150> again

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330
