first time so we get like these Bond
moves<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.880> see<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.239> got<00:03:00.450> one

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
moves as you can see I just got one

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.190 
moves as you can see I just got one
there<00:03:01.130> where<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.190> gives<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.519> special<00:03:02.790> light

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
there where it gives you special light

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.360 
there where it gives you special light
points<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.410> think<00:03:04.620> at<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.830> end<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> mission

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
points I think at the end of the mission

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.600 
points I think at the end of the mission
for<00:03:05.400> completing<00:03:06.209> these<00:03:06.330> bond<00:03:06.750> moves<00:03:07.170> as<00:03:07.650> they

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
for completing these bond moves as they

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.979 
for completing these bond moves as they
call<00:03:08.910> them

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
call them

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.500 
call them
so<00:03:10.989> maybe<00:03:11.140> they<00:03:11.409> go<00:03:12.040> through<00:03:12.249> this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
so maybe they go through this

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.179 
so maybe they go through this
construction<00:03:13.510> site<00:03:13.959> which<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.349> a<00:03:14.530> really<00:03:15.069> good

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189
