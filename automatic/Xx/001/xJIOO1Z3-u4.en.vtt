twelve<00:00:50.070> iron<00:00:50.399> blocks<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> corner<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.660> so

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
twelve iron blocks in the corner like so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
twelve iron blocks in the corner like so
fill<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> spaces<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.870> gold<00:00:55.320> blocks<00:00:55.710> except

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
fill the spaces with gold blocks except

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.310 
fill the spaces with gold blocks except
for<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> center<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> center<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
for the center because in the center you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
for the center because in the center you
put<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.770> block<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> diamond<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.899> finally<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
put a block of diamond and finally you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.850 
put a block of diamond and finally you
drop<00:01:02.190> don't<00:01:02.489> throw<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:03.110> ender<00:01:04.110> pearl<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.530> top

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
drop don't throw an ender pearl on top

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.130 
drop don't throw an ender pearl on top
of<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.150> portable<00:01:06.840> hole

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
of that and you get a portable hole

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.580 
of that and you get a portable hole
generator<00:01:08.000> which<00:01:09.000> creates<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.689> temporary<00:01:10.080> hold

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
generator which creates a temporary hold

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.440 
generator which creates a temporary hold
when<00:01:10.799> thrown<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.340> requires<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:12.060> redstone

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
when thrown it requires one redstone

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.710 
when thrown it requires one redstone
block<00:01:12.630> per<00:01:12.840> hole<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> therefore<00:01:14.479> we<00:01:15.479> need

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
block per hole and therefore we need

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.649 
block per hole and therefore we need
some<00:01:15.990> fuel<00:01:16.580> now<00:01:17.580> let<00:01:17.759> me<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:17.970> demonstrate<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
some fuel now let me just demonstrate to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.490 
some fuel now let me just demonstrate to
you<00:01:18.810> how<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.680> use<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.479> simply<00:01:21.960> drop

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you how to use this you just simply drop

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.670 
you how to use this you just simply drop
the<00:01:22.560> item<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.360> it's<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.689> create<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.470> hole

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the item and it's going to create a hole

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.120 
the item and it's going to create a hole
for<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.250> after<00:01:26.909> quite<00:01:27.780> some<00:01:27.960> time<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
for you and after quite some time it is

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.080 
for you and after quite some time it is
going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.869> just<00:01:31.250> reappear<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> state<00:01:32.790> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
going to just reappear in the state it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.350 
going to just reappear in the state it
was<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.420> before<00:01:34.340> therefore<00:01:35.340> after<00:01:35.610> dropping

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
was in before therefore after dropping

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.749 
was in before therefore after dropping
you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.320> place<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:37.950> any<00:01:38.159> blocks<00:01:38.490> or

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you can not place down any blocks or

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.590 
you can not place down any blocks or
images<00:01:39.229> mind<00:01:40.229> something<00:01:40.710> real<00:01:41.430> quick<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.030> can

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
images mind something real quick I can

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.350 
images mind something real quick I can
demonstrate<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.140> later

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
demonstrate this later

place an item that's not possible
enough<00:02:00.180> place<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> block

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
enough place a block

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.469 
enough place a block
okay<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.070> that's<00:02:03.850> basically<00:02:04.270> everything

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
okay and that's basically everything

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.469 
okay and that's basically everything
through<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.229> usage<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:05.799> works<00:02:06.009> in<00:02:06.280> every<00:02:07.090> four

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
through the usage it works in every four

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.930 
through the usage it works in every four
directions<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.319> three<00:02:08.890> by<00:02:09.100> three<00:02:09.399> by<00:02:09.640> 10

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
directions is three by three by 10

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.460 
directions is three by three by 10
blocks<00:02:10.360> large<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:12.660> yeah<00:02:13.660> after<00:02:13.989> dropping<00:02:14.230> it

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
blocks large and yeah after dropping it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.640 
blocks large and yeah after dropping it
you<00:02:14.620> can<00:02:14.860> roughly<00:02:15.819> go<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.959> one<00:02:17.140> end<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.470> it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
you can roughly go to the one end of it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.670 
you can roughly go to the one end of it
and<00:02:17.920> back<00:02:18.489> again<00:02:18.640> before<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:20.040> reappears<00:02:21.300> if

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
and back again before it reappears if

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.770 
and back again before it reappears if
you<00:02:23.680> don't<00:02:23.920> know<00:02:24.100> how<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> install<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:25.060> it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
you don't know how to install this it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.050 
you don't know how to install this it's
