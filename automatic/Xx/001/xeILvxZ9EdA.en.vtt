00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.009
 bernanke 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:14.629
 hello guys only consume but handed a small question a test a 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.640
 contest this we will see by the way guess and if this game is a game 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.759
 normal online 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.060
 an instruction item 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.490
 let's see them I've put a couple of times the names of the players not 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.460
 it seems like treyarch therefore apparently the second part destruction 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 but when I see it and feel the same these doubts and when I say instruction 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.720
 I mean instruction at the most basic level of 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.950
 those that seem silly robots or that go around 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.440
 so that the seas 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.620
 is that being sincere is not in any part of the black ops anymore 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.300
 uneven that this one 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.440
 it's not that they were the worst players 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.870
 they certainly did not do it well 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.239
 nor that we were the best either 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.539
 but the final game out in a way that I'll already see it if I finished 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.399
 symbol I did not die in the whole game at the time of the shots of a wall 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.680
 in function the robots those that aim badly slow by aim very well what 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.350
 it happens that it aims slow they take some emblem good parts we were with my 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.210
 son gives the gold with 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.210
 vicente javi the national center for health percent 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 that's why the two brothers in which he played xavi and with juan and how would you say that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.220
 more than being 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.510
 the one who joined I believe in a screen divided to no one we dedicate ourselves 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.780
 basically to steal the deaths 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.220
 each other to expect that you have a genetic shutter of laminate let me 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.910
 let me run through the horák map and be changing because it is 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.280
 operating the plant but grows at the rate of every game running 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.389
 find someone that we take out I think it's three times 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:45.500
 and we know where the players are but the map of kings 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.640
 for the big bread that 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.060
 that we had problems finding this the bad guys 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.160
 Well, it's from kobe and if we've been winning enough 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.670
 but inside nothing will come 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.799
 the moment 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.310
 more important because 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.250
 a creed that are now within a few seconds if they get the last 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.150
 low 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.440
 d the game does not work for them 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.150
 another low bullet of the rivadavia team is to go to 600 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.479
 suddenly 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.189
 700 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.690
 you have seen 709 1 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.310
 my colleagues and one team but not the ones I knew and that's where 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.249
 they are in 700 so that's not what they come from now 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:28.469
 5000 points followed by my team and none or one death the other 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.239
 team and is that allies or three tenths less populated 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.689
 they left and those who stayed 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.709
 they did not get even a low you can believe it is to have 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.929
 it really seemed like an instruction game 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.979
 I'll see it good there 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.779
 nothing is dedicated to chasing them to look for them to see 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.179
 where we find them in a cenote mota to fear the artillery albertengo I have 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.179
 I have dogs I do not know what 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:57.399
 if it was a good thing fun because if it does not die if you kill efe it looks good 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.839
 do not 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.509
 but boring and if we had to play like this all night for that and we 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.739
 they know good percent 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.400
 I'm going to explain a little what led to it, nobody in the silenced world came 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.910
 from lugo b arrived 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.400
 in the part of a plan that does not work because there says it as not 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.599
 we passed them the other so many 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.730
 good only is that I had the commanded on this map I quite like the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.059
 normal look 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.049
 surely the libor with double charger 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.299
 i in this framework announced that it does not have much backsliding 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.899
 the swimmers circling the map turned to the map with the green flag 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.569
 We found someone to swim me 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.879
 I invite you to my colleagues they like to humiliate make deaths of these but 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.179
 when the right bastards 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.969
 hence the name of the clan will be made in fhm put thousand back from little 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.749
 flipped mac itespresso 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:57.309
 I also have no more history but the game will take advantage of 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:01.179
 talk about the nelson poket instruction mode you know it but 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:05.059
 but just in case we talk about it is a novelty is the catch seems very very very 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.169
 interesting especially for people who 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.379
 that he's not used to playing that never fuck him the very thing 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.669
 campaign not alone 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.419
 steam or destruction basically juas with robots that are stupid they seem 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.219
 lobotomized 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:24.089
 we go bands of any kind of sense or intuition of what they do 

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.420
 go 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.560
 They are going around and there is a very good aim but very slow 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.790
 when it is located in the south in the yellow sea to green to tip mita locate 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.650
 they kill you what happens that they did not carry 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.210
 three or four seconds not and to do it very well stop for that for people who 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.940
 he has never played to try things to test weapons 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.360
 to practice yoga sentenced to know the maps not well for your things 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.670
 and if it really is going to leave you for tested in level 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.270
 the one of the expert level him of madrid more difficult because we are going to five hits cox 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.889
 they stay in the head 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.520
 board otherwise they go from being very bad to being very good not so good 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.729
 that's a month a fun thing to try with friends 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.689
 and to train you although not always present in games like this one that 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.310
 I have here p 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.370
 the issue that should not be boring for 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.920
 all of you must have proven that we do not have a good time or we do not 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.669
 We spent all departure and arrival of I do not know what 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.340
 and we did not really look at the issue of not being killed during pt 20 ' 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.150
 five minutes 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.689
 until the end we do not leave in seven deaths three of them alone 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.669
 led juan kids we were insulting him the whole game uncle 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.849
 You insult the team, those things that you do when you play with 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:33.700
 between colleagues not 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.560
 Toussaint is what makes something really fun when you play with people 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.199
 what 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.439
 although you get along well and you have a micro 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.809
 in postobón merlo 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:45.799
 If I had known that the game was if I had put on, I got married. 

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:49.269
 runner in fact I was about to think they are committing suicide for field of 

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:52.520
 change the class run a little more and get to the rivals before 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.050
 phrases what was good I talked about juan and cubes of the clan mph and I think that I 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.530
 I see bound to support your last your last 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:05.159
 a low for cook takes will we see it again that that sums up a little what 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.639
 is what was the departure a humiliation 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.050
 whole of these poor people that poetic what topographical sinema that equity 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.319
 sad at the same time that c's I perceive fixed 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.270
 thomas cook in the head that lost look 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.589
 in the snow 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.159
 fed up with hollywood that goes well
