00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.320
 things you have to be subscribed to 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.410
 channel that minimum will be subscribed to me 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.780
 literary resins blog that will expose 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.190

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 publicly so that I can see it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.899
 both in the channel and in the blog that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.510
 you are subscribed to them and then be 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.540
 of legal age 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.210
 and this time it's something 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.180
 or super mandatory because what I'm going to 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.530

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.079

 unfortunately you have to reside in 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.900
 Spain 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.110
 Spain is as much the peninsula as 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.970
 that's the attitude this is not a thing 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.330
 that you have not actually looked at how you can 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.680
 see here international is not something that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.620
 I have made wards that is very expensive nor 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.610
 I'm even showing myself to look at it 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.880
 It gives me a lot of anger but in fact I have 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.060
 downloaded the books to the post office to weigh them and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.960
 They spent 500 grams that is 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.540
 would enter between 500 and a kilo and is that 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 they are prices that is that they are a 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.320
 gone so you do not think I say it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.870

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.220

 34 I do not care but we're going to make it 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.870

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.500

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.989

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.250
 comment that you have to put in this 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.100
 occasion the draw will be of books the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.540
 first I did cosmetic and this 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.480
 book is because you already know that my channels 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.530
 as much of one thing as of another and good 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.530
 without further delay 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:24.230
 these are the pocket size and they are a 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.840
 special election that has come from the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.460
 music more morrás de lena valentí in 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:38.110
 these books are for me 18 years old 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:41.270
 because they try ncm in this raffle 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.980
 always surely for me 18 years old 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.300
 because it's a problem that you can 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.920
 search but this time it is 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:53.110
 imperative that they be over 18 years of age and 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:56.720
 well I tell you are the books in this 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.090
 series the saga call it as you want and 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.550
 the books go two by two 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.000
 pass this 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.320
 it's a story shortly the outgoing 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.330
 next story will also be two 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.630
 books as you can see 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:18.130
 if I see it puts first part 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.980
 and second part 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.720
 the pity is that I have no review of these 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.700
 books because I read them nothing but 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.440
 they went on sale and I did not have the blog 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.300
 still then I have to make a 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.640
 rereading to do the review but 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.060
 good for this in google reviews masters and 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.650
 dungeons and lofts bale infinity 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:40.350
 well I roll up like a blind 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.270
 and good next to the books is a couple 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.449
 that in a police case they have to 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.380
 infiltrate a bsm tournament with what 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.430
 which he has to in the first book 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.460
 but it's called the shot has to 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.590
 teach it you have to take it can sound 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.509
 a little weird a bit already but like 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.550
 you want but it is what it is you have to 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.960
 introduce in that world of psm so that 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.070
 when I get there, it is not there 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.289
 with the show and note that she is not 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.120
 participant and they are then discovered 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.880
 the first one deals with that and the second one 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.560
 it's about the tournament of everything that happens 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.529
 inside the tournament all they have to 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.809
 do and well you can not even imagine 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.999
 the high voltage of these books and that is 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:25.639
 they are incredible I think I've already tired 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.979
 ad nauseam to speak of elena 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.229
 brave and the author of his other saga 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.419
 but this saga has nothing to do with the 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:36.319
 saga band and it's another different room and 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:39.469
 another different genre and it's amazing 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:42.769
 has incredible me when I decided to 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:45.679
 do the lottery I found out that having 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:47.539
 come out this teeny little issue and because 

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.099
 they were going to drop a book the first 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.199
 but when I found out you were going to 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.779
 chiquitita digepo revisions lame 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.449
 both since they served as a pull 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:58.149
 because I have to tell you that if someone 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.079
 is interested after the draw 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:02.329
 Unfortunately, the books do not touch him 

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:04.759
 If you want to buy, I recommend you 

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:06.799
 complete at the same time because because the 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.239
 First you just have to pull your hair 

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:10.759
 or hairs, you have to have the 

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:13.639
 second bony and good after all the 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.489
 silver that was released because that we are 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:21.079
 I think that you will have 15 days from the day 

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:23.809
 upload the video until 15 days 

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:25.459
 after this this date I'll put it in the 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:27.769
 information box because I do not know 

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:30.110
 when I'm going to edit it and when I upload it 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:32.239
 because on the internet I do not know how my 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.649
 youtube that I had them and it's not in the 

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:35.329
 day can you upload me the day after 

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:37.459
 try it for two days until it rises 

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:39.829
 then I will leave you in the little box 

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.569
 information from what day until 

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:43.489
 it came again we repeat that you watch please the 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.349
 information box because if I have been 

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:48.750
 I forgot something I'm going to put it down 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.550
 in addition to the dates of each harsh 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.280
 so good luck to everyone 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.120
 I hope you like it raffled a merit 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.120
 huge chao 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.510
