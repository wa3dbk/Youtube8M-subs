00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
first start doing videos because it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.729

my suggestion would be just start
banging<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.790> literally<00:01:06.560> every

start releasing them to the public but
the<00:01:29.960> hardest<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.170> about<00:01:31.200> doing<00:01:31.710> YouTube

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the hardest thing about doing YouTube

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.690 
the hardest thing about doing YouTube
videos<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:33.720> doing<00:01:34.140> YouTube<00:01:34.500> videos<00:01:34.700> if

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
videos is not doing YouTube videos if

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.100 
videos is not doing YouTube videos if
that<00:01:35.939> makes<00:01:36.119> any<00:01:36.240> sense<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.020> you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that makes any sense because when you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.010 
that makes any sense because when you
make<00:01:37.290> videos<00:01:37.890> daily<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.060> easy<00:01:39.329> become

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
make videos daily it's just easy become

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
make videos daily it's just easy become
comfortable<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> practice<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.909> when

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
comfortable with the practice it's when

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.679 
comfortable with the practice it's when
you<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.600> time<00:01:42.869> off<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:44.360> yeah<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:45.509> very

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
you take time off or yeah you're very

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
you take time off or yeah you're very
sporadic<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.579> not

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
sporadic about it or you know just not

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 
sporadic about it or you know just not
consistent<00:01:48.210> with<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.740> when<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
consistent with it that's when it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.710 
consistent with it that's when it
becomes<00:01:50.369> difficult<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> don't
