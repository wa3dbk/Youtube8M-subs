and high flow auxilary hydraulics in the

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.189 
and high flow auxilary hydraulics in the
industry<00:00:30.099> you're<00:00:30.849> also<00:00:31.060> going<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.480> get<00:00:31.660> better

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
industry you're also going to get better

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.200

bucket<00:00:32.619> breakout<00:00:32.980> force<00:00:33.280> in<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.550> competition

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
bucket breakout force in the competition

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.630 
bucket breakout force in the competition
and<00:00:34.390> better<00:00:35.230> engine<00:00:35.680> torque<00:00:35.890> so<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:36.430> can<00:00:36.550> be

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
and better engine torque so you can be

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.130 
and better engine torque so you can be
able<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:36.850> power<00:00:37.000> those<00:00:37.210> attachments<00:00:37.809> longer

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
able to power those attachments longer

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.160 
able to power those attachments longer
and<00:00:38.260> stronger<00:00:38.680> our<00:00:39.309> sv<00:00:39.640> 250<00:00:40.120> is<00:00:40.210> also<00:00:40.570> equipped

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
and stronger our sv 250 is also equipped

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.079 
and stronger our sv 250 is also equipped
with<00:00:41.290> ride<00:00:41.589> control<00:00:41.979> so<00:00:42.370> what<00:00:42.549> ride<00:00:42.699> control

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
with ride control so what ride control

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.579 
with ride control so what ride control
basically<00:00:43.420> does<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:43.989> transforms<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
basically does is it transforms the

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.250 
basically does is it transforms the
loader<00:00:44.830> arms<00:00:45.220> into<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:46.000> shock<00:00:46.269> absorber<00:00:46.809> so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
loader arms into a shock absorber so

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.689 
loader arms into a shock absorber so
instead<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.620> bouncing<00:00:48.010> around<00:00:48.100> in<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.460> seed

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
instead of bouncing around in the seed

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.789 
instead of bouncing around in the seed
and<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.030> frame<00:00:49.299> taking<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.900> shock<00:00:50.199> on<00:00:50.470> bumpy

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
and the frame taking the shock on bumpy

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:52.710 
and the frame taking the shock on bumpy
terrain<00:00:50.949> with<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.339> heavy<00:00:51.549> load<00:00:51.820> your<00:00:52.479> loader

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
terrain with a heavy load your loader

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.170 
terrain with a heavy load your loader
arms<00:00:53.080> are<00:00:53.199> gonna<00:00:53.260> absorb<00:00:53.699> 90%<00:00:54.699> of<00:00:54.760> that<00:00:54.879> shock

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
arms are gonna absorb 90% of that shock

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.689 
arms are gonna absorb 90% of that shock
for<00:00:55.479> you<00:00:55.659> take<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.170> look<00:00:56.409> at<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.619> sv<00:00:56.920> 250<00:00:57.519> here

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
for you take a look at the sv 250 here

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.369 
for you take a look at the sv 250 here
you<00:00:57.850> notice<00:00:58.150> right<00:00:58.239> away<00:00:58.379> best-in-class

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
you notice right away best-in-class

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.160 
you notice right away best-in-class
visibility<00:01:00.280> how<00:01:00.790> is<00:01:00.970> that<00:01:01.089> achieved<00:01:01.239> well

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
visibility how is that achieved well

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.630 
visibility how is that achieved well
number<00:01:02.440> one<00:01:02.680> we<00:01:02.860> have<00:01:03.040> one<00:01:03.190> of<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.309> lowest

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
number one we have one of the lowest

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.280 
number one we have one of the lowest
thresholds<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.360> industry<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:04.989> it's<00:01:05.110> about

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
thresholds in the industry so it's about

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.980 
thresholds in the industry so it's about
18<00:01:05.650> inches<00:01:05.799> up<00:01:06.130> so<00:01:06.400> easy<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.850> get<00:01:06.970> into<00:01:07.180> but

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
18 inches up so easy to get into but

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.600 
18 inches up so easy to get into but
also<00:01:08.170> that<00:01:08.439> door<00:01:08.650> glass<00:01:08.890> goes<00:01:09.159> down<00:01:09.369> nice<00:01:09.549> and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
also that door glass goes down nice and

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.790 
also that door glass goes down nice and
low<00:01:09.820> giving<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.330> good<00:01:10.540> sight<00:01:10.870> lines<00:01:10.900> to<00:01:11.230> the

low giving you good sight lines to the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.560 
low giving you good sight lines to the
front<00:01:12.040> of<00:01:12.100> your<00:01:12.160> attachment<00:01:12.730> if<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.360> take<00:01:13.540> a
