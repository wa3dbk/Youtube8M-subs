natural one time when she did her wash
and<00:01:55.350> gos<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.140> after<00:01:58.350> i

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and gos and so I just you know after i

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.889 
and gos and so I just you know after i
detangled<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.219> i<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.399> rinsed<00:02:00.210> put<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.719> head

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
detangled it i just rinsed put my head

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.499 
detangled it i just rinsed put my head
under<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.200> water<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.250> let<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.549> kind<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
under the water and just let it kind of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.789 
under the water and just let it kind of
get<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.140> water<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.409> there<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.770> i

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
get a little bit of water on there but i

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.820 
get a little bit of water on there but i
kept<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.280> lot<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> conditioner<00:02:06.299> in

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
kept a lot of the conditioner in

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.690 
kept a lot of the conditioner in
so<00:02:07.700> hoping<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.270> this<00:02:08.479> one<00:02:08.660> dry<00:02:09.200> white

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
so hoping that this one dry white

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.720 
so hoping that this one dry white
because<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:11.000> we'll<00:02:11.690> see<00:02:11.930> now<00:02:12.830> afterwards

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
because of that we'll see now afterwards

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
because of that we'll see now afterwards
I<00:02:14.090> actually<00:02:14.900> used<00:02:15.470> eco<00:02:16.130> styler<00:02:16.370> gel<00:02:16.640> with<00:02:17.630> the

I actually used eco styler gel with the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.020 
I actually used eco styler gel with the
argan<00:02:18.230> oil<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.800> there<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.490> I<00:02:19.580> didn't<00:02:19.820> bring<00:02:19.910> it

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
argan oil in there and I didn't bring it

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.120 
argan oil in there and I didn't bring it
in<00:02:20.120> here<00:02:20.270> actually<00:02:20.390> got<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> really<00:02:21.080> big<00:02:21.800> tub

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
in here actually got a really big tub

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.860 
in here actually got a really big tub
like<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:23.060> one<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.270> my<00:02:23.300> girlfriends

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
like this that one of my girlfriends

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.860 
like this that one of my girlfriends
gave<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.230> me<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:25.610> went<00:02:25.910> through<00:02:26.240> each

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
gave to me and I just went through each

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.620 
gave to me and I just went through each
of<00:02:27.080> my<00:02:27.200> four<00:02:27.470> sections<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.430> took<00:02:28.850> smaller

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
of my four sections and I took smaller

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.370 
of my four sections and I took smaller
sections<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:31.490> pretty<00:02:31.670> much<00:02:31.790> just<00:02:32.230> put<00:02:33.230> up

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
sections and I pretty much just put up

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.490 
sections and I pretty much just put up
quite<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.710> bit<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.160> my<00:02:34.220> hand<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.170> right<00:02:36.170> through

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
quite a bit on my hand and right through

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.010 
quite a bit on my hand and right through
my<00:02:36.590> head<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.860> actually<00:02:37.160> going<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.670> put<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.660> try

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
my head I actually going to put in a try

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.720 
my head I actually going to put in a try
a<00:02:39.140> couple<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:39.500> video<00:02:39.740> clips<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.280> how<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.460> did

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
a couple of video clips of how I did

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.550 
a couple of video clips of how I did
that<00:02:40.760> I'm<00:02:41.420> actually<00:02:41.630> trying<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:42.110> take<00:02:42.410> my

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
that I'm actually trying to take my

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.590 
that I'm actually trying to take my
camera<00:02:42.740> into<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.100> bathroom<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.820> do<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.240> couple

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
camera into the bathroom and do a couple

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.440 
camera into the bathroom and do a couple
clips<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.560> um<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:46.250> yeah<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.300> went

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
clips so um so yeah and so I just went

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.699 
clips so um so yeah and so I just went
through<00:02:47.570> my<00:02:47.660> whole<00:02:47.900> head<00:02:48.110> when<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.290> got<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
through my whole head when I got to the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.440 
through my whole head when I got to the
front<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.040> put<00:02:49.220> this<00:02:49.340> little<00:02:49.490> elastic<00:02:49.820> headband

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
front I put this little elastic headband

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.710 
front I put this little elastic headband
on<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.080> smooth<00:02:51.440> my<00:02:51.680> sides<00:02:52.370> down<00:02:52.760> which

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
on just to smooth my sides down which

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.180 
on just to smooth my sides down which
I'll<00:02:53.900> probably<00:02:54.080> take<00:02:54.320> off<00:02:54.500> once<00:02:54.740> my<00:02:54.890> hair<00:02:55.070> is

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
I'll probably take off once my hair is

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.870 
I'll probably take off once my hair is
dry<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:57.380> that's<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.670> was

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
dry and and that's it so this was

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.690 
dry and and that's it so this was
actually<00:02:59.120> fairly<00:02:59.600> easy<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.320> do<00:03:00.650> I'm<00:03:01.310> probably

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
actually fairly easy to do I'm probably

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.860 
actually fairly easy to do I'm probably
going<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.030> try<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.270> number<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.720> different

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
going to try a number of different

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.100 
going to try a number of different
approaches<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.800> this<00:03:04.570> maybe<00:03:05.570> next<00:03:05.840> time<00:03:06.080> I

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
approaches to this maybe next time I

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.830 
approaches to this maybe next time I
won't<00:03:06.230> use<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.010> Tresemme<00:03:07.550> as<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> leave-in<00:03:08.300> I

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
won't use the Tresemme as a leave-in I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.070 
won't use the Tresemme as a leave-in I
may<00:03:09.800> use<00:03:09.920> my<00:03:10.100> kinky<00:03:10.400> curly<00:03:10.930> styling<00:03:11.930> custard

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
may use my kinky curly styling custard

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.530 
may use my kinky curly styling custard
at<00:03:12.380> sleeping<00:03:12.800> with<00:03:12.980> my<00:03:13.100> argon<00:03:13.489> jail<00:03:13.820> because<00:03:14.330> i
