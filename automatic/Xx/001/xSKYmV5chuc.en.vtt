00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.910 
a must so I've got my frosting on top a
nice<00:01:42.060> dollop<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.320> doing<00:01:43.350> I'm

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
nice dollop and what I'm doing I'm

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920 
nice dollop and what I'm doing I'm
right-handed<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> push<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
right-handed so I'm going to push the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.260 
right-handed so I'm going to push the
frosting<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:47.340> direction<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.030> outer

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
frosting in one direction to the outer

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.870 
frosting in one direction to the outer
edge<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> cupcake<00:01:49.070> well<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.670> other

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
edge of the cupcake well with my other

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
edge of the cupcake well with my other
hand<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.329> left<00:01:51.509> hand<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:52.049> turning<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
hand my left hand I'm turning in the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.090 
hand my left hand I'm turning in the
opposite<00:01:53.820> direction<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.829> does<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.860> make

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
opposite direction so does that make

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.510 
opposite direction so does that make
sense

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
sense

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.270 
sense
it<00:01:57.180> makes<00:01:57.390> total<00:01:57.630> sense<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.560> year<00:01:58.860> ago<00:01:59.070> I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it makes total sense and a year ago I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
it makes total sense and a year ago I
didn't<00:01:59.640> even<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.939> where<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.149> buy<00:02:00.420> frosting
