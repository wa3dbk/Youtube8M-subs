00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
sizes as well you can get twice this for

sizes as well you can get twice this for
$4.99<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.250> believe<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.710> picked<00:02:29.890> up

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
$4.99 I believe but I just picked up

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.200 
$4.99 I believe but I just picked up
this<00:02:30.160> because<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.520> actually<00:02:30.730> fits<00:02:30.940> inside<00:02:31.060> of

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
this because it actually fits inside of

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.030 
this because it actually fits inside of
the<00:02:31.330> kit

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the kit

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.170

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
we'll have to have something outside of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.780 
we'll have to have something outside of
the<00:02:33.299> kid<00:02:34.879> so<00:02:35.879> using<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.689> you<00:02:37.609> simply<00:02:38.609> take

small it's pretty cool these little arms
bend<00:02:47.909> out<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:49.849> they're<00:02:50.849> pretty<00:02:51.030> tight<00:02:51.269> so

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
bend out like so they're pretty tight so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.259 
bend out like so they're pretty tight so

stove is this small you don't want
something<00:02:58.829> real<00:02:58.980> flimsy<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:00.989> come<00:03:01.139> out

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
something real flimsy so they come out

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.610 
something real flimsy so they come out
like<00:03:01.409> this<00:03:02.930> then<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.200> have<00:03:04.349> this<00:03:04.439> little

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
green thing right here this pops out

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:14.210 
green thing right here this pops out
like<00:03:07.590> like<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.549> take<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:10.669> like<00:03:11.669> this<00:03:12.859> you<00:03:13.859> screw

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
like like so take it like this you screw

like like so take it like this you screw
it<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:16.549> you'll<00:03:17.549> hear<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:20.040> get<00:03:20.250> as

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
it on and you'll hear it you get as

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.460 
it on and you'll hear it you get as
tight<00:03:21.419> as<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.599> can<00:03:21.629> just<00:03:21.959> with<00:03:22.049> your<00:03:22.169> fingers

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
tight as you can just with your fingers

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.490 
tight as you can just with your fingers
you<00:03:22.530> don't<00:03:22.709> want<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:23.060> over<00:03:24.060> tighten<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.500> and

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
you don't want to over tighten it and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.020 
you don't want to over tighten it and
this<00:03:25.859> is<00:03:26.010> what<00:03:26.159> controls<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.579> fuel<00:03:26.790> release

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
this is what controls the fuel release

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.289 
this is what controls the fuel release
so<00:03:27.930> starting<00:03:28.859> off<00:03:28.950> it's<00:03:29.609> about<00:03:29.790> off<00:03:30.030> right

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
so starting off it's about off right

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.199 
so starting off it's about off right
here<00:03:30.450> right<00:03:30.919> so<00:03:31.919> you're<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.159> to<00:03:32.250> let<00:03:33.060> me<00:03:33.120> get

how<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.530> do<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.989> you're<00:03:37.139> going<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.319> slowly

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
how to do this so you're going to slowly

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.360 
how to do this so you're going to slowly

the<00:04:32.890> cold<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.340> have<00:04:33.460> never<00:04:33.700> used<00:04:34.000> any<00:04:34.330> other<00:04:34.360> any

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
the cold I have never used any other any

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.840 
the cold I have never used any other any
of<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.990> other<00:04:35.140> types<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.530> stoves<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:36.130> haven't

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
of the other types of stoves I haven't

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.150 
of the other types of stoves I haven't
used<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.300> Snow<00:04:37.600> Peak<00:04:37.630> or<00:04:37.990> any<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.200> those<00:04:38.350> or

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
used the Snow Peak or any of those or

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.630 
used the Snow Peak or any of those or
MSR<00:04:39.640> so<00:04:40.390> I<00:04:40.420> can't<00:04:40.660> really<00:04:40.810> compare<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.230> those

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
MSR so I can't really compare to those

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.890 
MSR so I can't really compare to those
but<00:04:42.640> it<00:04:42.790> worked<00:04:43.270> out<00:04:43.360> great<00:04:43.540> for<00:04:43.630> what<00:04:43.870> I

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
but it worked out great for what I

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.170 
but it worked out great for what I
needed<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.380> do<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:45.160> I<00:04:45.190> can't<00:04:45.640> complain<00:04:45.940> there

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
needed to do so I can't complain there

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.900 
needed to do so I can't complain there
and<00:04:46.330> it<00:04:46.390> was<00:04:46.480> cold<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:48.520> only<00:04:48.730> thing<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:48.850> don't

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
and it was cold the only thing I don't

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.610 
and it was cold the only thing I don't
like<00:04:49.000> about<00:04:49.090> it<00:04:49.420> is<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:52.180> was<00:04:52.300> very<00:04:52.330> windy<00:04:52.720> and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
like about it is it was very windy and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.870 
like about it is it was very windy and
it<00:04:53.800> was<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:53.950> little<00:04:54.190> it's<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.460> little<00:04:54.669> flimsy

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
it was a little it's a little flimsy

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.710 
it was a little it's a little flimsy
just<00:04:55.600> standing<00:04:56.260> on<00:04:56.410> this<00:04:56.620> but<00:04:56.860> MSR<00:04:57.480> does<00:04:58.480> make

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
just standing on this but MSR does make

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.830 
just standing on this but MSR does make
a<00:04:59.400> stand<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.550> that<00:05:01.030> will<00:05:01.150> fit<00:05:01.360> on<00:05:01.390> any<00:05:01.480> of<00:05:01.750> the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
a stand that that will fit on any of the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.320 
a stand that that will fit on any of the
gas<00:05:01.990> canisters<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:03.550> gives<00:05:03.700> it<00:05:03.850> long<00:05:04.030> legs

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
gas canisters and it gives it long legs

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.540 
gas canisters and it gives it long legs
so<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.660> stabilizes<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:05.380> quite<00:05:05.500> a<00:05:05.530> bit<00:05:05.740> I'm

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
so it stabilizes it quite a bit I'm

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.740 
so it stabilizes it quite a bit I'm
going<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.760> pick<00:05:07.030> that<00:05:07.060> up<00:05:07.210> eventually<00:05:07.660> it's

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
going to pick that up eventually it's

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.580 
going to pick that up eventually it's
$15<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.860> it'll<00:05:09.250> it's<00:05:10.180> a<00:05:10.270> universal<00:05:10.840> stand<00:05:11.380> so

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
$15 and it'll it's a universal stand so

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.980 
$15 and it'll it's a universal stand so
it<00:05:11.710> works<00:05:11.860> with<00:05:11.980> anyone<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:13.630> only<00:05:13.840> other

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
it works with anyone the only other

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.470 
it works with anyone the only other
thing<00:05:14.140> I<00:05:14.200> didn't<00:05:14.380> like<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:14.500> lot<00:05:14.740> about<00:05:14.950> it<00:05:15.480> is

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
thing I didn't like a lot about it is

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.290 
thing I didn't like a lot about it is
how<00:05:16.660> short<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.140> arms<00:05:17.380> were<00:05:17.560> but<00:05:18.460> that's<00:05:19.120> why

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
how short the arms were but that's why

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.820 
how short the arms were but that's why
it's<00:05:19.450> such<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:19.780> when<00:05:20.410> you're<00:05:20.530> buying<00:05:20.650> the

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
it's such it when you're buying the

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.010 
it's such it when you're buying the
smallest<00:05:21.070> stove<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:22.270> can't<00:05:22.480> expect<00:05:22.780> that

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
smallest stove you can't expect that

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.710 
smallest stove you can't expect that
right<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:24.040> when<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.610> is<00:05:24.669> on<00:05:24.880> top<00:05:25.120> and<00:05:25.419> the

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
right so when this is on top and the

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.940 
right so when this is on top and the
winds<00:05:25.900> blow<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.080> it<00:05:26.230> can<00:05:26.350> be<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.470> little<00:05:26.620> flimsy

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
winds blow and it can be a little flimsy

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.980 
winds blow and it can be a little flimsy
so<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:27.880> want<00:05:28.090> to<00:05:28.180> keep<00:05:28.300> an<00:05:28.390> eye<00:05:28.540> on<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:28.870> you

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
so you want to keep an eye on it you

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.870 
so you want to keep an eye on it you
don't<00:05:29.080> just<00:05:29.169> want<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.470> let<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:29.620> go<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:30.010> come

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
don't just want to let it go and come

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.100 
don't just want to let it go and come
back<00:05:31.000> in<00:05:31.150> five<00:05:31.300> minutes<00:05:31.330> cuz<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.780> will<00:05:31.870> be<00:05:31.990> on

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
back in five minutes cuz it will be on

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.020 
back in five minutes cuz it will be on
the<00:05:32.200> ground<00:05:32.230> but<00:05:32.740> if<00:05:32.830> it's<00:05:32.980> not<00:05:33.070> windy<00:05:33.430> you're

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
the ground but if it's not windy you're

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.510 
the ground but if it's not windy you're
set<00:05:34.300> if<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.200> buy<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.410> extended<00:05:35.980> legs<00:05:36.190> from

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
set if you buy the extended legs from

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.220 
set if you buy the extended legs from
MSR<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.150> should<00:05:37.330> be<00:05:37.450> set<00:05:37.690> I<00:05:37.720> don't<00:05:37.990> know<00:05:38.080> yet

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
MSR you should be set I don't know yet

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.190 
MSR you should be set I don't know yet
but<00:05:38.560> my<00:05:39.010> buy<00:05:39.190> those<00:05:39.370> I'll<00:05:39.490> let<00:05:39.580> you<00:05:39.669> guys<00:05:39.790> know

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
and that really is the only I didn't

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.740 
and that really is the only I didn't
like<00:05:42.400> about<00:05:42.610> it<00:05:42.730> I<00:05:42.850> was<00:05:43.000> really<00:05:43.360> impressed

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
like about it I was really impressed

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.159 
like about it I was really impressed
with<00:05:44.460> how<00:05:45.460> long<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.730> fuel<00:05:45.910> lasted<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.540> use<00:05:47.020> this

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
with how long the fuel lasted I use this

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.020 
with how long the fuel lasted I use this
for<00:05:47.410> breakfast<00:05:47.740> lunch<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.040> dinner<00:05:48.100> for<00:05:48.880> three

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
for breakfast lunch and dinner for three

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.360 
for breakfast lunch and dinner for three
days

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
days

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.150 
days
and<00:05:50.460> there's<00:05:51.449> still<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:51.930> fourth<00:05:52.830> in<00:05:52.980> there

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
and there's still a fourth in there

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.740 
and there's still a fourth in there
about<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:53.880> I'm<00:05:53.970> pretty<00:05:54.120> excited<00:05:54.360> about<00:05:54.510> that

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
about so I'm pretty excited about that

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.070 
about so I'm pretty excited about that
it's<00:05:54.900> 399<00:05:55.440> for<00:05:55.650> monkeys<00:05:56.570> that<00:05:57.570> is<00:05:57.630> about<00:05:57.870> it

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
it's 399 for monkeys that is about it

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.449 
it's 399 for monkeys that is about it
for<00:05:58.290> the<00:05:58.470> optimist<00:05:59.130> crux<00:05:59.669> light<00:06:00.000> stove
