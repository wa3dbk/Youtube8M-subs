great so we want to go onto the bypass
now<00:00:10.559> I'm<00:00:10.830> gonna<00:00:10.920> have<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> look<00:00:11.309> at<00:00:11.490> it

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
now I'm gonna have a look at it

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.150 
now I'm gonna have a look at it
adjoining<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> what's<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> bypass<00:00:13.950> I'm

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
adjoining it so a what's the bypass I'm

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.650 
adjoining it so a what's the bypass I'm
sure<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.460> very<00:00:14.519> like<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> know<00:00:15.360> we've<00:00:15.480> been<00:00:15.509> on

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
sure you very like I know we've been on

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.390

it before I'm gonna just go over it I'd

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.460 
it before I'm gonna just go over it I'd
say<00:00:17.550> hey<00:00:17.850> we're<00:00:18.000> gonna<00:00:18.090> go<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:18.869> joining<00:00:19.199> it

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
say hey we're gonna go about joining it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.890 
say hey we're gonna go about joining it
so<00:00:20.039> got<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> slip<00:00:20.520> road<00:00:20.760> sort<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.300> joining

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
so got the slip road sort of a joining

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.689 
so got the slip road sort of a joining
like<00:00:22.109> leading<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.470> debt<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.130> slip<00:00:23.550> road

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
like leading up debt on that slip road

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.189 
like leading up debt on that slip road
we're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> build<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.300> momentum<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.900> face

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
we're going to build a momentum up face

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
we're going to build a momentum up face
so<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.769> were<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> same<00:00:27.060> speed<00:00:27.090> as

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so that we were going the same speed as

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.880 
so that we were going the same speed as
the<00:00:27.510> traffic<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.260> gonna<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.439> easy<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.830> us

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the traffic so it's gonna be easy for us

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.150 
the traffic so it's gonna be easy for us
to<00:00:28.949> marriage<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.380> while<00:00:31.380> doing<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.740> you're

going to be doing like a you're gonna be

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.479 
going to be doing like a you're gonna be
using<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.500> gears<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.920> we've<00:00:35.070> had<00:00:35.219> sort<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
using your gears that we've had sort of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889 
using your gears that we've had sort of
more<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> would<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.570> driving<00:00:36.840> along

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
more than you would just driving along

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.810 
more than you would just driving along
so<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> normal<00:00:37.620> Road<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.860> raven<00:00:38.489> cinema

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
so at the normal Road so raven cinema

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.130 
so at the normal Road so raven cinema
better<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> build<00:00:39.420> momentum<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
better to build momentum because you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.549 
better to build momentum because you
want<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.559> same<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.129> me<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:42.350> as<00:00:43.350> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
didn't that you don't matter on signal

painting me quit so if we come up and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.320 
painting me quit so if we come up and
there's<00:01:11.130> something<00:01:11.460> directly<00:01:11.640> beside<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you're just going to sort of ease off

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.929 
you're just going to sort of ease off
the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.830> slightly<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> look<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> one

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the first slightly and look to one

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.450 
the first slightly and look to one
behind<00:01:15.150> uncle's<00:01:15.540> directed<00:01:16.140> way<00:01:16.259> over<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
if there's something sit back from units

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
if there's something sit back from units
like<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.710> safe<00:01:20.009> distance<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.970> can

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
like a safe distance you can get you can

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
like a safe distance you can get you can
maybe<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.479> keep<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> speed<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.500> or

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
maybe just keep the speed you or

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.170 
maybe just keep the speed you or
increase<00:01:23.009> your<00:01:23.040> speed<00:01:23.280> slightly<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.880> just

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
increase your speed slightly and just

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780 
increase your speed slightly and just
pull<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> safely<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.680> front<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.070> once

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
pull it safely so in front of that once

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.219 
pull it safely so in front of that once
you're<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.119> you're<00:01:27.330> gonna<00:01:27.420> cancer<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> signal

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you're on you're gonna cancer the signal

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.530 
don't know if what we're gonna get till
we<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.210> there

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
we get there

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
we get there
a<00:01:33.570> key<00:01:34.380> thing<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.710> doing<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.189> are

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
a key thing as doing that we are

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010 
a key thing as doing that we are
building<00:01:35.490> our<00:01:35.700> speed<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.240> doing<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> same

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
building our speed up so doing the same

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.179 
building our speed up so doing the same
speed<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> traffic<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> then<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.100> would

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
speed as the traffic and then that would

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.740 
speed as the traffic and then that would
be<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.310> easy<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.790> join<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> can

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
be really easy to join if you can

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.210 
be really easy to join if you can
imagine<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.259> arrived<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.740> fifty<00:01:41.100> miles

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
imagine if you arrived at fifty miles

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
imagine if you arrived at fifty miles
now<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> traffic<00:01:42.210> doing<00:01:42.540> 50<00:01:42.960> they'll

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
now and this is traffic doing 50 they'll

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.800 
now and this is traffic doing 50 they'll
assume<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.189> frizzing<00:01:44.640> faster<00:01:45.090> but

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
assume like it's so frizzing faster but

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.960 
assume like it's so frizzing faster but
it's<00:01:45.899> gonna<00:01:46.020> give<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.259> goal

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.670 

start<00:01:53.330> welder<00:01:53.780> speed<00:01:54.020> up<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.290> once<00:01:54.530> you're

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
start welder speed up this once you're

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.710 
start welder speed up this once you're
in<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.890> corner<00:01:55.100> yeah<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.180> can<00:01:56.330> smoothly

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
in the corner yeah and you can smoothly

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.580 
in the corner yeah and you can smoothly
sort<00:01:57.050> of<00:01:57.110> felt<00:01:57.410> this<00:01:57.500> read<00:01:57.710> up<00:01:57.800> at<00:01:57.980> second<00:01:58.400> yeah
