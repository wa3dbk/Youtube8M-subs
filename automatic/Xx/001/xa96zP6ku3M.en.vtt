connotation for the Chinese and the a
lot<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.510> Chinese<00:02:39.160> jumped<00:02:40.160> in<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.580> and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
lot of Chinese jumped in and and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.440 
lot of Chinese jumped in and and
inflated<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.140> price<00:02:42.349> of<00:02:42.709> Lafite

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
inflated the price of Lafite

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.729 
inflated the price of Lafite
extraordinarily<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:45.200> mean<00:02:45.500> quite

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
extraordinarily I mean quite

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.520 
extraordinarily I mean quite
exceptionally<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.790> then<00:02:47.450> have<00:02:47.810> backed<00:02:48.290> off

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
exceptionally and then have backed off

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.979 
exceptionally and then have backed off
and<00:02:48.769> realized<00:02:49.100> maybe<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:49.970> not<00:02:50.300> quite<00:02:50.600> that

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
and realized maybe it's not quite that

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.080 
and realized maybe it's not quite that
as<00:02:51.410> much<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.010> special<00:02:52.400> as<00:02:52.519> we<00:02:52.640> thought<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.850> was

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
as much so special as we thought it was

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.090 
as much so special as we thought it was
and<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:53.780> if<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.080> look<00:02:54.230> at<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.410> graph<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
and so if you look at the graph of the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.350 
and so if you look at the graph of the
price<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.430> Lafite<00:02:55.790> there's<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.150> sort<00:02:56.299> of

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
price of Lafite there's a sort of

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.770 
price of Lafite there's a sort of
massive<00:02:56.870> peak<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.410> then<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.280> it's<00:02:58.819> fallen

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
massive peak and then it's it's fallen

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.509 
massive peak and then it's it's fallen
with<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> bit<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.260> judder<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.769> in<00:03:00.980> general
