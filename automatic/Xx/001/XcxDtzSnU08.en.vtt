00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
I got like 70 on either side normally it

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.630 
I got like 70 on either side normally it
started<00:01:31.420> like<00:01:31.540> 95<00:01:32.260> on<00:01:32.470> either<00:01:32.560> side<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:35.350> this

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
started like 95 on either side but this

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.820 
started like 95 on either side but this
stresses<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.880> legs<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.930> quads<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.619> little

stresses the legs the quads a little

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.280 
stresses the legs the quads a little
more<00:01:38.950> directly<00:01:39.369> than<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:40.049> bar<00:01:41.049> on<00:01:41.200> the

more directly than the bar on the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.670 
more directly than the bar on the
shoulders<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.689> is<00:01:43.780> deep<00:01:44.020> down<00:01:44.049> here<00:01:44.530> like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
shoulders so it is deep down here like

shoulders so it is deep down here like
this

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:57.959

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
so the lower bed step up and back I use

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.990 
so the lower bed step up and back I use
