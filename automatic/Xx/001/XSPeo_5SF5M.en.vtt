00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.329
 Also 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:52.800
 I wanted 8 n but this is because it contains 2 pieces 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:55.190
 I 'm going to put it on the deck I'm using right now. If it's home, it's a totally different design. 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.190
 Here 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:04.720

 I don't know for a while if it's 600,000 or so, but it's surprising 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:31.350
 It is Cheren or something 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.130
 A little fresh because unlike to have always it is a design image of Anne Ragi Dr. after the 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.550
