00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.160 
fish locator I put off to the left side
and<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:48.170> pretty

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and it's just because there was a pretty

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
so that's why it went on that side no

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
so that's why it went on that side no
real<00:01:57.240> other<00:01:57.360> reason

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.520 
just keep things out of the way
it<00:02:03.330> seems<00:02:03.570> tough<00:02:03.720> seems<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.350> work<00:02:04.470> best<00:02:06.530> you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it seems tough seems to work best you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.229 
it seems tough seems to work best you
see<00:02:07.679> I<00:02:07.710> put<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.070> right<00:02:08.100> down<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.519> that<00:02:08.640> pocket

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
see I put it right down in that pocket

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.420 
see I put it right down in that pocket
that<00:02:10.050> little<00:02:10.229> space<00:02:10.470> there<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.130> use<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that little space there so can use the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.729 
that little space there so can use the
pocket<00:02:11.640> put<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> cord<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.900> there<00:02:13.080> no<00:02:13.410> excess

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
pocket put the cord in there no excess

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.720 
pocket put the cord in there no excess
cord<00:02:17.060> still<00:02:18.060> useful<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:18.720> any<00:02:19.470> further<00:02:19.830> up<00:02:20.130> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
cord still useful but any further up and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.830 
cord still useful but any further up and
I<00:02:20.790> think<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> rods<00:02:21.300> would<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.570> been<00:02:21.660> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
I think the rods would have been a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.110 
I think the rods would have been a
little<00:02:21.959> too<00:02:22.170> far<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.769> way<00:02:23.060> then<00:02:24.060> it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
little too far out of the way then it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.900 
little too far out of the way then it
tough<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.390> reach<00:02:25.250> what<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.489> right<00:02:26.730> now<00:02:26.760> is

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
tough to reach what I have right now is

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.660 
tough to reach what I have right now is
if<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.420> need<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.170> rod<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.459> sit

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
if I need to get the rod I can just sit

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.390 
if I need to get the rod I can just sit
up<00:02:29.700> forward<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.360> I'm<00:02:30.510> able<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.810> reach<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.400> I'm

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
up forward and I'm able to reach it I'm

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.360 
up forward and I'm able to reach it I'm
about<00:02:32.700> six<00:02:32.940> foot<00:02:33.060> tall<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:34.100> you're<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> little

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
about six foot tall so you're a little

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.620 
about six foot tall so you're a little
shorter<00:02:35.700> perhaps<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.180> want<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.420> move<00:02:36.480> them

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
shorter perhaps you want to move them

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.479 
shorter perhaps you want to move them
back<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> little<00:02:37.019> bit<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:37.560> your<00:02:38.070> seat<00:02:38.280> would<00:02:38.400> be

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
back a little bit but your seat would be

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.160 
back a little bit but your seat would be
full<00:02:38.760> more<00:02:39.060> forward<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.989> work

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
full more forward so I think if I work

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.240 
full more forward so I think if I work
out<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> same<00:02:40.860> for<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:45.600> back<00:02:45.829> put<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:46.860> rod

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
out just the same for the back put a rod

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520 
out just the same for the back put a rod
holder<00:02:47.579> here<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.060> little<00:02:48.780> ninety<00:02:49.200> degree<00:02:49.410> going

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
holder here a little ninety degree going

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.229 
holder here a little ninety degree going
here<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.100> get<00:02:50.280> above<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.610> crate<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> got

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
here just get above the crate so I got

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.990 
here just get above the crate so I got
some<00:02:51.420> storage<00:02:51.690> space<00:02:52.100> proud<00:02:53.100> holder<00:02:53.310> here<00:02:53.670> can

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
some storage space proud holder here can

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.630 
some storage space proud holder here can
put<00:02:54.209> some<00:02:54.420> rides<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:55.470> top<00:02:55.739> if<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.040> need<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.400> for

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
put some rides up top if I need to for

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.860 
put some rides up top if I need to for

there and the paddle lock and that I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.789 
there and the paddle lock and that I
thought<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.019> was<00:03:04.140> gonna<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.380> kind<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
thought that was gonna be kind of a

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.560 
thought that was gonna be kind of a
annoyance<00:03:05.549> having<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.030> there<00:03:06.239> but<00:03:06.420> that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
annoyance having that there but that

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.180 
annoyance having that there but that
actually<00:03:06.959> there's<00:03:07.410> no<00:03:07.560> problem<00:03:07.920> whatsoever
