00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello everyone today I would like to tell 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.740
 to great consoles like authorities 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.740
 shim land 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:24.040
 and I'll probably start with her appearance 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.160
 there were twenty of them back on originally 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.710
 and slim version of sony playstation but there was 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.240
 also the blue version is so mysterious and 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.790
 it was intended for developers 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.739
 and from the gray version only those 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.340
 that you could run games on it 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.530
 any region this prefix with the same 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.809
 stringy if you're lucky to find and on 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.879
 auction then it will cost you considerable 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.980
 money so so sets and came in 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.710
 necessary equipment and instructions for 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.760
 creating games since that meant for 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.930
 some some presses and for 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.880
 developers but still consider 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.040
 the classic version on the top cover we 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.110
 we can three buttons that well ka psn which 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.989
 restarted the console button which 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.330
 turned it on and off and experience button 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.119
 which opened the drive itself to 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.830
 put there actually drive on 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.660
 The front panel has two inputs for 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.600
 joysticks and two for memory card 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.030
 I do not have a panic of fathoms but if 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.130
 who has few ports for joysticks 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.990
 special cartoon stage which allowed 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.190
 connect 4 such joystick 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.600
 play directly in four on 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.700
 rear panel you can find a connector for 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.500
 power supply for transmission 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.840
 images directly on tv 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.759
 connector sialal honestly say no 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.429
 I have why it is needed and a connector for 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.039
 I have extensions to this console 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.340
 only one device that can 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.039
 fit here this century this is such 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.080
 the thing that let you out of the bag 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.130
 directly do what you sit 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.710
 movie player 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.770
 when connecting a set-top box and switching 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.240
 mode in the mode, you can put a disk with 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.079
 film and sprawled on the couch 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.750
 watch a movie 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.460
 but there was also a crane for the steam version but both 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.530
 this next time 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.330
 jessica in russia were usually 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.819
 Chinese fakes substandard 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.580
 plastic constantly falling buttons 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.290
 gum troops were torn and the rest 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.420
 slag that we did live something skin 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.489
 Essentially but the kit also went and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.120
 original sony vsky joystick with 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.700
 poems 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.410
 but unfortunately he did not survive I remember 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.390
 just one game is gran turismo 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.580
 which played with him for what reason 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.349
 broke I have no idea in our time 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.190
 you can connect the joystick from ps2 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.660
 since their ports are absolutely similar and 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.709
 Fully joystick compatible with 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.200
 previous generation their firms but 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.640
 ps2 memory card already in ps1 not 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.760
 you will thrust because they have 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.390
 special teeth that do not allow 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.090
 to put 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.780
 console this memory card and actually have 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.340
 you won't succeed 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.200
 there were a lot of games on the console but I 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.269
 like many others did not even suspect 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.799
 that they were pirated and on almost every 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.670
 it was written that they are completely on 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.470
 Russian language 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.750
 when licensed drives were mostly 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.459
 in English to distinguish the license from 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.120
 pirates were just looking at 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.579
 drive itself 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.540
 the streets here the back side was black and 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.540
 no more 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.740
 in games you could often see 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.290
 such a picture but what about the startup screen 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.850
 console that causes a sea of ​​orgasm for 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.030
 the sound of the way on the console was all 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.680
 perfect but understandable because sony 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.680
 famous for its sound quality 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.400
 March mania 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.340
 my power mode 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.090
 rahov 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.110
 take off was
