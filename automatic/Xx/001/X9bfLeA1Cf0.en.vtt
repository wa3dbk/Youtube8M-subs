stopped working for no reason at all we

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.380 
stopped working for no reason at all we

everything<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.810> working<00:00:24.990> fine<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:26.099> turn

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
everything is working fine and we turn

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.189 
everything is working fine and we turn
up<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.789> within<00:00:27.210> five<00:00:27.539> minutes<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.080> would

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
up and within five minutes it would

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.349 
up and within five minutes it would
automatically<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.609> turn<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.210> within

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
is over time your laptop and/or computer

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.080 
is over time your laptop and/or computer
it<00:01:58.390> gets<00:01:59.230> a<00:01:59.350> lot<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.650> dust<00:01:59.950> into<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.670> dust

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
it gets a lot of dust into it and dust

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.180 
it gets a lot of dust into it and dust
could<00:02:01.450> stop<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:02.140> things<00:02:02.440> from<00:02:02.650> working<00:02:03.040> and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
could stop the things from working and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.300 
could stop the things from working and
it<00:02:04.000> what<00:02:04.660> happened<00:02:05.080> was<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.770> dust<00:02:06.070> had

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
it what happened was the dust had

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.920 
it what happened was the dust had
stopped<00:02:06.580> my<00:02:06.760> brother<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.210> banned<00:02:07.690> from

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
stopped my brother is banned from

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.900 
stopped my brother is banned from
working<00:02:08.320> so<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.130> computer<00:02:09.520> fan<00:02:09.670> wasn't

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
working so the computer fan wasn't

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.630 
working so the computer fan wasn't
working<00:02:10.300> at<00:02:10.450> all<00:02:10.720> which<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.590> why<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.400> computer

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
working at all which is why the computer

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.700 
working at all which is why the computer
isn't<00:02:13.150> working<00:02:13.240> because<00:02:13.660> when<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.440> turn<00:02:14.590> the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
isn't working because when you turn the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.680 
isn't working because when you turn the
computer<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.430> automatically<00:02:16.060> overheated

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
computer on it automatically overheated

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.000 
computer on it automatically overheated
and<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.930> automatically<00:02:17.350> just<00:02:17.590> turned<00:02:17.860> off

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
and it automatically just turned off

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.520 
and it automatically just turned off
because<00:02:18.490> when<00:02:19.120> things<00:02:19.660> get<00:02:19.810> too<00:02:20.020> hot<00:02:20.230> it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
because when things get too hot it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.530 
because when things get too hot it
automatically<00:02:21.160> turns<00:02:21.430> off<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.330> that's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
automatically turns off like so that's

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.170 
automatically turns off like so that's
that<00:02:22.840> was<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.230> main<00:02:23.410> problem<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.400> what<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:25.120> did

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
that was the main problem so what I did

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
that was the main problem so what I did
was<00:02:25.600> take<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.140> gray<00:02:26.800> into<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> fan<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
was take this gray into the fan and a

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.080 
was take this gray into the fan and a
lot<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.620> dust<00:02:29.950> came<00:02:30.250> out<00:02:30.400> trust<00:02:30.730> me<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:30.910> was

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
lot of dust came out trust me I was

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.320 
lot of dust came out trust me I was
there<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:32.260> does<00:02:32.410> came<00:02:32.650> out<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.180> he<00:02:34.180> just

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
there and it does came out and he just

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.120 
there and it does came out and he just
sprayed<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.720> couple<00:02:35.080> times<00:02:35.260> dust<00:02:35.710> came<00:02:35.920> out

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
sprayed it couple times dust came out

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.790 
sprayed it couple times dust came out
and<00:02:36.310> once<00:02:37.030> there<00:02:37.210> was<00:02:37.300> no<00:02:37.360> more<00:02:37.600> dust<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.200> give

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
and once there was no more dust you give

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.250 
and once there was no more dust you give
back<00:02:39.010> my<00:02:39.070> brothers<00:02:39.790> try<00:02:40.060> out<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.870> ended<00:02:41.170> up

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
back my brothers try out and it ended up

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.130 
back my brothers try out and it ended up
working<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.890> working<00:02:42.700> fine<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.210> it's<00:02:43.960> not

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
working and working fine and it's not

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.470 
working and working fine and it's not
overheating<00:02:44.740> as<00:02:44.890> much<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.430> tried<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.270> same

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
overheating as much I tried it the same

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.750 
overheating as much I tried it the same
with<00:02:46.660> my<00:02:46.930> laptop<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:48.040> my<00:02:48.130> surprise<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.520> lot

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
with my laptop and to my surprise a lot

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.180 
with my laptop and to my surprise a lot
of<00:02:48.910> cells<00:02:49.090> came<00:02:49.330> out<00:02:49.480> too<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.770> started

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
of cells came out too and it started

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.830 
of cells came out too and it started
going<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.520> little<00:02:51.640> bit<00:02:51.790> faster<00:02:52.210> because<00:02:52.570> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
going a little bit faster because the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.890 
going a little bit faster because the
parts<00:02:53.200> were<00:02:53.380> on<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:54.550> parts<00:02:55.060> weren't<00:02:55.239> heated

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
parts were on the parts weren't heated

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.510 
parts were on the parts weren't heated
up<00:02:56.020> at<00:02:56.170> all<00:02:56.350> indeed<00:02:56.560> we're<00:02:56.830> at<00:02:57.010> school<00:02:57.130> if<00:02:57.370> they

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
up at all indeed we're at school if they

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.000 
up at all indeed we're at school if they
needed<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.970> be<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.300> work<00:02:58.510> correctly<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.590> that's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
needed to be to work correctly so that's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.670 
needed to be to work correctly so that's
why<00:03:00.340> on<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:01.180> started<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.600> faster<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.530> that's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
why on it started going faster so that's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440 
why on it started going faster so that's
just<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.950> quick<00:03:03.160> little<00:03:03.520> tip<00:03:03.730> for<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.060> guys<00:03:04.239> to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
just a quick little tip for you guys to

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.300 
just a quick little tip for you guys to
fix<00:03:04.720> your<00:03:04.959> laptop<00:03:05.440> or<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.650> computer<00:03:05.739> and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
it's not going to work for everything

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.290 
it's not going to work for everything
obviously<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.340> will<00:03:09.550> work<00:03:09.790> if<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.120> have<00:03:10.270> a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
obviously but it will work if you have a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.990 
obviously but it will work if you have a
problem<00:03:10.570> similar<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.320> my<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:12.250> what<00:03:12.880> my

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
problem similar to my but what my

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.030 
problem similar to my but what my
brother<00:03:13.209> had<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.720> even<00:03:14.560> if<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.739> don't<00:03:14.860> have

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
brother had and even if you don't have

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.800 
brother had and even if you don't have
any<00:03:15.190> problems<00:03:15.700> if<00:03:15.880> your<00:03:16.090> computer's<00:03:16.420> going<00:03:16.540> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
any problems if your computer's going a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.170 
any problems if your computer's going a
little<00:03:17.050> slow<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.830> can<00:03:18.160> maybe<00:03:18.310> try<00:03:18.580> an<00:03:18.820> AVO

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
little slow you can maybe try an AVO

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.630 
little slow you can maybe try an AVO
boost<00:03:19.540> up<00:03:19.750> its<00:03:19.930> performance<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.590> little<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.040> if

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
boost up its performance a little and if

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.250 
boost up its performance a little and if
your<00:03:21.820> fan<00:03:22.090> doesn't<00:03:22.390> work<00:03:22.570> on<00:03:22.780> your<00:03:22.900> computer

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
your fan doesn't work on your computer

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.290 
your fan doesn't work on your computer
or<00:03:23.709> your<00:03:24.100> laptop<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.820> know<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.120> doesn't

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
or your laptop and you know it doesn't

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.940 
or your laptop and you know it doesn't
work<00:03:25.510> because<00:03:25.630> it's<00:03:25.840> not<00:03:25.989> moving<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.800> could

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
work because it's not moving you could

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.260 
work because it's not moving you could
try<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.130> too<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.580> maybe<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:28.000> could<00:03:28.209> help

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
try this too and maybe this could help

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.740 
try this too and maybe this could help
it

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.920 
it
start<00:03:29.170> moving

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
start moving

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.259 
start moving
maybe<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.290> just<00:03:30.739> help<00:03:31.159> it<00:03:31.340> out<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.489> little<00:03:31.730> so

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
maybe you just help it out a little so

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.360 
maybe you just help it out a little so
all<00:03:32.689> you<00:03:32.930> need<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.109> do<00:03:33.260> again<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.530> take<00:03:33.920> one<00:03:34.250> of

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
all you need to do again is take one of
