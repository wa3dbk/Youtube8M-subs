really<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.939> think<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> proof<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
really I think the proof is in the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.900 
really I think the proof is in the
pudding<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.650> think<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> actually<00:00:23.430> document

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
pudding I think if you actually document

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.340 
pudding I think if you actually document
yourself<00:00:24.000> doing<00:00:24.359> these<00:00:24.570> exercises<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
yourself doing these exercises with a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.019 
yourself doing these exercises with a
camera<00:00:25.740> you'll<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.070> able<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> yes<00:00:26.820> in

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
camera you'll be able to see that yes in

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.240 
camera you'll be able to see that yes in
fact<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.420> does<00:00:27.869> work<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.980> you

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
fact it actually does work and can you

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.310 
fact it actually does work and can you
with<00:00:29.789> face<00:00:29.970> yoga<00:00:30.210> get<00:00:30.449> rid<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> wrinkles<00:00:31.080> you

with face yoga get rid of wrinkles you
already<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.279> will<00:00:32.460> actually<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.940> rid

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.959 
of these crow's feet you can minimize
them<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.190> certainly<00:00:35.399> tone<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
them and you can certainly tone the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.400 
them and you can certainly tone the
muscles<00:00:36.000> under<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> skin<00:00:36.930> which<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
muscles under the skin which is going to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
muscles under the skin which is going to
plump<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.860> those<00:00:38.070> muscles<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.730> lift<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> skin

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
along with it so I would say you can

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.010 
along with it so I would say you can
reduce<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.000> appearance<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.510> wrinkles<00:00:42.660> and

reduce the appearance of wrinkles and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.569 
reduce the appearance of wrinkles and
you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.290> definitely<00:00:43.410> minimize<00:00:44.040> them<00:00:44.309> all

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
you can definitely minimize them all

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.529 
you can definitely minimize them all

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
one eyelid time it's kind of hard for me

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
one eyelid time it's kind of hard for me
to<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.530> without<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.770> mirror<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.130> I'll<00:01:08.250> try<00:01:08.460> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
to do without a mirror but I'll try so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.539 
to do without a mirror but I'll try so
sort<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:09.960> winking<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
sort of like you're winking I can see it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.760 
sort of like you're winking I can see it
and<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:12.360> you're<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> take<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.260> index

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and then you're going to take the index

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
and then you're going to take the index
finger<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.670> there's<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> muscle<00:01:15.270> part<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
finger so there's a muscle part of the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840 
finger so there's a muscle part of the
ring<00:01:15.869> muscle<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> depress

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
ring muscle and you're going to depress

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.249 
ring muscle and you're going to depress
that<00:01:17.880> muscle<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> has<00:01:18.869> something<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that muscle so it has something to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.859 
that muscle so it has something to
resist

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.959 

and<00:01:26.439> how<00:01:26.619> many<00:01:26.799> times<00:01:26.950> do<00:01:27.219> you<00:01:27.250> do<00:01:27.429> that<00:01:27.640> I<00:01:27.789> like

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
and how many times do you do that I like

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.749 
and how many times do you do that I like
to<00:01:28.000> do<00:01:28.179> 20<00:01:28.570> in<00:01:28.689> a<00:01:28.750> row<00:01:28.929> on<00:01:29.229> each<00:01:29.289> side<00:01:30.070> stop<00:01:30.549> and

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
to do 20 in a row on each side stop and

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.459 
to do 20 in a row on each side stop and
then<00:01:30.850> do<00:01:30.969> another<00:01:31.149> 20<00:01:31.359> in<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:31.719> row<00:01:31.750> when<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:32.350> get

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
then do another 20 in a row when you get

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.289 
then do another 20 in a row when you get
really<00:01:32.649> good<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.280> can<00:01:33.670> do<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.090> mirror

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
really good I can do this in the mirror

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.209 
really good I can do this in the mirror
but<00:01:34.450> not<00:01:34.630> looking<00:01:35.049> at<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.319> you<00:01:35.740> can<00:01:35.920> do<00:01:36.009> about

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
but not looking at you you can do about

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.289 
but not looking at you you can do about
that<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.399> same<00:01:36.549> time<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.729> might<00:01:36.909> be<00:01:36.939> able<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.179> do

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
that the same time I might be able to do

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.850 
that the same time I might be able to do

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
helps to tone this muscle right here

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.360 
helps to tone this muscle right here
which<00:02:28.900> lifts<00:02:29.379> and<00:02:29.560> releases<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.100> upper

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
everything else really neutral and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.539 
everything else really neutral and
you're<00:02:46.900> just<00:02:47.019> going<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.230> glue<00:02:47.950> your<00:02:47.980> upper

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.220 

so<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:56.760> counted<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.180> five<00:02:57.360> you'll<00:02:57.870> feel<00:02:58.110> it

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
so I just counted to five you'll feel it

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.550 
so I just counted to five you'll feel it
when<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.440> do<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.170> want<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.380> keep<00:03:01.470> your

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
eyelids as smooth as possible so this

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.260 
eyelids as smooth as possible so this
think<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.650> gluing<00:03:05.100> down<00:03:05.340> your<00:03:05.580> upper<00:03:05.820> eyelids

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
think of gluing down your upper eyelids

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.510 
think of gluing down your upper eyelids
yeah<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.960> smoothing<00:03:07.950> everything<00:03:08.310> at<00:03:08.430> the

yeah and smoothing everything at the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.130 
yeah and smoothing everything at the
same<00:03:08.670> time<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:12.240> again<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.570> should<00:03:12.600> feel<00:03:12.930> some

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
same time and again you should feel some

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.290 
same time and again you should feel some
kind<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.440> lactic<00:03:13.950> acid<00:03:14.490> burn<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> little

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300
