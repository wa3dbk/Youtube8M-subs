00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
thousand router and as Cadets giving the

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.699

connection to the Apple TV and the

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:07.679 
connection to the Apple TV and the
iPhone<00:01:06.100> but<00:01:06.670> it's<00:01:06.819> in<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.969> separate<00:01:07.209> room<00:01:07.420> so

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
iPhone but it's in a separate room so

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.209 
iPhone but it's in a separate room so
it's<00:01:07.840> farther<00:01:08.170> than<00:01:08.499> it<00:01:08.649> should<00:01:08.829> be

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:09.219 
it's farther than it should be

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.690 
it's farther than it should be
but<00:01:09.969> it<00:01:10.119> still<00:01:10.329> works<00:01:10.539> well<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:12.189> you<00:01:12.249> will<00:01:12.490> see

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
but it still works well now you will see

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.149 
but it still works well now you will see
some<00:01:12.729> slight<00:01:13.270> lagging<00:01:14.109> and<00:01:14.289> that<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.009> not

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
some slight lagging and that is not

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.870 
some slight lagging and that is not
because<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.689> unsynced<00:01:16.689> unseat<00:01:17.439> edge<00:01:17.920> from<00:01:18.549> the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
because of unsynced unseat edge from the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.879 
because of unsynced unseat edge from the
two<00:01:19.630> cameras<00:01:20.049> that<00:01:20.079> I'm<00:01:20.259> recording<00:01:20.469> with<00:01:20.709> it

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:20.889 
two cameras that I'm recording with it

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.029 
two cameras that I'm recording with it
is<00:01:20.979> actually<00:01:21.340> artifacts<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.509> using<00:01:23.049> airplay

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
is actually artifacts of using airplay

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.489 
is actually artifacts of using airplay
right<00:01:24.700> there<00:01:24.909> you<00:01:25.060> just<00:01:25.179> saw<00:01:25.359> one<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.840> very<00:01:26.319> big

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
right there you just saw one a very big

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:28.469 
right there you just saw one a very big
one<00:01:26.679> that<00:01:26.950> usually<00:01:27.670> happens<00:01:27.999> when<00:01:28.119> you<00:01:28.209> start

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
one that usually happens when you start

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.480 
one that usually happens when you start
the<00:01:28.599> game<00:01:28.630> up<00:01:28.929> you<00:01:29.139> know<00:01:29.259> it's<00:01:29.490> it's

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
the game up you know it's it's

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.429 
the game up you know it's it's
saturating<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.149> connection<00:01:31.659> and<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.200> takes<00:01:32.380> a

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
saturating the connection and it takes a

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.099 
saturating the connection and it takes a
little<00:01:32.529> while<00:01:32.709> for<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.069> to<00:01:33.130> become<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.509> true

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
little while for it to become the true

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.499 
little while for it to become the true
framerate<00:01:35.409> that<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.829> should<00:01:36.009> be<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
framerate that it should be so the

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.929 
framerate that it should be so the
little<00:01:37.749> glitches<00:01:38.169> you'll<00:01:38.439> see<00:01:38.619> are<00:01:38.939> what

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
little glitches you'll see are what

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.099 
little glitches you'll see are what
would<00:01:40.029> actually<00:01:40.179> happen<00:01:40.389> when<00:01:40.990> you're

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
would actually happen when you're

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.949 
would actually happen when you're
playing<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.549> see<00:01:42.700> when<00:01:42.819> I<00:01:42.849> change<00:01:43.119> cameras<00:01:43.689> it

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
playing and see when I change cameras it

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.839 
playing and see when I change cameras it
hangs<00:01:44.319> for<00:01:44.619> just<00:01:44.859> a<00:01:44.919> slight<00:01:45.130> second<00:01:45.579> but<00:01:45.729> when

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
hangs for just a slight second but when

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.489 
hangs for just a slight second but when
I<00:01:45.880> change<00:01:46.119> cameras<00:01:46.479> again<00:01:46.689> it's<00:01:47.289> stopped

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
I change cameras again it's stopped

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:54.269 
I change cameras again it's stopped
hanging<00:01:47.709> and<00:01:49.499> then<00:01:51.419> so<00:01:52.419> the<00:01:53.109> small<00:01:53.619> movements

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:54.279 
hanging and then so the small movements

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:57.899 
hanging and then so the small movements
are<00:01:55.649> exactly<00:01:56.649> how<00:01:56.770> you'd<00:01:56.950> play<00:01:57.069> it<00:01:57.159> I<00:01:57.340> got<00:01:57.759> the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
are exactly how you'd play it I got the

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.389 
are exactly how you'd play it I got the
two<00:01:58.029> Clips<00:01:58.299> synched<00:01:58.599> up<00:01:58.689> as<00:01:58.929> as<00:01:59.529> good<00:02:00.039> as<00:02:00.309> you

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
two Clips synched up as as good as you

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.519 
two Clips synched up as as good as you
can<00:02:00.609> so<00:02:01.450> they're<00:02:01.659> perfectly<00:02:02.020> time<00:02:02.289> locked

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
can so they're perfectly time locked

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:06.149 
can so they're perfectly time locked
together<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:04.929> so<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.289> can<00:02:05.469> see<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.829> know<00:02:05.919> it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
together and so you can see you know it

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.949 
together and so you can see you know it
becomes<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.669> little<00:02:06.880> laggy<00:02:07.029> at<00:02:07.239> some<00:02:07.450> point<00:02:07.719> and

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
becomes a little laggy at some point and

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:08.400 
becomes a little laggy at some point and
then

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
then

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.290 
then
you<00:02:08.830> know<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.010> comes<00:02:09.190> back<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:09.370> it's<00:02:10.060> just<00:02:10.240> a

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
you know it comes back on it's just a

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.730 
you know it comes back on it's just a
little<00:02:10.450> intermittent<00:02:11.050> thing<00:02:11.230> kind<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.620> like

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
little intermittent thing kind of like

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.010 
little intermittent thing kind of like
streaming<00:02:12.160> video<00:02:12.450> that's<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.660> know<00:02:13.750> same

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
streaming video that's you know same

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.810 
streaming video that's you know same
thing<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:14.470> over-the-air<00:02:15.100> streaming<00:02:15.670> which

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
thing it's over-the-air streaming which

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.720 
thing it's over-the-air streaming which
you're<00:02:16.480> gonna<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.780> when<00:02:16.960> you<00:02:17.020> have<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.730> router

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
you're gonna get when you have a router

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.430 
you're gonna get when you have a router
farther<00:02:19.180> away<00:02:19.330> or<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.870> an<00:02:19.990> older<00:02:20.260> router

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
farther away or you have an older router

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.580 
farther away or you have an older router
you<00:02:20.710> know<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:22.060> otherwise<00:02:22.960> I'm<00:02:23.320> pretty

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
you know so but otherwise I'm pretty

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.860 
you know so but otherwise I'm pretty
impressed<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:24.010> how<00:02:24.160> fluent<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.150> once<00:02:25.690> a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
impressed to how fluent and once a

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.170 
impressed to how fluent and once a
connection<00:02:26.260> saturates<00:02:26.980> enough<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.910> really

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
connection saturates enough you really

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.360 
connection saturates enough you really
get<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> high<00:02:28.630> frame<00:02:28.960> rate<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.410> there's<00:02:30.250> really

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
get a high frame rate and there's really

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.890 
get a high frame rate and there's really
no<00:02:31.740> loss<00:02:32.740> in<00:02:32.770> in<00:02:33.420> control<00:02:34.420> or<00:02:34.660> anything<00:02:34.780> like

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
no loss in in control or anything like

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.150 
no loss in in control or anything like
that<00:02:34.960> your<00:02:35.290> controls<00:02:35.680> pretty<00:02:35.800> much<00:02:35.950> stay

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
that your controls pretty much stay

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.220 
that your controls pretty much stay
there<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.460> whole<00:02:36.490> time<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.180> you're<00:02:37.960> able<00:02:38.200> to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
there the whole time and you're able to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.200 
there the whole time and you're able to
play<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.830> would<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.310> iPhone<00:02:39.850> itself

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
play like you would on the iPhone itself

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.900 
play like you would on the iPhone itself
except<00:02:41.140> now<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.410> sound<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:42.040> video<00:02:42.490> is

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
except now your sound and video is

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.540 
except now your sound and video is
streaming<00:02:43.720> through<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.900> big<00:02:44.050> TV<00:02:44.400> instead<00:02:45.400> of

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
streaming through a big TV instead of

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.790 
streaming through a big TV instead of
the<00:02:45.640> small<00:02:45.880> iPhone<00:02:46.240> screen<00:02:46.570> so<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:47.590> kind<00:02:47.770> of

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
the small iPhone screen so it's kind of

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.990 
the small iPhone screen so it's kind of
neat<00:02:47.950> because<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.520> know<00:02:48.640> some<00:02:48.820> of<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> things

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
neat because you know some of the things

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.330 
neat because you know some of the things
show<00:02:49.360> up<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.630> TV<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.260> some<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.130> things

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
show up on the TV and some of the things

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.890 
show up on the TV and some of the things
show<00:02:51.580> up<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.000> iPhone<00:02:52.270> screen<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.750> things

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
show up on the iPhone screen the things

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.360 
show up on the iPhone screen the things
you<00:02:53.020> interact<00:02:53.380> with<00:02:53.470> show<00:02:53.770> up<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.070> iPhones

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
you interact with show up on the iPhones

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.980 
you interact with show up on the iPhones
touch<00:02:54.670> screen<00:02:54.940> instead<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:57.430> big<00:02:57.990> TV

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
touch screen instead of the the big TV

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.290 
touch screen instead of the the big TV
so<00:02:59.380> that's<00:02:59.680> nice<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.250> how<00:03:00.400> they<00:03:00.580> did<00:03:00.820> that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
so that's nice I like how they did that

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.800 
so that's nice I like how they did that
and<00:03:01.500> as<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.770> see<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.010> there<00:03:03.190> there's<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.810> just

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
and as you see in there there's a just

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.290 
and as you see in there there's a just
my<00:03:04.960> iPhones<00:03:05.680> home<00:03:05.950> screen<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.580> going<00:03:07.180> right

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300

now and just going about turning off the
airplane<00:03:10.840> mirroring<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.470> can<00:03:11.650> just<00:03:11.740> use<00:03:11.800> my

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
airplane mirroring so I can just use my

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.610 
airplane mirroring so I can just use my
iPhone<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.580> I<00:03:12.640> normally<00:03:12.910> would<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.540> I'm<00:03:14.410> back
