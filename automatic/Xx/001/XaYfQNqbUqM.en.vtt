first of all what's cool about this gun

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.390 
first of all what's cool about this gun
is<00:00:53.240> you<00:00:53.660> could<00:00:53.840> switch<00:00:54.230> it<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.470> shoot<00:00:55.040> one

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
is you could switch it to shoot one

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.510 
is you could switch it to shoot one
bullet<00:00:55.610> at<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:56.000> time<00:00:57.010> two<00:00:58.010> at<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.250> time

or<00:00:59.890> three<00:01:00.890> at<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.100> time<00:01:01.180> what's<00:01:02.180> also<00:01:02.360> cool<00:01:02.720> is

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
or three at a time what's also cool is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.460 
or three at a time what's also cool is
you<00:01:03.320> still<00:01:04.040> have<00:01:04.070> this<00:01:04.430> part<00:01:04.730> on<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.940> top

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470

which you put your ammo clip in but

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.800 
which you put your ammo clip in but
what's<00:01:09.200> cool<00:01:09.500> is<00:01:09.830> if<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.100> run<00:01:10.280> out<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.460> ammo

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.719 

they<00:01:14.810> put<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:15.260> part<00:01:15.620> on<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.800> bottom<00:01:16.220> of<00:01:16.550> the

they put this part on the bottom of the
gun<00:01:18.250> which<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.580> isn't<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.090> don't<00:01:20.330> use<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:20.720> to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
gun which it isn't you don't use it to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.200 
gun which it isn't you don't use it to
shoot<00:01:21.140> but<00:01:21.830> since<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:22.400> on<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.700> bottom<00:01:22.880> if

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
shoot but since it's on the bottom if

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.150 
shoot but since it's on the bottom if
you<00:01:23.330> run<00:01:23.479> out<00:01:23.600> of<00:01:23.630> ammo<00:01:24.050> you<00:01:24.080> easily<00:01:25.009> have

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
you run out of ammo you easily have

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.880 
you run out of ammo you easily have
another<00:01:25.430> clip<00:01:25.700> right<00:01:25.940> here<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.330> could

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
another clip right here so you could

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.570 
another clip right here so you could
pull<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.040> out<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.229> put<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.259> right<00:01:30.530> on<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:33.580> you

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
pull it out and put it right on and you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.060 
pull it out and put it right on and you
could<00:01:34.790> get<00:01:35.030> other<00:01:35.240> clips<00:01:35.720> from<00:01:36.500> other<00:01:36.680> guns

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070
