 It is understood whether the death penalty system is in favor or against everyone who received it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:00.280
 First of all, Omiya Ely, who is against the death penalty , talks about the reason 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:11.190
 By the way , there is still a country in Uchi , but after all people are being done 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.790
 A country with a tooth row 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.880
 By I'm I myself there were not very accepting softened immediate physiological practice to say desert 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:27.890
 Yappashi chain says immediately of selfish 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:32.870
 Ne because killed that person to loved ones is their favorite favorite people are living those days life 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:39.900
 Who thought that the person who broke the life of the person who robbed 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:47.129
 But I softened've thought really I wonder if Is it right to take the life of that person is going to bed 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.280
 life is that life imprisonment or something revenge system like a country after all of the people of Tteyuu k 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.380
 direction 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.430
 I feel very uncomfortable about pushing it to my job 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:04.900
 I understand opposition by say they've think 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:12.040
 Followed by Mr. Kojima 's type, the entertainer Mr. Kojima will prosecute the death penalty with his own theory 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.790
 I may well from the old days favor Chonhai there in recent Well Toka that false charge conditionally 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.299
 but 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.480
 Red-handed because I think it's hella cute was no false charge 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.250
 If it says already, it is a lot of street 1 a lot 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.890
 The other death penalty adamant in Toka shutter people You think at all a good time 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.380
 Ota Lesbian Gay 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.370
 The second half is already 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.230
 Strong and it was Bokkoboko at about 50 people on the other youtube of policeman 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:38.260
 Take away 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:43.420
 It's here that came to me, and if it's a bad thing like this, I 'm going to be a kid at home 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.370
 I do not rubbed now tits of that Omiya's if put'll I eat and eat or Tsu change me 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.950
 I think I'm such because big caught N still burn 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:55.489
 It is said that there is no reason why people do not have drunk driving and the price has increased and so has drunk driving has dropped 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.590
 Because I become a victim I feel already 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:03.680
 I think it is now on whether humans kill the person I am there is also a difficult problem that 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.360
 I wish I could reduce even one bad crime 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.110
 So I in fact what to do for the Oh 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:15.450
 Even Oh say there is also this kind of wind of choices sure When you have something wrong our hospital 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.600
 We can not do without the death penalty as a symbol that there are severe penalties 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.990
 Hit for four seasons not a general 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.860
 It's not provisional, but I need to think here why Japan ignores 85% 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.110
 I think there is 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:33.110
 I know retribution Te it's such that I thought I take the life 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.590
 I'll do it as happiness I can do this more than a square 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:42.720
 After all, Japan's compensation for life with its own 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:48.300
 It still is because companies that idea is that it would have Nja white I guy that 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:54.360
 I think there is also the right of the child of the child I'm light I'm good I 'm playing a piece 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:57.580
 And the scene that there is no choice but to lower the tea after all by how to say 2 ar 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.139
 Will not always 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.980
 Purchases still have the dignity of human beings, and after all abolishing the death penalty 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.050
 I human dignity 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:13.200
 Resulting in absolutely no 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:16.009
 Here, the amount of anti- death penalty writer Bichiko revolts against Maruyama lawyer 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.629
 It is a mistake day to give a life 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:24.270
 The landlord must never injure or die 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:30.630
 If you get sick, fix it and then 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:37.080
 I'm making a death penalty in the form of stealing life, but a system that can not dedicate lives 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:42.420
 I have to say going on the stomach that are likely to efforts Te but Mom Japanese Shinchi KeiMasashihon Ya to you 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.289
 It's not that I'm not going to be a prisoner for death because I'm going to give it away 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:51.099
 I would like to say that one more, 85 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:52.190
 In the case but is the percentage of the key right now what I a 85% Oite to this kind of question 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:57.320
 Also 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:05.030
 If it says that the capital punishment should be abolished, it will win if it says what kind of thing is said and asked 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:10.640
 Although it will decrease , how to explain is completely different What kind of survey by the Cabinet Office in 2009? 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:12.210
 Even in cases where the death penalty should be abolished, there is an opinion that it is unavoidable in some cases 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:21.259
 Which opinion 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:21.259
 When asked if I agree with the situation, it was unavoidable that it was 85.6% 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:33.000
 On the other hand, according to a survey by the Cabinet Office in 1959, you are actually a case of a person who committed a heavy crime 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:39.450
 Do you think it would be better not to put the capital punishment 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.409
 I do not think so in response to the question I do not think so 41.7% 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:49.709
 That is, in this questionnaire 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:49.709
 Death penalty in favor and take the answer is not come to the mass production that there is only 41.7%
