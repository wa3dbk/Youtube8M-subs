00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
versions they'll remove less card but

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.330 
versions they'll remove less card but
then<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.410> can<00:03:37.560> also<00:03:37.709> do<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.069> on<00:03:38.280> your

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
then you can also do it on your

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.879 
then you can also do it on your
opponent's<00:03:39.000> turn<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.540> that's<00:03:40.139> what<00:03:40.410> may<00:03:40.590> make

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
opponent's turn so that's what may make

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.430 
opponent's turn so that's what may make
it<00:03:41.040> superior<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.450> really<00:03:42.720> just<00:03:42.840> comes<00:03:43.079> down

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
it superior so it really just comes down

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.360 
it superior so it really just comes down
to<00:03:43.859> player<00:03:44.790> preference<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.450> suppose<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.370> you

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
to player preference I suppose and you

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.090 
to player preference I suppose and you
know<00:03:47.489> all<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.700> good<00:03:48.030> stuff<00:03:48.060> but<00:03:49.100> basically

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
know all that good stuff but basically

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.009 
know all that good stuff but basically
just<00:03:50.430> getting<00:03:50.730> rid<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.030> treeborne<00:03:51.630> that's

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
just getting rid of the treeborne that's

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.009 
just getting rid of the treeborne that's
very<00:03:52.470> very<00:03:52.620> clutch<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:54.000> can<00:03:54.150> also<00:03:54.299> place<00:03:54.690> soul

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
very very clutch you can also place soul

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.289 
very very clutch you can also place soul
release<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.739> like<00:03:55.980> get<00:03:56.519> rid<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.730> their<00:03:56.940> pot<00:03:57.180> of

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
release and like get rid of their pot of

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.930 
release and like get rid of their pot of
avarice<00:03:57.450> play<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.670> so<00:03:59.670> it's<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.329> decent<00:04:00.720> card

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
avarice play and so it's a decent card

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.280 
avarice play and so it's a decent card
next<00:04:02.940> card<00:04:03.389> our<00:04:04.230> next<00:04:04.500> cards<00:04:05.130> actually<00:04:06.290> must

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
restrict and zombie world these cards

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.780

so<00:06:34.950> I<00:06:35.250> don't<00:06:35.730> know<00:06:35.820> if<00:06:35.880> you<00:06:36.090> may<00:06:36.270> want<00:06:36.480> to<00:06:36.540> look

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
so I don't know if you may want to look

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.380 
so I don't know if you may want to look
into<00:06:36.960> that<00:06:37.230> card<00:06:37.560> then<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.190> last<00:06:38.310> card<00:06:38.700> if

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
into that card then the last card if

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.930 
into that card then the last card if
your<00:06:39.540> deck<00:06:39.750> can<00:06:39.930> use<00:06:40.110> it<00:06:40.320> def<00:06:41.190> and<00:06:41.550> really<00:06:41.730> use

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
your deck can use it def and really use

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.230 
your deck can use it def and really use
this<00:06:43.040> because<00:06:44.040> if<00:06:44.370> you<00:06:44.520> think<00:06:44.550> about<00:06:44.850> it<00:06:45.030> the

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
this because if you think about it the
