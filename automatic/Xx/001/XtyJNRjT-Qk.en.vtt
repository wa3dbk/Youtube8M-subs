00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello everyone's recipe today here at 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.080
 Ranch flavor 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.700
 it will be a very easy dessert to do 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.210
 delicious and will be a hit in your 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.190
 home I'm sure it's a rocambole 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.820
 Prestige good for the mass you go 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.090
 need a can of condensed milk 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 two cups of whole milk powder and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.119
 two cups of chocolate powder 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.210
 in case here I'm using one that 50% 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.680
 cocoa but you can also use your 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.350
 home a chocolate of your choice 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.870
 and for the filling that is the coconut candy I 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 You'll use a can of milk. 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.930
 condensate and a pack of 100 grams of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.450
 shredded coconut that you will make a sweet 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.379
 will mix carry on the fire when 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.390
 start to drop from the pan you remove 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.460
 let it cool because it has to be cold 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.579
 so we can use it for this 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.140
 I already did and the point is when he is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.530
 listening to the pan 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.489
 now we're going to make the dough we're going 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.489
 put the chocolate 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:23.930
 the milk powder and we are adding to the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.670
 few a can of condensed milk 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.200
 because little by little we'll see 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 the point when I'm in heat and 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.250
 Hand dropping there for now I'm 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.229
 here waiting with the spoon but soon 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:51.179
 soon we'll have to lay our hands on the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:56.899
 same mass and which will send it to 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.899
 amount of condensed milk 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:12.670
 here we can start 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.670
 to model by hand 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.780
 it will get a bit sticky but now it's 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.640
 just on the same hand you will start to 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:32.180
 To feel the sweet spot, you do not have to 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.210
 stay soft here 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.240
 already marcinho and afternoon sticking of the hand 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.240
 We'll get the foil there. 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:51.790
 and use it on the bright side always 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.790
 huh 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.530
 and here it is 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.530
 We are going to open this mass 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.849
 so it was fine to finely notice 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.940
 Oh and the dough is pretty mallya. 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.780
 now that we're going to put that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.910
 Sweet you made it already cooled. 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.910
 So we'll put him here. 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.870
 Good, we're going to start doing the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.769
 roulade 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:40.370
 There's no secret, you're rolling. 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:44.510
 squeezing take out on paper and glue again 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.569
 always squeezing it from the center to the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.519
 By carefully ends foil 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:59.599
 not in the dossier is releasing and 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:04:02.930
 here again at the very end 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.569
 we do found 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.989
 I think it gets easier a lot more 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.989
 easy 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.060
 the jj a 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.870
 and then I do I put together both the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.010
 half tone right because it is still 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.419
 soft né 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:39.490
 so we can take a shower 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:41.680
 especially here O Amácio good yet 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.070
 more certain possible 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:52.360
 then we will simply or perhaps 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.490
 do not remember to refrigerate for 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.960
 two hours or so until 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:02.680
 Be more consistent and cool, my love. 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.960
 After two hours it's already freezing. 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.080
 harder but worked that is the point 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:12.190
 Right for us to serve. 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:16.780
 Just look at the aluminum foil. 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:20.039
 It's already very cold and here we are. 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.039
 puts on a platter 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:32.169
 now and here now people are just an issue 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.979
 Can you hit the right people? 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.720
 on here 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:42.099
 the first slice that is always more 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.720
 difficult to put her in the season 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.620
 more beautiful to serve with 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:54.729
 sure the first part and then you 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:06:00.099
 slice of size where you think 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:03.069
 I owe one a cool tip is to use coconut 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.560
 burned also that already sells right 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.849
 pack of 100 grams I do not know there in the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.680
 your region 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:14.169
 but it is already very common in markets to have the 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.050
 shredded coconut that I indicate burned 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:23.620
 And then you will slice years and here we will 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:26.710
 You can put it on the plate. 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.389
 get a beautiful dish a little 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:34.570
 coconut grated when serving 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:37.300
 Good, I hope you liked it. 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.130

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.190

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.530
