00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:12.516
 Chapter 2 explains the role of arithmetic and control units 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:19.598
 CPU plays a role in processing of operation and control 

00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:23.290
 CPU determines the performance of the computer 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.704
 It is said to be the most important device 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.695
 Let's take a closer look at the role of CPU 

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:36.432
 First of all, please see here 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.844
 The screen you see is a desktop type personal computer 

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:42.841
 The main body is open 

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:47.763
 If you try to remove the device attached here 

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:54.172
 You can see that the hardware you have installed is installed 

00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:57.121
 This is CPU 

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:03.298
 In addition, what was attached on this CPU is 

00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:05.480
 Say "CPU cooler" 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.288
 It is a device that cools so that the CPU does not have heat 

00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:14.768
 So, how does this CPU work? 

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:16.115
 Let's think about it 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.245
 CPU is the "Central Process Unit" 

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.962
 In abbreviation that connected the first letter of each 

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:28.956
 In Japanese, it is called "central processing unit" 

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:34.854
 It plays a central role in computers, literally 

00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:38.151
 It is something that performs processing such as calculation 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.770
 When "System" is opened in "Control Panel" 

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.370
 A screen like this will open 

00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:51.150
 Let's take a look at the processor column 

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.150
 It is written as you see 

00:01:55.217 --> 00:01:59.210
 Basic CPU performance can be seen by looking at such a description 

00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:00.740
 Can judge 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.550
 First, the manufacturer name is written on the CPU at the top 

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.290
 As a manufacturer of CPUs in general circulation 

00:02:11.286 --> 00:02:15.540
 There are "Intel" and "Advanced Micro Devices" 

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:20.740
 Both companies, depending on the use of the computer 

00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:24.680
 High-performance and cost-effective 

00:02:24.684 --> 00:02:26.170
 I have a product line 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.210
 For example, Intel has a line of products with superior processing performance. 

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:33.160
 "Core processor family" or 

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:35.500
 Best-selling Pentium family 

00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:39.570
 Cost-effective "Celeron Processor Family" 

00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:40.500
 There are etc 

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:44.790
 Graphics processing and 

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:48.740
 If you think that the use of a computer with a high additional load 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.800
 CPU of "Core Processor family" is installed 

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:54.960
 Business applications and 

00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:58.210
 For low-use home users' computers 

00:02:58.213 --> 00:03:00.330
 In the "Celeron Processor Family" 

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:02.560
 CPU tends to be installed 

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:07.220
 So it's listed next to the manufacturer's name 

00:03:07.222 --> 00:03:09.480
 By looking at the name of the product line 

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.700
 You can judge the approximate performance 

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:17.090
 In the case of Apple's MAC series 

00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:20.620
 Formerly called IBM's "Power PC" 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.290
 Mac's own CPU was used 

00:03:25.148 --> 00:03:26.560
 But then Mac 

00:03:26.565 --> 00:03:29.680
 Now using Intel CPU 

00:03:30.884 --> 00:03:33.950
 "Xeon" used by Intel server etc. 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.940
 CPU such as Core series is used 

00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:42.190
 Thus, you can run Windows on MAC, etc. 

00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:44.000
 It became available 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.880
 Install an OS such as Windows XP on MAC 

00:03:48.884 --> 00:03:52.000
 Do you use MacOS 10 at startup? 

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:53.690
 Do you use Windows? 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.870
 It can be selected 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.860
 Well, as an index to judge CPU 

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:04.740
 There is another basic specification 

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:06.650
 Is the clock frequency 

00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:15.080
 For example, on the screen you see, it says "2.66 GHz" 

00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:19.320
 In this case, read "Niten Lok Krugha Hertz" 

00:04:20.254 --> 00:04:25.850
 This CPU operates at a clock frequency of 2.66 GHz 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.310
 I will express something like 

00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:33.790
 So what exactly is the clock frequency 

00:04:34.534 --> 00:04:37.780
 So, please see this slide 

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.200
 A simplified illustration of the clock frequency concept 

00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:45.590
 For example, there are tracks on land 

00:04:45.587 --> 00:04:48.050
 The runner runs on the track 

00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:51.670
 And regularly, the whistle 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.990
 Runners start at once 

00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:58.920
 If, for example, the whistle rang twice a minute 

00:04:58.915 --> 00:05:01.720
 Only 2 people per minute per lane 

00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:03.860
 I can send the runner out 

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:07.250
 There are 4 lanes 

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:10.780
 You can send out 8 runners in total 

00:05:11.523 --> 00:05:17.380
 So what if the whistle rang four times a minute? 

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:26.200
 4 runners per minute per lane 

00:05:26.198 --> 00:05:27.640
 Can be sent out 

00:05:28.404 --> 00:05:30.940
 Because the number of lanes is four 

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:35.320
 It is a calculation that can send out 16 runners in total 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.430
 Clock frequency is like this 

00:05:39.434 --> 00:05:42.600
 Please think that it is the cycle that the whistle rings 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.720
 Computers are timed by various devices 

00:05:48.722 --> 00:05:50.900
 We do various processing 

00:05:51.973 --> 00:05:55.920
 And send signals to them to operate 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.240
 Control device to control 

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:00.800
 In other words, it is CPU 

00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:05.120
 And as the interval of the signal is shorter 

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.830
 More information can be processed in a fixed time 

00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:12.170
 With clock frequency 

00:06:12.174 --> 00:06:17.300
 "The interval at which the CPU generates a signal to promote synchronization in one second" 

00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:18.560
 Refers to 

00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:22.510
 And the bigger this value is 

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.500
 Sync interval gets faster 

00:06:24.504 --> 00:06:28.310
 In other words, processing is faster. 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:31.370
 Therefore, the CPU 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:34.760
 By checking the product name and clock frequency 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.680
 You can judge the basic performance 

00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:45.120
 Thus, the CPU is called "central processing unit". 

00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:48.620
 Play a central role in computers 

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:52.820
 If it compares to human being, it is said that it is both brain and heart 

00:06:52.823 --> 00:06:55.010
 It is a device that plays an important role
