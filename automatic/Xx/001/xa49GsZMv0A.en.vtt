 also ramírez Spaniards since then dean 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.169
 efe 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.640
 I boné everything and we have 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 about 50 years old 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.039
 where I started then 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.480
 this one is entertaining 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.679
 from paolis entertaining 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.789
 menezes hand 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:32.990
 after my dad 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.409
 Kenny as he has always been 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:38.320
 as always there are April 30 with google 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.490
 ibope growing that eats its surroundings 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.560
 they have the emotion and inem I liked the idea is to start 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.300
 the prologue of it 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.300
 it's like a 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.330
 Ingrained feeling of the fanzine 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.810
 I grew up in a house in baden-baden 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.180
 both 100 meters past 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.200
 the line that passed or line that connects to Santiago lane 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.710
 all of the Atlantic like the railroad to the Pacific and that could happen in 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 the morning 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.850
 electric locomotives of the pacific load all six wagons that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.570
 they came from lemon with conventional gasoline 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.180
 well to the top date of the psoe 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.270
 this one gave him 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 at that time the campus has 200 meters east of the national gymnasium 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.980
 Where today the world fails 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.210
 and in the afternoon 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.520
 return your payment on it or acids towards asia 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.009
 towards the Atlantic and he looked again at a locomotive and so we see a lot happening 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.500
 many times the train out there 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.450
 and I think that was what made the most sense to me 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 then maybe he 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.870
 the good sense of 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.870
 you must go to the cinema 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.510
 diaz thresh my dad to my mom 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.720
 all this war is going to contribute with the pandering of the train 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.830
 idea what we have now 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.840
 it complicated us this is no longer God's only one 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.820
 an ingrained feeling but a fever 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.119
 but basically 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.570
 the feeling 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.679
 Jaime of attraction towards the rebel groups 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:14.489
 I do not search 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.109
 all the creeds 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:18.249
 railroad there are some products 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.919
 they like more than others but 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.849
 basically 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.899
 all this with pleasure since my childhood 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.899
 in is in the same area as eta 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:30.750
 sweeting 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.059
 entrance 15 years of being built 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:35.900
 we are already doing and we will do everything we can 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.439
 the weather 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.679
 Anything that is new to make 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:43.029
 only one use of any caprice that has urgency is added 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:46.889
 all right 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.899
 likewise they a year 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:54.909
 a completely digitized mockup continuing with this emerging hand he 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.499
 from the central expression 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.659
 They are not grind or more than everything 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.999
 model of the 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.289
 the period 4 5 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.289
 which are three years before 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:11.859
 the 100 meters that will be opened more respect 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.349
 represents a 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.829
 a pastime a bonetto pastime 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.769
 Montes highlighted 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.079
 before 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.649
 to nozar got into the fourth set of or wasting time 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.739
 you can not scratch 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.359
 entertaining itself because it's good entertainment 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.409
 they drive was dad my brother and I 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.449
 but we were the bankers right now years 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.459
 Closely minutes of euros 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.639
 the boys the minors 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.319
 the 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.429
 but also my younger brother is very involved with 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.469
 the federals liked 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.469
 and besides that 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:57.769
 the voice of a marked knowledge of the containers of the debut all the 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.649
 hobby of the campus of the content of the law percent and not so much collected 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.349
 railway wagons but 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.349
 that this kind of 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.269
 and let's say it like that 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.199
 of models 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.419
 the two containers that actually 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.999
 many mark studies of this type of training or crimes that come to scale 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.449
 p with the marks of the 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.099
 of those of the shipping companies and on top of that 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.849
 for that reason they can be 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.809
 the parades I walk alone use age 2 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:31.270
 louis 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.610
 losada happens without hesitation uu 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.610
 just as he calls himself 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.590
 to your liking and 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.069
 out there the thing goes 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.719
 in the case of my brother 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.479
 nor my dream 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.300
 of the truth of smer let's say 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.449
 think that in a future in costa rica you can have something 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.499
 come in and look very nice 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:55.199
 more civilized let's say 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.749
 with more mime a little more and more advanced advanced 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.490
 you can see also what we have now that they are 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.059
 so depressing 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:09.330
 the most difficult has been good 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.439
 the connection of the virus efe when in 2000 the connection of blocks to cross 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.610
 traffic lights and 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.319
 but the most difficult from the alhambra the mbe alhambra while 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.129
 everything we have done is the most roma makes it more complicated that we show 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:31.129
 but also other factors typical of the efe fun catenary is a pity that 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.089
 the photon models that 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.520
 that go with her 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.879
 these are some days showed up 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.330
 German 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.349
 per hundred mandelson are locomotives used driver two years ago 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.169
 for him 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.099
 farrar for commuter trains for commutes the best for him three years 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.430
 after 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.460
 the new commander 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.699
 they are good at cancer 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.199
 glazer 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.199
 20 30 years give like the most ordinary machine fall German 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.909
 how many have been replaced by one or another it is seen that they are 185 days 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.839
 the 146 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.039
 ferocious are virtually birth what the mansion creates as the most 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.289
 emblematic area 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.289
 and machines that I exercised 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.629
 the high on Tuesday one of 44 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.770
 in that area the necessary 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.300
 they are more a locomotive 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.949
 born in March doens 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:35.300
 this agency 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.749
 in chile this insurance 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:40.599
 good are machines from the thirties 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.569
 i 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.569
 - experience is disunited 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:50.849
 if not for him 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.509
 and just my favorite I do not know why the one I like most about him the 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.509
 design that has 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.809
 locomotive loaded 

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:03.080
 there are some 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.289
 options for the start 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.150
 the best thing is to have say the option of buying a being from it 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.629
 in any of the brands there 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:15.520
 both in 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.710
 in the country as 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.969
 outside the 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:21.389
 the green in sussex that comes are made up of locomotive wagons 

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:23.610
 transformer videos 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.410
 and there 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.569
 it starts 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:28.839
 but then the main thing is that they have 

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.559
 a space and well defined 

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:34.199
 and a very clear idea of ​​where they are going from where 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:34.899
 and where is it going
