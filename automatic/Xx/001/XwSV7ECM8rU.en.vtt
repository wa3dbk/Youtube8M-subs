00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that aside for a second like we know the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.069 
that aside for a second like we know the
unit's<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:00.840> protected<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.009> cloth<00:02:02.369> and

unit's here protected in this cloth and
I've<00:02:04.229> got<00:02:04.469> another<00:02:04.740> unit<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.399> projected<00:02:06.119> in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
I've got another unit here projected in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.509 
I've got another unit here projected in
the<00:02:06.359> clump<00:02:06.659> we'll<00:02:06.899> set<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.200> right<00:02:07.859> there<00:02:07.920> for

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
the clump we'll set that right there for

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.460 
the clump we'll set that right there for
the<00:02:09.390> time<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:10.289> we<00:02:10.530> find<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.610> what's

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
the time is we find out what's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
the time is we find out what's
underneath<00:02:13.470> these<00:02:13.739> babies<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.970> an<00:02:15.060> idea

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
underneath these babies and get an idea

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.890 
underneath these babies and get an idea
as<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.599> what<00:02:16.069> we<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.489> before<00:02:17.760> us<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.540> let's<00:02:18.780> go

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
as to what we have before us so let's go

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.869 
as to what we have before us so let's go
ahead<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.050> unwrap<00:02:19.950> these<00:02:20.489> looks<00:02:20.730> like

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
ahead and unwrap these looks like

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.070 
ahead and unwrap these looks like
they're<00:02:21.030> nicely<00:02:21.209> taped<00:02:21.690> up<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:24.080> everything

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
they're nicely taped up and everything

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.289 
they're nicely taped up and everything
so<00:02:26.599> but<00:02:27.599> they<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:27.930> did<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.140> good<00:02:28.290> job<00:02:29.299> making

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
so but they really did a good job making

so but they really did a good job making
sure<00:02:30.720> these<00:02:30.900> things<00:02:30.959> survived<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.220> shipping

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
sure these things survived the shipping

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.990 
sure these things survived the shipping
processes<00:02:33.450> around<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.870> world<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:34.980> here<00:02:35.790> is

there for a second will unwrap the other

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.710 
there for a second will unwrap the other
one<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:10.940> there<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.120> are<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.540> got<00:03:12.690> a

grommet eyes bottom to them so it's

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.160 
grommet eyes bottom to them so it's
going<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.440> sit<00:03:16.709> really<00:03:17.579> really<00:03:17.850> nicely<00:03:18.170> just

to go in the other end of the power

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.420 
to go in the other end of the power
supply<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.829> going<00:03:52.919> to<00:03:53.010> be<00:03:53.099> an<00:03:53.160> audio

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
supply and this is going to be an audio

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.670 
supply and this is going to be an audio
cable<00:03:53.669> now<00:03:54.060> what<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:54.930> probably<00:03:55.260> going<00:03:55.590> to

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
cable now what this is probably going to

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.780 
cable now what this is probably going to
be<00:03:55.919> is<00:03:57.769> this<00:03:58.769> is<00:03:58.950> going<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.190> connect<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.579> left

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
be is this is going to connect the left

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.270 
be is this is going to connect the left
and<00:03:59.970> right<00:04:00.090> speaker<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.680> cord<00:04:01.950> here<00:04:02.160> that

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
and right speaker so this cord here that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.339 
and right speaker so this cord here that
I<00:04:02.340> mentioned<00:04:02.700> earlier<00:04:02.940> that's<00:04:03.419> might<00:04:04.200> be<00:04:04.319> a

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
I mentioned earlier that's might be a

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.800 
I mentioned earlier that's might be a
power<00:04:04.590> cord<00:04:04.980> won't<00:04:05.519> be<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> power<00:04:06.030> cord<00:04:06.480> this

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
power cord won't be a power cord this

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.020 
power cord won't be a power cord this
will<00:04:07.049> be<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:08.099> connector<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.669> goes<00:04:08.730> between

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
will be the connector that goes between

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.270 
will be the connector that goes between
the<00:04:09.540> left<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.930> right<00:04:10.019> speakers<00:04:10.440> sending<00:04:11.190> the

sound<00:04:11.519> back<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.150> forth<00:04:12.359> so<00:04:12.780> we're<00:04:13.380> gonna<00:04:13.560> do

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
sound back and forth so we're gonna do

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.530 
sound back and forth so we're gonna do
is<00:04:13.829> take<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.400> play<00:04:14.579> with<00:04:14.729> it<00:04:14.850> come<00:04:15.209> back<00:04:15.359> and

the<00:04:30.540> only<00:04:30.750> issue<00:04:31.350> we<00:04:31.590> have<00:04:31.770> with<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.070> was

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
the only issue we have with it was

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.550 
the only issue we have with it was
trying<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.580> just<00:04:32.760> learn<00:04:33.210> how<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.810> control<00:04:34.500> it

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
trying to just learn how to control it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.890 
trying to just learn how to control it
and<00:04:34.950> operate<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.370> it's<00:04:35.670> got<00:04:35.850> kind<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.330> really

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
and operate it it's got kind of a really

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.110 
and operate it it's got kind of a really
kind<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.290> futuristic<00:04:37.650> touch<00:04:38.280> sensor<00:04:38.820> design

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
kind of futuristic touch sensor design

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.360 
kind of futuristic touch sensor design
to<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.690> it's<00:04:40.200> really<00:04:40.380> cool<00:04:40.650> once<00:04:40.950> you<00:04:41.040> get<00:04:41.250> it

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
to it it's really cool once you get it

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.830 
to it it's really cool once you get it
down<00:04:41.520> but<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:41.850> takes<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.150> little<00:04:42.210> while<00:04:42.480> in<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
down but it takes a little while in the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.020 
down but it takes a little while in the
instruction<00:04:43.620> manual<00:04:43.650> isn't<00:04:44.130> very<00:04:44.310> clear<00:04:44.640> so

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
instruction manual isn't very clear so

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.030 
instruction manual isn't very clear so
we<00:04:45.210> had<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.720> do<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.870> lot<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.080> experimentation<00:04:46.830> to

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
we had to do a lot of experimentation to

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.910 
we had to do a lot of experimentation to
find<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.940> out<00:04:48.030> was<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> very<00:04:48.600> intuitive<00:04:48.960> so

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
find it out was a very intuitive so

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.490 
find it out was a very intuitive so
you've<00:04:50.430> got<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.870> volume<00:04:51.870> control<00:04:51.960> right<00:04:52.440> here

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
you've got a volume control right here

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.370 
you've got a volume control right here
and<00:04:53.040> you<00:04:53.130> slide<00:04:53.460> your<00:04:54.150> finger<00:04:54.630> across<00:04:54.660> there's

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
and you slide your finger across there's

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.880 
and you slide your finger across there's
five<00:04:55.800> different<00:04:56.870> lights<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:58.290> light<00:04:58.500> up<00:04:58.560> as

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
five different lights that light up as

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.120 
five different lights that light up as
you<00:04:59.190> go<00:04:59.370> across<00:04:59.490> and<00:05:00.120> in<00:05:00.600> essence<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.770> can<00:05:01.800> you

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
you go across and in essence you can you

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.920 
you go across and in essence you can you
know<00:05:02.250> adjust<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.700> volume<00:05:03.060> based<00:05:03.480> upon<00:05:03.780> this

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
know adjust the volume based upon this

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.630 
know adjust the volume based upon this
and<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.200> course<00:05:04.230> if<00:05:04.500> you're<00:05:04.620> using<00:05:04.800> an<00:05:05.130> outside

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
and of course if you're using an outside

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.180 
and of course if you're using an outside
module<00:05:06.390> uh<00:05:06.660> whether<00:05:07.260> it's<00:05:07.380> your<00:05:07.710> mobile<00:05:07.980> phone

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
module uh whether it's your mobile phone

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.770 
module uh whether it's your mobile phone
or<00:05:08.370> another<00:05:08.520> devices<00:05:09.150> plugged<00:05:09.360> directly<00:05:09.510> into

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
or another devices plugged directly into

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.920 
or another devices plugged directly into
it<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.620> can<00:05:10.770> also<00:05:10.890> control<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.730> volume<00:05:12.390> that

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
it you can also control the volume that

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.350 
it you can also control the volume that
way<00:05:13.350> but<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.190> pretty<00:05:14.430> much<00:05:14.520> just<00:05:14.580> roll<00:05:15.270> your

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
way but you pretty much just roll your

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.930 
way but you pretty much just roll your
finger<00:05:15.660> back<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.080> forth<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.760> that<00:05:17.760> will

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
finger back and forth and that will

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.180 
finger back and forth and that will
control<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.420> volume<00:05:18.600> along<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.560> side<00:05:19.830> it's

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
control the volume along the side it's

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.860 
control the volume along the side it's
kind<00:05:20.400> of<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.520> same<00:05:20.730> thing<00:05:21.030> where<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.450> have<00:05:21.480> a

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
kind of the same thing where you have a

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.570 
kind of the same thing where you have a
power<00:05:22.440> button<00:05:22.530> we<00:05:22.800> do<00:05:22.950> this<00:05:23.130> a<00:05:23.280> while<00:05:23.430> to

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
power button we do this a while to

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.340 
power button we do this a while to
figure<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:23.970> out<00:05:24.060> we<00:05:24.270> kept<00:05:24.450> sliding<00:05:24.720> our<00:05:24.990> finger

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
figure it out we kept sliding our finger

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.350 
figure it out we kept sliding our finger
around<00:05:25.640> but<00:05:26.640> you<00:05:26.730> just<00:05:26.880> hold<00:05:27.030> your<00:05:27.120> finger

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
around but you just hold your finger

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.710 
around but you just hold your finger
over<00:05:27.630> each<00:05:28.050> of<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.320> buttons<00:05:28.500> there's<00:05:28.920> a<00:05:28.980> bass

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
over each of the buttons there's a bass

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.780 
over each of the buttons there's a bass
thing<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.900> adds<00:05:31.080> an<00:05:31.920> element<00:05:32.280> of<00:05:32.310> bass<00:05:32.550> to

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
thing that adds an element of bass to

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.750 
thing that adds an element of bass to
this<00:05:32.930> feels<00:05:33.930> like<00:05:34.140> we<00:05:34.260> need<00:05:34.980> have<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.340> on<00:05:35.460> there

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
this feels like we need have it on there

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.080 
this feels like we need have it on there
first<00:05:36.470> see<00:05:37.470> I<00:05:37.500> think<00:05:37.800> we're<00:05:37.950> in<00:05:38.040> a<00:05:38.340> mode<00:05:38.820> there

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
first see I think we're in a mode there

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.470 
first see I think we're in a mode there
