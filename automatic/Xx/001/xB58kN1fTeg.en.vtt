out<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.719> obviously<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.289> beginning<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
out there obviously it's beginning of

getting<00:00:48.360> inserts<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.770> don't<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.309> can

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
getting inserts but I don't think we can

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.650 
getting inserts but I don't think we can
ignore<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.850> fact<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> world<00:00:51.480> cup

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
ignore the fact that it's a world cup

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.630 
ignore the fact that it's a world cup
here<00:00:51.899> ok<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> look<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> results

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
here ok and if you look at the results

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
here ok and if you look at the results
you<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:53.969> were<00:00:54.030> six<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> seven<00:00:54.510> away

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you are there were six out of seven away

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
you are there were six out of seven away
wins<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.980> also<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> look<00:00:56.520> at<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.640> teams

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
wins but also if you look at the teams

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
wins but also if you look at the teams
that<00:00:56.910> lost<00:00:57.090> Waratahs<00:00:57.780> Crusaders<00:00:58.440> bulls<00:00:58.800> those

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that lost Waratahs Crusaders bulls those

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.630 
that lost Waratahs Crusaders bulls those
are<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> teams<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> most

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
are the teams with the most

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.760 
are the teams with the most
international<00:01:00.329> players<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.469> might<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
international players so it might be a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.139 
international players so it might be a
case<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.010> books<00:01:02.370> holding<00:01:02.579> themselves<00:01:02.789> back<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
case of books holding themselves back a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.250 
case of books holding themselves back a
bit<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.420> beginning<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> season<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
bit at the beginning of the season to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.630 
bit at the beginning of the season to
make<00:01:04.409> sure<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.739> make<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.189> no<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
make sure that they make it there no I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.830 
make sure that they make it there no I
mean<00:01:05.850> definitely<00:01:06.000> there's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> regular

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
mean definitely there's a lot of regular

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.080 
mean definitely there's a lot of regular
we<00:01:06.990> saw<00:01:07.140> injuries<00:01:07.530> beast<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.130> art<00:01:08.340> given<00:01:08.970> was

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
we saw injuries beast as art given was

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
we saw injuries beast as art given was
out<00:01:09.270> already<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> preseason<00:01:10.260> lurt<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.580> art

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
out already in a preseason lurt is art

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
out already in a preseason lurt is art
so<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.780> he<00:01:13.380> adds<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.770> concerning<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
so I think he adds a bit concerning and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.670 
so I think he adds a bit concerning and
I<00:01:14.490> mean<00:01:14.640> obviously<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.030> world<00:01:15.180> cup<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
I mean obviously the world cup is the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
I mean obviously the world cup is the
you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.580> looking<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:17.939> for

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you know that what we're looking at for

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
you know that what we're looking at for
this<00:01:18.299> year<00:01:18.479> coming<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> problem<00:01:19.500> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
this year coming up but the problem is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
this year coming up but the problem is
it's<00:01:19.890> only<00:01:20.159> getting<00:01:20.369> worse<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.090> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it's only getting worse because this is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.109 
it's only getting worse because this is
very<00:01:21.390> sad<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.439> death<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.950> super<00:01:23.369> 15<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:23.939> we

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
divided into two more it's so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
divided into two more it's so
complicated<00:01:49.530> no<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.399> knows<00:01:50.520> what's<00:01:50.759> actually

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
complicated no one knows what's actually

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
complicated no one knows what's actually
going<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.630> sounds<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.170> need<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> be

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
going on it sounds like you need to be

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.139 
going on it sounds like you need to be
the<00:01:52.920> guard<00:01:53.130> from<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.369> beautiful<00:01:53.490> mind<00:01:53.850> or

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the guard from a beautiful mind or

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
the guard from a beautiful mind or
something<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.479> understand<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.320> my

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
something to understand it and my

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.959 
something to understand it and my
concern<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.340> we're<00:01:56.520> gonna<00:01:56.610> get<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.850> sort

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
concern is that we're gonna get to sort

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.719 
concern is that we're gonna get to sort
of<00:01:57.060> IPL<00:01:57.570> levels<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.500> variety<00:01:59.040> way<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.430> could

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

of IPL levels of a variety way you could
just<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> bit<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.780> yeah<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.619> why

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
