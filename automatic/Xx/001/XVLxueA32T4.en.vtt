a<00:01:42.960> jumper<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:44.210> dunker<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.350> he<00:01:46.590> scores

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
a jumper a dunker you know and he scores

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.760 
a jumper a dunker you know and he scores
because<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.790> somebody<00:01:48.590> facilitating<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
because of somebody facilitating and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.370 
because of somebody facilitating and
passing<00:01:50.159> him<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> ball<00:01:50.610> he<00:01:51.299> manages<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.140> game

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
passing him the ball he manages the game

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.490 
passing him the ball he manages the game
probably<00:01:52.950> better<00:01:53.520> than<00:01:54.270> anybody<00:01:54.840> else<00:01:55.140> with

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
probably better than anybody else with

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
probably better than anybody else with
less<00:01:55.820> okay<00:01:56.820> no<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.509> those<00:01:57.689> guys<00:01:57.930> are

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
less okay no I think those guys are

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.620 
less okay no I think those guys are
playing<00:01:58.469> harder<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.250> him<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.360> take

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
playing harder for him and if you take

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
playing harder for him and if you take
him<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.590> equation<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.189> don't<00:02:02.340> believe

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
him out of that equation I don't believe

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
him out of that equation I don't believe
they<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.700> win<00:02:03.000> people<00:02:03.570> always<00:02:03.899> talk<00:02:04.140> about

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
they can win people always talk about

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.080 
they can win people always talk about
quarterbacking<00:02:05.130> well<00:02:05.700> there's<00:02:05.880> some

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
quarterbacking well there's some

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.999 
quarterbacking well there's some
quarterbacks<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.899> throw<00:02:07.200> there's<00:02:07.799> some

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
quarterbacks that can throw there's some

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.249 
quarterbacks that can throw there's some
quarterbacks<00:02:08.459> second<00:02:08.910> run<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.989> he<00:02:10.140> can

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
quarterbacks second run I think he can

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.619 
quarterbacks second run I think he can
he<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.099> combination<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.390> just

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
he can do a combination of not just

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.610 
he can do a combination of not just
throwing<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.230> running

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
throwing and running

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.449 
throwing and running

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.490 
ballplayer generally walks out onto the
basketball<00:03:32.910> game<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.450> gets<00:03:33.629> 15<00:03:33.989> assists<00:03:34.319> per

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
basketball game and gets 15 assists per

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.199 
basketball game and gets 15 assists per
night<00:03:34.739> what<00:03:35.190> makes<00:03:35.400> him<00:03:35.549> very<00:03:35.730> effective<00:03:36.150> I

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
night what makes him very effective I

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.360 
night what makes him very effective I
think<00:03:36.629> that<00:03:37.109> when<00:03:37.319> he<00:03:37.470> first<00:03:37.709> came<00:03:38.010> with<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
think that when he first came with the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.539 
think that when he first came with the
Celtics<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.480> had<00:03:39.720> stars<00:03:40.109> there<00:03:40.650> already<00:03:41.099> and

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
Celtics you had stars there already and

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.030 
Celtics you had stars there already and
I<00:03:41.849> think<00:03:42.150> they<00:03:42.329> deferred<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.169> him<00:03:43.500> because<00:03:43.799> not

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
I think they deferred to him because not

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.890 
I think they deferred to him because not
that<00:03:44.220> they<00:03:44.370> got<00:03:44.549> old<00:03:44.879> but<00:03:45.359> they<00:03:45.480> felt<00:03:45.810> that

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
that they got old but they felt that

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.409 
that they got old but they felt that
they<00:03:46.230> wanted<00:03:46.590> somebody<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.489> lead<00:03:47.879> their<00:03:48.150> team

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
they wanted somebody to lead their team

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.670 
they wanted somebody to lead their team
and<00:03:48.919> he's<00:03:49.919> in<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.699> same<00:03:51.079> components<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.290> me<00:03:52.470> as

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
and he's in the same components to me as

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.490 
and he's in the same components to me as
a<00:03:52.739> Western<00:03:53.250> respite<00:03:53.639> he<00:03:54.180> defends<00:03:54.690> well<00:03:54.840> he

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
a Western respite he defends well he

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.979 
a Western respite he defends well he
gets<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.889> passing<00:03:56.340> lane<00:03:56.549> he<00:03:57.000> finishes<00:03:57.510> and

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
gets in the passing lane he finishes and

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.500 
gets in the passing lane he finishes and
people<00:03:58.560> always<00:03:58.739> talk<00:03:59.069> about<00:03:59.099> well<00:03:59.699> he's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
people always talk about well he's

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.479 
people always talk about well he's
really<00:04:00.720> not<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.079> good<00:04:01.349> shooter<00:04:01.709> he's<00:04:01.949> he<00:04:02.280> gets

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
really not a good shooter he's he gets

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.309 
really not a good shooter he's he gets
triple<00:04:02.879> doubles<00:04:03.180> almost<00:04:03.449> every<00:04:03.720> game<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.230> I

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
triple doubles almost every game and I

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.280 
triple doubles almost every game and I
think<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.519> way<00:04:06.329> he<00:04:06.629> manages<00:04:07.230> his

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
think that the the way he manages his

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.939 
think that the the way he manages his
team<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:08.190> think<00:04:08.459> those<00:04:08.910> guys<00:04:09.239> just<00:04:09.680> defer<00:04:10.680> to

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
team I think those guys just defer to

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.189 
team I think those guys just defer to
him<00:04:11.160> like<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.699> ball<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.120> yours<00:04:12.359> we'll<00:04:12.989> get

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
down with run our stuff and we can rely

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.210 
down with run our stuff and we can rely
on<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.840> get<00:04:16.049> us<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.620> know<00:04:16.739> get<00:04:16.919> us<00:04:17.070> that

what<00:04:35.740> makes<00:04:36.070> him<00:04:36.310> very<00:04:36.490> good<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:37.000> think<00:04:37.450> his

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
what makes him very good I think his

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.720 
what makes him very good I think his
ball<00:04:37.840> handling<00:04:38.110> skills<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:39.100> people<00:04:39.520> always

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
ball handling skills and people always

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.840 
ball handling skills and people always
go<00:04:40.510> back<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:41.020> dribbling<00:04:41.620> his<00:04:42.010> ball<00:04:42.340> handling

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
go back to dribbling his ball handling

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.350 
go back to dribbling his ball handling
skills<00:04:43.080> he's<00:04:44.080> another<00:04:44.500> guy<00:04:44.730> okay<00:04:45.730> if<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.090> look

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
skills he's another guy okay if you look

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.100 
skills he's another guy okay if you look
at<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:47.560> team<00:04:48.180> composition<00:04:49.180> totally

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
at the team composition totally

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.260 
at the team composition totally
different<00:04:50.560> okay<00:04:51.160> cuz<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.520> remember<00:04:52.000> there

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
different okay cuz you remember there

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.720 
different okay cuz you remember there
was<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.420> guy<00:04:52.660> there<00:04:52.690> before<00:04:53.440> him<00:04:53.680> he's<00:04:54.100> in<00:04:54.340> Miami

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
was a guy there before him he's in Miami

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.420 
was a guy there before him he's in Miami
don't<00:04:55.450> have<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.630> lot<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.990> work<00:04:56.170> with<00:04:56.200> okay<00:04:56.830> but

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
don't have a lot to work with okay but

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.850 
don't have a lot to work with okay but
he<00:04:57.610> can<00:04:57.820> facilitate<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.870> get<00:04:59.110> those<00:04:59.290> guys<00:04:59.590> the

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
he can facilitate and get those guys the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.190 
he can facilitate and get those guys the
ball<00:05:00.070> but<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.580> think<00:05:00.940> another<00:05:01.630> part<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:02.050> his

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
ball but I think another part of his

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.530 
ball but I think another part of his
game<00:05:02.470> is<00:05:02.800> gonna<00:05:03.100> shine<00:05:03.430> hopefully<00:05:04.330> later

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
game is gonna shine hopefully later

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.050 
game is gonna shine hopefully later
because<00:05:05.380> he's<00:05:05.650> worked<00:05:05.950> on<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:06.400> when<00:05:06.730> he<00:05:06.760> was<00:05:06.940> in

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
because he's worked on it when he was in

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.420 
because he's worked on it when he was in
high<00:05:07.240> school<00:05:07.300> he<00:05:08.170> did<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.440> little<00:05:08.650> bit<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:09.100> it<00:05:09.250> at

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
high school he did a little bit of it at

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.940 
high school he did a little bit of it at
Duke<00:05:09.730> but<00:05:10.300> I<00:05:10.330> think<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:11.170> part<00:05:11.650> of<00:05:11.740> his<00:05:11.920> game

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
Duke but I think that part of his game

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.940 
Duke but I think that part of his game
is<00:05:12.490> going<00:05:12.850> to<00:05:12.970> shine<00:05:13.240> because<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:14.680> don't<00:05:14.830> have

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
is going to shine because you don't have

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.620 
is going to shine because you don't have
a<00:05:15.010> whole<00:05:15.190> lot<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.400> work<00:05:15.700> with<00:05:15.730> and<00:05:16.150> you're

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
a whole lot to work with and you're

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.440 
a whole lot to work with and you're
showing<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:17.140> you<00:05:17.440> can<00:05:17.620> lead<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:18.250> team<00:05:18.880> that's

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
showing that you can lead a team that's
