00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 hello friends welcome received / 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.200
 rainy I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.350
 calculator on the iphone is a 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.810
 very simple basic calculator but what 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 that I wanted to talk to you in this way so 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.950
 can be used for any calculator 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.070
 simple is about about the buttons 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.350
 that are here over mcm more or less 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.870
 gamer maybe some of you not the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.520
 have used for any other reason and 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.520
 is that I think it 's interesting to talk about 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.890
 them good if you need to save 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.490
 a number in memory to do some 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.070
 complex calculation can use the function 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.070
 m or memory for example if I have the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.430
 number 5 and I want to remind you that number 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.680
 to prieto m more and that number will be 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.170
 now in the memory of the iphone and is 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.920
 over marked the vr button indicating 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.200
 that there is something in memory m &amp; r means in 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.360
 English memory and rich 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.659
 so for example if I'm doing a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.469
 calculation and I need that number I tighten 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.140
 dmr and appears on the screen now well if 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:22.030
 I want to erase what is in memory all 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.750
 what I have to press is mc 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.970
 what memory means and erase memory 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.490
 now I am doing some calculation of 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.490
 pietra of m &amp; r nothing comes out because it's 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.710
 erased the memory very well let's say that 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.290
 I have the number 5 which by heart with 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.530
 example also I have it saved there 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.860
 I'm doing some calculation and let's say 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.409
 that I have the number 2 and I want to add or 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.090
 add 2 to the body that has memory 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.240
 all I have to do is press 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.580
 in the most and now if they remember there were 5 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.970
 and 5 2 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.160
 are seven words read the result of 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.800
 that mental prayer implant already the same 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.930
 happens with the minus if I want to subtract for 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:12.290
 example 6 to prieto m - and now 7 minus 6 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.930
 give me 1 and squeeze m rethink the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.310
 good result is very simple this 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.370
 works on any computer 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.080
 simple basic but it's something that 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.740
 interesting maybe some of us do not 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.970
 we've used it before and that's why I 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.100
 It seemed interesting to make this video 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.170
 but thank you very much for your support and 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.170
 back to my channel and many greetings
