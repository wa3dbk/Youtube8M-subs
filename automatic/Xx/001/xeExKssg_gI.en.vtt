and I just got hooked and I can't get

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.469 
and I just got hooked and I can't get
enough<00:01:40.909> of<00:01:41.149> it<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.950> key<00:01:43.310> thing<00:01:43.640> about<00:01:43.759> reining

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
enough of it the key thing about reining

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.020 
enough of it the key thing about reining
is<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.840> unlike<00:01:45.799> a<00:01:45.829> lot<00:01:46.100> of<00:01:46.219> disciplines<00:01:46.729> this

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
is that unlike a lot of disciplines this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.029 
is that unlike a lot of disciplines this
is<00:01:47.179> this<00:01:47.359> is<00:01:47.539> one<00:01:47.719> similar<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.229> dressage<00:01:48.679> it's

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
is this is one similar to dressage it's

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.340 
is this is one similar to dressage it's
been<00:01:49.189> compared<00:01:49.609> to<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.850> in<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.210> past<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.719> that

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
been compared to it in the past and that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.289 
been compared to it in the past and that
really<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:51.950> horse<00:01:52.219> doesn't<00:01:52.880> do<00:01:52.969> anything

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
really the horse doesn't do anything

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.609 
really the horse doesn't do anything
without<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.630> rider<00:01:53.869> you've<00:01:54.229> been<00:01:54.380> out<00:01:54.499> of

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
without the rider you've been out of

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.919 
without the rider you've been out of
cutting<00:01:54.979> where<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.280> horse<00:01:55.939> works<00:01:56.179> primarily

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
cutting where the horse works primarily

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.899 
cutting where the horse works primarily
off<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.319> the<00:01:57.469> cattle<00:01:57.859> and<00:01:58.039> not<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.700> rider

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
off of the cattle and not the rider

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.629 
off of the cattle and not the rider
signal<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.109> this<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:00.859> where<00:02:01.039> a<00:02:01.069> horse<00:02:01.310> relies

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
signal so this is where a horse relies

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.279 
signal so this is where a horse relies
completely<00:02:01.819> on<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.420> rider<00:02:02.719> and<00:02:02.990> he<00:02:03.049> should

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
completely on this rider and he should

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.260 
completely on this rider and he should
have<00:02:03.499> no<00:02:03.770> movement<00:02:04.219> other<00:02:04.729> than<00:02:05.060> what<00:02:05.179> his

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
have no movement other than what his

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.779 
have no movement other than what his
rider<00:02:05.539> tells<00:02:05.869> them<00:02:06.049> should<00:02:06.259> be<00:02:06.609> dictated<00:02:07.609> to
