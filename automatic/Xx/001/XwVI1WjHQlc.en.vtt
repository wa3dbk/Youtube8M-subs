00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.220
 so here I cut off all the excess tails and 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.330
 soak again the work that is here 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.429
 it only remains to braid the bend that is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.600
 bend these main protists here and 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:26.789
 those so i will show the simplest ie take 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:33.180
 any riser we start for the next riser 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.700
 output before and start back then as 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.329
 would we move to the right side then 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.590
 next we get for the next action 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.040
 short distance will need 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.129
 leave to the last riser 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.820
 it was possible to fill here that is, we take 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:57.289
 following 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:01:01.640
 we start it like this 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:04.979
 we weave before and we display back 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.090
 and so on, that is, all the risers need 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.659
 it will be neatly like this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.659
 weave 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.490
 so what if 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.950
 cracked while here I broke pond on 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.590
 in fact it is quite so frequent 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 repetition can be okay in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.939
 this is not his need to just change 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.670
 i.e. thick seals are inserted here 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.320
 or knitting needles here in this case until the end 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.750
 we must try to do this before 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.140
 of this place that the weaving is not disturbed 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.840
 then extracted selected wire 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.460
 another front and inserted in its place 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.250
 naturally you can do the replacement then 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.250
 when weaving is small enough 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.899
 here look i took out the stove sample not 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.280
 broken now need to paste into this 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.140
 place another rocks and so here I am replaced 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.960
 wire meaning it is all easy enough 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.710
 done in fact and remains only 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.710
 remove the knitting needle 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.520
 so, I have practically covered everything 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.170
 I only have 2 pratico left 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.459
 braid 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.520
 before you braid them 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.130
 soak the material well so that it does not 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.290
 what lot broke in such places about 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.030
 body mother and that is here i have to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.150
 Sorry, no fat sewed just 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.330
 since i'm not home i use 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.239
 needles that is, you need a given percent 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.450
 weave their cares with a twig before 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.630
 this which is already bent and fill it 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.400
 here's where I inserted sleeps 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.610
 accordingly I owe him so 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.370
 envy and here I will not insert 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.840
 insert into the camera that is here 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.769
 will need to fill it 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.060
 it's just not convenient for me on weight 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.140
 thing that is here in this way 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.730
 neatly wire refuel 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.400
 the material should be well equal than that 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.720
 there is to the end of it refuel and he 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.920
 will rise like all the other bars and so 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.489
 one wire left 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.739
 it needs to be here for this braid on 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.209
 boutiques for the following that is here he is 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.370
 must then enter before the next one and 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.090
 refuel down for the next riser 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.519
 here here by the principle which 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.400
 showed the chicken coop first straightened 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.930
 then refuel here and display back 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.510
 neatly need to remove this one 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:40.750
 last point there is another small 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.790
 the trick here is his I kinda brought 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.950
 forward, that is, you need to knit here before 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.340
 this pluto and the commandment here for the next 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.470
 riser 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.959
 that is, you can cut it somewhere 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.600
 around this place and neatly 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.370
 fill in here for this stand that is not 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.930
 the whole park to drag a little 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.760
 a piece but it must be done very 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.760
 neatly so as not to break the fruit 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.070
 so here I am finished bending and here 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.020
 remains only on the back of 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.330
 purse here these practices trim them 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.220
 then it will be possible to use in work 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:20.160
 that is, they are a long look and only 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:22.440
 the bottom part is cool and so here i am cut 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.110
 practice, that is, how much is left 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.570
 material you can still work with it 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:33.950
 wrong side and here's the front side 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.950
 almost all work is done
