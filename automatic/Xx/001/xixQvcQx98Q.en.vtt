as<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.759> said<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> Duke<00:01:36.240> Leto<00:01:36.360> Swampert<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
as I said a Duke Leto Swampert because I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.060 
as I said a Duke Leto Swampert because I
figured<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.439> would<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> best<00:01:37.829> play<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
figured that would be the best play to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.410 
figured that would be the best play to
make<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.460> leads<00:01:38.579> off<00:01:38.759> ditto<00:01:39.030> because

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
make but it leads off ditto because

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.670 
make but it leads off ditto because
that's<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> only<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.470> for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that's the only thing you can go for

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.100 
that's the only thing you can go for
rocks<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.610> he<00:01:42.390> relies<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.659> ditto<00:01:42.990> two

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
rocks because he relies on ditto two

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.980 
rocks because he relies on ditto two

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
I'm gonna go for you turn because I know

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.539 
I'm gonna go for you turn because I know
he's<00:02:53.379> going<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> switch<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.280> then<00:02:54.370> go<00:02:54.519> to

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
he's going to switch and then go to

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.780 
he's going to switch and then go to
raikou<00:02:54.970> because<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.389> do<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:56.139> specs<00:02:56.409> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
raikou because I do have the specs of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.699 
raikou because I do have the specs of
extra<00:02:57.790> century<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:58.389> I<00:02:58.450> figured<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:58.989> will<00:02:59.590> be

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
extra century so I figured that will be

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.640 
extra century so I figured that will be
a<00:02:59.739> good<00:03:00.069> thing<00:03:00.189> to<00:03:00.250> do<00:03:00.400> against<00:03:00.909> him<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.180> top

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
a good thing to do against him on top

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.110 
a good thing to do against him on top
unfortunately<00:03:02.650> does<00:03:02.829> not<00:03:02.859> kill<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.579> but<00:03:03.849> he

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
unfortunately does not kill it but he

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.869 
unfortunately does not kill it but he
get<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.389> footage<00:03:04.629> so<00:03:05.079> that's<00:03:05.650> kind<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.219> nice<00:03:06.430> I

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
get the footage so that's kind of nice I

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.610 
get the footage so that's kind of nice I
mean<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.689> don't<00:03:07.840> know<00:03:07.900> what<00:03:08.019> he's<00:03:08.109> gonna<00:03:08.230> go<00:03:08.590> for

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
mean I don't know what he's gonna go for

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.250 
mean I don't know what he's gonna go for
so<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.639> can't<00:03:09.969> really<00:03:10.150> judge<00:03:10.569> if<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.870> mattered

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
so I can't really judge if it mattered
