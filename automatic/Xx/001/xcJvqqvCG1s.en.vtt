point 0 9 7 volts in this battery when I
started<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.110> definitely<00:01:49.320> charge<00:01:49.829> or

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
started so we can definitely charge or

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.780 
started so we can definitely charge or
look<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.520> gone<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.880> bit<00:01:51.090> more<00:01:51.240> already<00:01:52.790> so

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
look it's gone up a bit more already so

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.749 
look it's gone up a bit more already so
indefinitely<00:01:54.210> charge<00:01:54.680> of<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.070> panel<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
indefinitely charge of that panel and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.660 
indefinitely charge of that panel and

just<00:02:19.520> stop<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.850> from<00:02:19.940> going<00:02:20.150> flat<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.750> my

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
just stop it from going flat is my

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.860 
just stop it from going flat is my
feelings<00:02:21.319> I<00:02:21.500> don't<00:02:21.709> think<00:02:21.920> it's<00:02:22.040> really<00:02:22.370> gonna

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
feelings I don't think it's really gonna

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.590 
feelings I don't think it's really gonna
charge<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.170> fit<00:02:24.380> up<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.940> might<00:02:26.120> get<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.330> teeny

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
charge that fit up you might get a teeny

just<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.930> trickle<00:02:30.170> charge<00:02:30.470> idea<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.130> maybe

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
just a trickle charge idea so maybe

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.210 
just a trickle charge idea so maybe
perhaps<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.030> don't<00:02:32.380> install<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.440> South<00:02:33.860> cell

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
perhaps you don't install a South cell

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.580

off of that little pun in the Sun with

off of that little pun in the Sun with
my<00:04:06.060> boost<00:04:06.330> circuit<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:07.790> actually<00:04:08.790> measured

my boost circuit I actually measured
that<00:04:09.390> yet<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.690> might<00:04:09.900> do<00:04:10.020> that<00:04:10.050> later<00:04:10.410> sorry<00:04:10.800> but

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that yet I might do that later sorry but

that yet I might do that later sorry but
mostly<00:04:11.940> fair<00:04:12.270> think<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.570> was<00:04:12.690> gonna<00:04:12.810> leave<00:04:12.960> it

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.240 

well<00:04:18.660> well<00:04:18.870> that's<00:04:19.080> been<00:04:19.320> disconnected<00:04:19.920> we

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
well well that's been disconnected we

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.010 
well well that's been disconnected we
have<00:04:20.400> had<00:04:20.580> a<00:04:20.610> little<00:04:20.820> bit<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.090> drop<00:04:21.390> back<00:04:21.690> here

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
have had a little bit of drop back here

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.620 
have had a little bit of drop back here
but<00:04:22.640> let's<00:04:23.640> look<00:04:23.820> alike<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.270> just<00:04:24.420> five

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
but let's look alike in just five

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.150 
but let's look alike in just five
minutes<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.200> Sun<00:04:25.440> but<00:04:25.680> about<00:04:25.890> 4

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
minutes in the Sun but about 4

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.090 
minutes in the Sun but about 4
millivolts<00:04:26.520> into<00:04:27.180> my<00:04:27.300> battery<00:04:27.750> maybe<00:04:28.620> less

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.280 

certainly<00:04:32.100> caused<00:04:32.310> an<00:04:32.340> increase<00:04:32.930> was<00:04:33.930> left<00:04:34.140> on

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
certainly caused an increase was left on

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.870 
certainly caused an increase was left on
for<00:04:34.500> longer<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.830> think<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> charge<00:04:35.610> quite

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
for longer I think that a charge quite

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.080 
for longer I think that a charge quite
well<00:04:36.030> on<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.300> Sun<00:04:37.130> fast<00:04:38.130> but<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:38.790> would<00:04:38.910> be<00:04:38.940> a

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
well on the Sun fast but it would be a

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.260 
well on the Sun fast but it would be a
great<00:04:39.270> trickle<00:04:39.630> charge<00:04:42.350> no<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.410> want<00:04:43.860> do<00:04:44.270> with

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
great trickle charge no I want do with

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.120 
great trickle charge no I want do with
some<00:04:46.370> so<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.460> can<00:04:47.610> see<00:04:47.790> both<00:04:47.970> those<00:04:48.270> meters

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
some so you can see both those meters

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.650 
some so you can see both those meters
and<00:04:50.130> i'll<00:04:50.370> hook<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.820> up<00:04:51.030> norwich<00:04:51.480> what

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
and i'll hook this up norwich what

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
that way without me drop we can back up

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.940 
that way without me drop we can back up

from<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.490> cap<00:05:46.700> just<00:05:47.510> in<00:05:47.630> case<00:05:49.390> there's<00:05:50.390> no

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
from the cap just in case there's no

from the cap just in case there's no
chance<00:05:50.840> of<00:05:51.020> discharging<00:05:53.890> do<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:54.980> have<00:05:55.070> a

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
chance of discharging do you have a

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.570 
chance of discharging do you have a
diode<00:05:55.490> vegan<00:05:55.970> to<00:05:56.090> my<00:05:56.270> own<00:05:57.220> capacitor<00:05:58.220> or<00:05:58.400> the

diode vegan to my own capacitor or the

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.100 
diode vegan to my own capacitor or the
negative<00:05:58.730> side<00:05:59.150> and<00:05:59.450> I<00:05:59.510> do<00:05:59.570> have<00:05:59.810> a<00:05:59.840> diet

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
negative side and I do have a diet

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.930 
negative side and I do have a diet
feeling<00:06:00.530> from<00:06:00.710> my<00:06:00.830> capacitor<00:06:01.340> to<00:06:01.460> my<00:06:01.580> battery

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
feeling from my capacitor to my battery

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.150

on<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.210> negative<00:06:02.540> side<00:06:04.690> so<00:06:05.690> I<00:06:06.010> should<00:06:07.010> be

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
on the negative side so I should be

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.790 
on the negative side so I should be
protected<00:06:07.640> from<00:06:08.050> discharges<00:06:09.050> I<00:06:09.260> have<00:06:09.560> to<00:06:09.650> put

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
protected from discharges I have to put

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.170 
protected from discharges I have to put
another<00:06:09.950> diet<00:06:10.220> on<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.490> positive<00:06:10.850> side<00:06:10.880> of<00:06:11.060> the

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
another diet on the positive side of the

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.800 
another diet on the positive side of the
battery<00:06:11.300> all<00:06:11.630> over<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:11.930> car<00:06:13.600> they'll<00:06:14.600> come

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
battery all over the car they'll come

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.450 
battery all over the car they'll come
back<00:06:14.930> at<00:06:15.140> me<00:06:15.260> narito<00:06:15.650> since<00:06:15.980> that<00:06:16.130> battery

back at me narito since that battery

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.590 
back at me narito since that battery
