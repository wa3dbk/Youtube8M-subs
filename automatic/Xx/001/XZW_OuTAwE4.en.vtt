00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.320
 Yesterday we were in giant slalom and 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 today hall tested around them and above all 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.540
 the good thing is that it's here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 really winter conditions 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.920
 has and that is very much I believe 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
 Also important for ski testing only 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.850
 provide few meaningful tests 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.880
 can be really wintry 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.890
 conditions and that was yesterday and 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.110
 really great for exercising today 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.710
 and very meaningful and 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.710
 revealing test 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.840
 my season was actually on 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.510
 You have to be honest at the beginning 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.680
 say I had some problems with it 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.750
 my shooter may and also with 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.070
 my own technique and from it 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.320
 as a result, the results were not 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.660
 as I imagined 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.680
 but actually it was with the son as well 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.170
 actually constantly up and it 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.729
 was a few very good separate couple 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.140
 unfortunate placements but im 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.550
 I think so 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.880
 be very happy with the season 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.880
 to lose 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.560
 a dream it is, of course, the highest 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.330
 snow safety as you can see here 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.880
 with the glasses but still has here 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.810
 still really great conditions hard 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.640
 good difficulty enough good hand 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.620
 characteristic where you really too 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.960
 different many different 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.940
 can also simulate terrain forms and 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.120
 he is that for me again and again 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.100
 nice to come here and special 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.590
 start the winter season and the end of the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.840
 winter season it is very much for me 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.840
 exciting interesting would like to come here
