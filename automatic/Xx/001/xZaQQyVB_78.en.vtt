00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.450 
I've been doing the tour since about 94
yeah<00:00:16.139> until<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:17.430> until<00:00:18.029> now<00:00:18.060> really<00:00:18.660> yeah

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
yeah until about until now really yeah

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.179 
yeah until about until now really yeah
so<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:21.109> that's<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.260> few<00:00:22.500> years<00:00:22.740> old<00:00:23.039> boy

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
so that's that's a few years old boy

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.519 
so that's that's a few years old boy
yeah<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> definitely<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> free<00:00:24.840> food<00:00:25.170> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
yeah I definitely get the free food I

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.929 
yeah I definitely get the free food I
think<00:00:25.800> old<00:00:25.859> surfers<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> same<00:00:26.699> aren't

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
think old surfers are the same aren't

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.580 
think old surfers are the same aren't
they<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.390> there's<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.689> free<00:00:27.869> feed<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.380> around

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
they if there's a free feed going around

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.710 
they if there's a free feed going around
there<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.920> surface<00:00:29.279> will<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.429> there<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
there that surface will be there but I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.740 
there that surface will be there but I
think<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.430> best<00:00:32.610> food<00:00:32.880> I've<00:00:33.239> probably<00:00:33.480> had

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
think the best food I've probably had

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.700 
think the best food I've probably had
would<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.880> probably<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> beach<00:00:36.239> -<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> at

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
would be probably the beach - at the at

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
would be probably the beach - at the at
the<00:00:37.860> Hurley<00:00:38.129> contest<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> America<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.570> know

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
what Brazil doesn't even serve but they

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
what Brazil doesn't even serve but they
didn't<00:00:42.360> use<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.629> serve<00:00:42.840> food<00:00:43.110> anyway<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
didn't use to serve food anyway like the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160

turns<00:03:58.030> on<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.209> way<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.690> was<00:03:58.959> going<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.140> get<00:03:59.260> a

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
turns on a way that I was going to get a

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.380 
turns on a way that I was going to get a
score<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.890> that<00:03:59.950> was<00:04:00.340> basically<00:04:00.520> basically

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
score and that was basically basically

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.830 
score and that was basically basically
my<00:04:01.480> approach<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.140> whole<00:04:02.230> year<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:04.000> just

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
my approach to the whole year and I just

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.540 
my approach to the whole year and I just
kept<00:04:05.020> getting<00:04:05.170> on<00:04:05.350> roles<00:04:05.620> getting<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:06.310> roles

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
kept getting on roles getting on roles

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.260 
kept getting on roles getting on roles
and<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.270> kept<00:04:08.020> doing<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:09.209> ended<00:04:10.209> up

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
and just kept doing it and ended up

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.390
