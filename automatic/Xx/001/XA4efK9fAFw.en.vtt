cutout<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.349> ring<00:02:23.870> after<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> get<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
cutout in the ring after you get the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.199 
cutout in the ring after you get the
plastic<00:02:26.040> Stata<00:02:26.280> ring<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.580> there<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.970> want<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
plastic Stata ring in there you want to

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.449 
plastic Stata ring in there you want to
go<00:02:27.299> ahead<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.540> turn<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.750> counterclockwise

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
go ahead and turn it counterclockwise

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.400 
go ahead and turn it counterclockwise
about<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.489> half<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.760> turn<00:02:29.940> gently<00:02:30.269> you'll<00:02:31.260> feel

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
about a half a turn gently you'll feel

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.680 
about a half a turn gently you'll feel
the<00:02:31.500> tension<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.040> recoil<00:02:32.400> spring<00:02:32.690> should

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the tension on the recoil spring should

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:43.580 
the tension on the recoil spring should
snap<00:02:33.930> back<00:02:34.170> into<00:02:34.200> place

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590

itself<00:02:49.459> remember<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.390> long<00:02:50.750> tab<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.109> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
itself remember the long tab of the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:01.500 
itself remember the long tab of the
spring<00:02:51.439> gets<00:02:52.250> installed<00:02:52.549> into<00:02:52.969> the<00:02:53.000> cover<00:02:53.840> I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.460 

know<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.629> kind<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:02.810> tough<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.109> see<00:03:03.260> on<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
know it's kind of tough to see on the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.830 
know it's kind of tough to see on the
video<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.010> if<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.459> can<00:03:04.640> look<00:03:04.790> down<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.720> is

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
video but if you can look down this is

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.020 
video but if you can look down this is
the<00:03:05.870> ratchet<00:03:06.260> on<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:07.129> small<00:03:07.609> tab<00:03:07.819> of<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
the ratchet on the small tab of the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.899 
the ratchet on the small tab of the
spring<00:03:08.359> you<00:03:08.900> can<00:03:09.049> see<00:03:09.290> locked<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.430> right<00:03:10.790> in

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
spring you can see locked in right in

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.030 
spring you can see locked in right in
this<00:03:11.000> groove<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.930> that's<00:03:12.230> what<00:03:12.349> you<00:03:12.439> want

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.140 

okay<00:03:16.040> now<00:03:16.159> you<00:03:16.219> can<00:03:16.280> put<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.579> friction<00:03:16.909> spring

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
okay now you can put the friction spring

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.539 
okay now you can put the friction spring
onto<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.780> friction<00:03:18.079> plate<00:03:18.340> make<00:03:19.340> sure<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
onto the friction plate make sure the

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.179 
onto the friction plate make sure the
tabs<00:03:19.790> are<00:03:19.970> facing<00:03:20.239> up<00:03:20.829> just<00:03:21.829> spread<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.099> right

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
tabs are facing up just spread it right

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.720 
tabs are facing up just spread it right
over<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.849> plate<00:03:23.980> okay<00:03:24.980> since<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.430> won't<00:03:25.579> be

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
over the plate okay since you won't be

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.129 
over the plate okay since you won't be
able<00:03:25.849> to<00:03:25.939> see<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.329> position<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.870> spring

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
able to see the position of the spring

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.229 
able to see the position of the spring
once<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.709> friction<00:03:28.040> plate<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.340> installed<00:03:28.549> I'm

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
once the friction plate is installed I'm

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.280 
once the friction plate is installed I'm
going<00:03:29.389> to<00:03:29.450> show<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.599> how<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.870> lines<00:03:30.079> up

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
going to show you how it lines up

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.179 
going to show you how it lines up
without<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.799> plate

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
without the plate

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.970 
without the plate
I<00:03:31.239> wanted<00:03:32.239> sort<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.569> parallel<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.680> ratchet

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
I wanted sort of parallel to the ratchet

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.909 
I wanted sort of parallel to the ratchet
arm<00:03:34.099> itself<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:35.319> now<00:03:36.319> take<00:03:36.379> your<00:03:36.620> friction

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
arm itself I now take your friction

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.409 
arm itself I now take your friction
plate<00:03:37.069> with<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.310> springs<00:03:37.549> on<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.819> make<00:03:38.239> sure

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
plate with the springs on it make sure

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.030 
plate with the springs on it make sure
to<00:03:38.599> align<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.139> tabs<00:03:39.379> as<00:03:39.680> we<00:03:39.769> showed<00:03:39.950> you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
to align the tabs as we showed you

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.490 
to align the tabs as we showed you
before<00:03:41.439> let's<00:03:42.439> take<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.650> right<00:03:42.769> over<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.010> top

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
before let's take it right over the top

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.680 
before let's take it right over the top
and<00:03:45.549> then<00:03:46.549> just<00:03:46.700> bolt<00:03:46.849> it<00:03:46.939> down<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:52.479> have<00:03:53.479> to<00:03:53.569> get

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
and then just bolt it down I have to get

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.210 
and then just bolt it down I have to get
the<00:03:53.750> bolt<00:03:53.930> tightened<00:03:54.290> down<00:03:54.319> we're<00:03:55.040> going<00:03:55.129> to

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
the bolt tightened down we're going to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.199 
the bolt tightened down we're going to
make<00:03:55.340> sure<00:03:55.459> we<00:03:55.579> have<00:03:55.669> a<00:03:55.699> little<00:03:55.879> bit<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.030> free

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
make sure we have a little bit of free
