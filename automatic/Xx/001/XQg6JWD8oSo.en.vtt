comparisons I don't I don't think I'm
good<00:00:33.660> enough<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.320> there<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.649> lots<00:00:34.860> of

good enough for that there are lots of

for<00:00:41.790> me<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.030> gonna<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.420> more<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> these<00:00:42.930> size

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
for me I'm gonna do more of these size

two I mean the reason that I got a

two I mean the reason that I got a
microphone<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.850> systems<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.570> want

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
microphone that systems because I want

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.930 
microphone that systems because I want
it<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:51.989> small<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.789> EM

Forster's<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.539> popular<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
Forster's was popular because the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.090 
Forster's was popular because the
picture<00:00:57.600> quality<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.109> rivaling<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.920> not

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
picture quality was rivaling if not

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.849 
picture quality was rivaling if not
surpassing<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.300> eight<00:01:00.629> PSC<00:01:01.289> counterparts

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
surpassing it the eight PSC counterparts

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.329 
surpassing it the eight PSC counterparts
and<00:01:02.010> yet<00:01:02.359> despite<00:01:03.359> its<00:01:03.510> most<00:01:04.040> despite<00:01:05.040> despite

is<00:01:05.670> small<00:01:06.000> sensor<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.510> know<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> quality<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
is small sensor you know the quality is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.550 
is small sensor you know the quality is
very<00:01:07.200> good<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.790> because<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> lenses

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
very good and because of that the lenses

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.700 
very good and because of that the lenses
will<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.830> small<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:11.659> okay<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> mean<00:01:13.590> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
will be small as well okay so I mean you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.530 
will be small as well okay so I mean you
have<00:01:13.830> Sony<00:01:14.070> cameras<00:01:14.549> which<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> larger

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
have Sony cameras which have the larger

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.630 
have Sony cameras which have the larger
sensor<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> smaller<00:01:16.770> body<00:01:17.040> than<00:01:17.310> some

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
sensor but a smaller body than some

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.510 
sensor but a smaller body than some
Micro<00:01:18.090> Four<00:01:18.299> Thirds<00:01:18.330> cameras<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.520> because

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
Micro Four Thirds cameras but because

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
Micro Four Thirds cameras but because
the<00:01:20.729> sensor<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.240> large<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.140> lens<00:01:22.500> has<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> be

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the sensor is large the lens has to be

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
the sensor is large the lens has to be
large<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.520> well<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.479> something<00:01:24.720> similar<00:01:25.140> like

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
large as well for something similar like

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.789 
large as well for something similar like
this<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:27.229> lenses<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.470> range

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
this so like like lenses in this range

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
this so like like lenses in this range
and<00:01:29.130> ApS<00:01:29.610> equivalent<00:01:30.270> would<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.570> about<00:01:30.810> two<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and ApS equivalent would be about two to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.370 
and ApS equivalent would be about two to
three<00:01:31.409> times<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.920> size<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:33.150> very<00:01:33.360> huge<00:01:33.990> so

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
three times the size it is very huge so

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.160 
three times the size it is very huge so
anyway<00:01:35.369> right<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.000> see<00:01:36.140> they<00:01:37.140> are

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
anyway right now as you can see they are

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.340 
anyway right now as you can see they are
very<00:01:37.530> similar<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.430> em1<00:01:38.880> looks<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:40.110> bit

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
very similar the em1 looks a little bit

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.249 
very similar the em1 looks a little bit
bigger<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.009> believe<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.930> way<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
bigger I believe because of the way it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.139 
bigger I believe because of the way it
was<00:01:43.380> designed<00:01:43.590> plus<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> grip<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
was designed plus you have the grip and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.780 
was designed plus you have the grip and
you<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> extra<00:01:46.290> button<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.890> button<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you have the extra button a button so it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969 
you have the extra button a button so it
actually<00:01:48.000> looks<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.780> its<00:01:48.960> own<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.829> might

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
actually looks on its own you might

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.760 
actually looks on its own you might
think<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.549> looks<00:01:50.729> much<00:01:51.299> chunkier<00:01:51.780> but

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
think that it looks much chunkier but

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
think that it looks much chunkier but
when<00:01:52.979> put<00:01:53.250> side<00:01:53.520> by<00:01:53.549> side<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.780> see

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
when put side by side as you can see

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.770 
when put side by side as you can see
that's<00:01:55.860> actually<00:01:56.930> not<00:01:57.930> much<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.799> difference

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
that's actually not much of a difference

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.740 
that's actually not much of a difference
right<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.049> terms<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.560> size<00:02:02.329> let's<00:02:03.329> look<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.630> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
right in terms of size let's look at it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.600 
right in terms of size let's look at it

screw<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:47.830> entirely<00:02:48.280> because<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:49.090> is

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
screw it in entirely because this is

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.570 
screw it in entirely because this is
just<00:02:49.930> for<00:02:50.080> comparison<00:02:50.739> sake<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.100> course<00:02:51.370> so

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
just for comparison sake of course so

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.940 
just for comparison sake of course so
this<00:02:51.700> adds<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.330> very<00:02:52.930> nice<00:02:53.170> grip<00:02:53.410> are<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.739> doing

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
this adds a very nice grip are we doing

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.590 
this adds a very nice grip are we doing
a<00:02:54.040> separate<00:02:54.340> review<00:02:54.489> for<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.360> remember

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
a separate review for this so remember

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.660 
a separate review for this so remember
to<00:02:55.840> check<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.140> out<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.860> as<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.160> can<00:02:57.280> see<00:02:57.340> I

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
to check it out but as you can see I

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.729 
to check it out but as you can see I
believe<00:02:57.790> because<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.540> has<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.260> add<00:02:59.470> some

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
believe because you has to add some

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.620 
believe because you has to add some
structural<00:02:59.980> integrity<00:03:00.730> here<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.300> bottom

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
structural integrity here so the bottom

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.380 
structural integrity here so the bottom
is<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.750> little<00:03:01.959> bit<00:03:02.110> thick<00:03:02.320> but<00:03:03.120> when<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.209> put<00:03:04.360> a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
is a little bit thick but when you put a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.340 
is a little bit thick but when you put a
drip<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:07.090> with<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.420> grip<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> little

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
drip it's this with the grip is a little

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.870 
drip it's this with the grip is a little
bit<00:03:08.440> taller<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.190> use<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.580> original

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
bit taller so if you use the original

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.030 
bit taller so if you use the original
hitch<00:03:16.239> LD<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.910> his<00:03:19.060> ld5<00:03:19.600> grip<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.709> wouldn't

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
hitch LD is it his ld5 grip it wouldn't

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.699 
hitch LD is it his ld5 grip it wouldn't
be<00:03:21.130> as<00:03:21.340> as<00:03:21.700> tall<00:03:22.150> but<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.900> grip<00:03:23.140> size<00:03:23.380> here<00:03:23.620> is

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
be as as tall but the grip size here is

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.890 
be as as tall but the grip size here is
very<00:03:24.070> similar<00:03:24.660> okay<00:03:25.660> in<00:03:26.049> front<00:03:26.799> so<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:28.330> e<00:03:28.360> m5

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
very similar okay in front so the e m5

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.770 
very similar okay in front so the e m5
with<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.380> grip<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:30.010> would<00:03:30.940> say<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.360> actually

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
with the grip I would say is actually

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.630 
with the grip I would say is actually
about<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.290> same<00:03:32.500> size<00:03:32.860> as<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:34.570> em1<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.340> this

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
about the same size as the em1 so this

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.320 
about the same size as the em1 so this
is<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.420> short<00:03:41.410> video<00:03:41.650> comparison

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
is this is a short video comparison

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.810 
is this is a short video comparison
between<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.630> two<00:03:43.660> in<00:03:44.170> terms<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.620> size<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.640> for

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
between the two in terms of size so for

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.789 
between the two in terms of size so for
those<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.330> who<00:03:46.630> are<00:03:46.959> looking<00:03:47.260> at<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.590> size

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
those of you who are looking at the size

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.610 
those of you who are looking at the size
and<00:03:48.040> think<00:03:48.370> who<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.120> has<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:49.900> has<00:03:50.380> that

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
and think who and has it and has that

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.490 
and think who and has it and has that
criteria<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.489> very<00:03:51.940> important<00:03:52.570> part<00:03:53.410> of

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
criteria is a very important part of

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
let's go in a quick circle again just

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.240 
let's go in a quick circle again just
look<00:04:12.209> around<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.720> camera<00:04:14.140> we<00:04:14.260> have<00:04:14.380> not<00:04:14.560> done

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
look around the camera we have not done

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.330 
look around the camera we have not done
it<00:04:15.400> side<00:04:15.670> by<00:04:15.700> side<00:04:15.850> yes

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.760 

looks<00:04:20.700> almost<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.150> same<00:04:21.239> yeah<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:22.350> lens<00:04:22.620> is

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
looks almost the same yeah this lens is

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.830 
looks almost the same yeah this lens is
definitely<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.340> little<00:04:23.550> bit<00:04:23.760> bigger<00:04:24.000> because

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
definitely a little bit bigger because

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.640 
definitely a little bit bigger because
this<00:04:25.169> is<00:04:25.290> up<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.650> 40<00:04:26.160> instead<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.610> 35<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.650> little

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
this is up to 40 instead of 35 a little

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.680 
this is up to 40 instead of 35 a little
bit<00:04:28.740> heavier<00:04:29.430> as<00:04:29.490> well<00:04:29.820> but<00:04:34.639> on<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.940> big<00:04:36.389> scale

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
bit heavier as well but on the big scale
