how was he remaining so lucid and then

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.400 
how was he remaining so lucid and then
perhaps<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:08.030> strangest<00:03:08.360> question<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.260> them

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
perhaps the strangest question of them

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
all entered Stan his head one he was

all entered Stan his head one he was
amazed<00:03:12.620> he<00:03:12.860> hadn't<00:03:13.190> asked<00:03:13.519> himself<00:03:13.640> sooner

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.220

why<00:03:15.349> is<00:03:15.620> there<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.069> voice<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.670> my<00:03:16.849> head

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
why is there a voice in my head

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.660 
why is there a voice in my head
dictating<00:03:18.230> everything<00:03:18.379> that<00:03:19.010> I'm<00:03:19.160> doing<00:03:19.190> and

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
dictating everything that I'm doing and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.570 
dictating everything that I'm doing and
thinking<00:03:20.349> now<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.410> voice<00:03:21.830> was<00:03:22.069> describing

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
thinking now the voice was describing

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.000 
thinking now the voice was describing
itself<00:03:23.120> being<00:03:23.390> considered<00:03:23.959> by<00:03:24.110> Stan<00:03:24.470> Lee<00:03:24.500> who

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
itself being considered by Stan Lee who

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.309 
itself being considered by Stan Lee who

found it particularly strange I'm

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.979 
found it particularly strange I'm
dreaming<00:03:28.010> about<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.310> voice<00:03:28.640> describing<00:03:29.569> me

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
dreaming about a voice describing me

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.380 
dreaming about a voice describing me
thinking<00:03:30.860> about<00:03:30.980> how<00:03:31.130> it's<00:03:31.519> describing<00:03:32.060> my

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
thinking about how it's describing my

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.320 
thinking about how it's describing my
thoughts<00:03:32.780> he<00:03:33.230> thought<00:03:33.730> emoni<00:03:34.730> thought<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.180> all

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
thoughts he thought emoni thought it all

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330 
thoughts he thought emoni thought it all
very<00:03:35.690> odd<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.410> wondered<00:03:36.769> if<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.040> voice

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
very odd and wondered if this voice

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.729 
very odd and wondered if this voice
spoke<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.880> all<00:03:38.060> people<00:03:38.510> in<00:03:38.599> their<00:03:38.780> dreams<00:03:39.080> the
