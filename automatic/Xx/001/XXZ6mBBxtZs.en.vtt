00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.289
 intimate edition where people 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.930
 just talk to you 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.490
 without thinking too much about what you're talking about 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.650
 would be a vlog of the heart let's say 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.660
 so let's not there we'll get started 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.240
 with the news if you wanna screw up a lot 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.610
 You as you can notice 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.620
 I'm in a new environment, yes I am 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.000
 I changed again to whoever accompanies me. 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.399
 You know that I was announcing that I was going to 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.950
 to change recently with the edict is me 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.510
 would change radically was going 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.030
 although for santa catarina 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.520
 live with friends and share a 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.640
 apartment and share the loneliness too 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.050
 that loneliness is a nuisance 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.489
 quite mainly who works 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.590
 with entertainment 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.890
 this is one of the reasons that led me to 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.809
 do - videos in recent times and how 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.780
 It is but that's a subject for another 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.210
 blog that maybe we can reach this 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.920
 matter if you enjoy this and if this 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.710
 that format that is already 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.659
 doing so basically today I 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.159
 I changed, I'm in a new house, I'm still 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.619
 in canoe cape 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.090
 because I was not the one who did not travel to 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.460
 santa catarina always stays the other 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.070

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.880
 Something just happened in the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.400
 My life that made me stay here. 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.659
 but I'm still at the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.000
 new parliament apartment is very 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.549
 cool is a lower payment it is more 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.990

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.450
 much better location much more 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.820
 calm for me to receive my son 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.520

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.110

 My house I do not like because 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.150
 The other time I moved I made a 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.430

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.500

 scary we are scary type 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.650
 things can not deny good 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.020
 side I'm here in the new apartment 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.610
 It's a payment that I already feel 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.470

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.430
 record to do things for you 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.350
 new and how this physical change I 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 I decided to make other changes in my 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.950
 life too 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.660
 changes always good, people break 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.030
 taking a lot of thing then I 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.620
 I decided to have a healthier life and 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.110
 have a better life and get rid of everything 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.760
 what makes me sick there is the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.160
 another topic on today's blog 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.520
 basically I decided to stop smoking 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.740
 Yes, it's meeting the calls from you and me. 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.170
 I know you 're a long time commenting that 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.280
 the mischief I am not ignorant 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.500
 I have always known that the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.510
 cigarette really makes me sick and not just the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 me cigarette i know all 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.420
 cigarette malfunctions 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.640
 it was not out of sheer ignorance it was 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.920
 imbecility that I still smoked and today I 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.490
 I decided because I'm really going to stop. 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.550
 and I want to enjoy it and if this 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.990
 blog to make a kind of diary of 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.330
 a sparkling wine 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.950
 Today's my first day and I'm very 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.980
 satisfied with that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.510
 I'm basically going through the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.640
 needs the first day 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.160
 taking chimarrÃ£o taking many mamam 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.830
 I already think about 10 15 marx is like 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.170
 I had this time probably should 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.080
 have now are exactly 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.630
 Let's see here it's 15 hours 45 minutes 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.790
 15 to 4 in the afternoon 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.620
 would be taking smoking my tenth 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.390
 cigarette of the day is usually 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.800
 forming two portfolios per day I even 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.330
 I did a calculation on twitter. 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.640
 smoking two wallets a day I was 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.070
 down 2 reais per day leading in 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.320
 about four thousand eight hundred and thirty 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.300
 four thousand three hundred and eighty reais or 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.600
 better saying every month 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.510
 pardon for a year this basically I went 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.780
 a reasonably good zero car and cars 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.480
 zero in the last ten years to pay 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.510
 This I am very anxious as 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.030
 feeling very anxious today I am 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.310
 feeling the physical and 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.630
 a funny thing that I 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.950
 I'm feeling about the lack of 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.260
 cigarette 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.390
 the wind seeks a physical thing that I 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.430
 I was feeling respect for the cigarette. 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.590
 feeling I've read about 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.510
 people who ask for person members who 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.690
 lose an arm for example may sound 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.500
 offensive may sound scrotal that I am 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.780
 Speaking 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.000
 but it really feels like a 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.400
 person who loses a member she still has 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.050
 the memory of that member then the person 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.080
 who lost a hand to an arm she 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.870
 still feel the finger she felt of thing 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.780
 Beautiful, I felt hurt, and I, basically, I 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.940
 I feel at the tip of my fingers straight 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.419
 cigarette I feel in my mouth the cigarette 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.500
 and it's a law I have a memory is mine 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.660
 is still very recent 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.020
 because as I told you it was me today 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.600
 I made that resolution and I'm very 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.419
 Happy I wanted to say with you, I 'm 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.580
 I really liked this new house. 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.810
 giving me a new temper has other things 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.820
 happened in my life that is 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.169
 changing new buses also to come back 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.860
 to record back with property to 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.080
 you 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.080
 and so basically this is what I just wanted 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.690
 explore some of that my this 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.610
 my resolution of these my this 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.260
 my decision because you always 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.160
 I always was sincere with you. 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.950
 then it is not fair to divide this 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.300
 thing is this interesting and good fact that 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.500
 it's happening in my life was the 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.940
 decision to quit smoking 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.470
 I hope you at the door and 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.040
 logical this is not correct 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.350

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.930

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.810

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.190
