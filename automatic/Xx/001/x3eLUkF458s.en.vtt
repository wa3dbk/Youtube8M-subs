00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.609
 Are beauty guys going to come back with one? 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:17.560
 liquid exchange procedure. 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:20.750
 cooling in the radiator the renuclear I 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.300
 I'm with him dismounted here already did 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:29.000
 withdrawal and of all the liquid of 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:32.930
 Cooling I forgot to Avai but 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.180
 the procedure is very simple that the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:46.220
 oil dipstick that dodo engine right there 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:49.700
 on his base hit here have this 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:55.030
 I could manage to get her with 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.460
 pressure pliers up and 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.350
 remembering with the cold engine six are only 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.239
 here is this boot 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.239
 this hose is here 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.850
 this hose here and put a 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.979
 container if you do not have an idea 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.290
 average not having an idea in the middle while 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:24.049
 subject fits water in the radiator 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:27.890
 then I put a bowl I 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:31.850
 I went back to the basin and for me they know 44 in 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.970
 average of water and the saving capital 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.970
 He did the blessing more or less more 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.799
 two bottles evidence here is a four 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.460
 likely that they are beautiful therein and the mixture 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.890
 of the coolant in personnel 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.630
 then what I did 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.530
 I removed here this hose here. 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.320
 that liquid is still inside the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.610
 radiator 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.610
 You come in this other one here. 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:16.459
 It's exactly the same scheme if it starts 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.319
 You here give a shit and will leave enough 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.030
 water that will still leave a half liter 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.030
 of water inside the radiator 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:41.750
 after that if the box here will stay 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.730
 everything is totally emptied already 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.400
 removed she says to make excellent and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.970
 just screw yourselves team 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.739
 this other side will remove two 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.920
 screws here I learned is that 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:06.980
 our box that has already passed 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:13.660
 From here, the clamp 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:16.670
 here the accent does not stop here 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.360
 underwater came out in front came out 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:25.190
 with a letter still moving that box 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.920
 here is a light bulb in it with the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:33.790
 made coarse sand 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:36.320
 she had too much dirt inside she stayed 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.690
 with more or less 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:44.550
 Hey guys and I have distilled water and the 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.740
 Cooling liquid 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:53.480
 the preparation and the pause and that 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.480
 show you the procedure itself
