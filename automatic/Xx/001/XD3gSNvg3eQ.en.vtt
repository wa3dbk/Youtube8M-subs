00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey what's up everybody this is DOM and

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.420 
hey what's up everybody this is DOM and
today<00:00:02.490> we<00:00:02.939> are<00:00:03.060> taking<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.659> look<00:00:03.929> at<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.650> Galaxy

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
today we are taking a look at the Galaxy

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.419 
today we are taking a look at the Galaxy
Note<00:00:05.850> edge<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.410> very<00:00:07.799> different

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
Note edge this is a very different

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.240 
Note edge this is a very different
device<00:00:08.730> from<00:00:09.000> Samsung<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.840> it's<00:00:10.380> not<00:00:10.620> exactly

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
device from Samsung and it's not exactly

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.039 
device from Samsung and it's not exactly
what<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.639> would<00:00:11.730> expect<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.389> actually<00:00:12.840> has

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
what you would expect this actually has

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.519 
what you would expect this actually has
a<00:00:13.080> curved<00:00:13.830> edge<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.480> right<00:00:15.750> side<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
a curved edge on the right side of the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.519 
a curved edge on the right side of the
display<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.220> display<00:00:17.609> total<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.529> 5.6

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
display so the display total is 5.6

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.679 
display so the display total is 5.6
inches<00:00:20.310> which<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.520> slightly<00:00:20.939> smaller<00:00:21.119> than

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
inches which is slightly smaller than

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.439 
inches which is slightly smaller than
the<00:00:22.020> Galaxy<00:00:22.560> Note<00:00:22.800> 4<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> extra

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the Galaxy Note 4 but you have the extra

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.330 
the Galaxy Note 4 but you have the extra
side<00:00:24.720> space<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.890> actually<00:00:26.039> take

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
side space that you can actually take

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.490 
side space that you can actually take
advantage<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.880> independently<00:00:27.810> from<00:00:28.050> whatever

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
advantage of independently from whatever

battery<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.100> shouldn't<00:00:53.489> make<00:00:53.670> too<00:00:53.910> much

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
battery but that shouldn't make too much

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
battery but that shouldn't make too much
of<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> big<00:00:54.899> difference<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.440> terms<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.190> battery

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
of a big difference in terms of battery

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
of a big difference in terms of battery
life<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.329> what's<00:00:57.510> cool<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.199> edge

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
life now what's cool about the edge

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.380 
life now what's cool about the edge
screen<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.609> Samsung<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.120> actually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
screen is that Samsung is actually
