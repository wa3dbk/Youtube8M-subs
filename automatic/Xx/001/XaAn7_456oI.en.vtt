I<00:02:29.610> am<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> little<00:02:30.180> surprised<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:31.110> be<00:02:31.140> honest<00:02:31.500> I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
I am a little surprised to be honest I

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.430 
I am a little surprised to be honest I
thought<00:02:31.890> today<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.940> would<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.209> been<00:02:33.450> kind<00:02:34.379> of

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
thought today it would have been kind of

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.949 
thought today it would have been kind of
news<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:34.799> she's<00:02:35.190> been<00:02:35.670> found<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.299> we<00:02:36.810> could

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
news that she's been found and we could

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.740 
news that she's been found and we could
have<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.109> happy<00:02:37.409> ending<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:37.859> it<00:02:38.010> isn't<00:02:38.750> so

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
have a happy ending but it isn't so

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.509 
have a happy ending but it isn't so
obviously<00:02:40.409> she's<00:02:40.560> got<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.799> be<00:02:40.829> local<00:02:41.280> because

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
obviously she's got to be local because

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.240 
obviously she's got to be local because
if<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> was<00:02:41.849> left<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.150> your<00:02:42.329> landline<00:02:42.659> I<00:02:43.379> guess

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
if it was left on your landline I guess

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.910 
if it was left on your landline I guess
it's<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.750> local<00:02:45.750> number<00:02:45.989> with<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.769> know<00:02:46.890> a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it's a local number with you know a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520 
it's a local number with you know a
digit<00:02:47.400> or<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.790> our<00:02:47.819> place<00:02:48.299> yeah<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.200> mean

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
digit or to our place yeah I mean

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.500 
digit or to our place yeah I mean
presumably<00:02:50.040> because<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.849> could<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.150> sort<00:02:51.420> of

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
presumably because it could be sort of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.740 
presumably because it could be sort of
the<00:02:51.810> north<00:02:52.019> easton<00:02:52.859> area<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.030> 191<00:02:54.629> which

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the north easton area the or 191 which

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.050 
the north easton area the or 191 which
is<00:02:54.930> cold<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.709> few<00:02:55.889> three<00:02:56.159> if<00:02:56.340> he's<00:02:56.519> dialed<00:02:56.970> on

the style as you say a few digits then

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.720 
the style as you say a few digits then
it's<00:03:00.000> quite<00:03:00.269> possible<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.900> local<00:03:01.730> it's

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
