therefore<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> cheesy<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
therefore it can be kind of cheesy and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.399 
therefore it can be kind of cheesy and
contrived<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.820> helps<00:01:48.149> by<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.390> being<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.869> 90s

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.859 
contrived that helps by it being the 90s
and<00:01:49.530> all<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> has<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> 20<00:01:50.460> moments<00:01:50.869> the

plots for all the issues are also pretty
fun<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.149> entertaining<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.590> a
