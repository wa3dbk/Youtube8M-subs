00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.070 
into that in a second but the gameplay
is<00:00:14.730> probably<00:00:15.000> gonna<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> black<00:00:15.509> ops<00:00:15.660> 1<00:00:15.839> game

words as I can the aim of the game for

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
words as I can the aim of the game for
me<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> go<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.649> montage<00:00:46.980> clips<00:00:47.190> episode

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
idea is to get as many kills as I can

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.569 
idea is to get as many kills as I can
and<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:52.110> idea<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.489> many

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and the idea right now is to get as many

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
and the idea right now is to get as many
kills<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.149> which<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.110> split<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
kills as I can which is on the split in

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.990 
kills as I can which is on the split in
the<00:00:55.800> quote-unquote<00:00:56.399> kill<00:00:56.640> field<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.969> don't

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the quote-unquote kill field I don't

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.099 
the quote-unquote kill field I don't
know<00:00:57.180> why<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> said<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.809> because<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
know why I said it like that because I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.569 
know why I said it like that because I
think<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> actual<00:00:58.859> term<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
think that's the actual term for it so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
think that's the actual term for it so
yeah<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.300> many<00:01:00.539> kills<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.870> can't<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
yeah as many kills I can't which is

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
yeah as many kills I can't which is
unsplit<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> kill<00:01:02.309> feed<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> don't

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
unsplit in the kill feed in if you don't

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.160 
unsplit in the kill feed in if you don't
know<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.120> I'm<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.270> about<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.600> own<00:01:03.750> split

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
know what I'm on about my own split

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.500 
know what I'm on about my own split
basically<00:01:05.040> when<00:01:05.220> nobody<00:01:05.610> else<00:01:05.820> gets<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.299> kill

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
basically when nobody else gets a kill

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.450 
basically when nobody else gets a kill
nobody<00:01:06.930> else<00:01:07.049> dies<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.680> nobody<00:01:08.340> else

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
nobody else dies and nobody else

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
nobody else dies and nobody else
connects<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.060> leave<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> game<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> same

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
connects or leave the game at the same

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.710 
connects or leave the game at the same
time<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.740> Amiga<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> clip<00:01:11.580> which<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
time as Amiga in the clip which you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.840 
time as Amiga in the clip which you
probably<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> hell<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> why

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
probably think what the hell is that why

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.390 
probably think what the hell is that why
is<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.030> even<00:01:15.180> mana<00:01:15.630> well<00:01:16.320> yeah<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> know<00:01:17.040> it's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
is that even mana well yeah I know it's

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
is that even mana well yeah I know it's
pretty<00:01:17.640> stupid<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> that's

awhile<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.020> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.650> first<00:01:37.890> start<00:01:38.130> making

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
awhile like I want to first start making

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
awhile like I want to first start making
videos<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> wasn't<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> thing<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.840> then

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
videos it wasn't really a thing but then

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.859 
videos it wasn't really a thing but then
I<00:01:39.990> started<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> grow<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.880> bigger<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.509> I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
I started to grow and get bigger and I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.660 
I started to grow and get bigger and I
started<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> tail<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:43.979> clips<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.460> way<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
started to tail up my clips that way I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.910 
started to tail up my clips that way I
think<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.299> probably<00:01:46.259> remember<00:01:46.649> when<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> started

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
think I probably remember when I started

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.429 
think I probably remember when I started
using<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.509> split<00:01:48.869> clips<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.259> can't

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
using just on split clips I can't

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.690 
using just on split clips I can't
remember<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.430> obviously

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
remember when that was it was obviously

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
remember when that was it was obviously
a<00:01:50.759> while<00:01:50.939> ago<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.390> yeah<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.619> pretty

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
a while ago but yeah it's it's pretty

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.499 
a while ago but yeah it's it's pretty
weird<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:53.820> about<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.240> is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
weird when you think about it really is

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.670 
weird when you think about it really is
and<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.810> wanted<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> talk<00:01:55.259> about<00:01:55.320> today

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
I've been doing it like I said for a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.859 
I've been doing it like I said for a
while<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.240> good<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.570> point<00:02:00.780> where

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
while and it's good to that point where

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.240 
while and it's good to that point where
it's<00:02:00.990> becoming<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.560> stressful<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.189> me

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it's becoming really stressful for me

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.550 
it's becoming really stressful for me
because<00:02:02.540> when<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> make<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.840> montage<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
because when I make a montage and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.899 
because when I make a montage and
knowing<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> could<00:02:05.399> have<00:02:05.490> finished<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
knowing that I could have finished it

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.969 
knowing that I could have finished it
weeks<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.270> weeks<00:02:06.360> ago<00:02:06.659> if<00:02:06.869> unsplit<00:02:07.469> clips<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
weeks and weeks ago if unsplit clips and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
weeks and weeks ago if unsplit clips and
split<00:02:08.220> clips<00:02:08.429> were<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> same<00:02:08.910> thing<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
split clips were the same thing like I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.449 
split clips were the same thing like I
could<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.500> do<00:02:10.619> something<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:11.129> get<00:02:11.250> rid<00:02:11.430> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
could just do something to get rid of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.250 
could just do something to get rid of
the<00:02:11.610> split<00:02:11.879> or<00:02:11.970> whatever<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> idea<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the split or whatever like the idea that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.630 
the split or whatever like the idea that
the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.559 
the
I<00:02:13.670> would<00:02:13.850> have<00:02:13.940> been<00:02:14.030> doing<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.270> month<00:02:14.420> Hajj

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
I would have been doing the month Hajj

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.460 
I would have been doing the month Hajj
would<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.810> been<00:02:14.900> doing<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.200> would<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.380> been

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
would have been doing it would have been

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.350 
would have been doing it would have been
a<00:02:15.500> ridiculous<00:02:16.040> standard<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.760> idea<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.240> that

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
a ridiculous standard the idea of that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.880 
a ridiculous standard the idea of that
it<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.690> frustrates<00:02:18.110> me<00:02:18.260> because<00:02:18.410> I'm<00:02:18.650> doing

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
it just frustrates me because I'm doing

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.650 
it just frustrates me because I'm doing
everything<00:02:19.160> in<00:02:19.370> my<00:02:19.430> power<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:20.360> finish<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
everything in my power to finish the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.570 
everything in my power to finish the
video<00:02:21.050> I'm<00:02:21.350> playing<00:02:21.620> as<00:02:21.740> good<00:02:21.800> as<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.069> can<00:02:22.310> and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
video I'm playing as good as I can and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.040 
video I'm playing as good as I can and
I'm<00:02:22.670> killing<00:02:22.880> as<00:02:23.090> many<00:02:23.240> people<00:02:23.569> as<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.870> and

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
I'm killing as many people as I can and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.949 
I'm killing as many people as I can and
obviously<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:25.040> idea<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:26.030> someone<00:02:26.360> else<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
obviously the idea that someone else the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.420 
obviously the idea that someone else the
other<00:02:26.990> side<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.440> map<00:02:27.620> can<00:02:27.890> drop<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.130> claim

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
other side of the map can drop a claim

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.100 
other side of the map can drop a claim
on<00:02:28.610> down<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:28.970> kill<00:02:29.120> someone<00:02:29.360> or<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:29.870> we<00:02:29.959> could

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
on down and kill someone or so we could

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.540 
on down and kill someone or so we could
leave<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.410> game<00:02:30.590> or<00:02:30.860> connect<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.400> game

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
leave the game or connect to the game

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.180 
leave the game or connect to the game
the<00:02:32.030> idea<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.800> happening<00:02:33.800> at<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> same

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
the idea that that happening at the same

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.740 
the idea that that happening at the same
time<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.670> me<00:02:34.820> getting<00:02:35.180> all<00:02:35.300> these<00:02:35.420> kills

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
time and me getting all these kills

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.080 
time and me getting all these kills
ruins<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> clip<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:36.980> ridiculous

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
ruins the clip is just ridiculous

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
kills you got point stacks and that's a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.900 
kills you got point stacks and that's a
really<00:03:03.650> cool<00:03:03.769> feature<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.550> really<00:03:04.760> good

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
really cool feature and a really good

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.960 
really cool feature and a really good

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
way to disregard the kill feed and just

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.490 
way to disregard the kill feed and just
go<00:03:08.180> with<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.540> know<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.780> kills<00:03:08.989> I'm<00:03:09.290> getting

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
go with you know the kills I'm getting

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.690 
go with you know the kills I'm getting
the<00:03:09.560> kills<00:03:09.739> as<00:03:09.920> quickly<00:03:10.130> as<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.340> can<00:03:10.400> like

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
the kills as quickly as you can like

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.040 
the kills as quickly as you can like
that<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:11.030> idea<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.630> awesome<00:03:11.959> and

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
that the idea of that is awesome and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.630 
that the idea of that is awesome and
obviously<00:03:12.350> it's<00:03:12.500> in<00:03:12.560> place<00:03:12.830> so<00:03:13.100> I'm<00:03:13.310> thinking

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
obviously it's in place so I'm thinking

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.699 
obviously it's in place so I'm thinking
with<00:03:13.760> advanced<00:03:14.090> warfare<00:03:14.540> if<00:03:14.630> we<00:03:15.080> start<00:03:15.590> to

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
with advanced warfare if we start to

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.680 
with advanced warfare if we start to
tailor<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:16.040> clips<00:03:16.340> towards<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.910> against<00:03:17.450> many

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
tailor I clips towards that against many

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.060 
tailor I clips towards that against many
kills<00:03:17.930> as<00:03:17.989> we<00:03:18.079> can<00:03:18.290> as<00:03:18.440> quickly<00:03:18.500> as<00:03:18.799> we<00:03:18.920> can

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
kills as we can as quickly as we can

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.160 
kills as we can as quickly as we can
then<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:19.760> think<00:03:20.060> we'll<00:03:20.150> be<00:03:20.269> golden<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:20.900> the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
then I think we'll be golden but the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.080 
then I think we'll be golden but the
dream<00:03:21.470> would<00:03:21.799> be<00:03:21.829> if<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:22.519> release<00:03:22.700> something

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
dream would be if they release something

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.120 
dream would be if they release something
where<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.600> can<00:03:23.870> basically<00:03:24.230> just<00:03:24.769> get<00:03:24.950> rid<00:03:25.070> of

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
where you can basically just get rid of

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.949 
where you can basically just get rid of
every<00:03:25.519> other<00:03:25.549> kill<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.420> happens<00:03:26.750> at<00:03:26.870> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
every other kill that happens at the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.539 
every other kill that happens at the
same<00:03:27.110> time<00:03:27.380> as<00:03:27.500> yours<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:27.920> just<00:03:28.070> shows<00:03:28.280> your

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
same time as yours and just shows your

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.340 
same time as yours and just shows your
kills<00:03:28.850> at<00:03:29.030> once<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.870> think<00:03:29.959> would<00:03:30.140> be<00:03:30.230> good

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
kills at once and I think would be good

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.020 
kills at once and I think would be good
there<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.799> that's<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.280> know<00:03:31.400> awesome<00:03:31.880> but

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
there like that's you know awesome but

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.220 
there like that's you know awesome but
obviously<00:03:32.269> they're<00:03:32.390> not<00:03:32.480> gonna<00:03:32.600> do<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.810> so

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
obviously they're not gonna do that so

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.410 
obviously they're not gonna do that so
I'm<00:03:33.590> hoping<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.130> Taylor's<00:03:34.610> towards<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.299> know

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
I'm hoping it Taylor's towards you know

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.390 
I'm hoping it Taylor's towards you know
bullet<00:03:36.110> ease<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.410> point<00:03:36.650> stacks<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.160> just

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
bullet ease and point stacks and just

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.550 
bullet ease and point stacks and just
aggressive<00:03:37.640> gameplay<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.450> just<00:03:38.750> I<00:03:38.900> don't<00:03:39.500> know

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
aggressive gameplay I just I don't know

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.870 
aggressive gameplay I just I don't know
what<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:39.920> really<00:03:40.130> don't<00:03:40.400> because<00:03:40.549> like<00:03:40.790> I

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
what it is I really don't because like I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.009 
what it is I really don't because like I
said<00:03:40.940> I've<00:03:41.120> been<00:03:41.180> doing<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.420> for<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:41.630> long<00:03:41.660> and

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
said I've been doing it for so long and

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.210 
said I've been doing it for so long and
I've<00:03:42.079> stuck<00:03:42.350> with<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.799> I've<00:03:42.920> really

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
I've stuck with it and I've really

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.949 
I've stuck with it and I've really
enjoyed<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:44.239> feel<00:03:44.510> like<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.660> bit<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.840> a

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
enjoyed it I feel like a bit of a

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.000 
enjoyed it I feel like a bit of a
hypocrite<00:03:45.200> because<00:03:45.410> I've<00:03:45.650> always<00:03:45.890> been

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
hypocrite because I've always been

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.800 
hypocrite because I've always been
against<00:03:46.579> split<00:03:47.030> clips<00:03:47.239> like<00:03:47.420> I'm<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.750> like

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
against split clips like I'm just like

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.630 
against split clips like I'm just like
oh<00:03:48.019> they're<00:03:48.680> cool<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:48.980> obviously<00:03:49.459> they're

oh they're cool and obviously they're
the<00:03:49.670> same<00:03:49.970> standard<00:03:50.510> because<00:03:50.870> you're<00:03:51.350> not

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
the same standard because you're not

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.720 
the same standard because you're not
doing<00:03:51.709> anything<00:03:51.890> differently<00:03:52.340> you're<00:03:52.519> doing

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
clip in the kill feed then they don't

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.410 
clip in the kill feed then they don't
think<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.100> clips<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.430> good<00:04:51.670> they<00:04:51.910> might<00:04:52.270> not

think the clips is good they might not
use<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.720> or<00:04:52.990> they<00:04:53.140> might<00:04:53.320> just<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:53.860> it's<00:04:54.130> not

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
use it or they might just think it's not

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.790 
use it or they might just think it's not
as<00:04:54.460> good<00:04:54.670> and<00:04:54.880> this<00:04:55.090> guy<00:04:55.210> is<00:04:55.270> just<00:04:55.360> like<00:04:55.800> you

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800

are<00:04:57.330> that's<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.420> thing<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:58.960> it's<00:04:59.050> just<00:04:59.200> like

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
are that's a thing and it's just like

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.540 
are that's a thing and it's just like
yeah<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.650> this<00:04:59.740> is<00:04:59.860> like<00:05:00.010> how<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.220> hell<00:05:00.400> does

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
yeah and this is like how the hell does

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.460 
yeah and this is like how the hell does
that<00:05:00.610> make<00:05:01.000> sense<00:05:01.270> because<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.870> have<00:05:02.320> no

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
that make sense because you have no

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.170 
that make sense because you have no
control<00:05:02.800> over<00:05:02.920> it<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.640> I'm<00:05:03.730> just<00:05:03.910> thinking

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
control over it and I'm just thinking

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.330 
control over it and I'm just thinking
it's<00:05:04.450> really<00:05:04.540> stupid<00:05:05.110> here<00:05:05.620> really<00:05:05.890> is<00:05:06.130> stupid

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
it's really stupid here really is stupid

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.180 
it's really stupid here really is stupid
but<00:05:06.700> like<00:05:06.760> we<00:05:07.390> do<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.960> we<00:05:08.230> enjoy<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:08.800> most

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
but like we do it and we enjoy it most

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.760 
but like we do it and we enjoy it most
of<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.430> time<00:05:09.640> but<00:05:10.510> it's<00:05:10.630> got<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:10.990> me<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.470> really

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
of the time but it's got to me it really

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.470 
of the time but it's got to me it really
