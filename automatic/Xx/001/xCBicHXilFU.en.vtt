00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 we are not talking about who the 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.760
 concentration of the principle that no one 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.990
 the first thing we have to kill is restoring 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.609
 he proposes the following 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:15.439
 those who walk know the genetics it does not change with time 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.060
 this is the same thing is different say no 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.060
 process of evolution is not taking place. 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.579
 so what we spend 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.890
 necessarily follow 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.029
 knows he's proposing some principles we will not kill 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.240
 not as caps for why 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.500
 that polls will always introduce norwegian jewel population obviously 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 not the worker are frequent 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.520
 no wonder it's natural selection 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.830
 the selection will have a square in front 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.960
 remaining 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.170
 in a particular set of is not interesting the senai also operate 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.770
 the promotion is next door because 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.250
 if we have emigration and immigration but we will also change the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
 This agent's frequency is not interesting either. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.480
 similar promotion 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.230
 because in this case of petroleum inflation we could have the 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.370
 performance of the house causing you to have a certain presence 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.090
 June 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.960
 but it's also not interesting, I have the aim of the population being 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.850
 politics 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.280
 and who says marriages when putting a house on why preferential marriages 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.960
 When you direct the wedding, this will cause me to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.100
 I put the change of frequency people, this does not interest us either. 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.680
 It is with the region that we establish the principles now in the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.780
 to calculate the frequency of people 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.680
 let's take as an example a pair of sar jeans we will pay to read them 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 and thus among a population 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.109
 the frequency and cut off will have to be and in the hall so percent 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.950
 was cool 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.250
 next year but I do not think anything 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.250
 what is the dominant position 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.309
 uncorrected cellular recessive year 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.309
 we will call 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:23.719
 reason for the success of the unique mission to 100% we will see who is 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:26.129
 Henrique 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.559
 max son 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:29.909
 brother 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.200
 nor as we have already calculated the time in recent months to the population 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.220
 now we can calculate the frequency of 2 death by remembering that 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.799
 this Nordic are the result of combining the agent 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.059
 we use a pair of alliances classes start on scholarships we started here 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.449
 so when you start the other possible here 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:51.639
 in the hundred years 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.009
 the individual 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.589
 the flames no conscience gets dominant 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.179
 the yield 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.179
 the reason but would be undue and illegal 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.269
 but even so it would be undue as it came to have 60 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.619
 we came that the German the reason 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:11.739
 winning was called 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.139
 while week 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.139
 so it was called the fifth then we will have here the following 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:21.979
 came people 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.579
 who also follows the same thing 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.969
 what a pity 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.399
 squared 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:29.829
 the warehouse 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.989
 is a first line of sight but we see that the frequency 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.409
 of this value would be 2 2 the classes then which would be 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.799
 2 vices 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.539
 stars 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:45.949
 damn it 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:46.810
 equal 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.169
 to 2 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.439
 and finally 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.439
 the individual voice and decisive vote that would be the same thing 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.269
 in the palaces 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.269
 kirk 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.450
 it does not exist recently 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:03.149
 here or block 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.189
 always one who wants Nordics in a population 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.539
 is an equal revenue 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.149
 to 100% 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.189
 in the west and midwest 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.189
 unlike most buses 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.109
 in industry 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.400
 squared it will be 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.080
 a goal 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.979
 simulation the team owner 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.589
 and to the square
