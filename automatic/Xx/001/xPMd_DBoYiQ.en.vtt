pregnant weeks wants to rack until mid
to<00:00:32.940> late<00:00:33.120> May<00:00:33.329> when<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.630> moved<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.079> settled<00:00:34.350> but

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
to late May when I moved and settled but

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.610 
to late May when I moved and settled but
after<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.730> point<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.570> end<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> July<00:00:37.440> or

after that point to the end of July or

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.470 
after that point to the end of July or
so<00:00:37.829> video<00:00:38.579> should<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> lot<00:00:38.910> more<00:00:39.149> regular

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
so video should be a lot more regular

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.049

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
slowest months for e-commerce so I

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.370 
yeah so if I could do it better right
now<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:40.090> don't<00:03:40.240> have<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.750> do<00:03:40.990> it<00:03:41.110> it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
now I don't have this have to do it it

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.990 
now I don't have this have to do it it
spins<00:03:41.740> quite<00:03:41.980> well<00:03:42.250> not<00:03:42.460> as<00:03:42.580> much<00:03:42.700> friction

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
spins quite well not as much friction

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.350 
spins quite well not as much friction
and<00:03:43.300> stuff<00:03:43.480> on<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.170> stadium<00:03:45.040> floor<00:03:45.460> as<00:03:45.850> the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
and stuff on the stadium floor as the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.660 
and stuff on the stadium floor as the
plastic<00:03:46.840> cores<00:03:47.290> do<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.250> can<00:03:48.340> spin<00:03:48.490> a<00:03:48.580> lot

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
plastic cores do so it can spin a lot

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.910 
plastic cores do so it can spin a lot
more<00:03:48.820> easily

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
more easily

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.710 
more easily
there<00:03:51.460> you<00:03:51.550> go<00:03:51.880> even<00:03:52.120> though<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.210> Bank<00:03:52.450> off<00:03:52.600> the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
there you go even though I Bank off the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.510 
there you go even though I Bank off the
wall<00:03:52.870> it's<00:03:52.990> doing<00:03:53.200> pretty<00:03:53.319> well<00:03:53.410> there<00:03:53.710> there

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
wall it's doing pretty well there there

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.980 
wall it's doing pretty well there there
is<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.640> much<00:03:54.850> better<00:03:55.000> example<00:03:55.270> of<00:03:55.630> how<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.870> can

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
is a much better example of how it can

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.800 
is a much better example of how it can
spin<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.920> if<00:03:57.459> you're<00:03:57.670> using<00:03:58.030> Twitter<00:03:58.240> wasn't

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
spin and if you're using Twitter wasn't

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.850 
spin and if you're using Twitter wasn't
it<00:03:58.870> contact<00:03:59.290> they're<00:03:59.410> pretty<00:03:59.560> much<00:03:59.620> done

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
it contact they're pretty much done

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.470 
it contact they're pretty much done
spinning<00:04:00.310> they<00:04:00.459> don't<00:04:00.610> really<00:04:00.819> go<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.360> go

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
spinning they don't really go and go

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.600 
spinning they don't really go and go
like<00:04:01.660> beyblades<00:04:02.050> too<00:04:02.260> but<00:04:02.590> that's<00:04:03.340> beside<00:04:03.580> the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
like beyblades too but that's beside the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.020 
like beyblades too but that's beside the
point

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
point

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.150 
point
maybe<00:04:04.959> I'll<00:04:05.080> try<00:04:05.200> using<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.680> stadium<00:04:05.950> for<00:04:06.130> a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
maybe I'll try using the stadium for a

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.800 
maybe I'll try using the stadium for a
bail<00:04:06.310> bail<00:04:06.550> at<00:04:06.700> some<00:04:06.850> point<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.090> bit<00:04:07.270> my<00:04:07.480> babies

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
bail bail at some point I bit my babies

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.449 
bail bail at some point I bit my babies
24/7<00:04:08.350> channels<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.709> see<00:04:08.830> how<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:09.040> works<00:04:09.250> out

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
24/7 channels to see how that works out

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.330 
24/7 channels to see how that works out
but<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:10.290> that's<00:04:11.290> good<00:04:11.500> for<00:04:11.709> what's<00:04:11.950> designed<00:04:12.250> to

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
but I that's good for what's designed to

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.960 
but I that's good for what's designed to
do<00:04:12.490> two<00:04:12.760> people<00:04:13.240> can<00:04:13.510> launch<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.800> laws<00:04:15.760> you

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
do two people can launch in so laws you

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.240 
do two people can launch in so laws you
don't<00:04:16.150> want<00:04:16.329> it<00:04:16.510> straight<00:04:16.989> out<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.320> miss<00:04:17.980> your

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
don't want it straight out and miss your

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.009 
don't want it straight out and miss your
point<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:18.880> can<00:04:19.000> work<00:04:19.120> pretty<00:04:19.299> well<00:04:19.390> but

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
point it can work pretty well but

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.960 
point it can work pretty well but
anyways<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.220> our<00:04:21.340> look<00:04:21.549> at<00:04:21.790> the

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
anyways that is our look at the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.780 
anyways that is our look at the
