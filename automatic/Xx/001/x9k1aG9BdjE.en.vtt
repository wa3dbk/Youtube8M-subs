 Thanks to Philip for the SimBoy subtitles 

00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:13.483
 You, Alice 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.894
 Yes, as I told you, you do not remember me, 

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:23.282
 Remember. No, I do not remember anything from before I was kidnapped 

00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:28.131
 I do not even know how it happened to me. I do not even know if it's my real name 

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:32.587
 This is your real name! I know what, how do you know? 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.116
 Because we were the best friends since kindergarten. I remember you 

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:39.471
 I thought ... I thought you were dead 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.832
 ?what 

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:45.681
 Yes, I can not believe how long I have not seen you 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.675
 Alicia 

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:22.331
 Yes sir, where were you? 

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:23.948
 Didn 't you hear me call you? 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.394
 And where is Hugo's prisoner? 

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:30.591
 She's got a stomachache here 

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:32.193
 ?you are fine 

00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:35.814
 Yes, you do not really want to know. Girls' affairs 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:40.461
 Okay, I'll leave you here. Come to me when you finish - fast 

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:41.162
 .Do not worry 

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.750
 I must go, but we must meet again 

00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:50.785
 You must tell me what happened 

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.389
 You must tell me everything 

00:01:52.938 --> 00:01:55.530
 Everything I went through. Who 's my family? 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.402
 How did I get here, okay, 

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:02.678
 Just say you owe the bathroom and every time I come 

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:04.845
 OK, okay, no problem 

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:14.014
 "Calm down, what do you have? 

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:16.718
 I 'm still in this place. Let me out already 

00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:21.362
 You have no right to shout at me. If you already have the right to imprison me - 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.289
 I have, sure I have, have you forgotten? 

00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:26.147
 I am the God of the earth 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.355
 Well, this thing was real - I 've ever lied to you - 

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:31.837
 Just for you 

00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:38.472
 !what? What do you think you're doing Hugo, I do not love you 

00:02:38.507 --> 00:02:40.947
 Do not worry, you'll love me when we get married 

00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:44.194
 I do not want to marry you, I'm married 

00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:46.167
 The white man who died 

00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:48.688
 You had to mention it 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.724
 Do not be sad, tomorrow we 're getting married 

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:55.965
 Oh no, what do you think? I'd rather die than marry you 

00:02:56.278 --> 00:02:58.158
 Shut up, we're getting married and that's it 

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:00.657
 You don 't want to marry someone who loves you? 

00:03:00.906 --> 00:03:02.626
 But, you're the only one I love 

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:07.233
 Hugo, it's very sweet of you, but ... I still love my mum 

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:18.508
 I do not care, we will marry, whether you like it or not, and we will get married here, and we will go to honey on earth and everything will be good and happy and you will not destroy it 

00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:30.753
 What, what are you doing here? 

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.044
 ...I am 

00:04:36.444 --> 00:04:37.282
 Stop her 

00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:47.692
 You should not have seen it 

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.183
 Hugo! What is 

00:04:50.738 --> 00:04:53.691
 What happened to Ellie and what did you do to that alien? 

00:04:54.368 --> 00:04:55.952
 She relax for another five minutes 

00:04:56.008 --> 00:04:59.890
 What? What happened to Eli? He was supposed to die at all 

00:05:00.603 --> 00:05:02.235
 There was no body, you forgot
