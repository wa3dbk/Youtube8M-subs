00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.350 
switches in wrong spot if you have one
of<00:02:14.080> those<00:02:14.610> accessories<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:16.090> need<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.330> be

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
of those accessories that need to be

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.729 
of those accessories that need to be
plugged<00:02:16.780> into<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.050> bottom<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.470> your<00:02:17.500> phone

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
plugged into the bottom of your phone

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.589 
plugged into the bottom of your phone
technically<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.849> could<00:02:18.970> probably<00:02:19.180> poke<00:02:19.450> your

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
technically you could probably poke your

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.820 
technically you could probably poke your
fall<00:02:19.810> out<00:02:19.930> through<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> bottom<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.560> use<00:02:20.709> it

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
fall out through the bottom and use it

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.720 
fall out through the bottom and use it
whenever<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.040> need<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.489> think<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
whenever you need to but I think the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.890 
whenever you need to but I think the
more<00:02:21.849> you<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> bottles<00:02:22.660> can<00:02:22.750> get

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
more you do that the bottles can get

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.440 
more you do that the bottles can get
really<00:02:23.019> stretched<00:02:23.349> out<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.670> i<00:02:24.700> don't<00:02:25.360> know<00:02:25.420> if

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
really stretched out so i don't know if

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.240 
really stretched out so i don't know if
i<00:02:25.540> would<00:02:25.599> recommend<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.230> lot<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:27.070> is

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
i would recommend that a lot but it is

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.620 
i would recommend that a lot but it is
possible<00:02:27.610> distance<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.150> sliding<00:02:28.360> for

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
possible distance is this sliding for

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.930 
possible distance is this sliding for
the<00:02:28.690> bottom<00:02:28.930> really<00:02:29.650> snug<00:02:29.920> fit

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
bother me at all sometimes when typing

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.430 
bother me at all sometimes when typing
it<00:03:58.120> does<00:03:58.300> get<00:03:58.570> kind<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.900> close<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.350> edge

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
it does get kind of a close to the edge

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.830 
it does get kind of a close to the edge
but<00:04:00.040> i'm<00:04:00.519> kind<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:00.970> i've<00:04:01.150> gotten<00:04:01.480> kind<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.690> used

leather strap right here or white okay

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.790 
leather strap right here or white okay
those<00:04:31.030> two<00:04:31.180> colors<00:04:31.360> now<00:04:32.169> with<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.380> the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
those two colors now with that the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.650 
those two colors now with that the
stitching<00:04:33.250> color<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:34.030> front<00:04:34.300> stitching

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
stitching color so this front stitching

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.090 
stitching color so this front stitching
obviously<00:04:34.990> mine<00:04:35.169> matches<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.650> case<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:35.980> you

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
obviously mine matches the case but you

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.320 
obviously mine matches the case but you
can<00:04:36.220> put<00:04:36.310> whatever<00:04:36.430> colors<00:04:36.790> you<00:04:36.880> want<00:04:37.000> i<00:04:37.180> have

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
can put whatever colors you want i have

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.320 
can put whatever colors you want i have
up<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.600> 28<00:04:38.230> stitching<00:04:39.000> different<00:04:40.000> colors<00:04:40.300> of

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
up to 28 stitching different colors of

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.990 
up to 28 stitching different colors of
stitching<00:04:40.780> that<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:40.990> can<00:04:41.110> use<00:04:41.200> on<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.680> three

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
stitching that you can use on the three

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.450 
stitching that you can use on the three
on<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.420> right<00:04:42.540> there<00:04:42.720> okay<00:04:43.530> they've<00:04:44.190> got

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
on that right there okay they've got

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.890 
on that right there okay they've got
structural<00:04:45.060> modification<00:04:45.720> with<00:04:45.810> this

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
structural modification with this

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.720 
structural modification with this
interaction<00:04:46.290> so<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:47.010> placement<00:04:47.280> of

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
interaction so this is the placement of

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.610 
interaction so this is the placement of
the<00:04:48.000> loop<00:04:48.150> for<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.390> carabiner<00:04:48.750> so<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.470> can

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
the loop for the carabiner so you can

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.420 
that's pretty expensive I like my
opinion<00:06:09.630> I<00:06:09.810> think<00:06:10.320> this<00:06:10.620> is<00:06:10.770> a<00:06:10.800> nice<00:06:11.010> case<00:06:11.250> i

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
opinion I think this is a nice case i

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.920 
opinion I think this is a nice case i
would<00:06:11.700> pay<00:06:11.790> sixty<00:06:12.060> dollars<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.419> buy<00:06:12.540> this<00:06:12.600> case

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
would pay sixty dollars to buy this case

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.170 
would pay sixty dollars to buy this case
that's<00:06:13.800> just<00:06:13.919> me<00:06:14.040> i<00:06:14.340> think<00:06:14.760> the<00:06:14.820> last<00:06:14.970> you<00:06:15.150> a

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
that's just me i think the last you a

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.210 
that's just me i think the last you a
long<00:06:15.810> time<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.260> it's<00:06:16.680> not<00:06:16.800> gonna<00:06:16.919> be<00:06:17.040> on<00:06:17.130> those

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
long time and it's not gonna be on those

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.950 
long time and it's not gonna be on those
throwaway<00:06:17.490> cases<00:06:17.970> you<00:06:18.090> use<00:06:18.450> for<00:06:18.660> like<00:06:18.750> a<00:06:18.780> month

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960

throwaway cases you use for like a month
or<00:06:19.200> even<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.979> year<00:06:20.220> i<00:06:20.280> think<00:06:20.400> this<00:06:20.580> case<00:06:20.790> will

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
or even a year i think this case will

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.240 
or even a year i think this case will
actually<00:06:21.180> really<00:06:21.360> long<00:06:21.510> time<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:23.010> you<00:06:23.070> get<00:06:23.190> to

actually really long time and you get to

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.320 
actually really long time and you get to
