city of tweak is a pretty simple tweak
this<00:04:21.409> is<00:04:21.650> called<00:04:21.950> subtle<00:04:22.520> lock<00:04:22.789> just<00:04:23.180> go<00:04:23.360> into

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
this is called subtle lock just go into

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.379 
this is called subtle lock just go into
my<00:04:23.599> lock<00:04:23.930> screen

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.679 
my lock screen
as<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.169> can<00:04:25.289> see<00:04:25.499> it<00:04:26.009> does<00:04:26.219> make<00:04:26.550> my<00:04:26.879> slider<00:04:27.360> a

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:27.689 
as you can see it does make my slider a

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.559 
as you can see it does make my slider a
lot<00:04:27.870> thinner<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.469> skinnier<00:04:29.039> as<00:04:29.249> well<00:04:29.939> as<00:04:30.150> my

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
lot thinner and skinnier as well as my

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.309 
lot thinner and skinnier as well as my
clock<00:04:31.020> which<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:31.770> really<00:04:32.550> thin<00:04:32.879> and<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.870> text

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
clock which is really thin and the text

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.529 
clock which is really thin and the text
is<00:04:34.499> a<00:04:34.560> lot<00:04:34.979> smaller<00:04:35.279> so<00:04:35.849> this<00:04:35.999> gives<00:04:36.330> a

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
is a lot smaller so this gives a

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.080 
is a lot smaller so this gives a
minimalistic<00:04:37.080> simple<00:04:37.979> and<00:04:38.189> clean<00:04:38.490> look<00:04:38.699> to

the next one is called grid lock 2.0
grid<00:04:44.969> lock<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.479> actually<00:04:46.139> one<00:04:46.289> of<00:04:46.319> the<00:04:46.529> first

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
grid lock is actually one of the first

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
city of tweets to ever come out I think

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.450 
city of tweets to ever come out I think
it<00:04:48.990> came<00:04:49.110> out<00:04:49.259> in<00:04:49.469> 2008

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460

a<00:04:50.490> really<00:04:51.330> old<00:04:51.360> cydia<00:04:51.779> tweak<00:04:51.990> so<00:04:52.590> grid<00:04:52.860> lock

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
a really old cydia tweak so grid lock

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.209 
a really old cydia tweak so grid lock
2.0<00:04:53.849> it's<00:04:54.120> upgraded<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:55.080> be<00:04:55.409> compatible<00:04:55.830> with

2.0 it's upgraded to be compatible with
iOS<00:04:56.430> 6<00:04:56.939> so<00:04:57.870> if<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.139> don't<00:04:58.379> know<00:04:58.500> what<00:04:58.710> grid

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
iOS 6 so if you don't know what grid

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.339 
iOS 6 so if you don't know what grid
lock<00:04:59.129> is<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.699> can<00:04:59.879> put<00:05:00.120> icons<00:05:00.629> anywhere<00:05:01.169> on

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
lock is you can put icons anywhere on

lock is you can put icons anywhere on
your<00:05:01.379> home<00:05:01.770> page<00:05:02.039> which<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.759> pretty<00:05:03.000> useful<00:05:03.419> if

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
your home page which is pretty useful if

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.459 
your home page which is pretty useful if
you<00:05:03.689> have<00:05:03.719> certain<00:05:04.469> themes<00:05:04.830> with<00:05:05.460> widgets<00:05:06.469> the

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
you have certain themes with widgets the

you have certain themes with widgets the
next<00:05:07.710> one<00:05:07.860> is<00:05:08.039> called<00:05:08.460> custom<00:05:09.029> grid<00:05:09.300> 2<00:05:09.719> now

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
next one is called custom grid 2 now

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.830 
next one is called custom grid 2 now
this<00:05:10.560> one<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:10.979> somehow<00:05:11.370> similar<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:12.150> gridlock

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
this one is somehow similar to gridlock

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.050 
this one is somehow similar to gridlock
but<00:05:13.289> this<00:05:13.529> tweak<00:05:13.830> allows<00:05:14.099> you<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.460> have<00:05:14.699> a

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.980 
an animated wallpaper and the great
thing<00:06:02.069> about<00:06:02.099> this<00:06:02.490> tweak<00:06:02.849> is<00:06:03.089> that<00:06:03.449> this<00:06:03.719> is

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
thing about this tweak is that this is

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.610 
thing about this tweak is that this is
free<00:06:04.620> unless<00:06:05.310> you<00:06:05.490> want<00:06:05.669> to<00:06:05.819> purchase<00:06:06.029> extra

free unless you want to purchase extra

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.679 
free unless you want to purchase extra
wallpapers<00:06:07.620> in<00:06:07.860> Cydia<00:06:08.520> so<00:06:08.969> this<00:06:09.149> is<00:06:09.419> the

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:09.689 
wallpapers in Cydia so this is the

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.329 
wallpapers in Cydia so this is the
default<00:06:10.110> wallpaper<00:06:10.560> that<00:06:10.860> it<00:06:11.009> comes<00:06:11.250> with

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:11.339 
default wallpaper that it comes with

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.360

when you download this free app or this
free<00:06:14.610> tweak<00:06:14.909> and<00:06:15.149> in<00:06:16.020> my<00:06:16.139> opinion<00:06:16.259> it's<00:06:16.680> really

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
free tweak and in my opinion it's really

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.639 
free tweak and in my opinion it's really
smooth<00:06:17.370> it<00:06:17.669> doesn't<00:06:18.029> like<00:06:18.210> my<00:06:18.539> device<00:06:18.930> as<00:06:19.349> much

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:19.649 
smooth it doesn't like my device as much

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.670 
smooth it doesn't like my device as much
as<00:06:20.009> other<00:06:20.490> Cydia<00:06:21.330> tweaks<00:06:21.689> such<00:06:22.080> as<00:06:22.319> the

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
as other Cydia tweaks such as the

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.589 
as other Cydia tweaks such as the
wallpaper<00:06:23.009> and<00:06:23.460> this<00:06:23.819> does<00:06:24.120> drain<00:06:24.479> your

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
wallpaper and this does drain your

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.600 
wallpaper and this does drain your
battery<00:06:24.960> a<00:06:25.020> bit<00:06:25.319> but<00:06:25.680> it<00:06:25.889> definitely<00:06:26.099> makes

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
battery a bit but it definitely makes

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.459 
battery a bit but it definitely makes
