elastic the ribbon that I'm using is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.689 
elastic the ribbon that I'm using is
probably<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:27.960> four<00:00:28.289> feet<00:00:28.529> long<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.580> I'm

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
probably about four feet long and I'm

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.130 
probably about four feet long and I'm
just<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.210> thread<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.810> through<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
just going to thread it through the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.200 
just going to thread it through the
elastic<00:00:31.560> until<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> ends<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
elastic until the ends are about the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.540 
elastic until the ends are about the
same<00:00:33.420> length<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.230> basically<00:00:34.800> split<00:00:35.250> in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
same length so it's basically split in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.299 
same length so it's basically split in
half<00:00:35.840> now<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:37.500> my<00:00:37.649> Topsy<00:00:38.100> tail

thicker ribbon the braid is going to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.990 
thicker ribbon the braid is going to
look<00:02:40.990> completely<00:02:41.170> different

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
curling iron and curl these ends so that

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.760 
curling iron and curl these ends so that
they<00:03:27.400> match<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.640> rest<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:28.180> her<00:03:28.360> hair
