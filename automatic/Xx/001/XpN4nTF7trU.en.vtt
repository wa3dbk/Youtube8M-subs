00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.410
 the terrible kids of the moto3 go 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.779
 strong and want to win 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.270
 in mid-race they were even in 11th 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.410
 to form the head group 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.160
 protagonists of overtaking at the limit e 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.050
 detached from thrill in pure style minutes 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.629
 to win thanks to a nice forcing in the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.970
 final was the british ryan wayne 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.980
 that with a perfect trajectory to the 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.559
 bucine managed to take those meters 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.580
 of advantage to pass without 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.809
 problems under the checkered flag 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.390
 splendid also the performance of 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.729
 Michael Coletti was a strong party 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.710
 the last to surrender to wayne touching 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:56.790
 the victory for only 8 cents of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.979
 second is confirmed at the top also 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.379
 andrea locatelli who remains in the lead 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.570
 to the general classification and has arrived 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.729
 a tenth of a second from the win is 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.360
 good at keeping a wild one behind 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.159
 Simone Mazzola quarter to end 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.620
 Roman was the protagonist of a beautiful 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.620
 comeback and only for two tenths I do not have 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.370
 could celebrate his ease in the top 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.960
 five enea bastianini 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.660
 who got behind him on the finish line 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.660
 rinaldi wright valtulini and marine 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.560
 closes in the top ten at just 3 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.450
 seconds from the leader 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.140
 from the door he too slowed down 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.140
 from tire wear 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:32.060
 the ranking was a good race 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.860
 we started back a little but i 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.900
 early says immediately of those first we have 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.300
 to recover he fought to the end 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.160
 it was really a good race I do 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.190
 compliments also to others and frank e 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.080
 so all the races are today the real thing 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.080
 it was more difficult than it could be 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.450
 seem to have made a great third place 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.360
 precisely why they have made the first 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.340
 obvious race I won and so today was 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.250
 more to earn points and not stay 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.769
 of civic friction 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.720
 pity the mash to point a little wrong 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.380
 let this race be played that 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.820
 he could go a little better 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.030
 however, I thank the staff now 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.120
 indra and the manager spider mind team 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.570
 manager yuri danish my trainers 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.290
 that are helping me and nothing there 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.290
