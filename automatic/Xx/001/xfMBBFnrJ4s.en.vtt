00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.240
 today here is 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.250
 we start with creative hands as 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.480
 Pablo commented and I already have my remover 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.640
 hand in hand so I'm going to start my 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 dear pillar good morning I already have my 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.680
 I'm not showing off to everyone 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.610
 looks at us we have this boat as the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.850
 project that I am showing is a boat 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.519
 empty silver we wash it off well 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.040
 finite and then our kit goes to 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.800
 contain all this kind of paintings and 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.149
 a special product is going to be the 1st 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.820
 to be able to apply the paint on the silver or 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.129
 in the glass or in the pet plastic for 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.860
 that we do not know what happens to run 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.780
 suddenly you paint and you find nothing 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.000
 will create life and suddenly we are 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.340
 painting our products that are zero 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.170
 porous there is no ailment and when 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.180
 trawls etc 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.460
 so with this look I can scratch 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.320
 with all the confidence in the world and it's not going 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.270
 to spend absolutely nothing the painting 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.360
 is not going to go this is the product that is 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.610
 Flame prime air although it will serve us 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.250
 for those three different surfaces the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.050
 plastic glass or metal hey and the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.240
 same includes it to my clear package 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.970
 viewpoints the thousand pesos as well as 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.539
 parades all this comes to our kit 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.920
 my mom our sponge brooch that is the 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.720
 that I'm moistening right now for your 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.850
 before we use it we have to 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 obey and remove excess moisture 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.530
 It's our one-inch sponge brooch 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.900
 the brushes in 413 of condor and in 411 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.490
 equal of condor of the toral sow 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.560
 leader and how much will it cost us 280 pesos 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.300
 very low 280 pesos and besides that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.890
 we're going to have all the paintings and everything 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.350
 we will be able to use the material 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.990
 use reuse and reuse and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.030
 reuse thank you very much of course 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.460
 then look at yourself and think 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.490
 that now I'm going to take prime and it's a 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.810
 non-toxic liquid does not smell that is something 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.310
 very good also because you can 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.470
 find in other places but they are 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.990
 toxic and with the sponge brush we are going to 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.970
 give one to two layers leaving to dry 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.220
 well between cap and cap according 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.560
 we rinse and then we will apply 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.450
 a layer of turquoise blue viatri lex 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.130
 mate and nothing else will serve us to 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.330
 these three products that I said our 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.100
 three surfaces but also for 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.300
 wood for walls where you 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.340
 you want to apply it ok clientele have 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.340
 applied on base now I'm going to take 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.120
 my brushes I'm going to moisten this 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.209
 brushes and 413 of condor and with this 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.480
 brush let's apply both bases as 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.400
 nuance first, look, I take the paint 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.590
 although I have a turquoise blue here 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 a little bit strong the color 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.730
 I'm going to extend well let's let it dry 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.410
 well between the cap and aquitaine layer would be 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.959
 the design that also the design comes in 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.450
 our team that with a suggestion not 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.160
 but good as much we as all 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.709
 those who want to paint have the best 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.569
 option to apply your favorite design is 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.000
 what will each of you ask 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.040
 designs comes already inside the kit that we 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.840
 includes all colors and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.390
 all the material comes so that what 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.120
 we can trace except the boats you can 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.190
 expand reducing mud as you want 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.590
 look at this first layer is going to be a 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.019
 little irregular but let's let 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.730
 dry well and we will apply a rise in 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.670
 dacca here I have a little more 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.290
 advance this and look as we have 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.390
 applied a second layer both in the 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.599
 hair as in the face we are going to do 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.849
 a double charge this is I'm going to load the 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.260
 base color in this case yellow skin 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.049
 acrylic 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.909
 all very happy the angular with this color 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.610
 and now on the dot high time 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.680
 excels a point I will qualify 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.209
 qualify is that I slide my brush 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.950
 see how it starts to degrade the 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.049
 color has loaded a little more 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.510
 to make it look hotter and now 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.480
 I am going to walk this gradient color 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.390
 pegadito towards the head this is going to 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.120
 create a shadow to be seen with a 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.799
 little bit more volume all our 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.229
 We are going to do this work 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.570
 exactly that is what I feel is 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.489
 very little friend the color you take a little 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.350
 of more base color and look how it 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.750
 began to integrate colors and 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.550
 we start to lower in accordance with equal wool 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.010
 visit you can give us a small 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.470
 curve so that you notice a little more and the 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.030
 blush in the same way nothing else with 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.100
 plus a little bit of this color well 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.590
 nuanced and we started to make a little 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.880
 knock to finish it 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.620
 are appearing on the screen of the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.790
 phone numbers you can dial from 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.100

 we are going now 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.940
 of this peace in a pacifying point and 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.669
 this point look I'm just going to put 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.030
 the perpendicular tip and we're going to do 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.860
 a slow turn so you do not cut 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.510
 painting and painting is no longer going to 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.760
 go down help me make him humor his 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.660
 easy detail to me I love moses 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.819

 flow and a green 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.270
 spring that is a very beautiful green 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.460
 Exactly go a little heart that already 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.930
 we had seen in a previous time the 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.360
 little eyes we are going to occupy our brush 411 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.180
 the caliber number 2 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.460
 of the brand with two the filaments are 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.379
 All these filaments are the ones that 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.080
 they will help to have a better rebound 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:32.220
 to be able to paint and the rim is about 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.220
 from this 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.610

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.120
 creaminess that we can dilute look at you 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.860
 an ojito is the most complicated wine of 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.600
 our crafts how to paint in the 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.700
 little eyes of course when we have the 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.220
 design and we can trace it but if not 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.840
 look nothing else with a stick it can be 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.370
