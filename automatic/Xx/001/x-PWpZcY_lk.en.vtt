00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.590
 you are there celestial retinue 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.740
 that says how to walk heavenly 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.950
 well last night surprised because we went out to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.650
 walk that goes to the dance and good 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.180
 we were on the route we went for a walk 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.850
 with my son they will not go for a walk 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.800
 and it does not miss in heaven or garcÃ­a what 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.850
 what did he do with a camera that 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.560
 we had but could not in my opinion 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.480
 I was too bright to do something 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.700
 purchased from model airplanes or something by 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.610
 style 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.610
 the sky was cloudy blue 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.560
 amazing 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.420
 the company is very clear and what 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.020
 It struck me in the car 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.010
 we were looking at the beginning it seemed like 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.780
 tip of some antenna 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.630
 but I noticed that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.050
 colors were silver and bright blue 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.150
 very bright 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.430
 and the antennas are red neither blue nor 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.130
 stalls 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.050
 celestial when they observed this phenomenon 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.990
 they stopped 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.409
 to see if this 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.499
 they could observe the best 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.429
 of course as curious we stopped 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:32.079
 we got off and taking with the camera 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.719
 many people stopped behind us 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:39.299
 what you had been looking at in the 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.899
 sky and had very slow movement very 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.000
 precise 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.069
 It was someone who was 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.259
 driving he did it very well 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.120
 because it was really like I was 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.520
 discontinued 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:57.220
 no it was not weird it was weird 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:03.090
 it was a slow fast movement you said 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.090
 Of course it was a big light or not 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.800
 but slow movement in the light will be 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.550
 big was big 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.550
 if it was big because to see it in 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.890
 the car what we pay attention to was 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.170
 pretty big how much longer or 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.720
 less a considerable celestial how much 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.510
 time they could observe it 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.769
 approximately 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.769
 15 10 minutes easy 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.990
 celeste I ask you a question you believe 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.330
 in this type of phenomena 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.300
 that truth has never happened to me I do not know if 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.250
 believe or not tell what I saw that called me 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.960
 very much attention did not appear something 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.420
 bought as I was just saying by this 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.970
 because we stop some kind of sound 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.630
 issued no no 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.200
 only light flashes but very 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.850
 bright something that looked very 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.850
 they really looked very cute
