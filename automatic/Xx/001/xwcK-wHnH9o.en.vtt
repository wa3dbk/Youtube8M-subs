00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.930
 and 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello every boy has come I am bless 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.130
 urban just for you know that in this 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.260
 section I always give you a choice of 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.480
 change a pokémon that is very used and 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.910
 very seen by another that is less 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.860
 known to be a little less used not 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.260
 however it means that the pokemon that 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.359
 I give of option is better than the one that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 we are replacing is not simply 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.990
 an option and that is more original today the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.090
 very used pokemon that I've wanted 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.890
 replace or try to at least give 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.989
 an option since it is very risky 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 replace this piece of pokemon this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.360
 piece of genius and never better said that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.580
 is the horus cndh because it beats because 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.949
 it's ten format I 'm not talking about normal walking 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.570
 I speak of lanús in the form of this totem 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.280
 pokemon looks very much at least me 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.989
 I crossed it a lot in the meta game and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.909
 which is a pokémon that makes very good 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.530
 physics function his empire on top of 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.449
 put traps rocks and over with 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 skill and intimidation gets you down on 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.470
 attack is a hard pokemon to crack because 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.479
 above has a large coverage of types 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.460
 and few weaken him I think that 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.030
 only the sky for four and the water 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.229
 by two you usually see this pokemon 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.329
 attacker as I said with nature 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.650
 cheerful or firm since he has an attack 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.680
 brutal 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.690
 to their states ps 89 very but that very 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.770
 well and look at the attack you have is 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.480
 brutal 145 pesos his appearance does not seem 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
 that has so much physical attack when 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.490
 he has 90 defense is very but that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.140
 very good speed 91 here for me it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.520
 it's a bit short to be a pokémon 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.500
 physical his hyper I'll have a little bit 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.400
 more speed but 91 that's a lot 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 special attack 105 and official defense 80 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.140
 decent what stands out most about him is the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.460
 attack that he has and defense life 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 It's not bad either, along with the speed 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.350
 is very good physical pokemon the sweater the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.510
 highest percentage of the role 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.820
 what it does is from physics to the super but with 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.800
 trap rocks comes out with intimidation you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.450
 lower attack by one fears back trap 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.670
 rocks and then you can make a route 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.250
 sharp an avalanche an earthquake a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.440
 disarm an anger whatever you want and from 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.470
 back they learn many attacks 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.630
 physical and good therefore find 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.130
 a good substitute for him is very but 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.190
 that very difficult but I have found 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.260
 one that looks a lot like you and can 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.330
 play the same role that is 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.560
 what interests us the substitute that I 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.390
 I tried 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.069
 andor you to this piece of genius is 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.020
 crocodile the land crocodile can 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.930
 do very but that very good function 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.940
 just like him 'I do not like you sharing a 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.700
 type that is the earth but unlike 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.780
 of the cndh howitzer eat many 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.610
 more weaknesses 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.860
 this is the weight that we have to pay to 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.950
 times for being more original to be fixed 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.069
 its stadiums ps 95 greater than the cndh 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.660
 horus totem attack 117 obviously the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.489
 great power that Landon has you are 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.610
 hard to get but I do not know either 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.160
 is short crocodile defense 80 a little 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.430
 less than the Andalusian fast totem and 91 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.530
 one point more than the special attack 65 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.019
 it is the same because it is not using and 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.330
 official defense 70 10 - logically 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.580
 they have less crocodile stats but it does 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.980
 very similar to the stats functions are 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.230
 relatively similar over also 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.360
 has intimidation ability and most 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.310
 important is that it is also commonly used 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.220
 acro tail the one of physics to the super with the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.220
 same natures cheerful or firm and for 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.620
 if he does not learn the same attacks 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.860
 that the traps rocks angry 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.470
 sharp rock earthquake disarm and 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.480
 many more attacks crocodile is 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.819
 known but logically is in less 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.650
 use that the famous orlando his totems 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.720
 for me and in my opinion I think he can 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.909
 do the same function as lanús totem 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.620
 because if you look, they are the same 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.840
 intimidation intimidation glad joy 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.370
 firm sign the same attacks if 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.190
 you want trap rocks trap rocks 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.530
 disarm disarm everything is the same only 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.030
 the andrus earn stats so guys 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.980
 I hope you liked the fruit for 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.660
 this week it was already demonstrated 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.280
 commented is a lot from here or 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.019
 I send a very strong hug I love you 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.769
 a lot and for nothing if the whole throat 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.769
 it annoys and is
