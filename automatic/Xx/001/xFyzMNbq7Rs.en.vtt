00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.019
 dear youtube friends this video 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.630
 we will talk about the difference will be 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.980
 playstation 3 slim and the new one 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:24.040
 ultra slim playstation 3 before we will talk 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.450
 of the previous slim and then from the cas 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.630
 here in front of me there is a playstation 3 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.369
 slim from 160 gb 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.050
 there are also other versions that 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:41.000
 up to 320 cities come here 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.480
 we see the disk compartment here with 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.100
 automatic entry this loan will go 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 blue ray law 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.839
 so the games are blue ray then 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.829
 obviously reads blue ray dvd movies e 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:00.100
 also of the type for music is also the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.100
 bluetooth 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.760
 below 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:10.300
 this part here are two rooms for 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.250
 the keys can be connected 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.100
 also obviously on an internal disk 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.900
 therefore there are no removable ones behind it 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.130
 I'm just here in front of the connector for the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:27.070
 key now let's try to turn 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:31.710
 behind the sockets and glass 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:35.910
 here we come the very long air intake 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.660
 here is the attack for the power supply 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:45.340
 which is this about the merger of the 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.830
 cable ends when you put it inside 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.800
 it will seem that he has not entered the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.830
 all but it's just a feeling because 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.600
 a piece of gum is left out here 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.970
 we have the old cable instead 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.340
 here we have the old cable the one with 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.160
 three colors white red and yellow that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.880
 still compatible with stones 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:18.150
 and also with play 2 here they have instead a 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:23.460
 surround cable that serves with this case 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.310
 you can connect 55 boxes of which 4 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.260
 normal and a subwoofer 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.830
 here instead we have the hdmi cable which 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:39.680
 new cable with respect to these colors e 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:42.969
 in the factors called hdmi here before hd 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.980
 and connects here and then to the TV and 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:49.989
 then the plater will have two cables one per 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.989
 power supply and one in catania 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:02.629
 this is because a 3 is the minimum size 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.120
 to be compatible with 3D e 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.269
 Now make them all compatible with the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.269
 roof 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.250
 was at 20 laps there is also the ethernet cable 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.860
 which is the cable for connection to 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.850
 internet but of course like all the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.420
 new new computers because in the end 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.460
 computer shoulder also connects away 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.120
 wifi with an internet connection 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.190
 with the router, set the connection to 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.040
 internet is very easy just put the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.000
 password and the security code and the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.000
 stone and will do everything automatically 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.850
 now 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:54.580
 now we will see the joystick though 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.290
 some of the psi with three super slim is 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.070
 the Swiss classic for three that 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.400
 they all know that he connects through 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:06.670
 very fast wireless too 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.290
 light and very bad as I don't have to 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.960

 imagine the main difference between 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.030
 slim playstation ultra slim playstation 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.850
 is the greatness facts to look at 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.320
 images and the playstation 3 slim is a lot 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.060
 smaller and obviously that too 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.120
