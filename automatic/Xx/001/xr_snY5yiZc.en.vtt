00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
I deem to probably be the best bang for

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.490 
I deem to probably be the best bang for
your<00:00:14.309> buck<00:00:14.460> overall<00:00:15.030> these<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.049> sony<00:00:16.260> MDR

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
under $20 they've proven themselves to

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.590 
under $20 they've proven themselves to
be<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:22.199> heck<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:23.279> pair<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.519> headphones<00:00:23.789> so

without much further ado let's begin

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.820 
without much further ado let's begin
with<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> review<00:00:27.410> let's<00:00:28.410> start<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.800> by

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
with the review let's start off by

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.950 
with the review let's start off by
talked<00:00:29.220> about<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> wire<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.570> headphones

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
talked about the wire the headphones

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630 
talked about the wire the headphones
have<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.199> nice<00:00:31.410> thick<00:00:31.740> four<00:00:32.040> foot<00:00:32.250> cord<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
have a nice thick four foot cord that

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
have a nice thick four foot cord that
runs<00:00:32.700> from<00:00:32.940> each<00:00:33.210> cup<00:00:33.480> separately<00:00:33.989> until

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
runs from each cup separately until

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
runs from each cup separately until
meeting<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> halfway<00:00:35.010> point<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:36.030> point<00:00:36.239> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
meeting at a halfway point the point is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.600 
meeting at a halfway point the point is
most<00:00:36.690> likely<00:00:36.989> used<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.590> prevent<00:00:37.890> tangling<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
most likely used to prevent tangling and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.160 
most likely used to prevent tangling and
if<00:00:39.000> that's<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> case<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> does<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> pretty

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
if that's the case then it does a pretty

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
if that's the case then it does a pretty
decent<00:00:40.649> job<00:00:40.680> from<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.059> cord<00:00:42.300> joins

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
decent job from there the cord joins

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.690 
decent job from there the cord joins
together<00:00:42.960> until<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.440> meet<00:00:43.680> at<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> 3.5

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
together until they meet at a 3.5

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.220 
together until they meet at a 3.5
millimeter<00:00:45.000> headphone<00:00:45.360> jack

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
millimeter headphone jack

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.170 
millimeter headphone jack
now<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.800> headphone<00:00:47.129> jack<00:00:47.399> has<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> flexible

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
now this headphone jack has a flexible

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.389 
now this headphone jack has a flexible
but<00:00:48.329> durable<00:00:48.660> rubbery<00:00:49.320> plastic<00:00:49.530> material

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
but durable rubbery plastic material

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.250 
but durable rubbery plastic material
covering<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.570> tell<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.110> it's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
covering it so you can tell that it's

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
covering it so you can tell that it's
not<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.739> collapse<00:00:52.890> anytime<00:00:53.399> soon<00:00:53.879> one

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
not going to collapse anytime soon one

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
not going to collapse anytime soon one
thing<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.960> would<00:00:55.020> say<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> dislike<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:56.039> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
thing that I would say I dislike is that

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.580 
thing that I would say I dislike is that
it<00:00:56.730> isn't<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> removable<00:00:57.570> auxilary<00:00:58.079> cord<00:00:58.440> like

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it isn't a removable auxilary cord like

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
it isn't a removable auxilary cord like
most<00:00:58.829> headphones<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.879> $20<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.570> can't

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
most headphones but for $20 I can't

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.200 
most headphones but for $20 I can't
really<00:01:00.930> complain<00:01:01.730> when<00:01:02.730> looking<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
really complain when looking at the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.880 
really complain when looking at the
headphones<00:01:03.539> themselves<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.559> tell<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
headphones themselves you can tell that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
headphones themselves you can tell that
they<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.580> bright<00:01:06.030> white<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.689> them

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
they have a really bright white to them

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.990 
they have a really bright white to them
which<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.200> love<00:01:07.409> most<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> time<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.880> have

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
which I love most of the time I have

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.670 
which I love most of the time I have
what<00:01:09.210> lighter<00:01:09.450> colors<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.200> they<00:01:10.350> stain

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
what lighter colors because they stain

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.380 
what lighter colors because they stain
easily<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> case<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.299> these

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
easily but it's not the case for these

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330 
easily but it's not the case for these
headphones<00:01:12.630> I've<00:01:13.380> taken<00:01:13.619> moderately<00:01:14.159> good

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
headphones I've taken moderately good

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.890 
headphones I've taken moderately good
care<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.119> five<00:01:15.390> months<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
care of them for about five months and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.109 
care of them for about five months and
have<00:01:16.229> yet<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.680> any<00:01:16.860> noticeable<00:01:17.250> stain<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
have yet to see any noticeable stain the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
have yet to see any noticeable stain the
headphones<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.720> plastic<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
headphones are all plastic but not a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
headphones are all plastic but not a
cheap<00:01:19.920> kind<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.670> look<00:01:20.820> fragile<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.479> that's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
cheap kind they look fragile but that's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.660 
cheap kind they look fragile but that's
not<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> case<00:01:22.439> either<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.549> I've

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
not really the case either I think I've

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.100 
not really the case either I think I've
shamefully<00:01:24.180> dropped<00:01:24.450> these<00:01:24.600> things<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
shamefully dropped these things like a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
shamefully dropped these things like a
dozen<00:01:25.560> times<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.189> still<00:01:26.220> work<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
dozen times and they still work like the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.640 
dozen times and they still work like the
day<00:01:27.150> I've<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.330> them<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.900> case<00:01:28.470> you're

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
day I've got them in case you're
