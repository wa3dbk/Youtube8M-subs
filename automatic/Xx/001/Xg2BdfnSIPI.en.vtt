00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
transfer 27 gigabytes not only take you

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030 
transfer 27 gigabytes not only take you
about<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.120> minute<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.170> means<00:03:22.380> more<00:03:22.769> data

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
about a minute so that means more data

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.120 
about a minute so that means more data
transfers<00:03:23.760> needs<00:03:24.720> more<00:03:25.080> hard<00:03:25.380> drives<00:03:25.470> yeah

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
transfers needs more hard drives yeah

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.220

the<00:03:26.700> new<00:03:26.820> specs<00:03:27.150> are<00:03:27.300> also<00:03:27.450> allowing<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.080> more

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the new specs are also allowing for more

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.080 
the new specs are also allowing for more

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.300 
compatibility with recharging energy
efficiency<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.110> know<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.590> can<00:03:31.800> maybe

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
efficiency you know so you can maybe

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.920 
efficiency you know so you can maybe
have<00:03:32.550> more<00:03:32.730> devices<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.330> are<00:03:33.480> charged<00:03:33.720> up

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
have more devices that are charged up

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.350 
have more devices that are charged up
actually<00:03:34.350> only<00:03:34.920> problem<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.489> i<00:03:35.700> don't<00:03:36.090> see

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
actually only problem is i don't see

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.150 
actually only problem is i don't see
them<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.660> any<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.989> new<00:03:37.110> apple<00:03:37.620> laptops

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
them in any of the new apple laptops

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.699 
them in any of the new apple laptops
that<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.670> got<00:03:39.300> bought<00:03:39.630> by<00:03:39.660> everyone<00:03:40.560> out

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
that just got bought by everyone out

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.610 
that just got bought by everyone out
there<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.900> maybe<00:03:42.900> there<00:03:43.200> will<00:03:43.260> be<00:03:43.320> another

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
there so maybe there will be another

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.430 
there so maybe there will be another
