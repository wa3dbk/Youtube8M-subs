00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
see if there was a lot of hackers now at

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.980 
see if there was a lot of hackers now at
that<00:01:14.310> moment<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.760> time<00:01:14.939> there<00:01:15.360> were<00:01:15.540> hackers

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that moment in time there were hackers

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
that moment in time there were hackers
there<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.710> least<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:17.400> treaters

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and there was probably others who were

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.230 
and there was probably others who were
really<00:01:19.920> bad<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:21.119> because

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
really bad because you know just because

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.340 
really bad because you know just because
somebody's<00:01:21.630> hacking<00:01:21.900> doesn't<00:01:22.140> mean<00:01:22.229> they're

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
somebody's hacking doesn't mean they're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.520 
somebody's hacking doesn't mean they're
going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.770> doing<00:01:22.950> good<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.200> ran<00:01:25.200> into<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
now this came into a couple things into

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
now this came into a couple things into
my<00:01:54.210> head<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.630> why<00:01:55.020> people<00:01:55.049> didn't<00:01:55.649> switch<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
my head of why people didn't switch to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190 
my head of why people didn't switch to
for<00:01:56.189> Delta<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.579> already<00:01:56.820> won<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.990> don't

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
for Delta one already won they don't

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.429 
for Delta one already won they don't

another<00:02:06.750> reason<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.680> people<00:02:08.160> don't<00:02:08.369> know

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
another reason to people don't know

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.410 
another reason to people don't know
about<00:02:09.330> how<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.319> install<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.459> they're<00:02:12.270> too

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
about how to install it like they're too

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.210 
about how to install it like they're too
lazy<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:13.020> guess<00:02:13.319> that's<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.860> second<00:02:14.130> reason

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
lazy I guess that's the second reason

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.860 
lazy I guess that's the second reason
they<00:02:14.489> might<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.790> too<00:02:14.940> lazy<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.330> install<00:02:15.599> for<00:02:15.810> it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
they might be too lazy to install for it

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.180 
they might be too lazy to install for it
also<00:02:16.080> won't<00:02:16.170> even<00:02:16.349> if<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.620> know<00:02:16.770> about<00:02:16.890> it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
also won't even if they know about it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.339 
also won't even if they know about it
three<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:17.940> might<00:02:18.150> be<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.750> clan<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.200> stuff

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
three they might be in a clan and stuff

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.420 
three they might be in a clan and stuff
like<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.680> already<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.069> their<00:02:20.190> server

don't want to switch out of technol gods
for<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.360> people<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.200> hack<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:29.400> could

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
for the people like to hack that could

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.100 
for the people like to hack that could
be<00:02:29.790> another<00:02:29.970> reason<00:02:30.090> people<00:02:30.569> stayed<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.930> tech

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
be another reason people stayed on tech

no anti-cheat and nothing that could go

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.600 
no anti-cheat and nothing that could go

still keep coming back which they seem
to<00:02:42.030> be<00:02:42.150> doing<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.500> that's<00:02:43.860> another<00:02:44.190> reason

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
to be doing so that's another reason

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.360 
to be doing so that's another reason
that<00:02:45.330> some<00:02:46.230> people<00:02:46.500> might<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.709> leave<00:02:46.950> techno

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that some people might not leave techno

that some people might not leave techno
gods<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.540> yeah<00:02:49.500> those<00:02:49.830> are<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> main<00:02:50.310> reasons

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
gods and yeah those are the main reasons

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.030 
gods and yeah those are the main reasons
that<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.910> thought<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.569> mean<00:02:51.750> otherwise<00:02:52.349> why

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that I thought of I mean otherwise why

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.199 
that I thought of I mean otherwise why
the<00:02:53.099> hell<00:02:53.310> would<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.459> still<00:02:53.700> play<00:02:53.849> this<00:02:54.030> oh

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
the hell would you still play this oh

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.199 
the hell would you still play this oh
there's<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.290> fifth<00:02:55.530> reason<00:02:55.799> actually<00:02:56.209> some

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
there's a fifth reason actually some

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.729 
there's a fifth reason actually some
people<00:02:57.450> cannot<00:02:57.690> play<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.140> Delta<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.530> because

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
people cannot play for Delta one because

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.370 
people cannot play for Delta one because
it<00:02:58.890> won't<00:02:59.130> let<00:02:59.220> them<00:02:59.370> connect<00:02:59.700> two<00:02:59.819> matches<00:03:00.380> it

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
it won't let them connect two matches it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.229 
it won't let them connect two matches it
won't<00:03:01.680> let<00:03:01.830> them<00:03:01.950> connect<00:03:02.310> them<00:03:02.459> it'll<00:03:02.970> keep

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
won't let them connect them it'll keep

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.970 
won't let them connect them it'll keep
saying<00:03:03.510> connects<00:03:03.750> into<00:03:03.930> online<00:03:04.230> services<00:03:04.739> or

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
saying connects into online services or

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.190 
saying connects into online services or
they<00:03:05.489> don't<00:03:05.640> know<00:03:05.760> how<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.120> bypass<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.989> steam

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
they don't know how to bypass the steam

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.400 
they don't know how to bypass the steam
check<00:03:07.500> which<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.980> very<00:03:08.610> very<00:03:08.819> simple<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.959> so

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410
