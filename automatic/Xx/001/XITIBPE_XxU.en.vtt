00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
jump off and well we're not too far away

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.630 
jump off and well we're not too far away
so<00:01:44.350> yeah<00:01:44.860> we<00:01:45.009> just<00:01:45.159> really<00:01:45.340> need<00:01:45.490> another

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
so yeah we just really need another

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.830 
so yeah we just really need another
speed<00:01:46.149> for<00:01:46.330> this<00:01:46.420> stunt

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
speed for this stunt

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.639 
speed for this stunt
here<00:01:47.289> we<00:01:47.380> go<00:01:47.590> pick<00:01:47.800> up<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.039> booster<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:49.649> of

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
here we go pick up the booster and of

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.740 
here we go pick up the booster and of
course<00:01:50.920> hit<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.280> pole<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:52.000> finger<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.420> hit

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
course hit the pole and a finger to hit

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.109 
course hit the pole and a finger to hit
a<00:01:52.869> pole<00:01:53.140> for<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.500> few<00:01:53.709> episodes<00:01:53.800> now<00:01:54.280> so<00:01:54.610> I<00:01:54.640> guess

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
a pole for a few episodes now so I guess

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.999 
a pole for a few episodes now so I guess
it<00:01:55.300> was<00:01:55.479> about<00:01:55.599> time<00:01:55.929> that<00:01:56.319> we<00:01:56.500> actually<00:01:56.649> did

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
it was about time that we actually did

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.279 
it was about time that we actually did
it<00:01:57.190> was<00:01:57.340> still<00:01:57.520> need<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.700> go<00:01:57.789> faster<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.569> it's

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
it was still need to go faster and it's

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.550 
it was still need to go faster and it's
turn<00:01:59.560> and<00:02:00.009> nope<00:02:00.819> we<00:02:01.390> keep<00:02:01.599> jumping<00:02:01.899> up<00:02:02.200> in<00:02:02.440> the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
turn and nope we keep jumping up in the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.229 
turn and nope we keep jumping up in the
end<00:02:02.709> we<00:02:02.890> need<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.069> like<00:02:03.190> avoid<00:02:03.399> that<00:02:03.940> little

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
end we need to like avoid that little

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.880 
end we need to like avoid that little
bump<00:02:04.420> somehow<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.170> it's<00:02:05.319> gonna<00:02:05.410> be<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> bit

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
bump somehow so it's gonna be a bit

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.360 
bump somehow so it's gonna be a bit
tricky

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
tricky

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.430 
tricky
new<00:02:07.490> new<00:02:07.670> new<00:02:07.700> new<00:02:09.250> that's<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.340> embarrassing

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
new new new new that's just embarrassing

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.980 
new new new new that's just embarrassing
we<00:02:12.440> came<00:02:12.680> pretty<00:02:12.890> high<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.370> time<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:14.720> we

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
we came pretty high this time but we

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.560 
we came pretty high this time but we
didn't<00:02:15.290> get<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.620> right<00:02:15.800> direction<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.580> then

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
didn't get the right direction and then

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.490 
didn't get the right direction and then
we<00:02:17.750> somehow<00:02:17.990> ended<00:02:18.410> up<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.860> tree<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
we somehow ended up in a tree and the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.530 
we somehow ended up in a tree and the
pole<00:02:24.770> again<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.550> looks<00:02:25.850> like<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.390> going

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
pole again it looks like this is going

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.150 
pole again it looks like this is going
to<00:02:26.630> be<00:02:26.750> one<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.990> those<00:02:27.050> episode<00:02:27.470> where<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.770> hit<00:02:28.130> a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
to be one of those episode where I hit a

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.940 
to be one of those episode where I hit a
pole<00:02:28.580> like<00:02:29.270> five<00:02:29.660> hundred<00:02:29.960> freakin<00:02:30.530> times

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
pole like five hundred freakin times

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.310 
pole like five hundred freakin times
anyways<00:02:31.700> let's<00:02:31.910> see<00:02:32.060> here<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.600> then<00:02:33.050> boost

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
anyways let's see here and then boost

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.000 
anyways let's see here and then boost
and<00:02:34.090> where<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.210> hell<00:02:35.390> am<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.630> going<00:02:39.010> getting

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
and where the hell am I going getting

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.850 
and where the hell am I going getting
closer<00:02:40.340> getting<00:02:40.760> closer<00:02:41.390> indeed<00:02:42.020> okay<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:42.740> I'm

closer getting closer indeed okay so I'm
not<00:02:42.950> sure<00:02:43.010> if<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.340> stunt<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.790> possible<00:02:44.390> with

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
the body so I'm gonna switch over to the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.400 
the body so I'm gonna switch over to the
ruffian<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.850> see<00:02:47.090> how<00:02:47.240> that<00:02:47.300> goes<00:02:47.450> okay<00:02:48.200> here

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
ruffian and see how that goes okay here

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.350 
ruffian and see how that goes okay here
we<00:02:48.530> go<00:02:48.560> we<00:02:48.830> are<00:02:48.890> back<00:02:49.070> with<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.400> ruffian<00:02:49.820> so

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
we go we are back with the ruffian so

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.080 
we go we are back with the ruffian so
let's<00:02:50.510> go<00:02:50.630> ahead<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:50.930> try<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.260> one<00:02:51.590> out

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
let's go ahead and try this one out

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.580 
let's go ahead and try this one out
that's<00:02:53.090> pretty<00:02:53.330> good<00:02:53.540> for<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.810> first<00:02:53.990> try<00:02:54.290> so

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
that's pretty good for the first try so

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.470 
that's pretty good for the first try so
I<00:02:54.620> think<00:02:55.190> we're<00:02:55.430> gonna<00:02:55.520> stick<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.060> ruffian

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480
