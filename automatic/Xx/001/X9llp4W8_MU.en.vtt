00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 to things that when there are steps 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.600
 and steps 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.020
 out of steps you have to wear a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.020
 little horse 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.379
 although the little horse 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.539
 yes 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.200
 but the rich 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.390
 when pressed, strength is 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.390
 what this letter does is push 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.610
 the pressure here pushes people when 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.519
 when this force like this force comes out 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.690
 direct shaft goes out there 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:48.150
 it goes out to the other axis it pushes then 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.339
 when this push and if you raise 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.220
 you lift the wheel if it is not like that with the 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.489
 you lift them and this force like 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.010
 goes straight up goes down the shaft passes 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.220
 and the axis goes up if it goes down what it does 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.760
 that force is that pushes the abyss 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.310
 the blood at the same time you push 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.040
 you raise 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.280
 almost at the same time push up the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.310
 you keep the balance 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.380
 It's difficult but that's the little horse 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.640
 already advanced 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 as the presumption 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.140
 at the same time 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.620
 Step 1 is to upload 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.130
 already the second pedaling 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.110
 the other technique 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.920
 when you upload 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.090
 come here 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.470
 if you do not go up late since this since 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.930
 you feel like I was going to stick the tire 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.119
 back here you get up a little bit of the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.640
 seat to others is for forward to 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.000
 that there is a gap where this is up 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.070
 is going to be this 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.850
 if I were sitting 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 turn when you hit your same weight you 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.820
 is going to push to appointments 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.820
 and it will bounce 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.670
 easier 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.360
 I would have been 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.110
 as it moves to hit the back 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.260
 pressures a little 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.260
 do not 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 I go with the other
