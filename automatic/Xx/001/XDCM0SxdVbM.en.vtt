kind<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.609> shows<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.150> system<00:00:27.390> I'm<00:00:27.900> gonna<00:00:28.080> pick

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
kind of shows the system I'm gonna pick

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
kind of shows the system I'm gonna pick
the<00:00:28.439> camera<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.310> second<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.789> walk

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
this that I can this plug in and run

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340 
this that I can this plug in and run
like<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.390> unbelievable

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and I want to show a couple of things

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840 
and I want to show a couple of things
about<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.780> um<00:00:52.469> yeah<00:00:53.219> I'll<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.640> over

there<00:00:53.969> okay

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
there okay

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.520 
there okay
do<00:00:55.140> these<00:00:55.370> these<00:00:56.370> actually<00:00:56.820> rotate<00:00:57.500> like<00:00:58.500> this

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
do these these actually rotate like this

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.750 
do these these actually rotate like this
here<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> I<00:01:00.239> did<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.579> have

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
here and I did that so I can I can have

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.320 
here and I did that so I can I can have
the<00:01:02.879> Sun<00:01:03.890> be<00:01:04.890> even<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.460> side<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the Sun be even on one side and it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.760 
the Sun be even on one side and it
doesn't<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.229> light<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.650> other

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
doesn't get a lot of light on the other

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.550 
doesn't get a lot of light on the other
I<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.130> spin<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.780> main<00:01:09.960> goal<00:01:09.990> there

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
I can spin it that's the main goal there

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
I can spin it that's the main goal there
with<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.000> maybe<00:01:12.000> rotate<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.630> once<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.960> day

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
with that maybe rotate it once a day

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.490 
with that maybe rotate it once a day
maybe<00:01:13.350> rotated<00:01:14.010> twice<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> day<00:01:15.290> some<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
maybe rotated twice a day some of this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.770 
maybe rotated twice a day some of this
stuff<00:01:16.770> doesn't<00:01:17.130> need<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.520> much

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
stuff doesn't need that much

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.020 
stuff doesn't need that much
especially<00:01:19.780> in<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.020> peak<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.530> summer<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
especially in the peak of the summer so

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.150 
especially in the peak of the summer so
you<00:01:22.090> can<00:01:22.270> rotate<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.290> then<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.770> winter

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
you can rotate it and then in the winter

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.740 
you can rotate it and then in the winter
it<00:01:24.820> really<00:01:25.120> doesn't<00:01:25.510> need<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.790> be<00:01:27.940> stationary

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
it really doesn't need to be stationary

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.800 
it really doesn't need to be stationary
you<00:01:28.930> can<00:01:29.140> even<00:01:29.560> flip<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.130> every<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.030> often<00:01:31.210> and

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
you can even flip it every so often and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.690 
you can even flip it every so often and
get<00:01:32.050> enough<00:01:32.290> light<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.710> even<00:01:33.460> if<00:01:33.580> you

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
get enough light on even if you

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.670 
get enough light on even if you
supplemented<00:01:34.420> some<00:01:34.630> light<00:01:34.840> on<00:01:35.020> half<00:01:35.290> of<00:01:35.470> it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
supplemented some light on half of it

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.980 
supplemented some light on half of it
that's<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.490> whole<00:01:36.610> goal<00:01:36.910> here<00:01:36.940> but<00:01:37.420> I'm<00:01:37.810> gonna

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
that's the whole goal here but I'm gonna

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.480 
that's the whole goal here but I'm gonna
kind<00:01:38.230> of<00:01:38.290> keep<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.530> camera<00:01:38.980> and<00:01:39.130> show<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.400> a

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
kind of keep the camera and show you a

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.220 
kind of keep the camera and show you a
little<00:01:39.640> bit<00:01:39.790> closer<00:01:40.060> kind<00:01:40.480> of<00:01:40.630> he's<00:01:41.020> been

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
little bit closer kind of he's been

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.040 
little bit closer kind of he's been
working<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.860> for<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.190> while<00:01:42.370> now<00:01:42.640> so<00:01:43.050> this

red<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.200> grew<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.250> other<00:01:54.340> video<00:01:54.610> it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
red I grew this in the other video it's

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.870 
red I grew this in the other video it's
just<00:01:55.570> starting<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.140> grow

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
just starting to grow

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.510 
just starting to grow
check<00:01:57.880> those<00:01:58.119> roots<00:01:58.360> out<00:01:59.040> okay<00:02:00.040> they're

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
check those roots out okay they're

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.109 
check those roots out okay they're
looking<00:02:00.820> pretty<00:02:00.850> good<00:02:01.740> they're<00:02:02.740> just<00:02:03.190> getting

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
looking pretty good they're just getting

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.460 
looking pretty good they're just getting
going<00:02:04.450> here<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.150> did<00:02:07.390> was<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.840> start<00:02:08.320> them

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
going here what I did was I start them

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.490 
going here what I did was I start them
in<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.679> half-inch<00:02:09.280> Rockville<00:02:09.759> cube<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.500> they

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
in a half-inch Rockville cube and they

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.550 
in a half-inch Rockville cube and they
just<00:02:11.920> got<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.400> roots<00:02:12.610> growing<00:02:13.080> about<00:02:14.080> three

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
just got the roots growing about three

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.520 
just got the roots growing about three
or<00:02:14.650> four<00:02:14.860> days<00:02:15.070> ago<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.600> they<00:02:16.720> bounce<00:02:16.900> back<00:02:17.110> and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
or four days ago so they bounce back and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.190 
or four days ago so they bounce back and
then<00:02:17.620> they're<00:02:17.770> ready<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.010> grow<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.640> also<00:02:19.540> got<00:02:19.959> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
then they're ready to grow I also got a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.250 
then they're ready to grow I also got a
lot<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.740> basil<00:02:21.070> growing<00:02:22.030> here<00:02:22.480> some<00:02:23.050> really

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
lot of basil growing here some really

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.680 
lot of basil growing here some really
nice<00:02:23.470> basil<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.489> they're<00:02:25.000> all<00:02:25.150> doing<00:02:25.390> real

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
nice basil and they're all doing real

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.420 
nice basil and they're all doing real
good<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:26.170> started<00:02:26.500> them<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.860> little<00:02:27.130> bit<00:02:27.250> later

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
good I started them a little bit later

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.720 
good I started them a little bit later
in<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.820> system<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.420> they're<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.720> between

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
in the system so they're in between

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.890 
in the system so they're in between
bouncing<00:02:30.730> back<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.209> I'm<00:02:31.300> gonna<00:02:31.420> I'm<00:02:31.750> gonna

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
bouncing back and I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.259 
bouncing back and I'm gonna I'm gonna
actually<00:02:32.170> trim<00:02:32.739> these<00:02:33.070> tops<00:02:33.459> off<00:02:33.730> here<00:02:34.060> pretty

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
actually trim these tops off here pretty

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.370 
actually trim these tops off here pretty
soon<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:36.209> they<00:02:37.209> just<00:02:37.450> kind<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.750> encourage<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
soon so they just kind of encourage a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.979 
soon so they just kind of encourage a
little<00:02:38.530> bit<00:02:38.739> more<00:02:38.950> stocky<00:02:39.370> growth<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:40.150> also

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
little bit more stocky growth I also

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.080 
little bit more stocky growth I also
have<00:02:42.030> some<00:02:43.030> nice<00:02:43.239> charred<00:02:43.690> going<00:02:44.080> here

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
have some nice charred going here

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.580 
have some nice charred going here
right<00:02:46.660> up<00:02:46.870> here<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.730> kind<00:02:49.270> of<00:02:49.330> all<00:02:49.510> around<00:02:49.660> but

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
right up here and kind of all around but

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.710 
right up here and kind of all around but
I<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:51.010> want<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.280> get<00:02:51.430> touch<00:02:51.730> base<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.300> this

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
I really want to get touch base on this

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.400 
I really want to get touch base on this
lettuce<00:02:53.290> here<00:02:53.770> this<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> nice<00:02:55.540> variety<00:02:55.780> that

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
lettuce here this is a nice variety that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.360 
lettuce here this is a nice variety that
seems<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.010> be<00:02:57.069> working<00:02:57.280> really<00:02:57.580> good<00:02:57.989> it's

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
seems to be working really good it's

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.259 
seems to be working really good it's
tighten<00:03:00.370> enough<00:03:00.610> now<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.400> see<00:03:03.640> there<00:03:03.940> it's

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
tighten enough now as you see there it's

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.800 
tighten enough now as you see there it's
starting<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.830> really<00:03:06.120> turn<00:03:07.120> its<00:03:07.300> head<00:03:07.480> here

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
starting to really turn its head here

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.809 
starting to really turn its head here
what<00:03:08.290> I'm<00:03:08.380> doing<00:03:08.680> is<00:03:08.800> I'm<00:03:08.950> coming<00:03:09.130> through<00:03:09.430> and

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
what I'm doing is I'm coming through and

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.870 
what I'm doing is I'm coming through and
I'm<00:03:10.420> just<00:03:10.690> pinching<00:03:11.069> these<00:03:12.069> off<00:03:12.340> maybe<00:03:12.670> making

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
I'm just pinching these off maybe making

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.479 
I'm just pinching these off maybe making
a<00:03:13.060> salad<00:03:13.330> out<00:03:13.599> of<00:03:13.630> them<00:03:13.870> later<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:15.340> by

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
a salad out of them later but by

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.509 
a salad out of them later but by
pinching<00:03:15.940> these<00:03:16.180> these<00:03:17.080> lower<00:03:17.440> Leafs<00:03:17.769> off<00:03:18.010> you

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
pinching these these lower Leafs off you

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.789 
pinching these these lower Leafs off you
just<00:03:18.700> kind<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.000> encourage<00:03:19.450> they<00:03:20.230> had<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.530> start

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
just kind of encourage they had to start

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.890 
just kind of encourage they had to start
to<00:03:20.920> tighten<00:03:21.250> up<00:03:21.370> those<00:03:21.880> are<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.209> first<00:03:22.510> Leafs

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
to tighten up those are the first Leafs

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.610 
to tighten up those are the first Leafs
or<00:03:23.350> leaves<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.670> were<00:03:24.959> growing<00:03:25.959> on<00:03:26.080> there<00:03:26.350> so

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
or leaves that were growing on there so

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.720 
or leaves that were growing on there so
by<00:03:26.950> pinching<00:03:27.310> those<00:03:27.489> off<00:03:27.760> we<00:03:28.600> should<00:03:28.989> be<00:03:29.730> ready

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
by pinching those off we should be ready

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.970 
by pinching those off we should be ready
to<00:03:30.970> tighten<00:03:31.540> up<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.930> make<00:03:32.080> those<00:03:32.290> heads<00:03:32.590> they

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
to tighten up and make those heads they

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.650 
to tighten up and make those heads they
were<00:03:33.040> bouncing<00:03:33.580> back<00:03:33.760> from<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:35.500> starting<00:03:36.010> so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
were bouncing back from just starting so

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.660 
were bouncing back from just starting so
every<00:03:37.660> day<00:03:37.840> they're<00:03:38.049> getting<00:03:38.170> bigger<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:39.069> I'm

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
every day they're getting bigger and I'm

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.910 
every day they're getting bigger and I'm
gonna<00:03:39.790> keep<00:03:40.060> updating<00:03:40.690> daily<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:41.410> can<00:03:41.590> see

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
gonna keep updating daily so you can see

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.020 
gonna keep updating daily so you can see
how<00:03:42.610> fast<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.209> stuff<00:03:43.450> really<00:03:43.750> grossed<00:03:44.019> it

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
how fast this stuff really grossed it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.699 
how fast this stuff really grossed it
really<00:03:46.030> beats<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.630> pants<00:03:46.900> off<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.200> most

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
really beats the pants off of most

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.039 
really beats the pants off of most
drawing<00:03:48.130> systems<00:03:48.700> because<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:49.900> an

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
drawing systems because it's an

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.470 
drawing systems because it's an
aeroponic<00:03:50.470> system<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.430> mists<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.239> roots

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
aeroponic system that mists the roots

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.810 
aeroponic system that mists the roots
now<00:03:53.200> just<00:03:53.530> going<00:03:53.890> through<00:03:53.920> picking<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.609> couple

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
a couple off there you can already see

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.729 
a couple off there you can already see
that<00:03:58.359> you're<00:03:59.170> gonna<00:03:59.320> be<00:03:59.410> able<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.590> make<00:03:59.709> a

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
you know I threw a cucumber in there

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.410 
you know I threw a cucumber in there
just<00:04:03.640> as<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.819> test<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:05.100> Wow<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.549> just<00:04:06.850> it's
