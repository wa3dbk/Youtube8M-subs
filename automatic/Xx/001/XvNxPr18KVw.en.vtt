accurate Vanguard issue auto rifle

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.090 
accurate Vanguard issue auto rifle
designed<00:02:00.380> for<00:02:00.560> performance<00:02:00.710> at<00:02:01.250> long<00:02:01.490> range

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
designed for performance at long range

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.800 
designed for performance at long range
as<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.729> can<00:02:04.850> see<00:02:05.030> here<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.299> rate<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.509> fire<00:02:05.780> is

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
as you can see here the rate of fire is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.660 
as you can see here the rate of fire is
pretty<00:02:06.200> high<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:06.770> then<00:02:07.189> it's<00:02:07.340> got<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.549> to

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
pretty high and then it's got it to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.370 
pretty high and then it's got it to
impact<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.329> it's<00:02:08.450> range<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.840> low<00:02:09.079> so<00:02:09.289> that

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
impact and it's range is low so that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.400 
impact and it's range is low so that
doesn't<00:02:09.859> really<00:02:10.239> make<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.299> lot<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.600> sense<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:12.109> me

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
doesn't really make a lot of sense to me

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.289 
doesn't really make a lot of sense to me
I<00:02:12.680> would<00:02:13.160> think<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.609> range<00:02:13.850> would<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.060> about

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
I would think the range would be about

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.259 
I would think the range would be about
the<00:02:14.420> same<00:02:14.570> as<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> impact<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:16.280> maybe

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
the same as the impact there but maybe

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.400 
the same as the impact there but maybe
it's<00:02:17.600> something<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.019> can<00:02:18.200> upgrade

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's something that you can upgrade

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.590 
it's something that you can upgrade
throughout<00:02:19.040> or<00:02:19.370> something<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.000> only<00:02:20.359> see

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
throughout or something but I only see

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.270 
throughout or something but I only see
the<00:02:20.720> one<00:02:20.750> upgrade<00:02:21.049> that<00:02:21.410> only<00:02:21.560> increases<00:02:22.130> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the one upgrade that only increases the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.259 
the one upgrade that only increases the
TAC<00:02:22.549> hit<00:02:22.850> damage<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:25.000> don't<00:02:26.000> know<00:02:26.090> we'll

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
TAC hit damage so I don't know we'll

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.400 
TAC hit damage so I don't know we'll
just<00:02:26.329> have<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.690> see<00:02:26.720> maybe<00:02:27.049> they'll<00:02:27.230> make<00:02:27.380> us

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
just have to see maybe they'll make us

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.949 
just have to see maybe they'll make us
some<00:02:27.620> changes<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:29.269> when<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> game<00:02:29.780> is

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
some changes to it when the game is

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.750 
some changes to it when the game is
launched<00:02:30.440> okay<00:02:31.160> then<00:02:31.430> we're<00:02:31.549> going<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.700> go

it<00:02:56.239> slow<00:02:56.569> okay<00:02:56.840> your<00:02:57.440> aunt<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.680> pull<00:02:57.920> pull<00:02:58.760> pull

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
it slow okay your aunt to pull pull pull

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.360 
it slow okay your aunt to pull pull pull
just<00:02:59.720> going<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.930> be<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.019> timing<00:03:00.470> thing<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:01.250> its

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
just going to be a timing thing but its

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.770 
just going to be a timing thing but its
impact<00:03:01.670> damage<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:02.150> high<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.630> going<00:03:02.720> to

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
impact damage is high so it's going to

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.460 
impact damage is high so it's going to
balance<00:03:03.200> out<00:03:03.319> against<00:03:03.650> some<00:03:03.799> other<00:03:03.889> things

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
balance out against some other things

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.869 
balance out against some other things
range<00:03:06.470> is<00:03:06.620> low<00:03:06.860> obviously<00:03:07.549> this<00:03:07.700> thing

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
range is low obviously this thing

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.640 
range is low obviously this thing
doesn't<00:03:08.180> have<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.330> scope<00:03:08.629> on<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.930> or<00:03:09.140> anything

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
doesn't have a scope on it or anything

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.039 
doesn't have a scope on it or anything
stability<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.430> going<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.730> be<00:03:10.909> a<00:03:11.120> little<00:03:11.720> tough

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
stability is going to be a little tough

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.660 
stability is going to be a little tough
it's<00:03:12.260> going<00:03:12.349> to<00:03:12.439> have<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.590> lot<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.799> recoil<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.519> it

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
it's going to have a lot of recoil to it

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.309 
it's going to have a lot of recoil to it
and<00:03:13.909> at<00:03:14.090> reload<00:03:14.480> speed<00:03:14.720> is<00:03:14.870> pretty<00:03:15.079> average

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
and at reload speed is pretty average

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.850 
and at reload speed is pretty average
and<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:16.610> holds<00:03:16.730> seven<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:18.379> of<00:03:18.500> course<00:03:18.709> you

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
and it holds seven and of course you

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.830 
and it holds seven and of course you
have<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.879> upgrade<00:03:20.269> over<00:03:20.420> here<00:03:20.659> on<00:03:20.750> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
have the the upgrade over here on the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.940 
have the the upgrade over here on the
side<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.110> will<00:03:21.409> increase<00:03:21.620> its<00:03:21.860> attack<00:03:23.950> so

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
side that will increase its attack so

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.899 
side that will increase its attack so
we're<00:03:25.069> going<00:03:25.189> to<00:03:25.280> move<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.519> here<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.819> the

we're going to move on here to the

your your designated marksman rifle it's

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.660 
your your designated marksman rifle it's
got<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> low<00:03:41.720> rate<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:41.930> fire<00:03:42.230> okay<00:03:43.159> you're<00:03:43.370> just

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
got a low rate of fire okay you're just

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.849 
got a low rate of fire okay you're just
fast<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.209> can<00:03:44.359> pull<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.599> trigger<00:03:44.859> it's

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
fast so you can pull the trigger it's

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.860 
fast so you can pull the trigger it's
impacts<00:03:46.220> pretty<00:03:46.579> decent<00:03:47.060> it's<00:03:47.299> about<00:03:47.480> right

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
impacts pretty decent it's about right

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.020 
impacts pretty decent it's about right
in<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.049> middle<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.440> whole<00:03:48.760> whole<00:03:49.760> pack

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
in the middle of the whole whole pack

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.080 
in the middle of the whole whole pack
it's<00:03:50.659> ranges<00:03:51.139> up<00:03:51.290> there<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.769> mean<00:03:51.829> obviously<00:03:52.220> if

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
it's ranges up there I mean obviously if

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.210 
it's ranges up there I mean obviously if
if<00:03:53.480> you're<00:03:53.810> if<00:03:54.049> it's<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.319> one-shot<00:03:54.560> pull<00:03:55.099> as

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
if you're if it's a one-shot pull as

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.289 
if you're if it's a one-shot pull as
fast<00:03:55.430> as<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:55.609> can<00:03:55.819> you're<00:03:55.970> going<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.150> need<00:03:56.269> a

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
fast as you can you're going to need a

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.979 
fast as you can you're going to need a
little<00:03:56.480> extra<00:03:56.629> range<00:03:58.120> stability<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.389> so<00:03:59.689> I

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
little extra range stability so so I

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.929 
little extra range stability so so I
mean<00:04:00.379> it's<00:04:00.980> going<00:04:01.099> to<00:04:01.189> have<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.340> little<00:04:01.459> recoil

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
mean it's going to have a little recoil

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.460 
mean it's going to have a little recoil
to<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.329> but<00:04:02.510> it's<00:04:02.629> reload<00:04:02.930> speed<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.290> pretty

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
to it but it's reload speed is pretty

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.949 
to it but it's reload speed is pretty
high<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.060> if<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.329> empty<00:04:05.599> your<00:04:05.629> entire

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
high so if you empty your entire

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.649 
high so if you empty your entire
magazine<00:04:06.200> a13<00:04:06.980> there<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.939> have<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.150> chance<00:04:08.420> to

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
magazine a13 there you have a chance to

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.330 
magazine a13 there you have a chance to
reload<00:04:08.959> pretty<00:04:09.260> quick<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:09.709> take<00:04:09.859> on<00:04:10.040> somebody

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
reload pretty quick and take on somebody

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.520 
reload pretty quick and take on somebody
that's<00:04:10.700> bearing<00:04:11.599> down<00:04:11.750> on<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:12.139> with<00:04:12.290> this

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
that's bearing down on you with this

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.330 
that's bearing down on you with this

works<00:04:51.320> like<00:04:51.560> impact<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.669> high<00:04:52.820> i<00:04:52.849> mean<00:04:53.210> you're

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
works like impact is high i mean you're

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.540 
works like impact is high i mean you're
going<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.900> put<00:04:54.320> a<00:04:54.349> bunch<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.680> bb's<00:04:55.010> into<00:04:55.250> people

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
going to put a bunch of bb's into people

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.010 
going to put a bunch of bb's into people
but<00:04:55.699> you<00:04:55.789> can't<00:04:55.970> really<00:04:56.060> share<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.479> across<00:04:56.539> map

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
but you can't really share it across map

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.460 
but you can't really share it across map
obviously<00:04:57.680> with<00:04:57.830> its<00:04:58.010> range<00:04:59.199> its<00:05:00.199> stability

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
obviously with its range its stability

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.710 
obviously with its range its stability
actually<00:05:01.340> pretty<00:05:01.550> decent<00:05:01.789> for<00:05:02.090> a<00:05:02.240> shotgun

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
actually pretty decent for a shotgun

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.649 
actually pretty decent for a shotgun
with<00:05:02.840> recoil<00:05:03.940> i'm<00:05:04.940> kind<00:05:05.150> of<00:05:05.270> surprised

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
with recoil i'm kind of surprised

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.300 
with recoil i'm kind of surprised
stabilities<00:05:06.260> that<00:05:06.440> high<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.800> it's<00:05:06.949> reload

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
stabilities that high and it's reload

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.189 
stabilities that high and it's reload
speed<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:08.150> course<00:05:08.419> is<00:05:08.570> going<00:05:08.720> to<00:05:08.780> take<00:05:08.960> quite<00:05:09.139> a

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
speed of course is going to take quite a

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.350 
speed of course is going to take quite a
bit<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.590> just<00:05:09.770> sit<00:05:09.919> there<00:05:10.099> and<00:05:10.220> put<00:05:10.820> every

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
bit to just sit there and put every

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.570 
bit to just sit there and put every
shell<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:12.020> at<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.530> time<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.130> of<00:05:13.220> course<00:05:13.400> it's

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
shell in at a time and of course it's

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.570 
shell in at a time and of course it's
only<00:05:13.789> for<00:05:14.030> four<00:05:14.930> shots<00:05:15.260> but<00:05:16.389> you<00:05:17.389> have<00:05:17.570> your

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
only for four shots but you have your

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.249 
only for four shots but you have your
upgrade<00:05:19.580> over<00:05:19.729> here<00:05:19.969> to<00:05:20.120> increase<00:05:20.419> its<00:05:20.570> attack

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
upgrade over here to increase its attack

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.080 
upgrade over here to increase its attack
and<00:05:23.259> then<00:05:23.349> we<00:05:23.470> go<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:25.860> 1309<00:05:26.860> AV<00:05:27.340> incognito

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
rate of fire is low I mean you got to

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.980 
rate of fire is low I mean you got to
take<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.560> time<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:47.949> fire<00:05:48.630> flip<00:05:49.630> out<00:05:49.780> that

take the time to fire flip out that

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.719 
take the time to fire flip out that
she'll<00:05:50.340> then<00:05:51.340> its<00:05:51.580> impact<00:05:52.060> is<00:05:53.729> surprisingly

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
she'll then its impact is surprisingly

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.260 
she'll then its impact is surprisingly
low<00:05:55.030> as<00:05:55.210> well<00:05:55.509> that<00:05:55.840> kind<00:05:56.080> of<00:05:56.909> that<00:05:57.909> kind<00:05:58.090> of

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
low as well that kind of that kind of

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.899 
low as well that kind of that kind of
like<00:05:58.509> I<00:05:58.810> don't<00:05:59.620> know<00:05:59.830> for<00:06:00.130> a<00:06:00.190> sniper<00:06:00.430> rifle<00:06:00.580> I

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
like I don't know for a sniper rifle I

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:01.920 
like I don't know for a sniper rifle I
would<00:06:01.060> think<00:06:01.180> you<00:06:01.330> would<00:06:01.419> be<00:06:01.509> a<00:06:01.539> little<00:06:01.750> more

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
would think you would be a little more

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.620 
would think you would be a little more
powerful<00:06:02.610> but<00:06:03.610> it's<00:06:03.729> range<00:06:03.940> is<00:06:04.090> high<00:06:04.330> of

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
powerful but it's range is high of

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.659 
powerful but it's range is high of
course<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.470> its<00:06:05.770> stability<00:06:05.919> is<00:06:06.400> pretty

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
course and its stability is pretty

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.999 
course and its stability is pretty
decent<00:06:06.880> and<00:06:07.330> three<00:06:08.020> load<00:06:08.229> speed<00:06:08.530> is<00:06:08.770> pretty

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
decent and three load speed is pretty

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.730 
decent and three load speed is pretty
fast<00:06:09.370> as<00:06:09.669> well<00:06:10.569> I<00:06:10.630> mean<00:06:10.870> you<00:06:10.990> pop<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.319> magazine
