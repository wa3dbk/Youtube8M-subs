00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
they have to prime it then they have to

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.680 
they have to prime it then they have to
paint<00:04:17.709> it<00:04:17.890> of<00:04:18.669> course<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.000> have<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.120> frame<00:04:19.480> in

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
paint it of course you have to frame in

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.800 
paint it of course you have to frame in
a<00:04:19.810> door<00:04:20.080> so<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.530> can<00:04:20.770> get<00:04:20.919> in<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.190> out<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.669> then
