00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.490 
tighten up what is a leaf spring behind
here<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.250> does<00:00:56.520> affect<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> tension<00:00:57.809> but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
here and it does affect the tension but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.189 
here and it does affect the tension but
it's<00:00:59.250> my<00:00:59.520> beliefs<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.239> affects<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.930> by

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
it's my beliefs that affects it by

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.500 
it's my beliefs that affects it by
changing<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.280> speed<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.090> which<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
changing the speed with which the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
changing the speed with which the
tension<00:01:03.989> pulley<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.559> move<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.549> not

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
tension pulley can move it's not

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.120 
tension pulley can move it's not
exerting<00:01:06.390> more<00:01:06.750> tension<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> thread<00:01:07.560> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
exerting more tension on the thread so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.120 
exerting more tension on the thread so
from<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> spool<00:01:09.540> pin<00:01:09.680> through<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> thread

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.330 
from the spool pin through the thread
check<00:01:11.570> around<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.080> tension<00:01:13.350> pulley<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
check around the tension pulley one and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.600 
check around the tension pulley one and
a<00:01:14.400> half<00:01:14.640> times<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.869> my<00:01:16.170> manual<00:01:16.770> mentions

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
a half times now my manual mentions

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
a half times now my manual mentions
another<00:01:18.270> piece<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.590> doesn't<00:01:19.950> exist

another piece here which doesn't exist
on<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.850> machine<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.409> makes<00:01:22.680> me<00:01:22.890> think

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
on this machine so that makes me think

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.090 
on this machine so that makes me think
there's<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.820> than<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> these<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.890> will

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
there's more than one of these it will

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.039 
there's more than one of these it will
go<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.820> through<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.600> take-up<00:01:28.430> arm<00:01:30.049> you'll

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
go here through the take-up arm you'll

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.469 
go here through the take-up arm you'll
see<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> thread<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.610> come<00:01:32.850> back

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
see that then the thread will come back

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.620

doesn't look like the one in the manual
it<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.290> drops<00:01:46.560> straight<00:01:46.950> down<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
here where the thread lays and then it

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.350 
here where the thread lays and then it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
will thread from right to left so let's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
will thread from right to left so let's
have<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> look<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.640> when<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.820> thread<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
have a look at that when you thread it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
have a look at that when you thread it
you<00:02:03.840> need<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> pull<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> fair<00:02:05.219> amount<00:02:05.340> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you need to pull out a fair amount of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.260 
you need to pull out a fair amount of
thread<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.090> start<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.799> I<00:02:07.799> explain<00:02:08.520> why<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:09.090> we

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
thread to start with I explain why as we

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.740 
thread to start with I explain why as we
go<00:02:09.420> along<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:11.099> through<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.000> thread<00:02:12.360> check

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
go along so through the thread check

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.750 
go along so through the thread check
there

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:25.160 
there
around<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.270> tension<00:02:15.540> pulley<00:02:20.750> once<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:24.170> again

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
around the tension pulley once and again

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.980 
around the tension pulley once and again
another<00:02:25.620> half<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.430> time<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:29.540> we've<00:02:30.540> got<00:02:30.840> to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
another half of a time then we've got to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.290 
another half of a time then we've got to
go<00:02:31.170> through<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.250> take-up<00:02:32.580> lever<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.090> in

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
go through the take-up lever which is in

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.420 
go through the take-up lever which is in
two<00:02:36.750> pieces<00:02:37.230> which<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.440> can't<00:02:37.800> see<00:02:37.920> from<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
two pieces which you can't see from the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.550 
two pieces which you can't see from the
front<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.690> tell<00:02:39.990> by<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
front but you can tell by it it's the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.410 
front but you can tell by it it's the
fact<00:02:40.740> making<00:02:41.550> sure<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.940> don't<00:02:42.060> lose

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
fact making sure that you don't lose

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.690 
fact making sure that you don't lose
that<00:02:42.450> extra<00:02:43.080> half<00:02:43.410> turn<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> tension

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that extra half turn on the tension

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.740 
that extra half turn on the tension
pulley<00:02:46.130> then<00:02:47.130> through<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> pigtail<00:02:48.360> thread

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
pulley then through the pigtail thread

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.550 
pulley then through the pigtail thread
guide<00:02:49.850> then<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.360> had<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.750> guess<00:02:51.990> on<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.500> one

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
guide then I had to guess on this one

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.380 
guide then I had to guess on this one
since<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.190> don't<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.580> picture<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.240> my

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
since I don't have a picture of it in my

since I don't have a picture of it in my
manual<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.410> my<00:02:55.860> guess<00:02:56.100> has<00:02:56.340> worked<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.910> thread

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
up just so that I can get the thread

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.580 
up just so that I can get the thread
through<00:03:07.470> there<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.510> push<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.020> down<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.410> that

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
through there and I push it down in that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.070 
through there and I push it down in that
slot<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.980> he<00:03:14.130> gonna<00:03:14.250> move<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.640> little<00:03:14.670> bit<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.240> I

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
slot is he gonna move a little bit and I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.080 
slot is he gonna move a little bit and I
want<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.410> mention<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.400> thread<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.760> now

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
want to mention that the thread is now

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.180 
want to mention that the thread is now
very<00:03:18.600> very<00:03:18.750> tight<00:03:19.350> going<00:03:19.800> through<00:03:20.010> this

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
very very tight going through this

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.160 
very very tight going through this
pulley<00:03:20.550> which<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.030> why<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.239> said<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.780> pull

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
pulley which is why I said to pull

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.220 
pulley which is why I said to pull
thread<00:03:22.590> off<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.970> lot<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.630> thread<00:03:24.840> off<00:03:25.019> in<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
thread off a lot of thread off in the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.960 
thread off a lot of thread off in the
beginning<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.890> didn't<00:03:26.220> pull<00:03:26.400> enough<00:03:26.730> off

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
beginning and I didn't pull enough off

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.390 
beginning and I didn't pull enough off
and<00:03:27.360> now<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.870> can't<00:03:28.410> pull<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.769> through

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
and now you can't pull that through

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.290 
and now you can't pull that through
there<00:03:29.670> it's<00:03:29.970> very<00:03:30.480> tight<00:03:31.040> but<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.489> take-up

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
there it's very tight but the take-up

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.449 
there it's very tight but the take-up
arm<00:03:33.570> seems<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.230> do<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.530> job<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.190> I'm<00:03:35.280> just

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
arm seems to do the job so I'm just

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.150 
arm seems to do the job so I'm just
gonna<00:03:35.610> pull<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.269> little<00:03:36.480> bit<00:03:36.660> more<00:03:37.160> make

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
gonna pull it out a little bit more make

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.000 
gonna pull it out a little bit more make
the<00:03:38.310> machine<00:03:38.700> move<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.450> see<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.709> I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
the machine move and you see that it I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.920 
the machine move and you see that it I
don't<00:03:41.489> know<00:03:41.730> if<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:41.910> can<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.480> tension

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
don't know if you can see the tension

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.690 
don't know if you can see the tension
pulley<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.440> rotating<00:03:44.690> as<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.980> moves<00:03:47.340> through

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
pulley is rotating as that moves through

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.840 
pulley is rotating as that moves through
so<00:03:48.060> now<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.269> have<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.840> little<00:03:49.230> bit<00:03:49.410> more<00:03:49.850> extra

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
so now I have a little bit more extra

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:59.690 
so now I have a little bit more extra
thread<00:03:51.560> okay<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.900> now<00:03:55.080> I'll<00:03:55.290> thread<00:03:55.620> it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:19.110 

from<00:04:00.700> right<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:00.940> left

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.480 

and<00:04:20.120> you'll<00:04:20.870> see<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.590> thread<00:04:21.919> has<00:04:22.190> sort

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
and you'll see that the thread has sort

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.430 
and you'll see that the thread has sort
of<00:04:22.580> just<00:04:22.849> fallen<00:04:23.389> right<00:04:23.629> into<00:04:23.990> that<00:04:24.110> groove

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
of just fallen right into that groove

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.580 
of just fallen right into that groove
right<00:04:24.650> there<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.220> that's<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.789> threading<00:04:26.330> of

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590
