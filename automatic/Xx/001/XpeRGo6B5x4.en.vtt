00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.959
 One hand of Gerkan German Champion Divorced Act 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.399
 his buildings check the contemporary architecture 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:15.099
 Reason for the Berlin Hauptbahnhof opened in 2006 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.439
 the cost of these typical traits 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.289
 it set natural 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.210
 Self-criticism ahead and 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.089
 I think that perception from the outside 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.089
 it's percent and patience 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.010
 positive as well as negative earlier 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.630
 and in my view b 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.620
 So it was from the city of Duisburg 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.410
 what is your personal 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.480
 with help on stage 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.430
 cared for the four children 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 but not included before the election critics give it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.000
 does not supply either 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.710
 that's one of them try the gestural 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.880
 that's what I call architecture every day 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.320
 architecture 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 and the cities worth living 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.190
 they would have to give away 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.340
 the wisdom of life 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.240
 I mediated in conversations 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.340
 simplistically 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.650
 Brigitte Heeke of IT 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.650
 have you a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.470
 the goals the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 I told myself Â»the council remain 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.940
 because remain unfulfilled 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.250
 You forget this dream at the same time the orientation 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.480
 Christian Eigenbetriebs 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.890
 what brings her to the stage 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.630
 the unanimity 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.630
 immediately got it 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.320
 through the community 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 So press an age 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.360
 what does a perfect day look like for you? 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.299
 Weightlifting in doubt should die someday 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.880
 were successful 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.410
 much satisfactory car overturned 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.370
 like Austria 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.270
 good feeling
