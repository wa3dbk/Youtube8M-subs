00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.260 
pen kind of sort of nine out of ten
times<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.079> fail<00:00:58.579> that<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.699> probably<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.090> one

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
times I fail that was probably just one

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.300 
times I fail that was probably just one
of<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> lucky<00:01:01.969> ones<00:01:03.589> 11<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> 10<00:01:04.979> um<00:01:07.310> yeah

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
of the lucky ones 11 out of 10 um yeah

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.640 
of the lucky ones 11 out of 10 um yeah
but<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.600> guess<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.020> could<00:01:10.170> give<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.439> real

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
but I I guess I could give it a real

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280 
but I I guess I could give it a real
quick<00:01:10.890> shot<00:01:11.159> here<00:01:11.430> um<00:01:11.810> i'll<00:01:12.810> probably<00:01:13.110> go

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
quick shot here um i'll probably go

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.620
