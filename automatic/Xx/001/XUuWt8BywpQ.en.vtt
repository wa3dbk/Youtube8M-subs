00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.639
Welcome, I'm Tasha from Michael's Chūbō.
Today's show is Chocolate Mousse Pudding.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.639
Perfect for summer, delicious when chilled
in the fridge, so I chose to share this recipe

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.960
Let's go over the ingredients.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.960
Dark chocolate
This chocolate I bought when I was in Holland.
Use something between 60 to 70%.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.870
I've been looking forward to eating this.
Instant coffee
salt

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.640
Heavy cream
sugar

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.219
vanilla essence

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.829
For ingredients and measurements, please check our Michael's Chūbō website.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.829
First, cut the chocolate into small pieces.
Stack them, like this.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.379
They're all chopped up.
Next, put this into a bowl.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.770
Add instant coffee and salt.
Set this aside for now.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.310
Next, we are preparing the heavy cream.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.200
Today I am using a 100% copper sugar pot.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.200
In here, put in heavy cream, sugar, vanilla essence.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.560
I'm heating this up on low,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.560
but if you're using a stainless steel pot at home, heat on medium.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.240
Heavy cream is either it bubbles a little or over boils,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.620
so make sure you don't leave the pot.
Keep your eye on it,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.080

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.080
when it starts to bubble a little, turn the heat off.
Like this.
Pour this over the chocolate.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.860
Don't touch and let it sit for a minute.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.730
One minute passed.
Mix gently.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.730
We are done.
Next put this into containers.
Then tap tap tap to let the air bubbles out.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.260
Put this in the fridge for at least 3 to 4 hours.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.980
3 hours have gone by and I took them out of the fridge.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.920
When they chill, they look like this.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.920
This part is optional, but I wanted to stick to the coffee theme,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.880
so I'm going to whip up the left over heavy
cream for garnish.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.190
Then sprinkle some cocoa powder on top.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.090
Chocolate mousse pudding, I'm going to try a bite.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.090
So rich and delicious!
Thanks for watching.
Enjoy!
