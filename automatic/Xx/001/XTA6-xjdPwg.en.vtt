00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.249
 simone nardicchia a woman 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.279
 you kill zombies you play in the first person 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.279
 you can't build your own weapons 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.820
 no it is not a strange death of the athlete for better a garda pin from 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.130
 mESSINA 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.610
 Restaurants 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.450
 I'm talking about you inhaling the new title of gardaland who we are at last 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.070
 managed to touch with an april + arrived here editorial 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.530
 you want to find out what awaits us in the first hours of play, well this video does 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.340
 for you 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 gmail 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 how much I would like 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.690
 we wake up on a large hotel room bed a few seconds per 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.040
 being able to orientate oneself with the initially blurred vision and then everything 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.270
 becomes clearer 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.050
 but only from the visual point of view because there are still many 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.530
 things that don't fit the interior of the last panzer resort in the paradise 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.610
 dany tropical island 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.010
 a quick glance from the vast balcony the two Calabrese figured raining from the sky 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.180
 there is definitely something wrong with the atmosphere that pervades the environment 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.780
 it seems pregnant with terrible news, impression confirmed with horror 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.630
 from the meeting with the first vacationers in a long corridor 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.210
 the dead look hey very short devoured by these individuals sweep 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.760
 via the questions it would require cd to escape 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.009
 then to me nice that you read to corn 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.880
 dexai puts on 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.670
 we are two I go 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.909
 two rai 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.749
 this happens in the first few minutes of gardaland in which we take confidence 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.490
 with the control system and I love you the first steps in the setting 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.850
 built the clan from 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.960
 for this lighters in first person to setting now 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.349
 although the setting can immediately make you think of heart for dead 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.340
 it is quite dead raising the reference, perhaps more fitting, if one looks for a meter 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.419
 comparison to describe the structure of the game 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.479
 at the beginning it is possible to choose one of the four available characters 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.950
 each characterized by different characteristics for the combat a 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.749
 own personal background 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.959
 we will be the only ones to be mysteriously immune to the infection that 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:29.999
 hit the island 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.919
 therefore we will soon find ourselves running around in the resurrected 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.729
 attempt to save the initially massed non-bungaro survivors has 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.459
 marked by zombies 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.799
 extremely open penetration 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.279
 in style being ax 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:47.609
 the multiplayer integrates itself into the single experiences proposing the possibility of 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.860
 face the game in cooperative mode 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.860
 for up to 4 players 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.779
 lol como 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:04.609
 You can activate connection while you store - the game environment what 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.919
 imposes a non-linear approach to the location of the site to reach the 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.259
 targets 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.489
 work tools and blunt objects can be used 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.769
 to fight melee with throws while firearms 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.159
 they are part of the more canonical shooter-style combat system 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.709
 person 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.359
 the system enriched by the vast possibilities of personalization 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.159
 offers 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.010
 Advancement of the game allow character evolution in terms of 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.180
 skill level the latter can be activated progressively 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.739
 through tree layouts very similar to those present in 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.739
 various role-playing games 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.439
 the most characteristic element of gardaland is probably was 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.510
 particularly being tropical if we say it as a set but survival 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.070
 horror 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.900
 the chrome engine 5 graphics engine developed by you that behaves to me 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.380
 admirably in the representation of the island in particular as regards 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.380
 the sunny exterior from the broad horizon 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.920
 there is something similar to andrea lendine in the rendering of different surfaces 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.569
 especially in the interiors where the game will prevent the occasion from being remembered 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.799
 close barks shock like modeling the mechanics of 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.059
 fighting deserves color choices 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.059
 hello hello dog 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.780
 now some attention to the anatomical construction of the characters appears evident 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.960
 in the different effects that the blows inflict on the bodies of the enemies 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.049
 the audio sector is also excellent as far as it was possible to hear 

00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:42.539
 focusing mainly on environmental noises, various dialogues in this one 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.539
 version entirely in English with Italian subtitles 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.270
 love 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.360
 does 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.139
