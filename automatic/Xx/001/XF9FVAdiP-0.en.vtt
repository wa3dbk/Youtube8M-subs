00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.780
 the successor to the ST 50 namely the posts for NEC SP 60 plasma television 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.300
 with this television you get a suit that has the 3d glasses 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 also so you get this off of mind when m darts is a lot of fun 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.480
 is because then you can draw on a plasma screen but show the photo and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 of course the necessary manuals are provided with m gerrans that prove 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.390
 namely 22 in the acquisition of television in four different sizes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.010
 50 one 55 incidents 65 after all 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.710
 and when those 42 children turned out to be under 7 centimeters thick analyst and 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.170
 the largest the 65 ins is 100 65 centimeters diagonally 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.730
 in traffic tight appearance as you are used from the pole for the plasma 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.510
 models 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.460
 with a black currant and the beautiful silver frame 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.240
 also the foot of silence is made 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.720
 and it is true that he has a people left of 10 watts with two 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.330
 front speakers that come with the five what tevez every five centimeters thin and that 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.830
 means that light is a picture hanging on the wall and then you have the side too 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.500
 a number of connections she has here so you put the bowl and interface there 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.720
 can be with smart card in to receive digital TV 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.570
 it also been a sd card 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.570
 2 dsb connections that 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.670
 every year so that means person video recording and you can therefore programs 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.550
 from TV to an external hard drive 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.890
 and it also has three HDMI connections with optical side 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.760
 connection 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.560
 at the bottom you have the component connection and also the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.299
 old logo audio connections 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.580
 the scart expires 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.030
 and here is the antenna connection and the ethernet connection but the television 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.750
 is also equipped with one of those four so you can also simply wireless on the internet 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.049
 and here you can see the points in front of the wall 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.690
 With this television is one for HD television and that means you wanted 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.119
 really super sharp 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.179
 and also those images run very smoothly thanks to the 25 because he is too 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.540
 image refresh 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.750
 well the dark scenes are also beautifully displayed thanks to the intimate place 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.879
 protest he needed and in doing so you enjoy the beautiful black is true 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.629
 of course, as a nice too much meat, 3d television is an active one 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.620
 3d tv 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.970
 and that also means that you get a pack that comes with the 3d images 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.310
 And so if you have connected to a 3D Blu Ray player you can watch these movies 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.280
 With much more depth you can now also view any program from 2D to 3D 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.669
 thanks to the 3d converter 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:34.769
 The Panasonic is also a new smart platform where you can use applications 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.049
 consult and purchase on the Viera 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.519
 and another nice thing that pans have is maier homescreen and that is 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.609
 actually a home screen where you yourself can do it a bit 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.189
 putting together, for example, a competition that you would like to attend, so that 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.060
 you can click on it quickly if you want to know more about viera connect or it 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.940
 new maes homescreen by living on the link below and that is all 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.219
 also explain this television has parts after and so you can content 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.290
 handlebar from laptop or psv connected to the home network 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.409
 m to the television itself 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.779
 of course you can operate the television with the normal operation but you can 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.960
 also with you and droid or peppel the voice 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.690
 if the four people work with enthusiasm 2 point 0 then you can just do it from the bank 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.660
 operate TV also with the emerges role if you then press that button also nice with 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.220
 give your voice a command 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.139
 to get the problems 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.799
 in the front 20 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.909
 and so you see that the volume of the television goes to 20 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.140
 farmers' union is searching the internet then you can also say that 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.510
 kohl flower 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.510
 internet 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.179
 and then you see that you have found congo on google 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:48.279
 the cake m is very nice 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:52.339
 it works via bluetooth and so I can draw on the panel if there is one 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:54.459
 for example, the pressure on the screen 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.769
 then you see that a photo came to a halt, yes, and then I can enjoy it 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.239
 For example, draw edges in blue and use the perry chain 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.789
 for example giving glasses it is of course very nice for children and there 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:09.539
 are also a lot of applications in the via flag that has meant so would be 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.919
 for this tax pen are very nice first for children 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.149
 when the television from the fff springs consumes slightly more power than 

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.499
 for example a leaked television and therefore falls in energy class c 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.239
 but in return you get worse sharp and critical responses contribute 

00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:27.289
 is on it 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.869
 well that is also true that the person has connections but most 

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:33.550
 For example, laptops that come on the market also have an HDMI 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.429
 connection and then you simply connect to the television via that connection 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.600
 when the television has smooth images and deeper black levels start in the 15th 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.509
 Round affects image refresh and the IMF with blackpool technology 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.340
 it is also true that a 3d television is and you get the active 3d glasses after 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.529
 the smart platform has improved a lot compared to the previous one 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:55.130
 years 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.169
 and my favorite you get a few spend 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.590
 who doesn't want nice kids on a plasma screen without it 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.339
 permanent 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.849
 with a big film lover and want to enjoy deep black values ​​or 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.529
 do you often watch sporting competitions with friends and you are ready quickly 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:12.520
 also just go smoothly across the screen 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.110
 Then this 3D plasma television from the pan is the People's PS 60 series is certain 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.650
 something for you boyer set the 42 there 50 and 55 or 65 is model gates on the TV 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.440
