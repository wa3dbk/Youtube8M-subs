00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.210
 welcome to Italian home cooking 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.090
 this evening's recipe is the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 castagnaccio here is the flour of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.439
 chestnuts that appropriately already 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.880
 sifted is a very simple recipe 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.800
 really made of nothing of the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.619
 Tuscan tradition 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 like all old recipes at 100,000 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.810
 variations that I propose to you are one 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.600
 of the richest 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.570
 however we start with preparing the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.360
 chestnut flour mixing it with so much 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 how much water will you need to get one 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.210
 fluid batter the dough to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.940
 texture that we like 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.120
 let's start adding if you want 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.559
 using the egg is an ingredient 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.860
 optional but in my opinion from 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.710
 castagnaccio finished a better one 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.920
 sugar texture 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.559
 other optional ingredient if you are 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.979
 of very sweet tastes add one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.729
 spoon but no more otherwise 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.369
 castagnaccio is likely to result 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.799
 really sickening because the flour of 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.109
 chestnuts has the distinction of being 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.139
 very sweet of his 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:22.619
 you see that adding place becomes 

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:25.799
 even easier to work the dough a 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.090
 this point we begin to enrich the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.429
 castagnaccio an ingredient 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.270
 the leaflets of are very traditional 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.609
 fresh rosemary the castagnaccio 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.039
 traditionally prepared from 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:43.590
 November you will say no instead from 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:47.669
 February because it is a sweet valentine 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.440
 which served to make one fall in love through 

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:51.660
 the magic of rose leaves 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.000
 marine that tied so it tells 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.340
 in legend 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.350
 to those who had cooked those who ate you 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.780
 you will say but why not since November that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.970
 chestnuts are in November and indeed 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.250
 because once everything was prepared in 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.440
 home and had to have time to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.010
 dry and then turned into 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.890
 flour 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.070
 meanwhile I am combining raisins well 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.190
 squeezed but still wet to chestnut 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:26.370
 in this way I still check one 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.320
 once the consistency even the summit is a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.150
 ingredient that the chestnut cake does not 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.670
 should miss it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.070
 practically all a teaspoon of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.800
 candied 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.480
 if you want to make it even more precious 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.560
 these obviously we do of 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.290
 distribute well in the mixture and returning 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.239
 to the things that were right in 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:58.200
 campania an intake of pine nuts e 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.270
 let's mix that last ingredient 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.760
 that should not miss the chestnut cake 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.580
 walnut kernels we choose from 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.230
 crumble to pieces with your hands 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.739
 within the dough the least 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.860
 beautiful 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.830
 we will keep the most beautiful for later 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.840
 garnish it castagnaccio we complete 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.550
 the dough of castagnaccio with a drop 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.650
 of oil the equivalent of two tablespoons is 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.510
 one of the few sweets that are prepared 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.510
 just with oil instead of butter 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.900
 tradition wanted the container 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.110
 in which the castagnaccio was cooked 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.660
 lined with wet chestnut leaves 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.290
 well overlapped squeezes 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.290
 I replaced it with one 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.659
 prosaic baking paper since I did not have 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.569
 chestnut leaves available on 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:58.150
 principle is the same now we pour the 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.319
 our compound in order to get one 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.750
 layer that is not too low because 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.959
 if the castagnaccio is too low 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.090
 it is dry from two to four fingers of 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.090
 height depending on your taste 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.340
 now let's go and decorate the chestnut cake 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.919
 using the same ingredients that 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.229
 we used to cook will be 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.110
 walnut kernels and pine nuts leaves of 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.599
 rosemary 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.280
 the important thing is that they don't sink 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:33.070
 in the dough of course this will tell 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.009
 that the consistency of castagnaccio e 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.419
 right for via castagnaccio ready for 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.490
 go into the oven 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.349
 I wonder if it will make them fall in love with the 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.349
 my husband after 25 years of marriage
