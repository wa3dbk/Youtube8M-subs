00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 let's see how clear from the figures that 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.460
 have points above 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:30.920
 for example you points and you have three less 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:30.920
 points 680 and numbers point 3.6 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:01:56.880
 winning numbers only in the 1960s and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:09.469
 it's normal 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:09.469
 thus nothing of 353 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.209
 in the following season and the edict is in 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:25.110
 study at the moment we see the time continues 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:25.110
 firm clan 34 point br gt 2003 - dose 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:03:06.940
 Imagine how the last one will be for 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:03:12.190
 Let's have numbers 03 01 2011 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:18.250
 with them they were doing solar system 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:20.280
 as the celebration of the party to learn the 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.280
 to dance 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.410
 now I understand being and risking your 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.410
