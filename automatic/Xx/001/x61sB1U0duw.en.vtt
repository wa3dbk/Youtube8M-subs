systems that I have ever seen we're

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.290 
systems that I have ever seen we're
looking<00:00:23.039> at<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> body<00:00:23.430> construction<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:24.119> have

one<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> reasons<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.119> gun<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.540> fit

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
one of the reasons that this gun can fit

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
one of the reasons that this gun can fit
a<00:01:09.990> larger<00:01:10.710> sized<00:01:10.890> battery<00:01:11.250> than<00:01:11.400> your

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
a larger sized battery than your

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240 
a larger sized battery than your
standard<00:01:11.700> s<00:01:12.030> system<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.560> hinging

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
standard s system is that the hinging

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.700 
standard s system is that the hinging
system<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> completely<00:01:15.570> removed<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
system is completely removed and all you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350 
system is completely removed and all you
have<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.189> pop<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> two<00:01:17.820> locks<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
have to do is pop the two locks on the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.899 
have to do is pop the two locks on the
side<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.020> front<00:01:19.619> piece<00:01:20.009> slides<00:01:20.670> off

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
side and the front piece slides off

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.240 
side and the front piece slides off
instead<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.479> hinging<00:01:21.990> open<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.770> other<00:01:23.009> ones

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
instead of hinging open like other ones

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
instead of hinging open like other ones
so<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.150> mechanics<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so you don't have the mechanics of the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.890 
so you don't have the mechanics of the
hinge<00:01:25.280> eating<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.430> space<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.420> potential
