00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.970 
the carriage come with left and right
freely<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.120> just<00:02:11.120> getting<00:02:11.480> out<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.720> way

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
freely and just getting out of the way

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.870 
freely and just getting out of the way
there's<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.040> lot<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.280> different<00:02:13.520> ways<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.790> go

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
there's a lot of different ways to go

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.059 
there's a lot of different ways to go
and<00:02:14.000> install<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.569> but<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.770> one<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
and install it but this is one of the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.699 
and install it but this is one of the
best<00:02:16.250> ways<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.550> go<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.380> once<00:02:18.650> you

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
best ways to go in and do it so once you

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.160 
best ways to go in and do it so once you
go<00:02:18.860> ahead<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.300> push<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.630> right<00:02:20.840> you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
go ahead and push it to the right you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.290 
go ahead and push it to the right you
get<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.739> little<00:02:22.010> bracket<00:02:22.190> right<00:02:22.430> here<00:02:22.489> this

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
get this little bracket right here this

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.360 
get this little bracket right here this
bracket<00:02:23.750> will<00:02:23.780> clamp<00:02:24.319> down<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.709> hoses<00:02:25.099> and

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
bracket will clamp down on the hoses and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.009 
bracket will clamp down on the hoses and
this<00:02:25.550> back<00:02:25.760> sticky<00:02:26.180> part<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.569> what<00:02:26.780> actually

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
this back sticky part is what actually

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.860 
this back sticky part is what actually
attaches<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.010> inside<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.239> try<00:02:29.810> to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
attaches to the inside of this try to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.949 
attaches to the inside of this try to
make<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.170> face<00:02:30.319> facing<00:02:31.010> down<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.459> um<00:02:32.300> or

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
make it face facing down so um or

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.259 
make it face facing down so um or
whichever<00:02:33.230> way<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.530> want<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.099> I'm<00:02:35.060> gonna<00:02:35.180> go

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
whichever way you want so I'm gonna go

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.390 
whichever way you want so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.450> put<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.170> bracket<00:02:37.099> onto<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
ahead and put the this bracket onto the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
ahead and put the this bracket onto the
hoses<00:02:37.849> it's<00:02:38.810> gonna<00:02:38.900> click<00:02:39.230> into<00:02:39.380> place<00:02:39.590> and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
hoses it's gonna click into place and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.509 
hoses it's gonna click into place and
roughly<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.569> placement<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.519> bracket

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
roughly the placement of this bracket

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.370 
roughly the placement of this bracket
it's<00:02:43.760> going<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.000> be<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.390> little<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
it's going to be a little bit to the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.559 
it's going to be a little bit to the
left<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.010> little<00:02:46.250> arrow<00:02:46.459> right<00:02:46.700> here<00:02:46.730> so

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
left of this little arrow right here so

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.880 
left of this little arrow right here so
you<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.780> kind<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:48.049> guesstimate<00:02:48.500> or<00:02:48.650> where<00:02:48.799> it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
you can kind of guesstimate or where it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.740 
you can kind of guesstimate or where it
should<00:02:49.069> go<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:50.209> I'm<00:02:50.390> gonna<00:02:50.510> go<00:02:50.600> ahead<00:02:50.660> and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
should go so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.170 
should go so I'm gonna go ahead and
remove<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.140> off<00:02:51.850> old<00:02:52.850> tape<00:02:53.390> backing<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
remove this off old tape backing and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.110 
remove this off old tape backing and
slowly<00:02:56.709> put<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.799> into<00:02:58.069> place<00:02:58.870> right<00:02:59.870> there

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
slowly put it into place right there

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.759 
slowly put it into place right there
will<00:03:02.120> securely<00:03:02.480> hold<00:03:02.540> into<00:03:02.900> place<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:03.500> I

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
will securely hold into place but I

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.500 
will securely hold into place but I
highly<00:03:04.220> recommend<00:03:04.670> if<00:03:04.819> you<00:03:04.880> get<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.060> chance<00:03:05.420> to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
highly recommend if you get a chance to

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.089 
highly recommend if you get a chance to
put<00:03:05.630> in<00:03:05.750> backing<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.230> with<00:03:06.260> some<00:03:06.500> tape<00:03:06.709> just<00:03:06.980> in

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
put in backing it with some tape just in

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.470 
put in backing it with some tape just in
case<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:07.580> don't<00:03:07.849> want<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:08.060> thing<00:03:08.120> coming

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
case so you don't want this thing coming

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.090 
case so you don't want this thing coming
off<00:03:10.269> so<00:03:11.269> once<00:03:11.450> it's<00:03:11.600> in<00:03:11.720> place<00:03:11.959> we'll<00:03:12.739> go<00:03:12.980> ahead

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
off so once it's in place we'll go ahead

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.120 
off so once it's in place we'll go ahead
and<00:03:13.220> make<00:03:14.150> sure<00:03:14.390> there's<00:03:14.600> enough<00:03:14.690> slack<00:03:15.440> on

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
and make sure there's enough slack on

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.490 
and make sure there's enough slack on
the<00:03:17.000> tube<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.780> can<00:03:17.900> move<00:03:18.019> left<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.290> right

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
the tube so it can move left and right

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.949 
the tube so it can move left and right
but<00:03:18.829> yet<00:03:19.040> not<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.060> loose<00:03:20.269> that's<00:03:20.540> gonna<00:03:20.690> whip

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
but yet not so loose that's gonna whip

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.990 
but yet not so loose that's gonna whip
around<00:03:21.109> inside<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.709> printer<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.760> we'll<00:03:22.910> go

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
around inside the printer so we'll go

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.190 
around inside the printer so we'll go
ahead<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.209> move<00:03:23.299> this<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.660> left<00:03:26.049> right<00:03:27.049> to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
ahead and move this to the left right to

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.040 
ahead and move this to the left right to
the<00:03:27.290> right

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.420 

looks<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.230> little<00:03:31.319> bit<00:03:31.709> too<00:03:31.740> loose<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.190> I'm

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
looks a little bit too loose so I'm

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.960 
looks a little bit too loose so I'm
gonna<00:03:32.550> pull<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.940> back<00:03:33.090> over<00:03:33.120> then<00:03:34.849> push<00:03:35.849> it

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
gonna pull it back over then push it

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.089 
gonna pull it back over then push it
left<00:03:36.270> again<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.030> right<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:40.709> see<00:03:40.770> how<00:03:40.920> it's

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
left again to the right you see how it's

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.530 
left again to the right you see how it's
when<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.849> far<00:03:42.030> right<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.300> kind<00:03:42.450> of

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
when is to the far right it's kind of

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.360 
when is to the far right it's kind of
taught<00:03:42.780> that's<00:03:43.410> kind<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.739> how<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.950> want<00:03:44.220> it

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
taught that's kind of how you want it

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.180 
taught that's kind of how you want it
you<00:03:45.150> know<00:03:45.270> installed<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:46.770> once<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> do<00:03:47.160> that

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
you know installed so once you do that

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.050 
you know installed so once you do that
you<00:03:47.520> go<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.760> pressure<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:49.350> go<00:03:49.500> ahead<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.060> on

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
you go and pressure you go ahead and on

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.970 
you go and pressure you go ahead and on
top<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.420> your<00:03:51.540> ink<00:03:51.750> tanks<00:03:52.170> your<00:03:52.620> ink<00:03:52.800> tank

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
top of your ink tanks your ink tank

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.100 
top of your ink tanks your ink tank
reservoirs<00:03:53.489> there's<00:03:54.060> two<00:03:54.270> holes<00:03:54.510> one<00:03:54.870> holes

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
reservoirs there's two holes one holes

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.110 
reservoirs there's two holes one holes
for<00:03:55.350> refilling<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.489> other<00:03:56.670> hole<00:03:56.910> lists

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
for refilling and the other hole lists

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.790 
for refilling and the other hole lists
for<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.300> air<00:03:57.480> vent<00:03:57.750> hole<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.530> can<00:03:58.680> go

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
for the air vent hole so you can go

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.270 
for the air vent hole so you can go
ahead<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.099> pop<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:01.230> plug<00:04:01.620> for<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.980> air<00:04:02.100> vent

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
ahead and pop the plug for the air vent

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.979 
ahead and pop the plug for the air vent
hole

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
hole

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.479 
hole
this<00:04:03.989> allows<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.530> printer<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.250> actually

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
this allows the printer to actually

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.780 
this allows the printer to actually
crawl<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.110> cartridges<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.860> mean<00:04:08.549> I<00:04:08.670> have

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
crawl to the cartridges I mean I have

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.550 
crawl to the cartridges I mean I have
these<00:04:08.910> little<00:04:09.030> air<00:04:09.299> filters<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:10.319> are<00:04:10.380> you

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
these little air filters that are you

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.949 
these little air filters that are you
gonna<00:04:10.650> install<00:04:11.040> into<00:04:11.280> your<00:04:11.310> your<00:04:12.030> ink<00:04:12.720> tank

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
gonna install into your your ink tank

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.310 
gonna install into your your ink tank
reservoirs<00:04:14.150> if<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.209> look<00:04:15.390> at<00:04:15.480> air<00:04:15.959> filters

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
reservoirs if you look at air filters

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.199 
reservoirs if you look at air filters
there's<00:04:16.590> gonna<00:04:16.709> be<00:04:16.829> two<00:04:17.130> sides<00:04:17.430> one<00:04:17.850> side<00:04:18.060> is

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
there's gonna be two sides one side is

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.969 
there's gonna be two sides one side is
sticking<00:04:18.600> there<00:04:18.720> another<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.560> can<00:04:19.680> use<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
sticking there another you can use the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.460 
sticking there another you can use the
thicker<00:04:20.220> side<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.760> put<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.239> straight<00:04:22.109> down

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
thicker side and put it straight down

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.340 
thicker side and put it straight down
into<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.040> ink<00:04:23.190> tanks<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:24.240> I'm<00:04:24.720> not<00:04:25.050> gonna<00:04:25.169> do

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
into the ink tanks so I'm not gonna do

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.290 
into the ink tanks so I'm not gonna do
that<00:04:25.500> step<00:04:25.740> right<00:04:25.919> now<00:04:26.040> but<00:04:26.340> basically<00:04:26.970> that's

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
that step right now but basically that's

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.860 
that step right now but basically that's
how<00:04:27.510> it's<00:04:27.720> done<00:04:28.970> after<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.570> go<00:04:30.810> ahead

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
how it's done after that you go ahead

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.870 
how it's done after that you go ahead
and<00:04:31.020> press<00:04:31.139> your<00:04:31.260> ink<00:04:31.770> button<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.370> when<00:04:32.790> you

press your ink button the printer is

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.719 
press your ink button the printer is
going<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.650> go<00:04:34.740> ahead<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.010> start<00:04:35.160> charging<00:04:35.640> the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
want the ink tanks to be higher if it's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.890 
want the ink tanks to be higher if it's
higher<00:04:53.030> gravity<00:04:54.030> will<00:04:54.120> pull<00:04:54.150> down<00:04:54.449> on<00:04:54.599> the<00:04:54.690> ink

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
higher gravity will pull down on the ink

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.570 
higher gravity will pull down on the ink
and<00:04:55.169> it's<00:04:55.319> going<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.500> leak<00:04:55.710> onto<00:04:56.160> your<00:04:56.280> printer

and it's going to leak onto your printer
which<00:04:56.699> is<00:04:56.849> something<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.449> don't<00:04:57.630> want<00:05:03.410> so

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
which is something you don't want so

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.010 
which is something you don't want so

when they let it finish charging also
you<00:05:10.080> notice<00:05:10.319> on<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.770> printer<00:05:11.449> there's<00:05:12.449> a

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
you notice on this printer there's a

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.570 
you notice on this printer there's a
little<00:05:12.780> hinge<00:05:13.020> on<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.289> top<00:05:13.500> when<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.370> close

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
little hinge on the top when you close

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.809 
little hinge on the top when you close
this<00:05:14.729> lid<00:05:14.940> down<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:16.139> hinge<00:05:16.610> actually<00:05:17.610> push

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
this lid down this hinge actually push

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.070 
this lid down this hinge actually push

here this is what to text this is how

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.360 
here this is what to text this is how
the<00:05:21.960> parent<00:05:22.289> detects<00:05:22.530> whether<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.979> lid<00:05:23.220> is

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
the parent detects whether the lid is

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.210 
the parent detects whether the lid is
closed<00:05:24.300> or<00:05:24.569> open<00:05:24.960> if<00:05:25.380> it's<00:05:25.590> open<00:05:25.889> like<00:05:26.039> this

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
closed or open if it's open like this

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.790 
closed or open if it's open like this
you<00:05:26.370> won't<00:05:26.550> be<00:05:26.639> a<00:05:26.669> little<00:05:26.940> print<00:05:27.500> so<00:05:28.500> what<00:05:28.650> I've

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
you won't be a little print so what I've

done<00:05:29.130> just<00:05:29.430> so<00:05:29.909> you<00:05:30.000> can<00:05:30.120> see<00:05:30.240> how<00:05:30.360> it<00:05:30.509> prints

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
done just so you can see how it prints

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.830 
done just so you can see how it prints
is<00:05:30.960> I<00:05:31.380> folded<00:05:32.190> up<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.370> piece<00:05:32.520> of<00:05:32.550> paper<00:05:32.759> a<00:05:33.150> bunch

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
is I folded up a piece of paper a bunch

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.219 
is I folded up a piece of paper a bunch
of<00:05:33.900> times<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:35.479> basically<00:05:36.479> made<00:05:36.750> this<00:05:36.900> little

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
of times and basically made this little

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.409 
of times and basically made this little
you<00:05:37.860> know<00:05:37.889> indention<00:05:38.610> right<00:05:38.759> here<00:05:38.970> so<00:05:39.180> this

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
you know indention right here so this

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.969 
you know indention right here so this
indent<00:05:39.750> will<00:05:40.020> go<00:05:40.139> ahead<00:05:40.199> and<00:05:40.409> insert<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:40.830> into

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
indent will go ahead and insert it into

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.370 
indent will go ahead and insert it into
your<00:05:41.099> so<00:05:41.909> I'm<00:05:41.970> gonna<00:05:42.060> go<00:05:42.210> in<00:05:42.300> put<00:05:42.840> that<00:05:42.990> in<00:05:43.169> so
