00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.749 
love to pass the puck
I<00:05:45.539> recommend<00:05:46.289> the<00:05:46.439> saucer<00:05:46.860> pass<00:05:47.039> it's<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.580> bit

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
I recommend the saucer pass it's a bit

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.279 
I recommend the saucer pass it's a bit
tricky<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.210> get<00:05:48.300> down<00:05:48.509> at<00:05:48.689> first<00:05:48.870> because<00:05:49.110> you

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
tricky to get down at first because you

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.510 
tricky to get down at first because you
have<00:05:49.379> to<00:05:49.469> hold<00:05:49.620> down<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.830> RB<00:05:50.099> button<00:05:50.370> and

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
have to hold down the RB button and

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.029 
have to hold down the RB button and
manually<00:05:51.300> pass<00:05:51.539> it<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:52.080> see<00:05:52.289> that<00:05:52.439> there<00:05:52.650> but

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
manually pass it you see that there but

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.649 
manually pass it you see that there but
once<00:05:53.219> you<00:05:53.340> get<00:05:53.520> it<00:05:53.669> it's<00:05:53.789> great<00:05:54.060> for<00:05:54.360> getting

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
once you get it it's great for getting

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.659 
once you get it it's great for getting
over<00:05:54.750> computer<00:05:55.319> defenseman<00:05:55.800> sticks<00:05:56.099> and<00:05:56.279> even

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
over computer defenseman sticks and even
