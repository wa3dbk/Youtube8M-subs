00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
marauders a lot of Vikings over here and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.980 
marauders a lot of Vikings over here and
we<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> good<00:01:09.150> amount<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.420> stalker<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.900> not

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
we got a good amount of stalker it's not

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600 
we got a good amount of stalker it's not
too<00:01:10.140> many<00:01:10.350> actually<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.010> low<00:01:11.460> bow

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
too many actually so that's low bow

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
too many actually so that's low bow
stalkers<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> charge<00:01:13.260> lots

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
stalkers they have a lot of charge lots

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
stalkers they have a lot of charge lots
it<00:01:13.650> looks<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.240> five<00:01:15.240> Colossus<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:17.570> these

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it looks like five Colossus so these

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.760 
it looks like five Colossus so these
Vikings<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> outnumber

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
Vikings I think are going to outnumber

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
Vikings I think are going to outnumber
these<00:01:20.130> classes<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.729> well<00:01:20.939> well<00:01:21.390> it's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
these classes pretty well well it's

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.210 
these classes pretty well well it's
about<00:01:21.659> even<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.200> yes<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
about even right yes and we have the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.429 
about even right yes and we have the
High<00:01:23.310> Templar<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.900> depends<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.350> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
High Templar so it all depends on this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.370 
High Templar so it all depends on this
EMP<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.009> these<00:01:26.130> EMP<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> hit<00:01:26.850> well

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
EMP if these EMP is going to hit well

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.510 
EMP if these EMP is going to hit well
Kip<00:01:28.380> should<00:01:28.560> destroy<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:28.920> army<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.430> we're

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
Kip should destroy this army so we're

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
Kip should destroy this army so we're
gonna<00:01:29.610> watch<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.030> slow-mo<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> watch<00:01:30.780> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
gonna watch in slow-mo and watch this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.039 
gonna watch in slow-mo and watch this
nuke<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> taking<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> observer<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:33.930> we

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
nuke so taking out that observer here we

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.850 
nuke so taking out that observer here we
go<00:01:35.630> good<00:01:36.630> concave<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.350> by<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> lights<00:01:37.710> want

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
go good concave here by the lights want

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
go good concave here by the lights want

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
a good little in luck concave here but
the<00:01:41.520> problem<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.850> he's<00:01:42.030> not<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.420> clicking<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.899> he

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the problem is he's not a clicking I he

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.149 
the problem is he's not a clicking I he
needs<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.380> attack<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.950> he's<00:01:44.070> got

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
needs to get this attack going he's got

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.260 
needs to get this attack going he's got
good<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.549> surround<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.060> spread

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
good little surround here so he spread

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.929 
good little surround here so he spread
out<00:01:45.299> from<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.659> EMP<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.640> comes<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
out from all the EMP so here comes the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
out from all the EMP so here comes the
EMPs<00:01:48.450> doing<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:48.960> good<00:01:49.110> job<00:01:49.350> looks<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.649> he's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
EMPs doing some good job looks like he's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.170 
EMPs doing some good job looks like he's
hit<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> high<00:01:50.159> templars<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> couple<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
hit the high templars you a couple of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
hit the high templars you a couple of
energy<00:01:51.509> left<00:01:51.659> nope<00:01:51.869> all<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> energy<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.590> done

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
energy left nope all the energy is done

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.319 
energy left nope all the energy is done
on<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> high<00:01:53.070> temp<00:01:53.340> luck<00:01:53.490> actually<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.090> love

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
on the high temp luck actually they love

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.160 
on the high temp luck actually they love
energy<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.720> i<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:54.960> why<00:01:55.049> he's<00:01:55.140> not

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
energy so i don't know why he's not

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.420 
energy so i don't know why he's not
storming<00:01:55.649> now<00:01:56.479> he's<00:01:57.479> got<00:01:57.630> him<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.840> run<00:01:58.020> now

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
storming now he's got him on the run now

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.560 
storming now he's got him on the run now
we've<00:01:59.430> done<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> lot<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.850> damage<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.450> got

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
we've done a lot of damage here we got

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.120 
we've done a lot of damage here we got
some<00:02:00.719> medevac<00:02:01.020> sweet<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.469> Vikings<00:02:01.860> are<00:02:01.979> all

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
some medevac sweet the Vikings are all

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.209 
some medevac sweet the Vikings are all
still<00:02:02.399> alive<00:02:02.990> we've<00:02:03.990> killed<00:02:04.560> almost<00:02:04.829> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
still alive we've killed almost to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.950 
still alive we've killed almost to
Colossus<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:05.939> far<00:02:06.180> these<00:02:06.360> high<00:02:06.509> templar

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
Colossus so far these high templar

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770 
Colossus so far these high templar
there's<00:02:07.229> only<00:02:07.350> two<00:02:07.619> left<00:02:07.829> with<00:02:08.009> energy<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.179> Kip

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
there's only two left with energy so Kip

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.029 
there's only two left with energy so Kip
could<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.200> trouble<00:02:10.349> bigger<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.860> like

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
could be in trouble bigger but like

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.470 
could be in trouble bigger but like
right<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.280> he's<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> food<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:12.000> 180

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
right now he's one in the food about 180

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880 
right now he's one in the food about 180
807

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
807

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.190 
807
so<00:02:14.370> good<00:02:15.000> lead<00:02:15.210> here<00:02:16.640> now<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.080> where

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so good lead here now this is where

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.660 
so good lead here now this is where
things<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.560> bad

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.430 

let's<00:02:28.670> go<00:02:28.820> back<00:02:34.030> loops<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.210> land<00:02:35.510> we<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.720> 188

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
let's go back loops but land we have 188

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.220 
let's go back loops but land we have 188
food<00:02:36.800> for<00:02:37.010> Kip<00:02:37.270> he's<00:02:38.270> got<00:02:38.510> his<00:02:38.720> opponent<00:02:39.140> on

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
food for Kip he's got his opponent on

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.410 
food for Kip he's got his opponent on
the<00:02:39.350> run<00:02:39.530> Kip<00:02:40.190> look<00:02:40.730> at<00:02:40.820> look<00:02:40.940> at<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.120> force

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
the run Kip look at look at this force

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.620 
the run Kip look at look at this force
ok<00:02:41.840> this<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.620> huge<00:02:42.890> they<00:02:43.850> almost<00:02:44.180> have<00:02:44.390> full

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
ok this is huge they almost have full

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.840 
ok this is huge they almost have full
life<00:02:44.810> after<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.290> stem<00:02:45.530> living<00:02:46.370> at<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.490> low<00:02:46.670> life

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
life after the stem living at a low life

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.750 
life after the stem living at a low life
are<00:02:47.060> these<00:02:47.180> Vikings<00:02:47.720> oh<00:02:48.020> we<00:02:48.830> had<00:02:48.920> better<00:02:49.130> EMPs

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
are these Vikings oh we had better EMPs

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.700 
are these Vikings oh we had better EMPs
on<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.030> high<00:02:50.150> templar<00:02:50.630> weary<00:02:50.990> impede<00:02:51.470> them<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
on the high templar weary impede them to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.010 
on the high templar weary impede them to
stop<00:02:51.920> from<00:02:52.100> storm<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:52.640> storm<00:02:53.540> wasn't<00:02:53.690> even<00:02:53.960> a

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
stop from storm so storm wasn't even a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.410 
stop from storm so storm wasn't even a
problem<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:54.770> all<00:02:55.670> that's<00:02:55.940> left<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.240> this

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
problem here all that's left is this

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.660 
problem here all that's left is this
little<00:02:56.810> ball<00:02:56.960> of<00:02:57.110> stalkers<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.830> three

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
little ball of stalkers and three

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.850 
little ball of stalkers and three
Colossus<00:02:59.360> these<00:03:00.080> guys<00:03:00.290> would<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.740> taken

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
Colossus these guys would have taken

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.410 
Colossus these guys would have taken
them<00:03:01.100> out<00:03:01.190> held<00:03:01.490> this<00:03:01.700> would<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.060> taken<00:03:02.180> this

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
them out held this would have taken this

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.090 
them out held this would have taken this
army<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.750> without<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.230> cult<00:03:03.440> Vikings<00:03:03.830> without

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
army I without the cult Vikings without

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:18.130 
army I without the cult Vikings without
the<00:03:04.250> ghost<00:03:04.490> and<00:03:09.220> yeah<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:15.790> yeah<00:03:16.790> now<00:03:17.660> Kip<00:03:17.870> ends

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
the ghost and yeah so yeah now Kip ends

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.480 
the ghost and yeah so yeah now Kip ends
up<00:03:18.230> holding<00:03:18.380> off<00:03:18.710> for<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.950> while<00:03:19.100> but<00:03:19.310> ends<00:03:19.460> up

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
up holding off for a while but ends up

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.340 
up holding off for a while but ends up
getting<00:03:19.610> losing<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.630> he<00:03:20.750> should<00:03:20.930> talks<00:03:21.170> the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
getting losing and he should talks the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.420 
getting losing and he should talks the
opponent<00:03:21.710> at<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.890> end<00:03:22.010> which<00:03:22.130> i<00:03:22.220> think<00:03:22.280> is

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
opponent at the end which i think is

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.210 
opponent at the end which i think is
funny<00:03:22.840> let<00:03:23.840> something<00:03:24.140> like<00:03:24.290> I'm<00:03:24.590> I'd<00:03:24.740> a<00:03:24.860> nuke

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
funny let something like I'm I'd a nuke

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.950 
funny let something like I'm I'd a nuke
myself<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.820> want<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> lost<00:03:26.270> new<00:03:26.570> but<00:03:26.780> then<00:03:26.870> he

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
myself you want a lost new but then he

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.670 
myself you want a lost new but then he
rage<00:03:27.140> quit<00:03:27.760> but<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.790> pretty<00:03:29.540> funny<00:03:29.900> game<00:03:30.320> a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
rage quit but a pretty funny game a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.460 
rage quit but a pretty funny game a
pretty<00:03:31.160> pretty<00:03:31.430> amazing<00:03:31.880> nuke<00:03:32.290> he<00:03:33.290> had<00:03:33.380> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
pretty pretty amazing nuke he had the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.760 
pretty pretty amazing nuke he had the
guy<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:33.770> run<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.360> this<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.540> why<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> lot<00:03:36.710> of

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
guy on the run and this is why a lot of

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.980 
guy on the run and this is why a lot of
people<00:03:36.860> are<00:03:37.160> don't<00:03:37.490> nuke<00:03:37.760> because<00:03:38.150> they<00:03:38.720> stuck

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
people are don't nuke because they stuck

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.200 
people are don't nuke because they stuck
