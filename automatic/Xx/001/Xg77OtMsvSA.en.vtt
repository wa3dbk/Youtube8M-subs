00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 or 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.030
 no 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.639
 hello the facts i hope you go 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.889
 well 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.059
 I have a little ribbon right now 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.310
 maybe that's why in the 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.760
 video I may be less playful or 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.859
 at least I'm going to talk a little bit so 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.849
 I decided today on you 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.740
 present my skin tone routine which is 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.210
 every day so the daily that is 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.980
 much lighter than I you 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.600
 have recently introduced you actually 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.239
 have been many to ask me 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.559
 so here it is not very very long 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.210
 for sure I speak at the same time 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.809
 so it may look like we're doing this 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.239
 it is but in reality but that's 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.920
 so I invite you to continue 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.460
 look to find out what I'm doing on 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 a regular basis 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.330
 I always apply moisturizing that I 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.860
 lets penetrate a few minutes and I 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.050
 I often put a bomb on 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.000
 the student to hydrate them 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.990
 until I make up piercing 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.770
 not really lipstick so the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.020
 good even to students everyday 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.970
 for mountain makeup it's not 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.710
 very very long mutually I 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 start with applying a base I 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.700
 change quite frequently day like 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.260
 several opening at the same time then 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.210
 I do alternation and every day 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.369
 one that I really like because it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.550
 either right now it's skins proof 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.560
 of corn flakes coming so precisely 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.830
 nourish the skin at the same time so there is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.229
 a small and anti-fit effect 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.020
 g24 only wanted to cure 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.930
 so I take it about twice 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.770
 that quantity there that I'm going to put on 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.770
 my face 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.610
 in this I will use my cache 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.430
 rings that will serve me both for 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.470
 correct my dark circles but also for 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.880
 correct small imperfections that 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.520
 the players I have at the level of the face 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.400
 and the body by which I will use 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.500
 it's the mac for players and I'm going 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.990
 use actually I put the above 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.590
 lake ans and on my agent and I would 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.900
 more at the museum of art for precisely 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.660
 distributed even the color so why 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:34.550
 just put a big motor take my 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:38.330
 eyes when I apply this product there I 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.070
 go patting and I find that 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.440
 using the fingers but it allows me 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.650
 precisely to go man is exactly the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.640
 shape of my face and where that's the same 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.010
 time is that I find it warms 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.380
 the product works a lot 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.000
 Application 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.610
 I will learn a little bit and 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 I'm going to put some around my bed 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.840
 when it is urgent that I have there 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.840
 report foully time 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.519
 the amount I took was little 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.430
 near the same amount as you had 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.909
 premium shown once is expected 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.140
 for the sinkers after that I come 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:31.600
 apply a powder I took there studio 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:36.260
 fixed mac my color is c3 so 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.240
 as they say to kabuki it's 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.060
 that of everything does what he wants like 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.290
 this one of which I speak often and I 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.180
 just going to apply it to 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.630
 places where I have had him more than 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.630
 recovery 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.730
 I'm losing this alone is making a big move a 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.330
 blows daughter the one poured the f30 from home 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.150
 segment I look at it for me but I 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.750
 shows you and I'm going to apply the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.600
 color for precisely that it is equal 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.930
 everywhere when I had that for 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:19.310
 a lot at the chest 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.110
 I am I make a mini cocteau ring I 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.650
 can not it's like that but I have 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:30.710
 at sea as under their an addition the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:33.940
 huckster are at the hairline 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.530
 or your different it's going to be roughly 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.890
 what they call year to a little bit of 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.410
 cut 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:48.020
 so it's a bit of a wallaby 3 and 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:50.690
 each side and then of that I'm going 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.190
 put the gloss in the major and tuzer 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.950
 rush that is very bright for not 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.960
 to have to search precisely right in 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.430
 the thousand hours and everything I would like 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.510
 however, want a whole color 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.030
 different from what I use 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.920
 usually finally that's a 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.380
 merle china color 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.120
 her name is berry I found that 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.420
 it was appropriate for the fall so I 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.460
 suggested you show it to me I take 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:20.690
 the angle brush like this is 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:22.590
 this is the f40 from sigma oh no and I 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.450
 will put it 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.450
 at the level of green skin var morning 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:38.640
 I always had a little on the year 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:41.070
 that's why I feel if you 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.020
 find that it was not how the 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.600
 camera the demarcation much sooner 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.970
 but for example you find that 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.830
 demarcation another embodiment dropped 13 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.480
 face and noticed a bit like seeing this 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.000
 it costs and the sites to learn 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.070
 your kabuki where you pay your own there 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.790
 we just do the checks with 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:06.390
 this one to just make it more 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:08.190
 strong in real life it's very natural to 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.260
 camera I still want a big one 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.960
 demarcation 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.840
 I offer you protecting her had not 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.000
 other choice so these routine amounts 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.160
 every day I do not have much 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.670
 of time imperfections that kind of 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.320
 things 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.800
 so I'm lucky to be able to use 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.360
 less current but it's normal 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.860
 I'm doing on a base 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.260
 usual what am I maybe 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.650
 change it's going to be like huser start the 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.670
 base the bloche so it's not bad all 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.810
 thanks a lot of space on this video 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.380
 mountain consoles on a base 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.300
 regular

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.439
 in the comments also in the 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.840
 information bar you will find 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:52.400
 all that is useful then to know how to be 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.430
 for example the products used to 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.849
 mount also as a ben joins more 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.169
 early but so on this I wish 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.340
 a good holiday I could have brought
