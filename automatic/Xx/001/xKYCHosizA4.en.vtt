00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 if you like rpg you have to meet 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.609
 the legend online game completely 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.589
 translated you play straight from your 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.160
 browser and do not need a super pc 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:17.100
 fuck 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:19.439
 meet and suppose ua and the people there 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.900
 there is inclusion for you but never play 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.050
 commented and a video of today is again 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.210
 over glue would come to advance wars iron and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.970
 is the first video of my here on dlc 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 suffer as soon as you left today 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.809
 xbox 360 and xbox 360 as you are 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.160
 speaking in depth is already nuno lopes carrais 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.989
 and maybe it's a map that I think the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.320
 majority but wants to see that the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.870
 remastering of the rasi nÃ© that existed 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.539
 mw2 of the map of the galera most liked 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.510
 play is back for the advance wars 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.480
 right off the bat already apologized to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.530
 You because that's the way I do not have it 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 first came out in full is legal and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.510
 second of all that is I do not have 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.680
 gameplay of the other maps yet 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
 In this video, I want to talk a little 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 on each of the maps is and so well 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.700
 A little bit because I played few 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.200
 times I did not have much time to play and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.030
 in the time that I had I had many 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.740
 difficulties finding room also up to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.930
 get to the tweet for the problem guys already 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 I was finding the room and everything else because 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.290
 it was difficult to find room generally 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.610
 not so launch should be 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.040
 I can actually launch them 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.500
 find a good room for this should be 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.820
 a little more complicated to find the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.680
 first time 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.180
 looking for I tried to play one more 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.860
 now before recording this 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.659
 video already knows a little easier but 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.259
 still you pick up and handle a lot 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.600
 cool 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.880
 I'm supposed to play a couple of 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.350
 cars and then the map I played was the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.340
 parliament played a few games 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.560
 in him 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.479
 I played a blackout one or two matches 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 as from 6 actually in the countryside 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.060
 paulo is not that the smallest map of this 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.040
 dlc and played half a game on the map 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.720
 I forgot to his name cache kremlin 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.719
 cronin something like 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.399
 Okay, so I do not have much that much 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.320
 talking about each of the maps does not 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.500
 started precisely because oscar raise is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.079
 he is very faithful to an original hi hi 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.149
 Okay, you'll see right away. 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.750
 playing that he has the same daughter 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.580
 same 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.070
 and the same thing quite the same as 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.350
 some small differences but nothing 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.390
 the way you play on the map is the same 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.370
 I'm not even a big connoisseur of 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.590
 two disclosed maps did not play much and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.450
 given two rays and maybe its maps that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.250
 I played the most but it's still not 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.370
 much in little in reais 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.660
 right but anyway okay yes map 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.740
 which was a map that fit well 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.209
 of this game 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.490
 if any regime map could remaster 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.250
 to another adversary the affair of some 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.430
 mw maybe a raise was between 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.830
 others more plausible to be renamed 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.380
 who would fit the most in this game 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.420
 I do not know if it is but anyway I liked it 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.070
 it worked well on the adversary the beast until 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.420
 on the other new as I said I 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.820
 I played in each one of them what 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.610
 I played the most, and the parliament is a 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.360
 parameter the call is open enough to 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.220
 it is a map with an instant amber 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.620
 space so we are not a dove is 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.800
 a medium map for small I found it 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.510
 I called very spaced out it knows it works 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.790
 Very well with the iphone salute but also 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.650
 You can play other forms together. 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.410
 styles in short range weapons 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.350
 ok and I found the most interesting is a 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.670
 attack very good shampoo and everything else alone 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.890
 which is not a map that I thought had 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.280
 many areas this is a rather 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.019
 run and not be so big and open and 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.360
 this idea of being quite 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.269
 which appeared to be the 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.489
 map is interesting this should be to a 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.410
 another map that we have is the map 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.150
 I told you I played one 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.430
 match and neither play a full match 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.920
 avoid another match it is fired 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.170
 best cover of lc and I had already spoken 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.049
 in training here by the trailer that map 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.880
 I kind of remembered a little bit 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.980
 chip is a form of four and 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.600
 ended up being remastered pro rock 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.700
 of goals do not remember now what was the name 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.090
 he had found there think the UN 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.760
 default of bags is finally really has 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.130
 A boy from that map is very 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.980
 tight here is a map definitely 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.959
 for proofs he does not think of using 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.459
 triple jump on this map you can even 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.310
 getting your own brawn is a good 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.709
 option but are you going to have much more 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.810
 advantages you use ufmg or a shot 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.770
 gun in short-range shooting that you 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.300
 will pass 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.120
 first on the strings you'll always talk 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.970
 I give a face with a certain bus is quite 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.190
 tight very humble kinase at last is 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.050
 It reminded me quite singh the Chinese is 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.780
 larger than a light schmidt 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.159
 It does not reach far right is but one way 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.870
 cool if you like but small 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.909
 probably a paulo fan can be 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.590
 maybe even your favorite map of this 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.240
 Delight is a bit complex I do not like 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.159
 complex small maps because it places 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.680
 nor have many corners and many corners turned 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:51.960
 everything but you can play it for 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.000
 play and he looked like a nice 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.220
 another map was what I - I played 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.639
 everyone to the family run, and I do not know 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.590
 sure and has practically nothing to 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.509
 talk like that, I played half a part of 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.840
 up was trainee launch I played there 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.639
 tcm metals it and the match is over and 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.800
 I still took a break from the team. 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.060
 carpegiani to make knife turkey not 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.590
 explore the map 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.099
 but it is a map that has a kind of 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.780
 ms a landmine that activate in 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.699
 half of the map of the nothing in the middle of the match 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.500
 you can not go there - you can even 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.419
 go there but have to spend a lot 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.770
 fast owner of the nightclub help desk for you 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.780
 to escape and not die 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.000
 is also looking like a pretty map 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.849
 opened up seemed to me also the largest map of 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.960
 lc is for anyone who likes snip guns 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.669
 long range 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.380
 maybe it's the best brand to be 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.120
 This is how I said I played little then 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.719
 I can not have a very opinion 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.759
 end on the map is still but until me 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.659
 gave the air of your map that I - with like 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.460
 said her 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.560
 and I do not usually like these maps 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.449
 to pack to be longer 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.039
 registered much more the areas of 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.979
 cooperation it can have many locations 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.479
 then maybe it's a map that 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.340
 I least like the sadc 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.020
 but in general this is what I can 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.909
 talk about those maps to the 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.550
 Moment I'll try to play some more. 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.779

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.219
