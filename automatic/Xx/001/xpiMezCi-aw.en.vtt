giving him the benefit of the doubt

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.130 
giving him the benefit of the doubt
right<00:02:29.370> there<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.120> know<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.510> was<00:02:30.720> running<00:02:31.019> him

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
right there but I know I was running him

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.380 
right there but I know I was running him
early<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.769> was<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:32.129> he<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:32.670> runs<00:02:33.030> hard

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
early and it was just he just runs hard

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.500 
early and it was just he just runs hard
you<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:33.959> he<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.349> he's<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.099> runs<00:02:35.819> hard<00:02:36.150> he

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
you know he just he's just runs hard he

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
you know he just he's just runs hard he
ran<00:02:36.720> hard<00:02:37.019> he's<00:02:37.200> run<00:02:37.410> hard<00:02:37.650> every<00:02:37.920> time<00:02:38.129> I've

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
ran hard he's run hard every time I've

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.789 
ran hard he's run hard every time I've
been<00:02:38.459> around<00:02:38.730> them<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.299> just<00:02:39.329> seems<00:02:39.799> like

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
been around them and it just seems like

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.410 
been around them and it just seems like
overkill<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:41.790> car<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.060> good<00:02:42.239> you'll

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
overkill like if your car is good you'll

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.630 
overkill like if your car is good you'll
go<00:02:42.569> forward<00:02:42.989> if<00:02:43.140> your<00:02:43.290> car<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.860> you'll<00:02:44.069> go

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
go forward if your car is and you'll go

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.250 
go forward if your car is and you'll go
back<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.120> that's<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.569> what<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.110> know

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
back and that's just what you know

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.979 
back and that's just what you know
that's<00:02:46.859> just<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.099> lot<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.370> NASCAR<00:02:47.609> and<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.329> you

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
that's just a lot of NASCAR and so you

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.370 
that's just a lot of NASCAR and so you
know

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.080 

there<00:02:51.770> was<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.190> was<00:02:52.280> still<00:02:52.490> enough<00:02:52.700> racing

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
there was there was still enough racing

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.550 
there was there was still enough racing
left<00:02:53.240> that<00:02:53.450> whoever's<00:02:53.780> car<00:02:53.930> was<00:02:54.080> faster<00:02:54.440> was

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
left that whoever's car was faster was

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.410 
left that whoever's car was faster was
gonna<00:02:54.710> get<00:02:54.890> ahead<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:55.460> I'm<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.300> disappointed

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420

you<00:02:57.080> know<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.230> felt<00:02:57.830> like<00:02:57.920> actually<00:02:58.610> this<00:02:58.730> was<00:02:58.940> a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
you know I felt like actually this was a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.150 
you know I felt like actually this was a
pretty<00:02:59.240> decent<00:02:59.420> run<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.020> at<00:03:00.440> Bristol<00:03:00.950> for<00:03:01.070> the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
pretty decent run it at Bristol for the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
first time and got caught out a little

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.250 
first time and got caught out a little
bit<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:04.010> with<00:03:04.910> tires<00:03:05.300> on<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:05.810> first<00:03:06.050> stop

I'd<00:03:17.510> such<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.810> such<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.530> good<00:03:18.770> run<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.040> finishes

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
I'd such a such a good run of finishes

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.000 
I'd such a such a good run of finishes
that<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:20.150> disappointing<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.230> leave<00:03:21.440> for<00:03:21.740> a
