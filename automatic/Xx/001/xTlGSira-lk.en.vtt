time I'm my hair is growing and have a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.719 
time I'm my hair is growing and have a
lot<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> new<00:01:13.950> growth<00:01:14.479> but<00:01:15.680> it's<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.979> enough<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
lot of new growth but it's not enough to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.649 
lot of new growth but it's not enough to
where<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.479> would<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:19.310> out<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.550> do<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> big<00:01:21.420> chop

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
where I would go out and do the big chop

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.820 
where I would go out and do the big chop
because<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.899> be<00:01:24.990> honest<00:01:25.410> with<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.619> that's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
because to be honest with you that's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.389 
because to be honest with you that's
traumatizing<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.910> me<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.860> may<00:01:29.039> think<00:01:29.070> it's

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
traumatizing for me you may think it's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.760 
traumatizing for me you may think it's
plenty<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.600> very<00:01:30.960> common<00:01:31.320> timing<00:01:31.619> for

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
plenty but it's very common timing for

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.510 
plenty but it's very common timing for
me<00:01:31.800> because<00:01:32.070> I've<00:01:32.280> always<00:01:32.610> had<00:01:34.070> long<00:01:35.070> hair

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
me because I've always had long hair

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.660 
me because I've always had long hair
ever<00:01:35.880> since<00:01:36.179> I<00:01:36.300> was<00:01:36.690> little<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:39.649> for<00:01:40.649> me<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.490> go

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
ever since I was little and for me to go

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.669 
ever since I was little and for me to go
from<00:01:42.060> long<00:01:42.780> hair<00:01:43.369> too<00:01:44.390> very<00:01:45.390> very<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:45.960> short

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
from long hair too very very very short

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.300 
from long hair too very very very short
hair<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:48.869> very<00:01:49.320> emotional<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.190> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
hair it's very emotional and it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.420 
hair it's very emotional and it's
probably<00:01:50.910> I<00:01:51.300> guess<00:01:51.690> too<00:01:51.960> much<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.410> me<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> take
