00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.720 
actually for two days when I first make
it<00:01:39.660> so<00:01:40.660> that<00:01:41.290> saves<00:01:41.560> me<00:01:41.800> time<00:01:42.160> as<00:01:42.400> well<00:01:42.580> they

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
it so that saves me time as well they

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.540

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
could stay up to 24 to 36 hours a

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.200 
could stay up to 24 to 36 hours a
particularly<00:01:46.180> when<00:01:46.900> there<00:01:47.650> is<00:01:48.040> lemon<00:01:48.970> in<00:01:49.090> it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
particularly when there is lemon in it

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.510 
particularly when there is lemon in it
so<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:49.600> preserves<00:01:50.020> better<00:01:50.410> what<00:01:51.190> makes<00:01:51.220> this

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
so it preserves better what makes this

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.060 
so it preserves better what makes this
whole<00:01:51.820> process<00:01:52.120> so<00:01:52.690> easy<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.710> cleaner

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070
