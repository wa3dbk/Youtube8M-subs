00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.589
 hi how are you in this opportunity 

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:09.130
 you in this video to explain them 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:10.510
 that eat at breakfast numerous times 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.850
 they have called me emails 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.209
 osea ask you eat in 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.070
 breakfast I can eat breakfast 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.650
 this is very important how many times 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.210
 we will have heard our mothers say 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.130
 in three of our study websites 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.590
 jobs breakfast is the most 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.990
 important of the day I always think that 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.430
 we always do directly bred with 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.990
 that mentality of the people who say 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.739
 have breakfast the most important meal 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.720
 of the day and it's very true if we do not eat the 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.850
 first meal of the day it is possible that 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.350
 let's start a 20% more during the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.260
 Lunch inside our main 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.880
 food that's why you need mateo de 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.040
 nutrients always the body from the 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.210
 morning of the first hours and there 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.640
 people who argue that they can not 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 eat in the morning is fine do not eat this 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.860
 tomorrow take a glass of drinkable yogurt 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.810
 come serial with milk if possible or is 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.300
 something light with liquids and 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.610
 it is not necessary for you to eat meats or 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.400
 fish in the morning but yes you have 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.040
 a good breakfast a good green tea with 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.650
 some toast and with a little jam 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.840
 can be grayish can be because it 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.310
 there is a hard egg like for example in 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.630
 several restaurant chains after 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.940
 is not hard food egg 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.690
 hard egg, but they are not eggs 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.300
 ready of course 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.940
 food 31 is as important as 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.290
 any other food but more so for 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.930
 the foundation that we are 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.840
 practically in an average between 6 to 8 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.130
 sleeping hours or 6 to 8 hours that the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.740
 body does not receive any kind of 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.360
 nutrient or does not have anything that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.730
 just improve the body that goes 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.110
 to have energy and so on then yes 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.670
 we get up after eight hours of 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.080
 sleep some people get to sleep 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.380
 10 hours those who can say luck 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.880
 others sleeping without nutrients the body 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.120
 you wake up you can not pretend 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.250
 be optimal both mentally and 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.840
 physical as to take a test like 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.270
 to go to work or to be 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.040
 excellently if they do not eat breakfast 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.230
 brain brain forgiveness 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.360
 you know it works with glucose 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.790
 sugar then you need to give it 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.560
 nutrients and carbohydrates glucose 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.380
 protein whatever but the morning 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.380
 you have to give him good things and avoid 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.790
 as much as possible and worth the redundancy that 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.640
 I just mentioned the brain 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.500
 eat very sweet things the morning something 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.650
 sweet is fine but not very sweet 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.630
 supposedly nothing fried if it is not a thing of a 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.459
 touch breakfast be something I need 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.740
 energy then if I eat everything I go to 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.870
 have a lot of energy, it's not like that, you should 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.180
 to eat something appropriate if I eat here 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.610
 we call the collation what is like a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.830
 small portion for example of fruits a 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.990
 little milk with cereal to a serial is 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.600
 just integral can be because 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.640
 new an egg can be multiple 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.260
 I personally until the breakfast by 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.750
 example three eggs and all logically 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.490
 without the yolk all the clear only very 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.710
 good protein a sandwich that's 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.360
 excellent but the crumb sandwiches 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.780
 they sell at the bakery near the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.580
 home that come with ham mayonnaise 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.750
 eggs all that good is the same as 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.210
 you can do with an egg 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.280
 raw from first with with a bread 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.840
 knocking him out by his poles and by Germans 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.700
 they are and ham and it is done where that is 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.960
 an excellent one and they're going to start a lot 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.390
 better days 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.700
 and another very good thing if it's the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.580
 hydration take something I recommend the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.650
 green tea I like is an alkaline drink 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.900
 which we avoid all kinds of evils in 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.370
 the body and it's working for me 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.710
 well and it makes me be very good during the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.170
 so it's not necessary for you to have a tea 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.200
 green if you want to exclude it from your diet 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.870
 whatever your reason may be tea 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.140
 black red tea can be because in a 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.690
 mate mate can be mate because I do not know 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.360
 try to avoid coffee or coffee 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.910
 It's not bad but I personally am not 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.740
 coffee supporter yes and why not what 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.710
 I have broken skim milk yes where 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.690
 skimmed as they say in your good country 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.400
 these were some small patterns of 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.410
 why breakfast is essential in 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.720
 summary why you need energy to 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.270
 do your things is done to study and 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.520
 either to work or let's talk about what it is 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.740
 go to train doing physical exercise if 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.380
 we do not have 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.380
 a breakfast after 8 to 10 hours of 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.730
 fasting we are going to give more than hours 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.980
 our other colleagues and others 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.140
 then to be strong indispensable 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.030
 breakfast you need more ideas and more
