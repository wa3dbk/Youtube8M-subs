happy with this first up is web browsing
which<00:03:44.860> is<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.010> relatively<00:03:45.580> light<00:03:45.880> task<00:03:46.269> but<00:03:46.660> the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
which is a relatively light task but the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.080 
which is a relatively light task but the
21<00:03:47.200> by<00:03:47.319> 9<00:03:47.470> aspect<00:03:47.709> ratio<00:03:48.040> combined<00:03:48.760> with<00:03:49.000> the

34 40 by 1440p resolution lets you have

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.080 
34 40 by 1440p resolution lets you have
two<00:03:52.480> full-sized<00:03:53.170> web<00:03:53.470> pages<00:03:53.709> side<00:03:54.130> by<00:03:54.160> side<00:03:54.370> it

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
two full-sized web pages side by side it

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.030 
two full-sized web pages side by side it
has<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.450> same<00:03:55.600> functionality<00:03:56.200> as<00:03:56.470> say<00:03:56.769> dual

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
has the same functionality as say dual

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.890 
has the same functionality as say dual
monitors<00:03:57.580> but<00:03:58.030> there's<00:03:58.209> no<00:03:58.300> bezel<00:03:58.720> in<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
monitors but there's no bezel in the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.330 
monitors but there's no bezel in the
middle<00:03:59.110> so<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.380> productivity<00:03:59.830> there<00:04:00.190> is

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
middle so the productivity there is

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.530 
middle so the productivity there is
awesome<00:04:00.730> I<00:04:00.790> also<00:04:00.910> do<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.120> lot<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.329> media

this<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.240> probably<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.570> best<00:04:28.720> time<00:04:28.960> to

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
this is probably the best time to

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.630 
this is probably the best time to
mention<00:04:29.320> these<00:04:29.620> speakers<00:04:30.130> that<00:04:30.340> are<00:04:30.370> built

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
mention these speakers that are built

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.700 
mention these speakers that are built
into<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.210> monitor<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:32.110> really<00:04:32.320> only<00:04:32.500> use

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
into the monitor and I really only use

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.290 
into the monitor and I really only use
them<00:04:32.919> for<00:04:33.100> 10<00:04:33.280> minutes<00:04:33.580> before<00:04:33.700> I<00:04:33.880> set<00:04:34.150> up<00:04:34.180> my

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
them for 10 minutes before I set up my

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.420 
them for 10 minutes before I set up my
much<00:04:34.660> better<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.260> audio<00:04:35.530> studio<00:04:35.919> monitors

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
much better and audio studio monitors

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.460 
much better and audio studio monitors
but<00:04:37.150> they<00:04:37.240> really<00:04:37.479> weren't<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.720> bad<00:04:38.020> for

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
but they really weren't that bad for

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.980 
but they really weren't that bad for
