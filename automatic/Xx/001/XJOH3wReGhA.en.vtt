00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.759
 waiting for this pork casserole with 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.580
 Black beer when listening to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.559
 we could listen is already ready 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.530
 you just have to enjoy eating it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.530
 it stays like this really is a delicacy for 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.080
 Sweet paprika as for the dish 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 that a little more decorated does not explain 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 it's spicy it's sweet in this case yes 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.080
 they prefer to add some spice for 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.240
 Of course it would not hurt too 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.030
 it will be very good but it is known 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.309
 that our palate is not so friendly 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 we could say that physical things 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.700
 then it 's fine we do it by implying 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.399
 as you are saying this is rather 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.110
 stretching to light sweetness I would 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.760
 I would dare to put something spicy too 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.370
 what the dishes that are 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.530
 slightly sweet or sweet 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 They wear very well with a touch of itch 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.449
 picas with some chile are fabulous 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.300
 but well not everyone likes it that way 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.190
 that we leave it to the absolute decision of 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.340
 each of us is easy for 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.070
 prepare is very 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.870
 and very simple they can do it with 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.760
 blonde beer too if they do not get 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.280
 Black beer is an easy dish to make 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.200
 and delicious good to see to prepare 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.570

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.660
