rules<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.850> that's<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.600> pc<00:00:39.960> only<00:00:40.170> obviously

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
rules and that's for pc only obviously

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.819 
rules and that's for pc only obviously
and<00:00:41.070> i'm<00:00:41.640> playing<00:00:42.180> part<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.350> trailer<00:00:43.800> for

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and i'm playing part of that trailer for

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.990 
and i'm playing part of that trailer for
that<00:00:44.070> first<00:00:44.809> content<00:00:45.809> patch<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.789> i<00:00:47.789> think

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that first content patch and i think

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.639 
that first content patch and i think
they<00:00:48.120> call<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.480> content<00:00:48.899> patch<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.320> opposed

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
they call it a content patch as opposed

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.369 
they call it a content patch as opposed
to<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> DLC<00:00:50.430> pack<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:50.940> they're<00:00:51.690> DLC<00:00:52.140> packs

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to a DLC pack because they're DLC packs

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.080 
to a DLC pack because they're DLC packs
are<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.860> much<00:00:53.100> larger<00:00:53.370> almost<00:00:53.969> like

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
are going to be much larger almost like

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.200 
are going to be much larger almost like
expansion<00:00:54.809> packs<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.699> happens

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
expansion packs so I think that happens

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.410 
expansion packs so I think that happens
on<00:00:57.329> Tuesday

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
on Tuesday

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.189
