00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.490
 how can google munch be used 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.719
 as a result of the developer 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:09.950
 that is, when creating 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.299
 and editing 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.479
 but now the minnow is open 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:17.689
 standard page honcho dot com 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.680
 in google chrome browser 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.109
 notice the most important thing than 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.569
 we are talking now 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.619
 for example for want 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.269
 change river text color ribbon 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.230
 version of the form but do not know how it is 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.040
 do and where will it do 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.720
 the simplest thing you can do is 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.240
 run this piece of text push right 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.360
 button or code preview 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.960
 items 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.300
 pressing pancakes immediately find ourselves on 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.400
 lines which is responsible for our 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.750
 inaccuracies 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.700
 if we are used to the frank, we even see 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.180
 this word is a tape option forum 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.650
 but with the right and immediately visible to the system 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.660
 by which 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.470
 determined by this most unusual 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.210
 our orange fund reform option 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.540
 calories expert 400 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.600
 foundation bis font size cure 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.330
 generally found in the height of the tank 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.670
 how can there be many others 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.250
 parameters or they are missing 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.130
 you yourself ask all this covenants set 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.130
 news in the common table CSKA 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.650
 a little part of the moment you have 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.480
 maybe she 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.050
 on the stock look and a few tables sf 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.400
 then explain exactly what 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.020
 specified line 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.120
 so you want to change let's 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.830

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.410
 4 0 4 0 4 0 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.570
 so we all know there 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.479
 notice it has become gray only 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.080
 you are now specifically on your 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.570
 monitor screen 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.540
 your visitors have everything left 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.090
 still if only their families change 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.270
 Directions try if you this 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.170

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.950
 table target communication and swap and do the same 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.330
 these changes we tried here 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.610
 this made sure that you are what we 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.800
 now here doing on no one reflects 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.340
 the poet can experiment 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.889
 as much as you want 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.129

 font let it be bilan 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:22.759
 and some 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.650
 if it certainly 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.209
 did not know this recall 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.469
 here so the president of Udmurtia 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.819
 that is, for years you can try any 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.099
 colors whatever you like them it is not 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.259
 forbidden 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.309
 one more thing as edition notes 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.219
 now want to change carefully 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.589
 wash some yes 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.989
 in April if you yourself are tallying a little higher 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.469
 that is, we just got our column out 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.529
 Forms are permissible. 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.799
 change the width that's the way it is a video clip 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.209
 one hundred percent 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.989
 then when Turkmenistan immediately 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.289
 vetlitskaya part of the program on 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.769

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.809
 fifty percent 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.639
 and this time see how we all 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.789
 exchanged 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.509
 width was 50 percent what we 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.929

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.149
 alcohol plump 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.219
 so leave google chrome and rejoice here 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.639
 By the way Godâ€™s reference dot chrome com 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.179
 earlier 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:48.019
