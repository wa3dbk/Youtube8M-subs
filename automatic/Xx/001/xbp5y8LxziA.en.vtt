00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
end of one side and then the initial

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.760 
end of one side and then the initial
corridor<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.899> an<00:01:00.989> assault<00:01:01.289> rifle<00:01:01.379> for

corridor there is an assault rifle for
extra<00:01:02.010> ammunition<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:03.019> believe<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.199> also

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
extra ammunition I believe you can also

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
extra ammunition I believe you can also
pick<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:04.920> grenades<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.460> some<00:01:05.610> point<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
pick up some grenades at some point and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.940 
pick up some grenades at some point and
then<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.590> gonna<00:01:07.770> want

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
then really from there you're gonna want

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
then really from there you're gonna want
to<00:01:08.040> group<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.939> best<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> hold<00:01:09.420> out

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to group up and do your best to hold out

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.090 
to group up and do your best to hold out
because<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.170> flood<00:01:10.439> are<00:01:10.530> gonna<00:01:10.650> come<00:01:10.950> in

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
because the flood are gonna come in

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.070 
because the flood are gonna come in
numbers<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.390> may<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:13.049> are

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
numbers and you may not think they are

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.539 
numbers and you may not think they are
very<00:01:13.170> fast<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.310> slightly

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
very fast because they do have slightly

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.789 
very fast because they do have slightly
lower<00:01:14.880> speed<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.540> trust<00:01:15.869> me<00:01:15.960> when<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.380> swarm

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
lower speed but trust me when they swarm

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
lower speed but trust me when they swarm
you<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.460> doesn't<00:01:17.909> matter<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.600> will

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you it really doesn't matter they will

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.990 
you it really doesn't matter they will
take<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:19.650> will<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.340> destroy

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
take you out and they will just destroy

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
take you out and they will just destroy
you<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.590> unfortunately<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.650> never<00:01:22.770> made<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you all unfortunately I never made it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.560 
you all unfortunately I never made it
particularly<00:01:23.880> far<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
particularly far in this because I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
particularly far in this because I
wasn't<00:01:24.810> too<00:01:25.020> great<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.860> ended<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.130> getting

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
wasn't too great we ended up getting

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.710 
wasn't too great we ended up getting
wiped<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> first<00:01:27.030> area<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.659> because

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
wiped out at the first area here because

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480 
wiped out at the first area here because
the<00:01:27.930> flood<00:01:28.110> were<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.470> good<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.860> uh<00:01:28.890> it's

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the flood were really good but uh it's

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
the flood were really good but uh it's
actually<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> pretty<00:01:29.909> balanced<00:01:30.270> experience<00:01:30.720> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
actually a pretty balanced experience so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.600 
actually a pretty balanced experience so
this<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> flood<00:01:32.040> room<00:01:32.250> where<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
this is the flood room where the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
this is the flood room where the
teleporters<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.299> spawn<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.600> at<00:01:33.930> some<00:01:34.200> point

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
teleporters will spawn in at some point

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.660 
teleporters will spawn in at some point
and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.770> different<00:01:35.100> choices<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and then you get different choices as to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
and then you get different choices as to
where<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.090> go<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.200> progression<00:01:37.650> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
where you can go with the progression of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560 
where you can go with the progression of
the<00:01:37.829> humans<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> work

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the humans and you just want to work

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
the humans and you just want to work
your<00:01:39.689> way<00:01:39.750> towards<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.799> humans<00:01:41.009> are

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
your way towards here so the humans are

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
your way towards here so the humans are
gonna<00:01:41.220> wait<00:01:41.369> till<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.820> door<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.329> exploded<00:01:43.259> so

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
gonna wait till this door is exploded so

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
gonna wait till this door is exploded so
right<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.729> door<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
right here the door is going to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.490 
right here the door is going to
disappear<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.049> run<00:01:46.200> right

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
disappear then you can just run right

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.719 
disappear then you can just run right
through<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.799> shield<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> move<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
through the shield and move on to the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.289 
through the shield and move on to the
next<00:01:47.820> area<00:01:49.520> once<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:51.000> lots<00:01:51.180> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
next area once in here you got lots of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.179 
next area once in here you got lots of
line-of-sight<00:01:51.780> breakers<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.649> gonna<00:01:52.829> want<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
line-of-sight breakers I'm gonna want to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.429 
line-of-sight breakers I'm gonna want to
work<00:01:53.340> down<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.729> L<00:01:53.970> curve<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.229> get

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
work down this L curve and as you get

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.600 
work down this L curve and as you get
here<00:01:55.649> you're<00:01:55.740> gonna<00:01:55.920> notice<00:01:56.130> there's<00:01:56.460> some

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
here you're gonna notice there's some

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
here you're gonna notice there's some
additional<00:01:56.969> ammunition<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> central

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
additional ammunition in the central

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.959 
additional ammunition in the central
area<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.100> two<00:01:59.340> doorways<00:01:59.670> on

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
area and then there are two doorways on

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.270 
area and then there are two doorways on
the<00:02:00.060> side<00:02:00.270> over<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.350> far<00:02:01.619> corner<00:02:01.649> there

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the side over in that far corner there

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
the side over in that far corner there
is<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> soft<00:02:02.790> kill<00:02:03.000> boundary<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
is a soft kill boundary because that is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
is a soft kill boundary because that is
a<00:02:03.990> flood<00:02:04.409> teleporter<00:02:05.070> spawn<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> guess<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
a flood teleporter spawn I guess in a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.280 
a flood teleporter spawn I guess in a
way<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.000> could<00:02:06.149> say<00:02:06.210> anta<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:07.170> where

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
way you could say anta that's where

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.449 
way you could say anta that's where
they're<00:02:07.380> gonna<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.619> coming<00:02:07.890> from<00:02:08.039> sliding

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
they're gonna be coming from sliding

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.740 
they're gonna be coming from sliding
through<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.879> then<00:02:08.970> trying<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.300> come<00:02:09.360> kill<00:02:09.629> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
through and then trying to come kill you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.110 
through and then trying to come kill you
this<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.800> awesome<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.580> remake<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
this is awesome this is the remake of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.260 
this is awesome this is the remake of
the<00:02:12.300> little<00:02:12.480> cafeteria

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
the little cafeteria

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.820

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
area so as I was showing you here there

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.490 
area so as I was showing you here there
are<00:02:14.950> two<00:02:15.310> different<00:02:15.610> entry<00:02:15.910> points<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.500> I

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
are two different entry points and I

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.440 
are two different entry points and I
just<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:18.010> love<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.670> part<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.030> mission<00:02:19.330> in

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
just I love this part of the mission in

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.360 
just I love this part of the mission in
combat<00:02:19.810> Evolved<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.590> find<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:20.950> let's<00:02:21.220> did

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
combat Evolved and I find that let's did

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.860 
combat Evolved and I find that let's did
such<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.550> great<00:02:21.820> job<00:02:22.150> rebuilding<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.780> it's

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
such a great job rebuilding and it's

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.480 
such a great job rebuilding and it's
really<00:02:23.200> accurate<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.830> mean<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.340> really

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
really accurate I mean and it really

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.460 
really accurate I mean and it really
gives<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.880> proper<00:02:25.090> feel<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.200> want<00:02:26.410> to

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
gives you the proper feel so you want to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.870 
gives you the proper feel so you want to
move<00:02:26.590> your<00:02:26.680> way<00:02:26.830> over<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.310> little<00:02:27.460> corner

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
move your way over to this little corner

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.310 
move your way over to this little corner
you<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.120> pick<00:02:28.300> up<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.480> turret<00:02:28.780> here<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.200> I

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
you can pick up a turret here and like I

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.630 
you can pick up a turret here and like I
said<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.530> few<00:02:29.620> weapons<00:02:29.920> along<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.520> way

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
said a few weapons along the way

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.400 
said a few weapons along the way
including<00:02:31.120> what<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.330> believe<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.720> one<00:02:31.870> shotgun

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
including what I believe is one shotgun

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.010 
including what I believe is one shotgun
and<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.120> want<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.360> hold<00:02:34.540> out<00:02:34.690> once<00:02:34.900> again

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
and you just want to hold out once again

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.170 
and you just want to hold out once again
so<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> flood<00:02:36.160> can<00:02:36.280> easily<00:02:36.670> use<00:02:36.850> all<00:02:37.000> these

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
so the flood can easily use all these

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.090 
so the flood can easily use all these
pillars<00:02:37.570> here<00:02:37.690> as<00:02:37.870> lots<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.380> cover<00:02:38.650> it's<00:02:38.950> a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
pillars here as lots of cover it's a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.490 
pillars here as lots of cover it's a
very<00:02:39.340> smart<00:02:39.670> strategy<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.390> what<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.290> would

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
very smart strategy and what I would

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.990 
very smart strategy and what I would
suggest<00:02:41.620> doing<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:42.070> grouping<00:02:42.490> up<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.880> they

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
suggest doing is grouping up like they

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.790 
suggest doing is grouping up like they
did<00:02:43.210> on<00:02:43.240> multiple<00:02:43.720> occasions<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.530> come

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
did on multiple occasions and just come

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.580 
did on multiple occasions and just come
in<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.070> numbers<00:02:45.460> and<00:02:45.640> just<00:02:45.790> wipe<00:02:46.120> us<00:02:46.330> out

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
in in numbers and just wipe us out

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.440 
in in numbers and just wipe us out
others<00:02:47.590> like<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.800> go<00:02:48.010> solo<00:02:48.370> distract<00:02:49.090> us<00:02:49.270> while

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
others like to go solo distract us while

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.090 
others like to go solo distract us while
the<00:02:49.660> remaining<00:02:50.410> members<00:02:50.590> come<00:02:50.920> out<00:02:51.010> of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
the remaining members come out of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.230 
the remaining members come out of
another<00:02:51.280> side<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.790> know<00:02:51.940> it's<00:02:52.120> all<00:02:52.210> about

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
another side so you know it's all about

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.960 
another side so you know it's all about
preference<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.110> strategies<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:54.850> is

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
preference for the strategies so this is

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.640 
preference for the strategies so this is

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
sight breakers more ammunition on the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
the final area we're gonna want to hold

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.980 
the final area we're gonna want to hold
out<00:03:30.880> against<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.270> flood<00:03:31.480> for<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.780> last

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
out against the flood for the last

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.300 
out against the flood for the last
little<00:03:32.200> stretch<00:03:32.440> which<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.770> believe<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.100> one

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
little stretch which I believe is one

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.130 
little stretch which I believe is one
minute<00:03:33.490> so<00:03:33.820> I'm<00:03:34.120> pretty<00:03:34.360> sure<00:03:34.570> each<00:03:34.780> section

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
minute so I'm pretty sure each section

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.840 
minute so I'm pretty sure each section
is<00:03:35.230> about<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.440> minute<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:36.220> could<00:03:36.370> be<00:03:36.490> mistaken

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
is about a minute it could be mistaken

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.310 
is about a minute it could be mistaken
about<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:37.480> that's<00:03:37.600> about<00:03:37.780> averaging<00:03:38.230> it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
about that but that's about averaging it

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.170 
about that but that's about averaging it
out<00:03:38.440> here<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.490> very<00:03:39.640> front<00:03:39.850> of<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:39.970> ship
