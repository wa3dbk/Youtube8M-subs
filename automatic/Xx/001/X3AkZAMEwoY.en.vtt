00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
and XPS 13 have fast SSD storage so I

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.730 
and XPS 13 have fast SSD storage so I
thought<00:03:10.630> it'd<00:03:10.720> be<00:03:10.750> interesting<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.410> see<00:03:11.560> which

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
thought it'd be interesting to see which

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:33.170 
thought it'd be interesting to see which
one<00:03:12.010> boots<00:03:12.370> faster<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.450> let's<00:03:13.780> find<00:03:13.960> out

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.000 

yeah<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.330> as<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.569> can<00:03:34.690> see<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.019> XPS<00:03:35.410> 13<00:03:35.440> did

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
yeah so as you can see the XPS 13 did

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.830 
yeah so as you can see the XPS 13 did
boot<00:03:36.280> slightly<00:03:37.000> faster<00:03:37.390> than<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.569> MacBook

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
like if you had the air you would be

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.870 
difference between the two SSDs the XPS
13<00:03:58.150> is<00:03:58.569> an<00:03:58.660> MDOT<00:03:59.049> 2<00:03:59.349> SSD<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.430> MacBook<00:04:00.760> Air

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
13 is an MDOT 2 SSD and the MacBook Air

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.930 
13 is an MDOT 2 SSD and the MacBook Air
is<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.120> PCIe<00:04:01.630> based<00:04:01.989> SSD<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.040> SPS<00:04:03.340> 13s<00:04:03.790> read

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
is a PCIe based SSD the SPS 13s read

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.880 
is a PCIe based SSD the SPS 13s read
rights<00:04:04.120> were<00:04:04.299> 452<00:04:05.019> megabytes<00:04:05.410> per<00:04:05.470> second

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
rights were 452 megabytes per second

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.280 
rights were 452 megabytes per second
read<00:04:06.099> and<00:04:06.340> 121<00:04:07.120> megabytes<00:04:07.510> per<00:04:07.569> second<00:04:08.019> write

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
read and 121 megabytes per second write

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.280 
read and 121 megabytes per second write
and<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.890> air<00:04:09.040> had<00:04:09.370> 710<00:04:10.299> megabytes<00:04:10.750> per<00:04:10.840> second

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
and the air had 710 megabytes per second

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.369 
and the air had 710 megabytes per second
read<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.940> 315<00:04:12.940> megabytes<00:04:13.450> per<00:04:13.540> second<00:04:14.019> right

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
read and 315 megabytes per second right

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.440 
read and 315 megabytes per second right
so<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:14.920> turns<00:04:15.069> out<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.340> MacBook<00:04:15.700> Airs<00:04:15.879> SSD<00:04:16.329> is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
so it turns out the MacBook Airs SSD is

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.719 
so it turns out the MacBook Airs SSD is
significantly<00:04:17.079> faster<00:04:17.500> but<00:04:18.340> they're<00:04:18.579> both

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
significantly faster but they're both

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.759 
significantly faster but they're both
blazing<00:04:19.359> fast<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.019> most<00:04:20.289> real-world

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
blazing fast and in most real-world

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.260 
blazing fast and in most real-world
applications<00:04:21.579> you<00:04:21.729> wouldn't<00:04:21.970> be<00:04:22.030> able<00:04:22.090> to

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
applications you wouldn't be able to

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.790 
applications you wouldn't be able to
notice<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.750> difference<00:04:23.169> but<00:04:23.350> there<00:04:23.530> are

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
notice a difference but there are

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.680 
notice a difference but there are
scenarios<00:04:24.639> out<00:04:24.789> there<00:04:25.030> where<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.300> MacBook

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
scenarios out there where the MacBook

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.719 
scenarios out there where the MacBook
Air<00:04:25.810> is<00:04:25.930> faster<00:04:26.350> stores<00:04:26.590> will<00:04:27.100> be<00:04:27.280> noticeable

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
Air is faster stores will be noticeable

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.340 
Air is faster stores will be noticeable
say<00:04:27.880> you're<00:04:28.030> recording<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.510> game<00:04:28.750> on<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.200> your

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
say you're recording a game on to your

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.840 
say you're recording a game on to your
storage<00:04:29.590> drive<00:04:29.950> or<00:04:30.220> like<00:04:30.370> you're<00:04:30.490> loading<00:04:30.789> a

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
storage drive or like you're loading a

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.360 
storage drive or like you're loading a
huge<00:04:31.060> map<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.660> air<00:04:31.810> will<00:04:32.110> be<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.289> lot<00:04:32.620> faster<00:04:32.650> so

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
huge map the air will be a lot faster so

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.830 
huge map the air will be a lot faster so
this<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.669> an<00:04:33.789> interesting<00:04:34.090> comparison

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
this is an interesting comparison

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.719 
this is an interesting comparison
between<00:04:34.960> these<00:04:35.289> two<00:04:35.470> laptops<00:04:35.710> Wi-Fi<00:04:36.400> speeds

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
between these two laptops Wi-Fi speeds

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.640 
between these two laptops Wi-Fi speeds
are<00:04:36.880> incredibly<00:04:37.419> important<00:04:37.990> with<00:04:38.139> portable

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
are incredibly important with portable

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.080 
are incredibly important with portable
laptops<00:04:39.010> because<00:04:39.190> that's<00:04:39.550> how<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.729> connect

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
laptops because that's how you connect

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.700 
laptops because that's how you connect
to<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> internet<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.200> actually<00:04:41.349> thought

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
to the internet and I actually thought

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.650 
to the internet and I actually thought
there<00:04:41.919> would<00:04:42.190> be<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.370> difference<00:04:42.820> but<00:04:43.510> there

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
there would be a difference but there

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.750 
there would be a difference but there
wasn't<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.139> XPS<00:04:44.470> 13<00:04:44.560> was<00:04:45.099> seventeen<00:04:45.520> point

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
wasn't the XPS 13 was seventeen point

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.400 
wasn't the XPS 13 was seventeen point
six<00:04:45.820> megabytes<00:04:46.300> per<00:04:46.450> second<00:04:46.840> down<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.200> six

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
six megabytes per second down and six

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.320 
six megabytes per second down and six
point<00:04:47.650> two<00:04:47.800> megabytes<00:04:48.190> per<00:04:48.280> second<00:04:48.700> up<00:04:48.820> while

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
point two megabytes per second up while

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.150 
point two megabytes per second up while
the<00:04:49.479> air<00:04:49.630> was<00:04:49.900> 18<00:04:50.289> point<00:04:50.560> 1<00:04:50.740> megabytes<00:04:51.130> per

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
the air was 18 point 1 megabytes per

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.100 
the air was 18 point 1 megabytes per
second<00:04:51.520> down<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:51.880> 6<00:04:52.210> point<00:04:52.450> 3<00:04:52.539> megabytes<00:04:53.020> per

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
second down and 6 point 3 megabytes per

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.020 
second down and 6 point 3 megabytes per
second<00:04:53.530> up<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.160> yeah<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.580> MacBook<00:04:54.910> Air

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
second up so yeah the MacBook Air

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.240 
second up so yeah the MacBook Air
technically<00:04:55.810> has<00:04:55.960> slightly<00:04:56.500> faster<00:04:56.860> Wi-Fi

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
technically has slightly faster Wi-Fi

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.830 
technically has slightly faster Wi-Fi
but<00:04:57.490> there<00:04:57.610> are<00:04:57.700> also<00:04:57.820> other<00:04:58.150> factors<00:04:58.660> that<00:04:58.780> I

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
but there are also other factors that I

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.750 
but there are also other factors that I
couldn't<00:04:59.139> take<00:04:59.229> into<00:04:59.470> account<00:04:59.740> so<00:05:00.250> basically

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
couldn't take into account so basically

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.400 
couldn't take into account so basically
they're<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.120> same<00:05:01.389> alright<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:02.050> test<00:05:02.260> how

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
they're the same alright to test how

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.839 
they're the same alright to test how
long<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.770> battery<00:05:02.919> lasts<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.520> went<00:05:03.700> with<00:05:03.820> a

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
long the battery lasts I went with a

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.750 
long the battery lasts I went with a
very<00:05:04.380> real-world<00:05:05.380> test<00:05:06.190> this<00:05:06.430> is<00:05:06.610> not

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
very real-world test this is not

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.010 
very real-world test this is not
synthetic<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.419> is<00:05:07.539> not<00:05:07.690> extremely

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
synthetic this is not extremely

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.600 
synthetic this is not extremely
controlled<00:05:08.530> what<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:08.979> did<00:05:09.190> was<00:05:09.370> take<00:05:09.550> my

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
controlled what I did was take my

had a million views that's awesome I
took<00:05:13.599> my<00:05:13.840> 1+1<00:05:14.380> review<00:05:14.620> which<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:14.770> a<00:05:14.889> 13<00:05:15.430> minute

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
took my 1+1 review which is a 13 minute

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.969 
took my 1+1 review which is a 13 minute
video<00:05:15.970> I<00:05:16.240> played<00:05:16.660> it<00:05:16.780> back<00:05:16.900> full<00:05:17.200> screen<00:05:17.560> full

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
video I played it back full screen full

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.830 
video I played it back full screen full
resolution<00:05:18.580> full<00:05:18.910> brightness<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.479> full

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
resolution full brightness and full

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.750 
resolution full brightness and full
sound<00:05:20.200> and<00:05:20.470> I<00:05:20.530> just<00:05:20.740> recorded<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.220> percentage

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
sound and I just recorded the percentage

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.790 
sound and I just recorded the percentage
hit<00:05:21.940> each<00:05:22.330> laptop<00:05:22.840> took<00:05:23.080> from<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.470> start<00:05:23.710> of

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
hit each laptop took from the start of

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.560 
hit each laptop took from the start of
the<00:05:23.860> video<00:05:23.919> to<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.550> end<00:05:24.639> of<00:05:24.849> the<00:05:24.910> video<00:05:25.120> so<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
the video to the end of the video so the

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.260 
the video to the end of the video so the
XPS<00:05:25.900> 13<00:05:25.930> went<00:05:26.410> down<00:05:26.560> 5%<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.760> MacBook<00:05:27.970> Air

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
XPS 13 went down 5% and the MacBook Air

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.959 
XPS 13 went down 5% and the MacBook Air
also<00:05:28.780> went<00:05:29.320> down<00:05:29.530> 5%<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.669> they<00:05:30.729> were<00:05:30.789> both

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
also went down 5% and they were both

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.880 
also went down 5% and they were both
near<00:05:31.300> full<00:05:31.630> charge<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:32.140> obviously<00:05:32.770> this

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
near full charge and obviously this

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.589 
near full charge and obviously this
isn't<00:05:33.070> an<00:05:33.250> indication<00:05:33.669> on<00:05:33.849> how<00:05:33.940> long<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.510> will

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
isn't an indication on how long it will

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:35.050 
isn't an indication on how long it will
actually

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
actually

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.420 
actually
the<00:05:35.389> entire<00:05:35.690> battery<00:05:36.169> but<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.740> does<00:05:36.950> say<00:05:37.190> that

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
the entire battery but it does say that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.700 
the entire battery but it does say that
they<00:05:37.520> handle<00:05:37.910> video<00:05:38.060> playback<00:05:38.470> similarly<00:05:39.470> and

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
they handle video playback similarly and

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.740 
they handle video playback similarly and
they<00:05:40.160> have<00:05:40.340> similar<00:05:40.730> sized<00:05:40.970> batteries<00:05:41.540> so<00:05:41.660> it

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
they have similar sized batteries so it

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.780 
they have similar sized batteries so it
doesn't<00:05:42.020> say<00:05:42.350> too<00:05:42.410> much<00:05:42.860> but<00:05:43.250> I<00:05:43.310> ran<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.760> test

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
doesn't say too much but I ran the test

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.159 
doesn't say too much but I ran the test
anyway<00:05:44.240> to<00:05:44.300> see<00:05:44.510> if<00:05:44.630> there<00:05:44.780> would<00:05:45.020> be<00:05:45.050> a

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
anyway to see if there would be a

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.900 
anyway to see if there would be a
difference<00:05:45.560> so<00:05:45.950> charging<00:05:46.310> speed<00:05:46.490> isn't

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
difference so charging speed isn't

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.430 
difference so charging speed isn't
important<00:05:47.330> to<00:05:47.389> everybody<00:05:47.840> cuz<00:05:48.139> a<00:05:48.169> lot<00:05:48.350> of

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
important to everybody cuz a lot of

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.170 
important to everybody cuz a lot of
people<00:05:48.650> just<00:05:48.680> be<00:05:48.950> charging<00:05:49.370> overnight<00:05:49.669> so<00:05:50.090> it

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
people just be charging overnight so it

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.879 
people just be charging overnight so it
doesn't<00:05:50.419> matter<00:05:50.510> how<00:05:50.630> quickly<00:05:51.080> it<00:05:51.290> gets<00:05:51.440> to

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
doesn't matter how quickly it gets to

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.640 
doesn't matter how quickly it gets to
100%<00:05:52.340> but<00:05:53.180> for<00:05:53.419> a<00:05:53.450> lot<00:05:53.600> of<00:05:53.720> people<00:05:54.020> that<00:05:54.200> quick

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
100% but for a lot of people that quick

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.200 
100% but for a lot of people that quick
charge<00:05:55.010> if<00:05:55.280> you<00:05:55.310> only<00:05:55.550> have<00:05:55.730> a<00:05:55.760> couple<00:05:55.820> minutes

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
charge if you only have a couple minutes

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.990 
charge if you only have a couple minutes
to<00:05:56.450> spare<00:05:56.810> is<00:05:57.020> important<00:05:57.889> so<00:05:58.280> I<00:05:58.310> timed<00:05:58.730> how

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
to spare is important so I timed how

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.430 
to spare is important so I timed how
long<00:05:59.060> it<00:05:59.210> would<00:05:59.389> take<00:05:59.450> to<00:05:59.630> charge<00:05:59.930> from<00:06:00.050> zero

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
long it would take to charge from zero

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.830 
long it would take to charge from zero
to<00:06:00.530> 25%<00:06:01.160> and<00:06:01.760> also<00:06:02.300> how<00:06:02.419> long<00:06:02.480> it<00:06:02.720> would<00:06:02.810> take

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
to 25% and also how long it would take

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.680 
to 25% and also how long it would take
to<00:06:03.020> charge<00:06:03.260> from<00:06:03.530> zero<00:06:03.800> to<00:06:04.250> 100%<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:05.300> XPS<00:06:05.660> 13

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
to charge from zero to 100% the XPS 13

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.290 
to charge from zero to 100% the XPS 13
took<00:06:06.260> 21<00:06:06.650> minutes<00:06:07.160> to<00:06:07.310> go<00:06:07.430> from<00:06:07.550> zero<00:06:07.820> to<00:06:07.850> 25%

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
took 21 minutes to go from zero to 25%

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.870 
took 21 minutes to go from zero to 25%
and<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:08.900> MacBook<00:06:09.080> Air<00:06:09.350> took<00:06:09.590> 23<00:06:10.100> minutes<00:06:10.490> to

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
and the MacBook Air took 23 minutes to

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.270 
and the MacBook Air took 23 minutes to
go<00:06:10.970> from<00:06:11.180> zero<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.660> 25%<00:06:12.320> and<00:06:12.830> that<00:06:12.979> 2<00:06:13.130> percent

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
go from zero to 25% and that 2 percent

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.159 
go from zero to 25% and that 2 percent
difference<00:06:13.790> really<00:06:14.180> isn't<00:06:14.360> anything<00:06:14.990> and<00:06:15.139> I

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
difference really isn't anything and I

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.170 
difference really isn't anything and I
couldn't<00:06:15.350> test<00:06:15.650> battery<00:06:15.889> degradation<00:06:16.400> so

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
couldn't test battery degradation so

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.090 
couldn't test battery degradation so
over<00:06:17.510> time<00:06:17.750> it's<00:06:18.110> possible<00:06:18.500> that<00:06:18.620> the<00:06:18.770> battery

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
over time it's possible that the battery

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.890 
over time it's possible that the battery
or<00:06:19.220> these<00:06:19.370> results<00:06:19.880> would<00:06:20.270> change<00:06:20.570> but

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
or these results would change but

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.540 
or these results would change but
basically<00:06:21.410> they're<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.800> same<00:06:21.979> and<00:06:22.190> because

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
basically they're the same and because

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.490 
basically they're the same and because
I'm<00:06:22.850> so<00:06:23.150> good<00:06:23.419> at<00:06:23.450> running<00:06:23.810> benchmarks<00:06:23.960> and

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
I'm so good at running benchmarks and

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.379 
I'm so good at running benchmarks and
tests<00:06:24.919> I<00:06:25.040> actually<00:06:25.520> turn<00:06:25.669> the<00:06:25.820> timer<00:06:26.120> off

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
tests I actually turn the timer off

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.719 
tests I actually turn the timer off
after<00:06:26.990> going<00:06:27.229> from<00:06:27.410> 25%<00:06:27.860> so<00:06:28.370> I<00:06:28.430> don't<00:06:28.580> have<00:06:28.669> a

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
after going from 25% so I don't have a

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.090 
after going from 25% so I don't have a
time<00:06:29.000> going<00:06:29.389> from<00:06:29.540> 0<00:06:29.780> to<00:06:29.840> 100%<00:06:30.320> but<00:06:31.010> the

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
time going from 0 to 100% but the

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.700 
time going from 0 to 100% but the
MacBook<00:06:31.460> Air<00:06:31.610> did<00:06:32.090> reach<00:06:32.360> 100%<00:06:32.870> before<00:06:33.350> the

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
MacBook Air did reach 100% before the

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.890 
MacBook Air did reach 100% before the
XPS<00:06:34.040> 13<00:06:34.160> did<00:06:34.760> concluding<00:06:35.419> this<00:06:35.540> is<00:06:35.720> pretty

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
XPS 13 did concluding this is pretty

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.710 
XPS 13 did concluding this is pretty
easy<00:06:35.990> the<00:06:36.590> XPS<00:06:36.919> 13<00:06:37.010> had<00:06:37.580> a<00:06:37.610> faster<00:06:38.090> CPU<00:06:38.240> and

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
easy the XPS 13 had a faster CPU and

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.540 
easy the XPS 13 had a faster CPU and
faster<00:06:39.200> graphics<00:06:39.650> and<00:06:40.039> while<00:06:40.160> the<00:06:40.250> MacBook

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
faster graphics and while the MacBook

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.900 
faster graphics and while the MacBook
Air<00:06:40.669> had<00:06:40.850> a<00:06:40.880> much<00:06:41.240> faster<00:06:41.479> SSD<00:06:42.140> the<00:06:42.410> XPS<00:06:42.680> 13

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
Air had a much faster SSD the XPS 13

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.279 
Air had a much faster SSD the XPS 13
actually<00:06:43.910> booted<00:06:44.270> faster<00:06:44.660> and<00:06:44.900> then<00:06:45.200> they

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
actually booted faster and then they

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:47.469 
actually booted faster and then they
both<00:06:45.440> had<00:06:45.680> similar<00:06:45.979> Wi-Fi<00:06:46.700> and<00:06:47.030> battery

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
both had similar Wi-Fi and battery

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.180 
both had similar Wi-Fi and battery
benchmarks<00:06:48.140> and<00:06:48.320> all<00:06:48.500> of<00:06:48.650> this<00:06:48.770> was<00:06:49.010> pretty

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
benchmarks and all of this was pretty

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.760 
benchmarks and all of this was pretty
much<00:06:49.280> expected<00:06:50.000> from<00:06:50.479> the<00:06:50.690> spec<00:06:50.990> sheet<00:06:51.260> but

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
much expected from the spec sheet but

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.380 
much expected from the spec sheet but
looking<00:06:52.280> at<00:06:52.400> specs<00:06:52.729> and<00:06:53.000> looking<00:06:53.270> at

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
looking at specs and looking at

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.880 
looking at specs and looking at
benchmark<00:06:53.840> results<00:06:54.200> are<00:06:54.350> totally<00:06:54.740> different

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
benchmark results are totally different

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.590 
benchmark results are totally different
things<00:06:55.070> so<00:06:55.729> either<00:06:55.940> way<00:06:56.180> I<00:06:56.210> ran<00:06:56.479> the

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
things so either way I ran the

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.360 
things so either way I ran the
benchmarks<00:06:57.080> and<00:06:57.260> these<00:06:57.500> are<00:06:57.650> the<00:06:57.740> expected

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
benchmarks and these are the expected

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.310 
benchmarks and these are the expected
results<00:06:58.880> that's<00:06:59.390> it<00:06:59.539> for<00:06:59.690> this<00:06:59.750> video<00:06:59.930> stay

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
results that's it for this video stay

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.900 
results that's it for this video stay
