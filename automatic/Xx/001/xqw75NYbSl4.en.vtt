00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 P 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.610
 hello our dear with you Kate and 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.010
 you are on the channel the path to female happiness 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.290
 Today, we with the baby will tell you 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.779
 mastic recipe that we decorate and 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.930
 decorating cakes which cake 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.029
 we will decorate today reference 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.039
 on the recipe we leave down in the infobox 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.809
 so if you haven't watched ours 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.360
 recent recipes then go on and 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.760
 look and so for mastic us 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.089
 will need candy marshmallow either 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.530
 chewing marshmallows are still called here 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.670
 double white 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.910
 it will be the basis of the fire and for the decor 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.160
 let's use such a yellow one 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.520
 smitten with kim marshmallow but if we melt 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.800
 These sweets that capital pink mass 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.090
 further we need powdered sugar and 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.210
 a little butter 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.660
 as well as some figures if you have 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.050
 or just knives forks to 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.310
 make some beautiful pattern glasses 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.310
 first we will do modularity 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:24.849
 we take vakula 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:30.530
 bowl and pour candies in a bowl 

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:33.429
 then add a piece of butter 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.789
 this is necessary for the mass to be 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:40.610
 more plastic so I think so much 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.940
 will be enough and ship either to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:48.259
 microwave or i'm in the oven 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:51.289
 for 10 minutes at 100 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.399
 degrees to make these sweets 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.399
 just or 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:09.290
 Here is our car that has already stood in 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.860
 the oven she corrected see what 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:17.810
 principle, the liquid can be purely kneaded 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.320
 mastic manually but if we do it 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.680
 manually then there may be lumps because 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.680
 very hard 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.709
 consistency sofa decoration for dots 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:39.920
 so send everything to the blender i use 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.400
 such a dog for the ruble test and sugar 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.150
 powder 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.570
 so here I have such a proportion of 200 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.420
 gram march him and 250 grams sugar 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.790
 Powder I will then look if 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.520
 must be added from afar on the hearth 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:03.160
 the consistency should be like 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.160
 plasticine in order to be able to 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:19.440
 create the desired effect sprinkle 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.160
 mold on which we will be laid 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.880
 mastic 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.190
 powdered sugar in general is something like 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.940
 on the process when we knead the dough 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.330
 only instead of flour we play here 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:42.260
 powdered sugar 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:46.560
 our wall is still pretty 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.530
 liquid would say why she should not 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.190
 stick to hands therefore and again and 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.760
 such 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.760
 frozen 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.350
 we 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.170
 but 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.370
 here we have some donut 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.870
 further we turn on necessary 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.870
 form 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.040
 Further we prepare white mastic on 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.040
 analogies 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.660
 but 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.879
 but 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.169
 at 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.430
 Here is a cake we finally got 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:05.060
 decorate everyone can from mastic by 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:08.270
 my own best wishes for us 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.730
 Here is a cake for 1 year of ours 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.190
