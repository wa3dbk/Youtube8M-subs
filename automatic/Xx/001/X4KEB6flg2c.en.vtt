iPhone and iPod begins with this grid of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.539 
iPhone and iPod begins with this grid of
stars<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.870> as<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.139> touch<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.349> screen<00:00:13.710> you

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
stars and as you touch the screen you

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.650 
stars and as you touch the screen you
draw<00:00:14.790> them<00:00:15.000> towards<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.780> gravity<00:00:17.660> so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
draw them towards you with gravity so

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.540 
draw them towards you with gravity so
it's<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.900> way<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.050> drawing<00:00:19.560> with<00:00:19.919> stars<00:00:20.279> when

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it's a way of drawing with stars when

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.300 
it's a way of drawing with stars when
you<00:00:20.580> let<00:00:20.820> go<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:21.810> come<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> halt<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.770> then

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
you let go they come to a halt and then

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
you let go they come to a halt and then
you<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.580> go<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.240> move<00:00:24.930> them<00:00:25.199> tease<00:00:25.500> them

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you can go in and move them tease them

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.279 
you can go in and move them tease them
explode<00:00:26.490> them<00:00:29.539> when<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.630> double<00:00:30.900> tap<00:00:31.050> it's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
explode them when you double tap it's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.410 
explode them when you double tap it's
possible<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> change<00:00:32.070> settings<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.059> circle
