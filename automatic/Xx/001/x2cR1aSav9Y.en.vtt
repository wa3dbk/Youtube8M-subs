time<00:01:06.140> though<00:01:06.350> unfortunately<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.549> cars<00:01:07.790> will

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
time though unfortunately the cars will

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.190 
time though unfortunately the cars will
actually<00:01:08.180> clip<00:01:08.390> through<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.659> ground<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.110> this

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
can actually have the game not time your

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.570 
can actually have the game not time your
flip<00:01:30.080> right<00:01:30.230> and<00:01:30.410> you<00:01:30.560> crash<00:01:30.890> what<00:01:31.130> sucks

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
flip right and you crash what sucks

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.250 
flip right and you crash what sucks
somehow<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.150> flipped<00:01:32.450> into<00:01:32.630> midair<00:01:32.870> there

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
somehow I flipped into midair there

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.380 
somehow I flipped into midair there
there<00:01:33.650> really<00:01:33.710> know<00:01:33.890> how<00:01:33.950> that's<00:01:34.100> possible

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
there really know how that's possible

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
can't even flip off on most of them you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.750 
can't even flip off on most of them you
just<00:01:45.710> fucking<00:01:45.920> run<00:01:46.190> into<00:01:46.460> them<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.670> nothing

happens<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:47.330> um<00:01:47.780> good<00:01:48.140> coding<00:01:48.650> there<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.310> guess

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
happens so um good coding there I guess

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.820 
happens so um good coding there I guess
let<00:01:50.210> me<00:01:50.360> know<00:01:50.510> now<00:01:50.960> if<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.200> try<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.470> flip<00:01:51.710> on

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
you will still flip so very odd

whatever I had to kind of tilt the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.679 
whatever I had to kind of tilt the
camera<00:02:13.519> down<00:02:13.760> there<00:02:13.939> for<00:02:14.090> an<00:02:14.180> epic<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.599> know

beauty hit the nitrous button which I

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.520 
beauty hit the nitrous button which I
didn't<00:02:16.069> even<00:02:16.099> get<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.730> yet<00:02:17.359> I<00:02:17.389> still<00:02:18.049> managed

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
didn't even get and yet I still managed

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.340 
didn't even get and yet I still managed
to<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.920> four

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
to get four

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.410 
to get four
first<00:02:19.500> which<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> bizarre<00:02:20.550> because<00:02:21.030> usually

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
first which is bizarre because usually

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780 
first which is bizarre because usually
the<00:02:22.350> rubber-banding<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.280> game<00:02:23.490> is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the rubber-banding on this game is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.180 
the rubber-banding on this game is
really<00:02:24.600> severe<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:26.010> almost

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
really severe like it's almost

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.920 
really severe like it's almost
impossible<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.910> get<00:02:27.030> first<00:02:27.240> place<00:02:27.330> unless<00:02:27.810> you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
impossible to get first place unless you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.930 
impossible to get first place unless you
gets<00:02:28.080> knockout<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> part<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.700> even

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
gets knockout of the part and so even

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.370 
gets knockout of the part and so even
though<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.090> ate<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.240> big<00:02:30.450> bag<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.750> shit<00:02:30.930> all<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
though I ate a big bag of shit all the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.320 
though I ate a big bag of shit all the
tricks<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.830> pulled<00:02:32.040> off<00:02:32.190> still<00:02:32.640> get<00:02:32.820> me<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> first

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
tricks I pulled off still get me a first

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.510 
tricks I pulled off still get me a first
place<00:02:33.570> time<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.740> would<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> most

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
place time this would not be the most

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.800 
place time this would not be the most
optimal<00:02:35.820> time<00:02:36.000> obviously<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.660> broke

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
optimal time obviously and I broke

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.240 
optimal time obviously and I broke
50-million<00:02:37.350> which<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.650> don't<00:02:37.800> get<00:02:37.980> anything

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
50-million which you don't get anything

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.160 
50-million which you don't get anything
for<00:02:38.490> because<00:02:38.790> nobody<00:02:39.120> ever<00:02:39.300> thinks<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.080> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
for because nobody ever thinks that you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.480 
for because nobody ever thinks that you
will<00:02:40.290> ever<00:02:40.410> get<00:02:40.620> anywhere<00:02:40.830> close<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.340> so

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
will ever get anywhere close to that so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.740 
will ever get anywhere close to that so
okay

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
okay

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.890 
okay
fast<00:02:43.590> times<00:02:45.020> 156<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.560> yeah
