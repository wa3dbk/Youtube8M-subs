00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.110
 i 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.710
 hi friends are unique weight and luciana 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.270
 Herrera director of style institute and 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.430
 today I 'm going to give you some tips 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.230
 of how to dress the different forms of 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.230
 body that will highlight their beauty 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.480
 being good in canada 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.480
 and travel 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.729
 well basically there are three types of 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.040
 bodies we do not universally have the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.720
 oval body then we have the body 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.880
 rectangular that would come to be the body 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.210
 of the models and finally we have the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.479
 pear or triangle body where the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.100
 say part of the shoulders is narrow 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.200
 but the part of the hips is more 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.149
 wide and definitely in each 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.399
 typology that is in each body shape 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.740
 they will see their variants there are people who 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.289
 they are much more marked than others there is 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.750
 body lighter pears others much more 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.550
 marked on each body would vary and 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.560
 According to the body, every woman 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.350
 you have to identify your body shape 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 and learn to dress it to highlight what 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.280
 better than you have and neutralize all 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.450
 those areas that do not favor you in 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.720
 our model has a body 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.550
 rectangular which means that the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.300
 shoulders are aligned with your hips 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.250
 okay 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.780
 they are on the same straight line what 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.659
 we have to do in this body the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.640
 goal is to generate a waist and as 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.640
 we generate waist in this way 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.259
 probably no longer have much waist 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.119
 but visually makes a cut here what 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.370
 that generates a much more silhouette 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.709
 flattering that if it did not have it in 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.820
 this case our model has a bust 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.920
 little we can do is like and 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.570
 It has little taste but it has a neck 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.030
 also long what we can do is 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.500
 generate volume in this area because what 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.840
 that we are also generating the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.820
 waist we want to generate volume in the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.500
 bust area that already has very little 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.830
 she what we can put her are 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.620
 necklaces 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.900
 large widths here then visually 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.480
 looks will go towards the part of the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:57.450
 necklace and visually the bust is going to 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:03:00.900
 highlight the body that we have here is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.660
 the inverted triangle body where the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.790
 shoulder sticks over hips in 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.940
 this body type what we have to 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.670
 work is that the hips are aligned 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 with the shoulder what we are going to do is 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.660
 as most bodies mark the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.300
 waist but we are also going to generate 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.370
 volume in this area of ​​the hips that 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.930
 they are narrow and the derriere for 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.150
 generate a volume and balance 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.459
 with the backs that are wider and 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.790
 the more more more shoulders also 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.709
 with a dress where the part of the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.450
 waist and hips that is the 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.370
 waist down is more have some 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.560
 design have some work like this that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.570
 has some folds that then what 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.610
 let's do as I said is generate 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.250
 a balance between 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.710
 and the hip is what we can do in 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.710
 the case of susan 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.580
 generate put a necklace that has a 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.400
 straight line if we have a little taste 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.220
 generous we need to wear necklines in b 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.380
 or circular is a little deeper for 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.320
 let see skin and neutralize this area 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.600
 of taste we can also put a 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.310
 Accessory that goes in a straight line 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.230
 delgadito if we do not want to highlight 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.330
 the part of the taste if we wanted 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.489
 highlight this part forward we could 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.250
 put a much more greater accessory 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.190
 thicker volume according this 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.310
 necklace cited not to drop it here in 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.490
 golden what it does is give it a look a 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.710
 little more at night a little more elegant 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.280
 although the one in the crystal necklace 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.820
 that we had previously put 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.820
 and 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.400
 this is the body pear and this body the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.160
 characteristic this body is that it is more 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.620
 narrow shoulders and backs and is 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.590
 prominent in the area of ​​the hips 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.090
 how are we going to see it here then what 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.700
 we have to work in this body 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.770
 It is also mark the waist 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.660
 usually with a thin belt and 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.670
 we have to neutralize the area of 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.890
 hips so that they do not protrude 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.140
 visually and generate a balance with 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.670
 the shoulder area and the bust this 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.880
 is what we work in this type of 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.120
 body is that we do not use any kind of 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.280
 ruffled or bobos or designs nor 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.440
 prints or any type of cut in 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.930
 this area of ​​the waist but what yes 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.900
 we find favorable are the cuts in 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.090
 skirts in type to why the skirt or 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.490
 cut type what it does is neutralize 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.190
 the area of the hips another other 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.160
 recommendation is also that the length of 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.840
 the sacks be half the derriere not 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.700
 on the hips or at the level of 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.900
 races because if not the 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.720
 excels 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.390
 this length is sac what it does is not 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.700
 neutralize or your hips covers if 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.100
 we see it for more than the sack has stripes 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.830
 horizontal but does not make it more prominent 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.120
 this area of ​​the hips than another other 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.370
 important recommendation for 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.650
 women who have wide hips if 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.710
 they want to neutralize them is to use bags 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.120
 small do not use big bags 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.760
 because the portfolio usually 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.470
 We are up to the hip truth 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.250
 If it's big we'll see that visually 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:18.550
 the hip also grow then we use 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:22.380
 small bags that those are some 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.380
 recommendations for this body type
