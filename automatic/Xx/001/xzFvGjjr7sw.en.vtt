00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.500 
lost interest in diablo 3 fairly quickly
and<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.609> fact<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:39.909> there<00:03:40.120> wasn't<00:03:40.269> any

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
and the fact that there wasn't any

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.809 
and the fact that there wasn't any
long-term<00:03:40.840> progression<00:03:41.650> or<00:03:41.709> goals<00:03:42.040> was<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.549> big

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
long-term progression or goals was a big

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.610 
long-term progression or goals was a big
part<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.150> reason<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:44.019> them<00:03:44.139> adding<00:03:44.500> this

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
part of that reason so them adding this

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.439 
part of that reason so them adding this
system<00:03:44.979> is<00:03:45.069> going<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.400> add<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.579> lot<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:45.879> it<00:03:46.299> and

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
system is going to add a lot to it and

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.360 
system is going to add a lot to it and
no<00:03:46.750> it's<00:03:46.959> not<00:03:47.049> just<00:03:47.470> an<00:03:47.650> incredibly<00:03:48.129> high
