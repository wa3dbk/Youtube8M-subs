00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.520
 Clock hands stopped 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.180
 From the time you left 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.040
 Like the grains of sand in the timer 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.280
 You went by without me 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.500
 All this way 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 It was nothing" 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.040
 We had everything in our hands 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.380
 If you leave 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.160
 Only the doubt remains. 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.240
 How far our way would have gone. 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.520
 If it is true that the road is still long 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.160
 There will be no weapons 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.880
 Neither mountains nor deserts 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.360
 There will be no turning back 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.560
 If you will forget the end of the story. 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.420
 I know I went there. 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.960
 too much time sure of myself 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.240
 I am aware that I have failed 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.740
 I will change, I swear 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.460
 All this way 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.755
 It was nothing" 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.900
 We had everything in our hands 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.720
 If you leave 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.540
 It's just the doubt 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.260
 How far would our way have gone? 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.540
 If it is true that the road is still long 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.100
 There are no weapons 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.140
 Neither mountains nor deserts 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.420
 There is no going back 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.640
 If you will forget the end of the story 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.600
 If you stay 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.780
 It will be worth it 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.240
 If you stay 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.860
 If you leave 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.800
 Only doubt is 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.080
 how far our way would have gone 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.260
 If it is true that the road is still long 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.740
 There are no weapons 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.900
 neither mountains nor deserts 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.420
 it does not happen again 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.200
 If it is true that the road is still long 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.560
 There are no weapons 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.600
 Neither mountains nor deserts 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.120
 There is no going back 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.620
 If you will forget the end of the story
