00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.269
 invited with a very different thing 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.910
 I start peeling a pound of 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.460
 sweet potato and cut into large cubes 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.710
 more or less the same size as the cubes 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.010
 of pumpkin I bought already peeled 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.649
 leads to a shape along with pumpkin 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:46.289
 spread well I'll season with two 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:49.110
 tablespoons honey salt and pepper 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.110

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.140
 all with plenty of olive oil 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.210
 mix with your hands in a corner with a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 head of whole garlic I make one 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.519
 little around olive oil well 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.670
 preheated oven at minimum temperature 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.490
 for about 30 to 45 minutes until you 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.759
 very golden while the action I do 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 liquid part of the peak soup an onion and 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.780
 salt and olive oil and cover with a liter 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.200
 of vegetable stock 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.689
 cook for about ten minutes 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.829
 some in golds and the garlic is 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.020
 Perfect to make the butter very soft 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.450
 I shoot all the cloves of garlic from within. 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.619
 of the shell and mortar takes the hamas 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.649
 I had a salt and pepper shavings together 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.630
 one lemon and then mixed with 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.280
 50 grams of butter at temperature 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.590
 average 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.930
 I've already cut the slices of baguette 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.790
 bed and brush on both sides with the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.540
 butter and bake in preheated oven 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.490
 low impotence until golden 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.940
 now that the shape has already cooled 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.370
 gradually leads to the blender 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.490
 hit with the car until the cream 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.280
 be lighter by another pan to 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.380
 heat and season with that lack of salt 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.600
 of a little bit of nutmeg 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.610
 if the cream is very thick it is only 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:31.550
 add a little more broth or 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:34.880
 water but will only get wonderful 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.300
 slightly sweet and super full of 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.170
 different flavors together and the toast 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.490
 get good with or without soup also a 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.490
