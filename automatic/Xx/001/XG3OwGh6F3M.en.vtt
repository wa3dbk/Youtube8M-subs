00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.720
 did you know that Mexico currently occupies the 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.590
 obesity first place in the world 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.590
 childish 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.710
 this condition favors the appearance 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.300
 of diseases such as diabetes type 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 2 infarcts high cholesterol levels 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.610
 renal failure between exhaustion 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.680
 others have heard again and again that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.559
 good nutrition is vital for 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
 our children grow up healthy and strong and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.670
 that eating well benefits not only your 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.519
 physical growth but also to its 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.399
 intellectual and psychological development the 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.780
 question is what is eating well what 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.780
 it implies to take a good diet 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.570
 of stripes challenges again you because 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.970
 we have to eat so many things 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.700
 nutritious clear foods 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.799
 nutrients give us energy in which 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.890
 we found the fatty proteins 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.479
 carbohydrates vitamins minerals 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.049
 always new everything our body 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.149
 you need to be healthy it's true now 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.369
 remember the proteins you find in 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.390
 foods of animal origin such as 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.070
 cow that whistle the chicken the fish besides we 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.030
 help us to be strong that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.350
 our cells are formed to play 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.509
 also thanks are sources of 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.119
 energy both those of plant origin and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.190
 animal but you have to be very careful 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.950
 because if we eat too much fat 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.479
 we could get sick the other day 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.490
 Mom told me that it is also important 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.159
 eat foods that contain 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.709
 carbohydrates sing up to serial 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.350
 etcetera so we can keep running and 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.119
 jumping like we like so much 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.930
 and your mom did not tell you one of the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.930
 vitamins and minerals 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.359
 perhaps 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.950
 I do not remember anything because the fruits and 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.140
 vegetables are the foods that most 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.239
 they have vitamins and minerals and 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.069
 we need to eat a lot of this so that 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.590
 our body can absorb and use 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.530
 all these fat proteins and carmela 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.269
 it's not that our body requires what 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.099
 that I also love the deadly ones 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.780
 he likes them a lot when they lower me 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.690
 prepared rich to take me to the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.450
 school if I like it too much 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.450
 my mother of 7 seconds and sports 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.300
 Good nutrition requires 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.270
 satisfy a need based on 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.930
 a balanced and varied diet 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.850
 this feeding must be complete this 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.800
 it means that you have all the groups 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.770
 food and therefore all 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.990
 This is achieved by including the 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.290
 less one food from each group in one 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.290
 food must also be balanced or 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.180
 is not to consume more than one or another group 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.129
 food 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.469
 we must also take care that it is 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.629
 enough remember that you have to 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:28.450
 cover the nutritional needs of 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.209
 each person according to age sex 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.489
 stature physical activity or state 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.459
 physiological another consideration 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.799
 important is to offer variety ie 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.659
 include in each meal the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.359
 three food groups that 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.489
 we will explain in a moment there is 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.489
 also take care that the food is 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:53.439
 hygienic is to say that food is 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:56.000
 prepare serve and consume with cleanliness 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.099
 finally you have to offer food 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.590
 suitable to different tastes 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.010
 customs and availability of 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.010
 same 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.180
 to close this part let's recap that 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.620
 a good diet to make 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.670
 healthy should be complete balanced 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.740
 enough varied hygienic and adequate 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.930
 then we will tackle the theme of the dish 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.090
 of good eating tool made by 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.890
 the health secretary that represents 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.840
 graphically in the three groups of 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.150
 food and in what portion should we 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.430
 to ingest we will begin with the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.640
 vegetables and fruits that are source of 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.380
 natural vitamins , minerals and fiber and 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.900
 that help the good functioning of the 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.210
 human body is important to know that 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.730
 we should consume more vegetables than fruits 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.800
 since these second ones contain more 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.890
 sugar which in large quantities 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.260
 it can be harmful we continue with the 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.890
 group of cereals and tubers such 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.730
 like bread oat pastas potato omelette 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.560
 etc 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.630
 These are the main source of energy 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.840
 that the body uses to perform 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.970
 your daily activities 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.980
 and finally there is the group of 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.380
 legumes and foods of animal origin 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.260
 and these can be pea beans 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.300
 meat chicken egg fish among others 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.460
 these foods provide 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.260
 mainly proteins that are 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.860
 necessary for growth and for 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.060
 tissue formation and repair 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.949
 finally we will give four strategies 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.310
 very useful to improve the feeding 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.319
 at home 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.240
 strategy 1 have a good home 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.039
 food availability 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.620
 this means that there are always vegetables 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.710
 and fruits within reach of children as well 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.389
 how to avoid foods like pancakes 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.669
 soft drinks and sweets although these 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:54.099
 foods may seem small have 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.099
 a lot of layoffs and thanks 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.340
 strategy 2 make a menu fun 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.350
 Take your time to cut and model 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.449
 some figures on the child's plate 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.620
 will succeed in motivating you for engineering 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:10.840
 foods that normally do not taste 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.640
 strategy 3 milk is very important 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.490
 at this stage since it generates the 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.840
 Calcium reserves for adult life 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.540
 motivate your child to ingest products 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.510
 dairy products in the case of milk avoid 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.940
 use it with sugar or chocolate instead 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.050
 of this make smoothies with fruits like 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.050
 banana or strawberry 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.230
 The fourth and final strategy is 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.750
 allow children to choose their dishes 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.490
 and cutlery remember that adults and 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.440
 Children should eat in different 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.690
 lots so with this strategy 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.850
 is motivating the little one with a plate 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.620
 own that he chooses and in this way 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.240
 he can also learn to regulate his 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.370
 portions 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.560
 the dish that the child chooses should be 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.120
 simple avoiding the drawings and colors 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.110
 since this can distract your attention 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.110
 in the food 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.640
 so we finish this little tutorial 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.260
 on child nutrition 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.270
 We hope you have been to his liking and 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.270
 that will be very useful thank you very much
