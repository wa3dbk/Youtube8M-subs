00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.470
 what purpose do I think 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.340
 I think I'm saying it 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.930
 I think of the match in the face of growth thanks to the soldiers he stressed 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:11.679
 he is the best player who failed 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.169
 most of the time the group's politics and motorcycle 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.749
 I think that winning 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.150
 I think I'm hotter 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.369
 then she has the benefit of 1,090 knee injuries 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.369
 Thursday at 0 against this price 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.050
 later 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.649
 these are no longer there 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.870
 it's basically easy to read 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 he adds that the current figures 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.320
 you would not be racist three years interfering in blogs 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.540
 finally a little worried 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.740
 I'm talking about the war 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.460
 it is an all risks insurance 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 after this phenomenon explains mrs berra 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.680
 presentation of the student social fracture 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 it is sure that it is a lot of action on this 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 a final stampa center 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.200
 this is a good thing 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.170
 on this part 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.659
 either the sum on you I think in this context I think it 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.930
 the company listed on the market I know that money does not eat at its 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.630
 hunger 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.290
 punch out his flamboyant style 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.200
 I trust that crosses the country 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 so for me 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.339
 it provides property 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.339
 what do you want 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.509

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.259
 the beautiful parasite tokyo 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.259
 in the aude on the five desrues that technical

 it applies today swinger and his players have screamed 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:48.789
 I do not want to play that bastard who recruit the most cheap 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.949
 shockwave for everything you said I think it dictates small we thought 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.949
 with mobile homes 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.499
 but its doors 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:01.330
 especially to believe it 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.860
 when we can finally smile 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.469
 that's what I ask him 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:09.469
