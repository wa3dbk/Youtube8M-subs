00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
an interesting piece of information also

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.530 
an interesting piece of information also
that<00:01:13.140> our<00:01:13.290> crankcase<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> leader<00:01:14.850> did<00:01:15.299> not

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that our crankcase is the leader did not

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.050 
that our crankcase is the leader did not
know<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.470> pretty<00:01:16.619> cool<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:17.130> always

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
know that so that's pretty cool I always

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.370 
know that so that's pretty cool I always
thought<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> was<00:01:18.330> crowbar<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.020> curb<00:01:19.229> our

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
thought it was crowbar because curb our

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.190 
thought it was crowbar because curb our
kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> lead<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.330> freeway<00:01:21.689> scene<00:01:21.930> he<00:01:22.080> was

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
kind of lead in the freeway scene he was

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.870 
kind of lead in the freeway scene he was
the<00:01:22.290> first<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.650> transform<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.700> always

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the first one to transform so I always

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
the first one to transform so I always
assumed<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.509> him<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.470> those

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
assumed it was him but to know those

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.370 
assumed it was him but to know those
crankcase<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.310> cool<00:01:26.659> crowbar<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> stealth

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
crankcase is cool crowbar is a stealth

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710 
crankcase is cool crowbar is a stealth
alpert<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.549> neat<00:01:29.850> maybe<00:01:30.509> that's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
alpert if so that's neat maybe that's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.999 
alpert if so that's neat maybe that's
why<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.930> lead<00:01:31.259> i<00:01:31.290> don't<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:32.820> um

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
why you lead i don't know and then um

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
why you lead i don't know and then um
hatchet<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.130> odd<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.670> hunting<00:01:36.000> dog<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.960> too

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
hatchet is odd the hunting dog not too

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
hatchet is odd the hunting dog not too
hard<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> figure<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.220> though<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
hard to figure out that one though and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940 
hard to figure out that one though and
he<00:01:39.119> also<00:01:39.329> said<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:39.960> each<00:01:40.140> resemble<00:01:40.710> on

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
he also said that they each resemble on

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.069 
he also said that they each resemble on
a<00:01:41.159> predator<00:01:41.640> from<00:01:41.909> aliens<00:01:42.390> vs<00:01:42.659> predators

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
a predator from aliens vs predators

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.530 
a predator from aliens vs predators
sounds<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:44.100> cool<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.640> does<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.299> know

say that which is really interesting but
there's<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.349> little<00:02:29.440> peg<00:02:29.709> on<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> back<00:02:30.129> of<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
there's a little peg on the back of the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.390

one<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.879> just<00:02:31.120> has<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.900> closed<00:02:32.349> cannon<00:02:33.190> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
one that just has the closed cannon and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.610 
one that just has the closed cannon and
then<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:34.000> with<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.180> open<00:02:34.269> cannon<00:02:34.930> plugs

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
then the one with the open cannon plugs

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.460 
then the one with the open cannon plugs
into<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.910> slot<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.900> becomes<00:02:38.200> a

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
into the slot and it becomes a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.350 
into the slot and it becomes a
double-barreled<00:02:39.250> gun<00:02:39.489> which<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.819> really<00:02:40.090> neat
