here's isn't it the new vehicle system

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.850 
here's isn't it the new vehicle system
now<00:02:57.209> instead<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.660> like<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.380> driver<00:02:58.560> gets

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
now instead of like you the driver gets

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.350 
now instead of like you the driver gets
in<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.250> past<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.550> get<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.150> they

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
in and the past you get in you have they

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.660 
in and the past you get in you have they
like<00:03:00.540> get<00:03:00.750> close<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.260> actual<00:03:01.500> enter<00:03:02.400> point

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
like get close to the actual enter point

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.580 
like get close to the actual enter point
so<00:03:03.240> if<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.570> close<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> here<00:03:04.080> I'll<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.440> into

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
so if I get close to here I'll get into

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.080 
so if I get close to here I'll get into

get into any of these like passengers
like<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.790> Gunners<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> guy

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.690 

and<00:03:20.720> all<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.959> works<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.739> multiplayer<00:03:23.489> and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
and all this works for multiplayer and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.370 
and all this works for multiplayer and
stuff<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.760> vehicle<00:03:27.120> controls<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.630> also

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
stuff and the vehicle controls have also

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.890 
stuff and the vehicle controls have also
been<00:03:28.530> remade<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.220> if<00:03:29.430> i<00:03:29.610> get<00:03:29.910> into<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.390> driver

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
been remade so if i get into the driver

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.320 
been remade so if i get into the driver
now<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:32.070> helicopter<00:03:32.580> takes<00:03:32.790> into

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
now the helicopter takes into

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.100 
now the helicopter takes into
consideration<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:35.280> blade<00:03:36.180> rotation<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:36.870> I

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
consideration of the blade rotation so I

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.460 
consideration of the blade rotation so I
look<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.130> W<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.239> play<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.690> keep<00:03:39.989> going

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
look like W and the play to keep going

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.580 
look like W and the play to keep going
up<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.510> keep<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.540> faster<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.200> then<00:03:43.500> you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
up and keep going faster and then you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.860 
up and keep going faster and then you
get<00:03:43.739> higher<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:45.030> see<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.330> cameras<00:03:45.690> way

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
get higher and you see the cameras way

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.020 
get higher and you see the cameras way
in<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.050> vehicle<00:03:46.440> now<00:03:46.620> there's<00:03:47.550> cameras<00:03:47.850> way

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
in the vehicle now there's cameras way

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.660 
in the vehicle now there's cameras way
so<00:03:48.269> you're<00:03:48.450> not<00:03:48.600> like<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> piece<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.260> rock

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
so you're not like a piece of rock

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.850 
so you're not like a piece of rock
sitting<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.060> cockpit<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.720> now<00:03:52.350> the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
sitting in the cockpit and now the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.370 
sitting in the cockpit and now the
helicopter<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> lot<00:03:53.850> faster<00:03:54.269> before<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.260> had

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
helicopter a lot faster before you had

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.590 
helicopter a lot faster before you had
the<00:03:55.680> entire<00:03:56.430> force<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.970> helicopter<00:03:57.120> was

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
the entire force of the helicopter was

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.229 
the entire force of the helicopter was
by<00:03:57.750> going<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.440> upwards<00:03:58.830> force<00:03:59.100> now<00:03:59.790> it

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
by going the upwards force now it

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.390 
by going the upwards force now it
actually<00:04:00.870> applies<00:04:01.320> forward<00:04:01.800> force<00:04:02.100> when

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
actually applies forward force when

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.860 
actually applies forward force when
you're<00:04:02.550> tilting<00:04:02.970> forward<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
you're tilting forward and the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.820 
you're tilting forward and the
helicopter<00:04:04.080> still<00:04:04.680> shoots<00:04:05.010> this<00:04:05.910> missiles

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
helicopter still shoots this missiles

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.180 
helicopter still shoots this missiles
and<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:09.120> can<00:04:09.269> actually<00:04:09.600> show<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.290> hit

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
and I can actually show you the hit

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.039 
and I can actually show you the hit
markers<00:04:11.670> if<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.120> hit<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.420> tank<00:04:12.600> which<00:04:12.930> I

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
markers if I can hit that tank which I

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.159 
markers if I can hit that tank which I
can't<00:04:13.320> convince<00:04:13.650> voice<00:04:14.459> there<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.959> see<00:04:15.989> the

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
can't convince voice there you see the

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.380 
can't convince voice there you see the
hell<00:04:16.380> hit<00:04:17.040> marker<00:04:17.370> there<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:17.760> also<00:04:18.120> i've

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
hell hit marker there and also i've

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.120 
hell hit marker there and also i've
added<00:04:18.630> parachutes<00:04:19.229> and<00:04:19.410> parachutes<00:04:19.799> are<00:04:19.919> very

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
added parachutes and parachutes are very

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.990 
added parachutes and parachutes are very
work<00:04:20.640> in<00:04:20.790> progress<00:04:20.970> they<00:04:21.479> are

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
work in progress they are

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.170 
work in progress they are
messed<00:04:22.570> up<00:04:22.690> so<00:04:22.900> if<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.140> jump<00:04:23.380> out<00:04:23.910> press<00:04:24.910> space

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
messed up so if I jump out press space

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.210 
messed up so if I jump out press space
open<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.750> parachute<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.410> as<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:27.040> can<00:04:27.190> see

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
open the parachute and as you can see

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.410 
open the parachute and as you can see
the<00:04:28.000> tourneys<00:04:28.330> last<00:04:28.540> lower<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.110> now<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.100> the

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
the tourneys last lower and now the the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.630 
the tourneys last lower and now the the
vehicle<00:04:31.420> is<00:04:31.540> instead<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:32.110> before<00:04:32.350> if<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.400> get

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
vehicle is instead of before if you get

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.300 
vehicle is instead of before if you get
out<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:34.030> them<00:04:34.180> they<00:04:34.990> would<00:04:35.230> just<00:04:35.260> stop<00:04:36.010> in

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
out of them they would just stop in

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.100 
out of them they would just stop in
midair<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.700> fall<00:04:36.880> down<00:04:36.910> now<00:04:37.390> they<00:04:37.690> actually

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
midair and fall down now they actually

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.370 
midair and fall down now they actually
continue<00:04:38.560> their<00:04:38.770> original<00:04:39.870> their<00:04:40.870> original

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
continue their original their original

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.110 
continue their original their original
velocity<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.040> that<00:04:42.310> plate<00:04:42.610> will<00:04:42.790> actually

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
velocity and that plate will actually

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.650 
velocity and that plate will actually
continuously<00:04:43.720> get<00:04:44.080> slower<00:04:44.760> if<00:04:45.760> you're<00:04:46.240> not<00:04:46.480> in

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
continuously get slower if you're not in

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.990 
continuously get slower if you're not in
the<00:04:46.690> vehicle<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:47.260> now<00:04:47.440> let<00:04:47.800> me<00:04:47.830> get<00:04:48.100> into<00:04:48.640> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
the vehicle so now let me get into the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.440 
the vehicle so now let me get into the
car<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:50.860> here's<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.280> car<00:04:51.460> has<00:04:51.670> three<00:04:52.090> seats

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
car so here's the car has three seats

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.330 
car so here's the car has three seats
and<00:04:53.140> one<00:04:53.290> better<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:56.020> gunner<00:04:56.230> aiming<00:04:57.160> is<00:04:57.310> a

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
and one better the gunner aiming is a

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.040 
and one better the gunner aiming is a
little<00:04:57.580> messed<00:04:57.760> up<00:04:57.880> on<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.120> car<00:04:58.360> there's<00:04:58.810> one

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
little messed up on the car there's one

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.780 
little messed up on the car there's one
passenger<00:04:59.650> where<00:04:59.890> you<00:04:59.980> can<00:05:00.130> sit<00:05:00.340> here<00:05:00.730> and

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
passenger where you can sit here and

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.280 
passenger where you can sit here and
then<00:05:01.210> there<00:05:01.540> is<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:02.160> driver<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:04.390> car<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.020> lot

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
then there is a driver the car is a lot

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.320 
then there is a driver the car is a lot
better<00:05:05.590> now<00:05:05.890> before<00:05:06.520> you<00:05:06.640> can<00:05:06.790> actually<00:05:06.940> drive

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
better now before you can actually drive

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.909 
better now before you can actually drive
into<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.660> sky<00:05:07.960> now<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.530> takes<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:08.830> in

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
into the sky now it takes it in

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.350 
into the sky now it takes it in
consideration<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.640> if<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:09.940> car<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.240> actually

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
consideration and if the car is actually

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.770 
consideration and if the car is actually
on<00:05:10.630> the<00:05:10.660> ground<00:05:11.110> before<00:05:11.410> applying<00:05:11.830> force<00:05:12.280> and

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
on the ground before applying force and

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.390 
on the ground before applying force and
the<00:05:13.780> cameras<00:05:14.230> way<00:05:14.410> it<00:05:14.560> just<00:05:14.590> makes<00:05:14.950> it<00:05:15.100> feel<00:05:15.340> a

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
the cameras way it just makes it feel a

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.220 
the cameras way it just makes it feel a
lot<00:05:15.520> better<00:05:15.730> and<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:17.350> can<00:05:17.530> even<00:05:17.710> drift<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:20.080> if

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
lot better and you can even drift so if

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.110 
lot better and you can even drift so if
I<00:05:20.380> do<00:05:20.440> this<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:20.830> can<00:05:21.190> drift<00:05:21.520> forward<00:05:21.790> like<00:05:22.090> a

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
I do this you can drift forward like a

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.070 
I do this you can drift forward like a
little<00:05:22.419> bit<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:24.340> then<00:05:24.419> if<00:05:25.419> I<00:05:25.540> get<00:05:25.750> out<00:05:25.930> of<00:05:25.990> the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
little bit and then if I get out of the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.700 
little bit and then if I get out of the
car<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:26.650> there's<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.340> tank<00:05:28.290> well<00:05:29.290> let's<00:05:29.530> get

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
car and there's the tank well let's get

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.140 
car and there's the tank well let's get
into<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.979> driver<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.520> tangles<00:05:30.850> out<00:05:30.940> black

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
into the driver the tangles out black

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.909 
into the driver the tangles out black
and<00:05:31.360> white<00:05:31.479> which<00:05:31.720> will<00:05:32.020> be<00:05:32.140> changed<00:05:32.740> I'm

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
and white which will be changed I'm

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.800 
and white which will be changed I'm
going<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.400> make<00:05:33.550> it<00:05:33.669> like<00:05:33.820> green<00:05:34.180> tint<00:05:34.510> because

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
going to make it like green tint because

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.790 
black and white your swords are crap but
now<00:05:37.000> you<00:05:37.060> can<00:05:37.330> see<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.630> turret<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.229> stuff<00:05:38.560> and

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
now you can see the turret and stuff and

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.890 
now you can see the turret and stuff and
you<00:05:39.760> approach<00:05:40.570> shoot<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.290> there's<00:05:42.100> two<00:05:42.550> seats

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
you approach shoot and there's two seats

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.030 
you approach shoot and there's two seats
there's<00:05:43.900> actually<00:05:44.169> three<00:05:44.200> seats<00:05:44.620> on<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:44.770> tank

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
there's actually three seats on the tank

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.670 
there's actually three seats on the tank
because<00:05:45.220> I<00:05:45.340> threw<00:05:45.669> in<00:05:46.080> too<00:05:47.080> many<00:05:47.260> guns<00:05:47.470> who

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
because I threw in too many guns who

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.700 
because I threw in too many guns who
said<00:05:47.860> one<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:48.850> you<00:05:49.450> can<00:05:49.690> get<00:05:50.050> in<00:05:50.169> left<00:05:50.470> gunner

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
Marcus if you shoot the vehicle right

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.330 
Marcus if you shoot the vehicle right
I'll<00:06:09.260> actually<00:06:09.470> get<00:06:09.770> hit<00:06:09.830> markers<00:06:10.400> and<00:06:10.700> yeah

I'll actually get hit markers and yeah

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.880 
I'll actually get hit markers and yeah
so<00:06:13.340> other<00:06:14.090> than<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.360> all<00:06:14.510> we<00:06:14.870> have<00:06:15.080> is<00:06:15.410> really

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
so other than that all we have is really

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.500 
so other than that all we have is really
to<00:06:16.040> show<00:06:16.190> is<00:06:16.340> a<00:06:16.370> kill<00:06:16.610> fee<00:06:16.790> but<00:06:17.000> I<00:06:17.060> don't<00:06:17.270> think

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
to show is a kill fee but I don't think

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.940 
to show is a kill fee but I don't think
that<00:06:17.570> we<00:06:17.840> actually<00:06:17.990> be<00:06:18.260> shown<00:06:18.530> in<00:06:18.560> this<00:06:18.770> video

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
that we actually be shown in this video

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.640 
that we actually be shown in this video
