 Hello, today I want to talk about 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:10.639
 bags and bags which was to choose where 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.830

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.910
 I mean just ball here is such a 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.680
 bag with handle well and with a strap just under 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.770
 this term sell anything 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.040
 starting from the amount of some kind of road 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.190
 backpacks with straps there idle all in 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.050
 than these straps they add not 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.800
 only here is Nikita clinging 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.929

 fittings then straps it first 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.359
 will weigh under a kilogram a 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:54.170
 secondly it will be difficult to roll it 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.670
 roll such a small lump because 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.760
 that u can have their main chip 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.679
 roll up a little bundle but when you need to 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.989
 unwind stuff there junk and 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.699
 move a short distance along the street 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.369
 and it is real to transfer to quite 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.700
 small distance and or second 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:15.829
 bowl option is a back bag for neither 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.710
 rich people who have no money 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:23.119
 on the backpack here is such a sexy crew 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.579
 if there is no money for some backpack on 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.590
 something you do not want to spend and you 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.670
 let's say you need to wear something temporarily 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.310
 the bow 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.380
 normal thing but shoulder rubs me wildly 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.840
 This one has only been worn. 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.310
 so here is a cross to the cross behind but 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.700
 all the same wildly uncomfortable clean 100 meters 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.219
 threw all the bags than they are good 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.070
 high volume then 60 liters all this 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.869
 Soviet somewhere 70 trunks so big 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.450
 volume have them stuffed some heavy 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.670
 things will be impossible to wear them 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.159
 too hard and will rub 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.439
 Well 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.360
 it all comes out of it 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.580
 you have a ball and so where you need to buy 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.620
 decide you want at least three bowl 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.140
 there is such a shabby style 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.269
 army greenenky there grayish or 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.430
 you want you don't need it you can 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.120
 take her modern spoil modern 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.260
 bullet weight tarot 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.530
 There with plastic such handles slings from 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.510
 modern if you want modern 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.209
 it's such as Turov on my 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.790
 he has some drawbacks for example 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.040
 here is a plastic frame and it is sewn 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.280
 it is not clear how in this seam I am afraid 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.170
 the inscription will break out here he has a hefty 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.260
 hunter it is 0mg they are very rubs 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.090
 of course this place is often on the shoulder 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.819
 especially when clothes are a little on the shoulder 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.260
 No, well, then he is easy to eat 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.640
 modern then just on the internet you can 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.450
 see the tourist shop 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.250
 equipment somewhere else while even 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.359
 for example, ebay sells modern 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.190
 bags and trunks well, because you want to here such 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.290
 here is the world 3 then I would walk around the flea markets 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.510
 somehow where trade in the army was 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.910
 I live in St. Petersburg 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.060
 a lot of these and if you are somewhere not very 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.599
 big city then shops selling 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.000
 Here are purely military such a brand is well 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.349
 not brands of other countries in general 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.819
 shells selling here go in there and 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.620
 here is the last option i am not very 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.349
 I recommend it because on the internet when 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.180
 you order was here such here this bowl 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.690
 you can run into such a hell and 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 a little bit there you won't like it and if you 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.700
 personally bought from the seller personally 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.859
 you can and bargain in general on ebay I 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.260
 leave in the description of the words for which 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.919
 punch these bags and bags here and you can 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:59.080
 choose directly copy on ebay 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:03.440
 there is a search string and throw out balchik 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.000
 so this balloon 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.270
 in general it is now a Soviet sleeping bag 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.180
 lies i first thought and vasya do 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.700
 as a bag bout writes this strap well then 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.190
 I liked the sleeping bag so much that I decided 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.060
 still wanted to leave in the summer of this review 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.650
 miracle sleeping bags 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.930
 so subscribe to the channel will be in 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.860
 him to sleep there in the woods in the summer and tell 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.660
 your feelings 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.460
 the thing is so powerful securely so the pipe st and 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.320
 in principle, probably all 60 liters 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.960
 optimal volume is heavier already 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.140
 drag less makes no sense because 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.020
 that bulky stuff there figs on shove 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.980
 the optimal size is 60 liters here in 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.700
 Basically, this is all 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.040

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.680
