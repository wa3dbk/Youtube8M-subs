00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.230
 in our live section of the law 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.970
 we help you better understand your 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.010
 rights are you wondering if it's worth the 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.570
 shot to challenge a pv or you have 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.270
 just need a legal opinion 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.580
 to answer it we made an appointment 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.480
 you with a lawyer specializing in 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.480
 the Highway Code 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.840
 not at all allowed white saturday nothing 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.059
 it was vrp but it exists closer 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.920
 forbidden today I was told that the 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.260
 allowed white no longer existed 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.969
 I read on the website of the public service 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.030
 suspension of driving license 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 could well be arranged then 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.550
 what is it about philippe of toul 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.680
 so for a few years actually the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.170
 legislator has changed things in this 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.829
 therefore for the offenses the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.699
 more serious 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.979
 before there was the possibility 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.809
 to obtain a blank license and therefore 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.970
 to be able to continue working and 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.379
 outside work ranges and 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.430
 professional activities we did not have 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.470
 not the right to drive 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.729
 but now it's more possible to 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.150
 everything for the most offenses 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.939
 serious 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.500
 so an example speeding the 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.689
 plus 50 km time there is more than 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.400
 possibility of obtaining a development of 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.470
 the suspension of the driving license 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.850
 for no offense elsewhere road yes 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.950
 but then for the offenses so a 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.299
 little bit less important we are 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.189
 agree that it's totally possible 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.079
 then for example speeding 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.490
 more than 30 km / hour at most 40km 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.409
 art is quite possible 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.509
 and I pls it very often and in 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.990
 practice does it happen often from 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.359
 get 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.549
 so by asking him by the voice of a 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.140
 naveau case is well justified there 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.429
 happens but now it's still 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.020
 something that is very rare because 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.759
 that it's not very well known and then 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.079
 judges are reluctant enough to 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.729
 doctors in place because that's enough 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.740
 heavy in the execution of 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.810
 sentences in fact since there is a follow-up 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.249
 the administration that will have to replace 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.960
 the driver's license and then follow 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.909
 things very closely so that's it 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.200
 rather a problem in practice after 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.569
 to implement it 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.159
 It is clear that this 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.020
 accommodation of the sentence is not so 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.759
 frequent but it is also true that he 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.429
 is not much asked of 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.929
 judges the lawyers certainly the plaid but 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.550
 before the local courts and 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.640
 police courts that manages well 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.500
 this particular litigation the defendants 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.000
 often come alone without 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.040
 the assistance of a lawyer 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.080
 especially letting know 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.420
 their rights we will never repeat it 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.599
 enough in our chronicles a defense is 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.599
 prepare
