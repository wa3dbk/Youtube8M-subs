00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
going to sit right back here and you're

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.280 
going to sit right back here and you're
just<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> crouch<00:00:37.800> um<00:00:38.510> you<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.809> not<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
just going to crouch um you it's not the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.780 
just going to crouch um you it's not the
greatest<00:00:40.469> part<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.129> people<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.550> still

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
greatest part because people can still

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.240 
greatest part because people can still
get<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:43.200> don't<00:00:43.469> usually<00:00:43.770> expect

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
get to you but they don't usually expect

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
just gonna get it down waiting for it to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.690 
just gonna get it down waiting for it to
plant<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.860> all<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.100> we're<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> run

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700

straight over here and this one you do
need<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> thermal<00:01:41.310> sight<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.850> very

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
need a thermal sight for it's very

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
need a thermal sight for it's very
difficult<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.720> without<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:43.500> just

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
difficult to see without you're just

can see the bomb right there and you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
can see the bomb right there and you

should be able to see anybody on it you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.899 
should be able to see anybody on it you
could<00:01:49.380> use<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> regular<00:01:50.130> side<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.700> it'd<00:01:50.790> be

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
could use a regular side but it'd be

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730 
could use a regular side but it'd be
kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.659> difficult<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.439> through<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
kind of difficult to see through the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.889 
kind of difficult to see through the
flames<00:01:53.040> only<00:01:53.820> issue<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.390> spot<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.750> your

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
left side is open so this would be good

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.550 
left side is open so this would be good
if<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.820> somebody<00:01:57.180> sitting<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> back

of<00:03:05.590> course<00:03:05.800> you<00:03:05.950> don't<00:03:06.100> need<00:03:06.310> thermal<00:03:06.700> for

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
of course you don't need thermal for

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.480 
of course you don't need thermal for
this<00:03:06.970> spot<00:03:07.240> either<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:08.590> just<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.370> know

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
this spot either it's just you know

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.030 
this spot either it's just you know
pretty<00:03:09.700> easy<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:10.210> to<00:03:10.300> see<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.690> course<00:03:11.350> they

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
pretty easy one to see of course they

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.770 
pretty easy one to see of course they
could<00:03:12.310> run<00:03:12.580> through<00:03:12.790> here<00:03:12.970> but<00:03:13.150> nobody<00:03:13.540> ever

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
could run through here but nobody ever

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.530 
could run through here but nobody ever
really<00:03:14.020> does<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.430> they'll<00:03:16.300> usually

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
really does that and they'll usually

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.750 
really does that and they'll usually
just<00:03:16.900> jump<00:03:17.200> over<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.770> they'll<00:03:17.920> check<00:03:18.520> this

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
just jump over and they'll check this

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.640 
just jump over and they'll check this
area<00:03:19.180> here<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> wouldn't<00:03:20.050> lay<00:03:20.140> here<00:03:20.410> plus

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
area here so I wouldn't lay here plus

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.200 
area here so I wouldn't lay here plus
it's<00:03:20.830> easier<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.250> see<00:03:21.430> people<00:03:21.790> like<00:03:21.910> I'll<00:03:22.030> show

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
it's easier to see people like I'll show

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.420 
it's easier to see people like I'll show
you<00:03:22.270> real<00:03:22.480> quick<00:03:22.650> when<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.740> come<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.310> you

you real quick when you come and you

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.150 
you real quick when you come and you
when<00:03:24.940> they're<00:03:25.120> defusing<00:03:25.870> it's<00:03:26.440> easy<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:26.950> see

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
when they're defusing it's easy to see

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.130 
when they're defusing it's easy to see
between<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.790> dumpster<00:03:28.240> right<00:03:28.540> there<00:03:28.600> but<00:03:28.960> the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
between the dumpster right there but the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.770 
between the dumpster right there but the
pallets<00:03:29.980> back<00:03:30.220> there<00:03:30.490> it<00:03:31.060> doesn't<00:03:31.540> really

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
pallets back there it doesn't really

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.210 
pallets back there it doesn't really
look<00:03:32.050> like<00:03:32.110> anybody's<00:03:32.770> there<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.160> very

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
look like anybody's there it's very

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.160 
look like anybody's there it's very
difficult<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.970> see<00:03:34.240> people<00:03:34.660> have<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.990> of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
difficult to see people have to of

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.690 
difficult to see people have to of
course<00:03:35.350> be<00:03:35.530> looking<00:03:35.560> for<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.190> then<00:03:36.550> of

and what we're going to do this time

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.750 
and what we're going to do this time
this<00:04:00.189> one<00:04:00.599> is<00:04:01.599> actually<00:04:01.930> best<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:03.069> feel<00:04:03.519> without

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
this one is actually best I feel without

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.059 
this one is actually best I feel without
a<00:04:03.969> thermal<00:04:04.480> sight<00:04:04.689> although<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.109> can<00:04:05.500> use<00:04:05.530> one

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
a thermal sight although you can use one

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.800 
a thermal sight although you can use one
it's<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.299> little<00:04:07.420> more<00:04:07.599> difficult

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
it's just a little more difficult

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.539 
it's just a little more difficult
especially<00:04:08.439> if<00:04:08.769> they<00:04:08.859> have<00:04:08.890> cold-blooded<00:04:09.459> so

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
especially if they have cold-blooded so

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.130 
especially if they have cold-blooded so
you<00:04:09.609> want<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.819> go<00:04:09.939> as<00:04:10.000> far<00:04:10.359> over<00:04:10.390> as<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:10.930> can

easily when I'm not sculpting you can
see<00:04:34.660> it<00:04:34.750> beeping<00:04:35.110> if<00:04:35.289> somebody<00:04:35.620> gets<00:04:35.740> on<00:04:35.949> it

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
attention though it's a little bit

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.760 
attention though it's a little bit
difficult<00:04:39.759> to<00:04:40.090> see<00:04:40.360> but<00:04:40.960> they're<00:04:41.440> probably

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
difficult to see but they're probably

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.279 
difficult to see but they're probably
not<00:04:42.190> going<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.460> see<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.789> it's<00:04:43.030> very<00:04:43.289> unlikely

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
not going to see you it's very unlikely

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.680 
not going to see you it's very unlikely
I<00:04:45.220> doubt<00:04:45.669> anybody's<00:04:46.210> going<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.389> come<00:04:46.660> through

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
I doubt anybody's going to come through

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.210 
I doubt anybody's going to come through
the<00:04:46.900> flank<00:04:47.259> this<00:04:47.500> far<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:47.889> if<00:04:48.009> they<00:04:48.160> do

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
the flank this far and if they do

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.070 
the flank this far and if they do
they'll<00:04:48.580> probably<00:04:48.759> go<00:04:49.150> on<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.389> roof<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.630> check

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
they'll probably go on the roof to check

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.969 
they'll probably go on the roof to check
it<00:04:50.400> one<00:04:51.400> last<00:04:52.120> thing<00:04:52.539> you<00:04:52.599> can<00:04:52.840> do<00:04:53.169> is<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:53.949> can
