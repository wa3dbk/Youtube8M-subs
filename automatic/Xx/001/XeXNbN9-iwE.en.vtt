video in today's video I've got a cool

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.370 
video in today's video I've got a cool
technique<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.580> for<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.300> called<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.929> chuck

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
technique and for you called a chuck

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.230 
technique and for you called a chuck
some<00:00:10.950> people<00:00:11.219> call<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.519> Chuck<00:00:11.820> other

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
some people call it the Chuck other

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.169 
some people call it the Chuck other
people<00:00:12.599> call<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.110> ghost<00:00:13.620> note<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.580> whichever

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
people call it a ghost note so whichever

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.570 
people call it a ghost note so whichever
way<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:15.990> refer<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.980> basically<00:00:17.460> just

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
way you refer to it it's basically just

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.140 
way you refer to it it's basically just
like<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.210> percussive<00:00:19.170> hit<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.550> guitar<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
like a percussive hit on the guitar and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.679 
like a percussive hit on the guitar and
there's<00:00:21.630> two<00:00:21.900> ways<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.590> actually

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
there's two ways that you can actually

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.720 
there's two ways that you can actually
produce<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.140> percussive<00:00:25.710> sound<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.460> first

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
produce this percussive sound the first

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.820 
produce this percussive sound the first
way<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.570> taking<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.500> almost<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
way is just a taking it's almost like a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.740 
way is just a taking it's almost like a
karate<00:00:29.189> chop<00:00:29.840> movement<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:32.630> heating<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
karate chop movement and heating it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.670 
karate chop movement and heating it
against<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.410> guitar<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> there's<00:00:37.290> actually

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
against the guitar so there's actually

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.900 
against the guitar so there's actually
two<00:00:38.040> ways<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.820> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
two ways in which you can do this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.760 
two ways in which you can do this
specific<00:00:39.480> technique<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> first<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.440> just

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
specific technique the first one is just

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.840 
specific technique the first one is just
lightly<00:00:42.079> where<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.350> slap<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> strings<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
lightly where you slap the strings so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
lightly where you slap the strings so
that<00:00:45.000> they<00:00:45.149> hit<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.840> fridge<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> then

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that they hit the fridge and then

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.040 
that they hit the fridge and then
produced<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.160> them<00:00:47.660> that<00:00:48.660> sound<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:51.660> second

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
produced at them that sound the second

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.029 
produced at them that sound the second
waves<00:00:52.199> where<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.500> hear<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:52.890> bit

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
waves where you hear it a little bit

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.729 
waves where you hear it a little bit
harder<00:00:55.640> we<00:00:56.640> getting<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.719> actual<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
harder we getting and the actual like a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
bit more of a drum sound on the actual

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000 
bit more of a drum sound on the actual

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.200 

alright<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> sounds<00:01:55.620> of<00:01:55.890> IBM<00:01:56.640> actually

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
alright so that sounds of IBM actually

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.290 
alright so that sounds of IBM actually
making<00:01:57.420> use<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:58.980> of<00:01:59.190> heat<00:02:00.120> on

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
making use of that because of heat on

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.480 
making use of that because of heat on
the<00:02:00.510> guitar<00:02:00.840> instead<00:02:01.440> of<00:02:01.560> using<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.890> tie<00:02:02.130> or<00:02:02.160> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the guitar instead of using a tie or a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.020 
the guitar instead of using a tie or a
rest<00:02:02.910> I'm<00:02:03.120> actually<00:02:03.980> producing<00:02:04.980> a<00:02:05.130> purely

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
rest I'm actually producing a purely

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.790 
rest I'm actually producing a purely
percussive<00:02:06.570> tone<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> guitar<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
percussive tone on on the guitar a

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.710 
percussive tone on on the guitar a
second<00:02:08.580> way<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.000> produce<00:02:09.270> these

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
second way that I can produce these

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.320 
second way that I can produce these
ghost<00:02:10.050> notes<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.680> by<00:02:11.010> just<00:02:11.340> lightly<00:02:11.730> touching

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
ghost notes is by just lightly touching

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.440 
ghost notes is by just lightly touching
the<00:02:12.450> strings<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:15.000> strumming<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
the strings and then strumming the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.580 
the strings and then strumming the
guitar<00:02:18.950> don't<00:02:19.950> press<00:02:20.190> too<00:02:20.220> odd<00:02:21.380> because<00:02:22.380> then

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
guitar don't press too odd because then

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.020 
guitar don't press too odd because then
you'll<00:02:22.710> get<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.950> know<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.130> ring<00:02:23.430> out<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.610> don't

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you'll get to know to ring out and don't

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.120 
you'll get to know to ring out and don't
press<00:02:24.600> too<00:02:24.750> likely<00:02:25.110> around<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.160> 5th<00:02:26.430> fret<00:02:28.130> 7th

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
press too likely around the 5th fret 7th

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.700 
press too likely around the 5th fret 7th
fret<00:02:29.310> because<00:02:29.490> then<00:02:29.880> you're<00:02:30.060> going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.300> get

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
fret because then you're going to get

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.660 
fret because then you're going to get
harmonics<00:02:31.710> all<00:02:32.130> right<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.620> let's<00:02:34.620> let's<00:02:35.400> move

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
harmonics all right so let's let's move

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.790 
harmonics all right so let's let's move
the<00:02:35.850> chord<00:02:36.120> shapes<00:02:36.480> again<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.020> because<00:02:37.650> these

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
the chord shapes again and because these

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.530 
the chord shapes again and because these
work<00:02:38.040> better<00:02:38.280> with<00:02:38.520> bar<00:02:38.820> chords<00:02:39.210> so<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.450> I'm

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
work better with bar chords so what I'm

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.900 
work better with bar chords so what I'm
going<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.690> do<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.290> want<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.560> play<00:02:40.710> if<00:02:42.320> G<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.700> a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
going to do is want to play if G and a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.860 
going to do is want to play if G and a
minor<00:02:46.850> all<00:02:47.850> right<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.210> I'm<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.780> use

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
minor all right and I'm going to use

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.620 
minor all right and I'm going to use
that<00:02:48.960> same<00:02:49.260> rhythm<00:02:49.500> but<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.400> b3<00:02:50.850> instead<00:02:51.480> of

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
that same rhythm but on b3 instead of

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.770 
that same rhythm but on b3 instead of
using<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.010> karate<00:02:53.370> chop<00:02:53.780> style

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
using like this karate chop style

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.420 
using like this karate chop style
technique<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.350> produce<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.920> because<00:02:56.280> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
technique to produce that because of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.979 
technique to produce that because of
tone<00:02:56.700> I'm<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:58.220> strum<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.550> by<00:03:00.420> by

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
tone I'm going to strum it and by by

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.540 
tone I'm going to strum it and by by
releasing<00:03:01.350> my<00:03:01.590> left<00:03:01.770> hand<00:03:01.920> pressure<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.400> of

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
releasing my left hand pressure on of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.740 
releasing my left hand pressure on of
the<00:03:02.790> chord<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:04.170> i<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:05.600> strike<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the chord and then i can just strike the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.360 
the chord and then i can just strike the
strings<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.380> will<00:03:07.650> give<00:03:07.830> me<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:08.010> ghost

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
strings and it will give me a ghost

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.040 
strings and it will give me a ghost
notes<00:03:08.610> sound<00:03:08.850> as<00:03:09.000> well<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.840> going<00:03:09.930> to

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
notes sound as well so this is going to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:28.559 
notes sound as well so this is going to
sound<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.350> this

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.910 

okay<00:03:29.569> so<00:03:29.629> there's<00:03:29.989> two<00:03:30.290> ways<00:03:30.500> for<00:03:30.800> you<00:03:30.890> to

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
okay so there's two ways for you to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.610 
okay so there's two ways for you to
incorporate<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.870> percussive<00:03:32.870> element<00:03:33.470> into

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
incorporate a percussive element into

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.900 
incorporate a percussive element into
your<00:03:33.860> playing<00:03:34.069> one<00:03:34.340> is<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.550> karate<00:03:34.879> chop

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
your playing one is the karate chop

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.040 
your playing one is the karate chop
style<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.560> second<00:03:36.890> one<00:03:36.980> is<00:03:37.160> their<00:03:38.050> kind

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
style and the second one is their kind

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.800 
style and the second one is their kind
of<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.260> ghost<00:03:39.530> note<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.099> we<00:03:41.060> touch<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.390> strings

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
of a ghost note and we touch the strings

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.750 
of a ghost note and we touch the strings
and<00:03:42.050> then<00:03:42.170> you're<00:03:42.260> able<00:03:42.319> to<00:03:42.530> do<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:43.129> strum<00:03:43.730> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
and then you're able to do to strum the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.339 
and then you're able to do to strum the
strings<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.330> get<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.599> for<00:03:44.810> cos<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.140> tone

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
strings and get that for cos of tone

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.170 
strings and get that for cos of tone
appening<00:03:45.739> all<00:03:46.340> right<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:46.640> now<00:03:46.849> we've<00:03:47.090> looked

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
appening all right so now we've looked

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.120 
appening all right so now we've looked
at<00:03:47.330> quite<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.569> bit<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:47.959> far<00:03:48.200> we've<00:03:48.709> checked<00:03:48.950> out

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
at quite a bit so far we've checked out

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.850 
at quite a bit so far we've checked out
them<00:03:49.489> how<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.060> use<00:03:50.180> ties<00:03:50.630> we've<00:03:51.290> used<00:03:51.620> their

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
them how to use ties we've used their

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.910 
them how to use ties we've used their
wrists<00:03:52.660> we've<00:03:53.660> also<00:03:53.870> used<00:03:54.200> we<00:03:54.620> look<00:03:54.769> at

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
wrists we've also used we look at

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.740 
wrists we've also used we look at
anticipation<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:56.030> now<00:03:56.299> we've<00:03:56.480> looked<00:03:56.599> at

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
anticipation and now we've looked at

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.600 
anticipation and now we've looked at
using<00:03:56.989> this<00:03:57.140> percussive<00:03:57.799> element<00:03:58.190> into<00:03:58.370> your

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
using this percussive element into your

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.699 
using this percussive element into your
plank<00:03:58.849> so<00:03:59.060> we've<00:03:59.239> looked<00:03:59.450> at<00:03:59.599> quite<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.930> lot<00:04:00.200> so

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
plank so we've looked at quite a lot so

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.120 
plank so we've looked at quite a lot so
far<00:04:00.980> so<00:04:01.599> instead<00:04:02.599> of<00:04:02.780> throwing<00:04:03.590> even<00:04:03.920> more

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
far so instead of throwing even more

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.059 
far so instead of throwing even more
kind<00:04:04.549> of<00:04:04.610> things<00:04:05.090> away<00:04:05.390> from<00:04:06.140> technical<00:04:06.709> point

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
kind of things away from technical point

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.050 
kind of things away from technical point
of<00:04:07.130> views<00:04:07.310> what<00:04:07.579> we're<00:04:07.670> going<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.849> do<00:04:07.910> in<00:04:08.000> the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
of views what we're going to do in the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.910 
of views what we're going to do in the
following<00:04:08.360> videos<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:09.140> we're<00:04:09.530> just<00:04:09.560> going<00:04:09.829> to

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
following videos is we're just going to

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.550 
following videos is we're just going to
check<00:04:10.069> out<00:04:10.220> some<00:04:10.340> cool<00:04:10.579> codes<00:04:10.880> with

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
check out some cool codes with

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.770 
check out some cool codes with
variations<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.709> these<00:04:12.980> kind<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.780> strumming

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
variations of these kind of a strumming

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.259 
variations of these kind of a strumming
patterns<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:16.340> far<00:04:16.579> we've<00:04:16.729> also<00:04:16.940> only

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
patterns and so far we've also only

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.000 
patterns and so far we've also only
looked<00:04:17.510> at<00:04:17.600> one<00:04:17.900> bar<00:04:18.169> strong<00:04:18.470> Macbeth<00:04:18.739> of

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
looked at one bar strong Macbeth of

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.190 
looked at one bar strong Macbeth of
course<00:04:19.250> we<00:04:19.820> can<00:04:20.000> get<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.269> tube<00:04:20.600> or<00:04:20.810> stomach

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
course we can get a tube or stomach

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.540 
course we can get a tube or stomach
pattern<00:04:21.530> which<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:21.739> going<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:21.979> sound<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.400> little

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
pattern which is going to sound a little

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.450 
pattern which is going to sound a little
bit<00:04:22.760> more<00:04:22.970> interesting<00:04:23.720> as<00:04:24.050> well<00:04:24.260> so<00:04:25.070> if

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
bit more interesting as well so if

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.860
