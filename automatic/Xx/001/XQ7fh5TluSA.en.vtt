00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.939
 That's their know-how Flex Leica lens adapter for the Sony NEX 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.480
 Lanker means he can pick up the title so he can 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.099
 at a network of services and the ex-Aachen Seymour and afterwards 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.029
 how that worked exactly the showhouse it was 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.880
 the adapters so come on here at this tactical wallin 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 Plastic box we do not need a long way 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.390
 We are interested in a caught 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.669
 as you can see 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.200
 on the subject DAB Bauhof now I do not have to say so if that 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.850
 not at fault with yourself 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.650
 best quality Westerwelle it works 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.410
 You can not find anything comparable on the market 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.930
 So, this adapter is equal to a very long one here 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.540
 Â»Further objectively visor they had been able to relate connected to 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.460
 Dollar marks and the whole comes then additional to the Soini Lex 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.800
 As the first shoot you as always adapter for once to the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.040
 objectively to the overlooked there their lives we were quite normal about the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.160
 Mark whether the deep and insert adapters 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.270
 maybe talk 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.170
 and then there is already one 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.100
 So it's time to fix it then you just have to pin this silver pin 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 in the direction of Camara press so say the camera body longer imagines 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 that is slowing down but steadying now 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.720
 just press down hold everything then maybe even 20 already 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.820
 percent 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.030
 fix 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.350
 suppress reason 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.410
 they are very close 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.500
 Goal also misses no sense 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.740
 but then it ran first 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.660
 sometimes make distance Suhl objectively 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.160
 and then again here by marking 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.470
 easy 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.470
 attach to the ball in the net of the camera 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.650
 and they just slept a nice two millimeters like that 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.940
 on her Sony NEX 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.550
 also positive again 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.030
 unless such ships make and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.049
 very special pictures
