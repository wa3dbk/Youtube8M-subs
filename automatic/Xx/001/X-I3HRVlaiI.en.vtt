00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.870
 all right 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.940
 enemy 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.769
 very good to all guys and girls I am 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.720
 price and let's continue with the ideas 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.340
 on which treyarch could be based for 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.210
 create elements of call of duty zombies 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.649
 2015 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 I leave here the 4 chapters 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.039
 before and as always commented that 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.989
 the things that we are going 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.610
 seeing that it changes and it's from them and so on 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.290
 I hope you like it there 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.090
 in the previous chapter on the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.620
 grenades we said that the letter was 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.720
 I had started writing after the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.610
 ascension launch shortly before 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.590
 leave with those of ted at that time 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.240
 there was very little variability in terms of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.400
 grenades that we already talked about in the 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.340
 previous video and equipment that about what 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.080
 let's talk in this the team is what 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.150
 that you select we go with the buttons 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.620
 up and down the command until a call of 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.510
 the dead the only team we had 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.340
 they were the play moore in shangrilÃ¡ 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.020
 they added the spice more in moon the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.880
 spacesuit and device 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.800
 hack and I already remembered was when 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.140
 They added a lot of variety generators 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.600
 shields traps turrets the jet gun 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.940
 trampolines resonators guillotines the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 time bomb and the maxis drone in 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.810
 The ideas in this letter include three 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.119
 Lethal equipment that we would select 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.920
 with the top button of the knob and six 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.980
 non-lethal equipment that selection 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.690
 we would do with the right button of the command 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.730
 let's start with the lethal team 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.010
 specifically for this equipment the drum 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.900
 of gasoline the gasoline can is a 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.670
 new item of equipment that leaves a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.500
 Trace of gasoline on the ground while 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.110
 we keep pressing the button above 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.270
 of the knob when the button is released on 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 Trace of gasoline starts to burn and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.960
 will remain burning for a period 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
 of variable time damaging any 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.410
 zombie that walks on him but also 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.690
 It can hurt players 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.480
 go over this equipment I like 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.280
 but in turn I see it unnecessary is 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.770
 say if star puts something like that in a 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.270
 zombie map in 2015 will be just because it is 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 necessary for a step of interest 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.890
 because I do not know about having weapons or even 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.870
 traps like we'll see, I see it 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.970
 unnecessary 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.450
 the next lethal equipment would be the charge 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.700
 fp form explosive projectile this 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.560
 team remembers a clay mor is placed in 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.720
 the ground and it explodes when we 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.450
 we want it like it's a c4 like that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.030
 we press a button and the load of fp 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.670
 explodes and fires explosive projectiles 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.590
 the explosion is more or less large and the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.720
 projectiles would go only in one direction 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.910
 the address where you are pointing the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.400
 load as the playmore would therefore be 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.650
 like the resonator in verin but 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
 explosive and explodes when we 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.370
 we want to harm the zombies that are 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.440
 in front of this team I like it because it's 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.650
 like a clamor but improved exploits 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.510
 when we want and it is more powerful 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.189
 the last lethal equipment would be a bomb 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.829
 of time the explosive classic 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.689
 programmed as dynamite with a radius of 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.510
 wide explosion that reminds of the pitch 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.849
 of flow but once it's detonated from 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.530
 this mode after placing it will spend about 20 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.450
 seconds until it explodes so 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.310
 you have to think when you have to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.349
 place it to be able to kill the zombies 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.720
 who chase you in my opinion this 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.819
 team I do not see future if they do not modify 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.549
 something about him because of having to 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.019
 expect it to explode 20 seconds and such 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.489
 I see it difficult to use because you have to 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.620
 calculate when to throw to kill 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.770
 the zombies and so on so I do not know this 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.870
 team I would not like 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.490
 now we move on to the non-lethal team that 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.230
 my opinion is more interesting than the 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.450
 lethal equipment starting with the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.790
 ur works device is translated as 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.880
 German timepiece 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.400
 bourgeois in watchmaking looks like 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.590
 clock and would be purchased for 3000 points in 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.540
 the wall you choose with the right button 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.360
 of command like any non-lethal device 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.360
 and once placed emits a green orb 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.130
 of energy in a radius of 360 degrees that 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.620
 everything that goes through the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.960
 zombies and players own a battery 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.910
 when it's finished the device breaks 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.280
 and to recover it you would have to catch 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.200
 a maximum ammunition this team yes that 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.330
 I like it I see it useful for anything 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.340
 to slow down zombies if you want 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.990
 revive someone or throw it in the middle of 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.360
 a corridor to kill zombies that come 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.100
 ahead and as well is not infinite 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.780
 but you're running out and such would not be 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.520
 much been so I would like 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.410
 the next is a teleportation of 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.780
 Pocket like the one on the loading screen 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.820
 of munt has an aspect like that of 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.950
 the tactical inserts of call of duty 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.870
 black ops 1 you select them with the 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.030
 right button of the command you place it in the 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.370
 floor and when you press the button again 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.810
 as if it were 11 4 the time bomb in 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.240
 see that you have to press again the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.919
 button allows you to teleport 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.800
 to the location where you left the 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.870
 teleportation there is only one per round 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.850
 so when you use it you can not go back 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.560
 to use it until the next round 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.540
 every pocket teleport has a 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.710
 different color to be able to differentiate 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.650
 what is each player's 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.750
 and nothing this teleportation I like but 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.520
 if they put it I would remove that from one by 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.590
 round because that would greatly facilitate the 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.690
 game you are locked in zombies you're going to 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.580
 dying and teleporting tuales if 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.770
 you have an extra life to each game and 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.560
 I do not know I would not like it I would put it 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.180
 you have one and when you spend it you would need 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.100
 maximum ammunition or something to 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.170
 recover it not one per round 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.390
 the next non-lethal would be a 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.340
 barricade is placed as a clay mor and 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.900
 it is a big wall so big 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.630
 like a zombie the size of a door 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.700
 the zombies can not climb the wall or 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.170
 pierce it in its place as if it were 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.730
 a window the zombies have to go 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.070
 removing the wooden planks to 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.840
 to be able to pass the players either 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.080
 they could go through it or repair it but 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.510
 pressing the x button in xbox or square 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.030
 in playstation near the barricade what 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.800
 we destroyed the destroyed a barricade 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.560
 it can only be destroyed by the 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.970
 player who placed it and I like it but 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.830
 to prevent people from using 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.870
 barricades to try to climb on them 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.460
 and get off the map and such could be done 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.170
 that the barricade could only be 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.760
 place in places where before 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.160
 there was a door that we opened with 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.890
 money 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.990
 next a re dressing time I 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.760
 it sounds pretty now you will see once 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.220
 activated this device will make us 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.350
 go back in time 10 15 seconds 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.940
 allowing us to try again if it is 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.130
 that we would have fallen into a trap or 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.990
 we are in a bad situation is a 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.900
 rare device of the mysterious box 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.450
 a wonder weapon that only has one 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.220
 use and it is not replenished with maximum ammunition 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.860
 this reminds me a lot of the pump 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.240
 Verdi time but the time bomb 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.700
 go back according to the rounds and be 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.180
 reversed time goes back according to 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.190
 time about 10-15 seconds 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.289
 penultimate flare gun is 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.030
 would buy on the wall and allow to illuminate 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.889
 the dark areas on the map 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.199
 also lets your classmates know 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.419
 where are you and is that you go into those 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.850
 zones and you can also shoot at 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:45.090
 zombies burning them comes with 5 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.500
 shooting and lastly the last 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.960
 equipment would be an electric screwdriver 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.970
 it is a non-lethal device that can 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.070
 be used over a window to 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.199
 triple the resistance to your planks 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.030
 It can be used twice per round as 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.949
 the play maurice would recover every 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.630
 This round reminds me a lot 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:04.400
 hacker of montero hacker the moon is 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.400
 more advanced and used for more things 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.789
 and nothing else that's all as you see 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.379
 treyarch has been able to rely on some of 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:13.470
 these elements to create some 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:15.840
 teams of black ops 2 and whites 1 and already 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.520
 We will see in 2015 if it is still based on 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.560
 them to create new ones or not with 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.250
 greetings and see you next video 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.250
 goodbye
