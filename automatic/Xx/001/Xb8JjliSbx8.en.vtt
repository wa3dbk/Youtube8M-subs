00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
actually did drop so um that's kind of

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.470 
actually did drop so um that's kind of
cool<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> thing<00:00:50.640> that's<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.239> weird

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
cool with the thing that's kind of weird

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.459 
cool with the thing that's kind of weird
about<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.840> don't<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.260> should<00:00:52.289> be

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
about that I don't think they should be

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.020 
about that I don't think they should be
doing<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.670> would<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
doing that because there would be the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
doing that because there would be the
best<00:00:54.270> phone<00:00:54.600> they're<00:00:55.170> basically<00:00:55.289> saying<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
best phone they're basically saying that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.340 
best phone they're basically saying that
yeah<00:00:56.610> here's<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.270> these<00:00:57.390> other<00:00:57.570> phones<00:00:57.870> they

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
yeah here's all these other phones they

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.650 
yeah here's all these other phones they
have<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> problems<00:00:58.980> too<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.629> go

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
have the problems too so there you go

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
have the problems too so there you go
there's<00:01:01.109> other<00:01:01.289> phones<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.620> problem<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
there's other phones of the problem I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.380 
there's other phones of the problem I
don't<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:02.820> should<00:01:02.850> say<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.359> because

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
don't think they should say that because

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.929 
don't think they should say that because
it's<00:01:04.019> basically<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:05.189> saying<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it's basically not saying they're the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's basically not saying they're the
best<00:01:06.150> phone<00:01:06.659> company<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> be

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
best phone company and they want to be

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.620 
best phone company and they want to be
the<00:01:08.340> best<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.700> want<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.090> making<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> best

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the best they want to be making the best

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.230 
the best they want to be making the best
phones<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.320> why<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.490> showing<00:01:12.000> off

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
phones so why they you know showing off
that<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> problems<00:01:13.290> too<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.799> just

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that they have the problems too I just

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
that they have the problems too I just
thought<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> weird<00:01:15.210> so
