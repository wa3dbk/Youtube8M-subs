00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello friends I am tocoma loquendo with 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.259
 another video but this time I want to talk 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.210
 how they transform something so beautiful to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.210
 something so painful let's start 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.790
 [Music] 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.790
 yes 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:29.939
 [Music] 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.279
 and today I want to talk about something very 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.220
 important of the anime genre today I'm going to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.379
 talk about dragon ball z kai like everyone 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.899
 we know dragon ball z is one of the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.000
 well-known and successful animes the saga 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.879
 It is divided into three parts dragon ball 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.979
 dragon ball z and dragon ball gt custom 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.530
 who spent time most fans wanted 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.330
 more of this series including me all 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.400
 after seeing more than twice all the 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.949
 sagas we needed the story 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.439
 will continue but you know what they say 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.509
 that much covers little squeezes and nobody 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:02.909
 way out the supposed continuation of 

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:05.339
 dragon ball z dragon ball and dragon ball 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.049
 never existed was really just a 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.299
 shit created by fans of 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.280
 dragon ball zo better said about 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.710
 true fans would at least know 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 that krilin has no sayayin blood like that 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.540
 that can never be transformed into a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.729
 super sayayin that's pretty obvious but 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 despite the stupid fashion they were already 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.659
 working on a new project the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.290
 project that in my opinion was the shit 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.930
 of the boxes 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.510
 since the story did not change anything is 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.430
 more the very lazy even reduced all the 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.410
 history taking out all the parts 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.690
 beautiful adventure that dragon had 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.060
 ball z the first time I saw dragon ball 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.160
 z kai I was really disappointed because 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.200
 all the time they gave the image of something 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.210
 false they wanted to move to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.180
 dragon ball kai for a continuation of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.250
 dragon ball zy alone is more of the same 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.440
 the very beasts reduced all dragon 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.470
 ball in 5 minutes to move to the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.270
 where the sayayin come to earth 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.430
 in this way dragon ball z has 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.290
 become a bad influence without 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.229
 tell that the voices are not the same 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.140
 from before the director of this shit I say 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.850
 project is irwin diane which he tried to 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.950
 make dubbing the same 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.380
 but because of a damn agreement 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.300
 this could not be done even the new 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.310
 opening is a shit compared to the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.140
 previous if you want to check it by 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.390
 yourselves look at the description 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.209
 of the video and you will see that it does not compare with 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.100
 the previous opening finally gives me 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.959
 a lot of anger that they have tried to 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.510
 improve dragon ball z in this way already 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.990
 that dragon ball z if you can continue and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.760
 this 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.400
 for the idiots who say they do not know 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.990
 can yes yes yes you can the only thing 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.570
 happens here is that your lack of creativity 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.580
 is what prevents their fucking brains 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.410
 can you imagine a continuation of 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 dragon ball z and respect to the voices 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.820
 You can look at the chapter that 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.560
 I left in the description of the video and there 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.300
 they will see the disaster they have done with 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.000
 our beloved series of dragon ball 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.950
 z clarified just clarified that it will not be the end 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.470
 of dragon ball z that because a project 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.530
 has been a failure does not mean that it 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.540
 they receive completely someday they will be given 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.760
 account of the truth and will continue this 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.680
 magnificent series leaving aside this 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.990
 shit so expected by us the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.180
 fans and I want to clarify this again no 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.490
 I have nothing against the series is more 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.260
 I'm a dragon ball zy fan 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.930
 many my life would not have been the same 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.180
 without dragon ball z and that's why August this 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.760
 video to complain about the worst mistake in 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.830
 the anime story I know that many 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.050
 otakus or many people who like dragon 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.840
 ball z see it subtitled in Spanish or 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.610
 be in Japanese but honestly to me it 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.400
 It makes me a little bored to be reading 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.960
 300 chapters while I have them all 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.150
 in Latin audio 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.950
 good reviewer looking at the folds 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.290
 in noticed several things that follow me 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.330
 outraging the voice of the master roshi was 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.400
 replaced by that of goku's grandfather and 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.410
 I do not say that it looks bad but that voice does not 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.600
 goes with the personality of rossi bone 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.700
 rossi is an old pervert and grandpa 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.920
 goku is the opposite at least 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.750
 would have put a more perverted voice 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.670
 or something that goes with the personality of 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.920
 rossi since what they did with our 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.080
 beloved series has no equal and still 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.660
 more has no forgiveness the project has 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.310
 failed and no one can deny it I 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.140
 I value everything they have done and that 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.360
 It has cost a lot to be in charge of a 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.040
 project so big but once you do not 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.110
 they reached an agreement with the voices 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.390
 originals in latin of goku goiÃ¡n 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.700
 Krillin and all the other characters 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.650
 important of the series would have to 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.050
 have resigned since they should know 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.000
 that the fans would not accept such a change 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.190
 in the series of both dubbing and 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.910
 opening but they did not and here the 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.830
 consequences 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.450
 I already talked about the dubbing but the truth 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.520
 is that dubbing is one thing 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.010
 extremely disgusting our 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.080
 vegueta is no longer the same no one can 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.120
 replace the true voice of vegueta 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.100
 in Latin also the voice of goku is not 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.320
 compares the voice to the original 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.510
 character and can not change it for more 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.510
 dubbing that they will never do the same thing 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.340
 that dragon ball z was sooner than not 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.650
 to indignarme is that in a little less 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.660
 of five minutes summed up all dragon 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.970
 ball to pass to dragon ball z in just 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.490
 six minutes this has already overcome all 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.590
 degree of ignorance I wonder if in 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.080
 such an important project in which they have 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.000
 been working so long they could not 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.070
 make a dragon ball and that dragon ball 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.020
 It is also part of the original story 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.180
 and not having followed the story is a 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.250
 lack of mental coefficient but if there 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.200
 many series that faithfully follow the 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.510
 original story and they have a lot 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.450
 success because these bastards of your whore 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.490
 mother could not do the same the only thing 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.590
 sure is that dragon ball z has passed 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.000
 for many stages and nobody ever 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.980
 will steal what is really 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.980
 fuck dragon ball z kai
