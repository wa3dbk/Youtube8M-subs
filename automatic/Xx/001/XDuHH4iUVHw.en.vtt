 It may seem like the year that just happened was 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.720
 one year decline if at all levels the 

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:10.360
 queen's or concluded with its own census 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.400
 2000 animals was going to close this year with 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.019
 two unique additions in the 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.340
 history of our country the 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.070
 rhinoceroses that are going to get 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.169
 especially from Africa it 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.419
 They also incorporated six new species 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.419
 which are clear aligning prime 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.550
 and now 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.910
 a day on dates like this 700 thousand in 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.640
 one year 400 different species more than 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.820
 2,000 animals in 2 hectares so that 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.460
 250 officials are displaced so that 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.830
 we take care of them and above all the pleasure of 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.780
 know that in the windsor there is room to 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.090
 all not in vain has become the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.350
 park of this largest type of chile 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.360
 and only 18 years after being born 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.740
 important and one of the most important of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.900
 Latin America currently does not 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.810
 only because of the diversity of species 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.360
 that we have but also by the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.340
 environment that has these species and 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.509
 finally for the jobs that we are 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.890
 doing in the conservation area 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.440
 research where we are leaders to 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.850
 national and international level in this 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.740
 half to interrupt it because they come 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.330
 the giraffes and help you doctor hello 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.310
 this Saturday of February the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.140
 The pavilion of the figures is currently 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.610
 measuring about two meters could 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.830
 get to four and one whose 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.270
 ancestral relatives changed the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.149
 history of egypt was left behind 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.130
 when she had been betrayed by the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.680
 Roman emperor for not 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.409
 or give up or be a slave to the people 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.670
 once he dominated he spoke with his slaves and 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.869
 he asked them to bring him a basket 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.060
 with fruits and that inside those doors 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.579
 with fruits put an Egyptian cobra 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.710
 she took it what the legend tells 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.179
 of course and with an accurate bite and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.729
 the injection of the poison ended up finishing 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.829
 with his life and that's how the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.299
 cleopatra's suicide at the hands of this 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.950
 Egyptian poisonous cobra that today 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.200
 we premiered a good show but the old 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.030
 Egypt not only reached us that the shaft 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.580
 suppose it ended the life of his last 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.310
 queen also this river crocodile more 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.349
 long of Africa more than 1,700 kilometers 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.569
 that the child is entering the 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.549
 new herpetitor of windsor we have 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.739
 extended an owner that already existed 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.959
 with this you're seeing here the 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.489
 new nile crocodile enclosure a 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.890
 enclosure that allows this animal 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.450
 be much more comfortable that also 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.049
 it gives people a better 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.910
 exhibition in the park through 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.620
 these enclosures and through barriers 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.810
 natural resources allow us to prevent the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.030
 animal approaches that bush 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.890
 this and then it starts to spin 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.930
 on its axis and leave it and then 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.720
 shed crocodile tears 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.880
 exactly snakes in our 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.840
 public survey ranked them well below in 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.840
 voting intentions 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.980
 and the hands 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.330
 the lion penguin 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.670
 marí marí does not like me I always go to 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.620
 take care of each animal as the snakes 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.870
 with such bad reputation on television in 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.520
 the cinema and in the theater where not even 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.950
 They can also name they took 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.290
 some votes without a doubt but it's nice 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.550
 see it how they move gone and from near 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.510
 you never have the opportunity to go back 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.560
 the jealousy for fabrics in 100 she 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.480
 He touched the glass and wanted to touch her 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.520
 us and loves animals already 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.320
 they have a place with a lot of contact with 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.270
 animals is fascinated in return 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.070
 we had to reread precariously 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.740
 because they had just brought the snake 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.360
 most lethal on the planet is here at 15 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.880
 minutes after a bite that 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.920
 dispatch to the other world look at the grace of 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.140
 the red writer summit is that a 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.270
 difference from the other snakes that 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.640
 they bite and inject the poison what it does 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.070
 is to spit the poison into the eyes of 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.020
 their prey and through the membranes 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.660
 of the eyes and the skin the poison 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.030
 first the society and then enter the 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.920
 system generating death by 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.570
 Poisoning in a few weeks will come 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.010
 the first gerontes wines that have 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.260
 ever stepped on chile 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.480
 ten thousand dollars each copy and this 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.790
 it will be your house for those who have life 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.810
 the average one animal of these lives 40 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.520
 We are about two years old 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.870
 weeks of receiving this first couple 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.530
 of rhinos a male and a female 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.540
 we are standing at this moment 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.400
 exactly is an immense scale that 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.900
 It can take up to four tons of 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.940
 weight is what they can think 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.650
 these rhinoceroses part of the welfare 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.060
 of them is that we know precisely 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.010
 how much are you thinking to know how 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.500
 we are with their diets these tubes of 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.170
 iron are 12 centimeters in diameter 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.820
 are filled with concrete in the case of 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.440
 some emergency through these 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.960
 bars 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.700
 our staff can go through without 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.560
 no problem once so for some 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.770
 animal motive had some reaction 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.790
 that forced our staff to leave 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.850
 they can perfectly do it and the animal 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.810
 is contained within those bars 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.000
 public that dazzled until the 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.470
 fellow iniesta that swept the 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.140
 emmys awards of the television industry 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.050
 North American for his documentary is a 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.490
 documentary about the new nature

 England on the east coast of the USA 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.130
 they named by 77 m in four points 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.380
 near santiago the metro train or in 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.630
 car for accessible animals and some 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.020
 sometimes until you see them one of 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.480
 the 700 thousand compatriots in 2013 will pass 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.950
 for the rhinoceros wind show 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.950
 that speaks with last
