00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
the only reason they believe in it we

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.900 
the only reason they believe in it we
know<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.410> early<00:03:47.709> birds<00:03:47.920> had<00:03:48.250> teeth<00:03:48.519> because

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
know the early birds had teeth because

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.120 
know the early birds had teeth because
the<00:03:49.060> fossil<00:03:49.239> record<00:03:49.720> shows<00:03:49.750> they<00:03:50.500> have<00:03:50.709> teeth

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
the fossil record shows they have teeth

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.290 
the fossil record shows they have teeth
and<00:03:51.600> also<00:03:52.600> we<00:03:53.170> know<00:03:53.410> that<00:03:53.950> they<00:03:54.250> evolve<00:03:54.670> from

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
and also we know that they evolve from

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.270 
and also we know that they evolve from
two<00:03:55.690> dinosaurs<00:03:57.540> very<00:03:58.540> rarely<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:59.290> modern<00:04:00.040> bird
