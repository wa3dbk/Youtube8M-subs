 I want to lucy and I bring you new ones 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.220
 news layers about big auto online 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.759
 because I still know that there are many people 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.519
 that I could not get in and I'm going to give 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.519
 advice this I have tried and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.230
 and I could get in there doing a second 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.390
 player profile that can be seen in the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.660
 online that I could not do so far 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.369
 and I've also tried it with my brother 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.030
 because my brother could not enter either 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.949
 with his console he could not enter the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.739
 online console my brother the 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.780
 old and I'm going to give one thing that I've 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.160
 done and I have left things the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 twice I've done it the first thing 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.730
 you have house 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.470
 erase 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.870
 the characters that you have made 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.239
 previously and if you have got into a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.220
 heading for example as there was a lot 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.790
 people who have me a departure 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.100
 that it was not was not well made and have 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.530
 started playing that game is no longer useful 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.880
 and greater what advises that they be erased 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.270
 all the matches that you have been able to 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.300
 do or even without getting to enter 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.910
 delete it and start again this is 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.180
 does entering the game by mode 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.630
 story and when I'm going to stick in the 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.450
 online or would enter into profiles 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.120
 well outlined in characters you enter and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.340
 wolf rise you believe it again up there 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.080
 over again the character and return 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.020
 to enter at the beginning or enter 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.370
 in story mode the story that comes out 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.920
 principle that where is all the 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.770
 problem and if you are lucky to the best 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.310
 missing the first but for the first 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.460
 and it was already falling where all the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.620
 characters next to the car and does not come out 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.050
 a car so that it can choose what 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.450
 you have to do and go back to another bar the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.280
 interface marbella the interface and go back to 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.610
 enter and when the re-enter no 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.430
 come in and get the stories and not 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.400
 You give metais to the cheese factory in 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.429
 360 team so you will not enter 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.100
 directly in the multiplayer if so 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.030
 I'm fine because it will enter multiplayer 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.150
 will start again in the parking lot and not you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.280
 you will have scrap the way of the beginning 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.000
 that explains what a big car 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.569
 online and it will go going to the circle 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.879
 magnificent blue 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.709
 if you do another pair again 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.769
 there is even a little bit if it is again 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.560
 another see the same then and you go with more 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.989
 striped players 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.050
 come back another is going to rescue the console 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.630
 I did this with the console 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.720
 brother who did not enter I have done other 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.819
 times at the third exit there are several 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.400
 Ways to know if it's badly done 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.860
 the first time that if you enter and fence 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.200
 around your several people who 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.690
 they are also waiting to enter the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.630
 game is not going to enter that race is 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.349
 there right away if when you are alone 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.150
 You see another one in the car or see how 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.760
 people come out saying that it ends and the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.769
 car and hit and by the appears the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.180
 person the black going through the 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:22.819
 your is not going to work either 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.540
 well the issue is that the least that 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.310
 you do again go back to the interface and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.319
 well do it a few times I think 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.340
 that three or four times what 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.030
 you do 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.340
 smells 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.440
 you may do well 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.410
 I also learn the reasons for the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.750
 that you can to this in case you do not know 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.910
 many times that goes with this supposes 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.700
 that the server is spending is not 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.379
 available and I could also see that they are 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.209
 getting the updates but many 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.160
 sometimes I asked myself from 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.810
 saying yes as good as you can be 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.190
 getting updates if I do not get 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.410
 he arrives here little by little and thinking 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.780
 little by little I realized that the 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.460
 updates are doing it in the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.160
 cloud this is going to be the new 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.830
 in the form of goals updates of the 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.460
 upcoming games of the xbox 360 by 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.320
 example and that's why many games are 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:28.280
 they sing for making games for example as 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.830
 the warfare or also as word tal 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.540
 because they make updates on it 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.840
 cloud and we do not have to download not only 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.250
 In us 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.250
 if it fails the cloud fails all the others 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.699
 and that if one of the problems so 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.710
 most people have had 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.199
 problems when entering the cloud 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.060
 or when he said you can not enter the 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.889
 cloud because it is unavailable can 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.270
 be that alomar coincided you forgot that 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.330
 is making trouble to be able 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.270
 solve the problem because you know 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.960
 try to do it this way about 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.330
 everything respects or removes or deletes 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.770
 the profile that you have created of player 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.039
 and you will see that if they do not pass to the second 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.500
 third fourth 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.380
 He tried to enter at least the same 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.000
 saw does not mean that to others he 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.389
 go to do the same but at least 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.090
 to those who are not able to play for 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.460
 the least you have a solution for 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.340
 try it and I think the solution is 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.289
 that especially the profile that you have 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.550
 used to enter the games 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.620
 raid wolves 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.870
 I also did something else that is because 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.620
 You can also prove that it is getting me 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.050
 on the equipment disk 300 more details 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.430
 in memory and delete the update 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.310
 and when you put back games 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.890
 update again to the best 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.210
 can also serve you already know that 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:00.070
 you can go around a lot so that 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.930
 solve the issue and when you have 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.910
 entered and you have done the first two 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.460
 missions that the first a mission with 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.270
 the car and the second is a mission that 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.370
 you have to go steal 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.110
 some camels, if you do it well 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.020
 and because of that the only thing that you have to 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.330
 know is that either entering from the 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.340
 game from the beginning you load of the 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.320
 line and it goes directly you do not have 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:29.650
 No problems or in the same 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.630
 as a campaign game by giving the 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.000
 crosshead to the bottom part loads the 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.400
 profile that I was using that I did not 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.340
 I'm going to have problems none good 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.010
 Well, I hope I've served you 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.030
 something what I am commenting if you have 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.820
 I'm going to try 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.780
 they explained more or less well then nothing 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.780
 more come gaztelu
