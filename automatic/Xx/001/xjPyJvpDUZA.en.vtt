00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.310
 receive as every Thursday the graduate 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.029
 in nutrition claudia bello good day good morning juan carlos infinity of 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.460
 questions claudia you will not be able to answer them all this morning you are going to 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.210
 have to follow a viewer who consults yes to vegetables to fruits 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.660
 besides recording them you must 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.269
 disinfect 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.179
 Interesting question Juan Carlos Pinzón and all 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.619
 being talking about which vegetables another attack we are going to consume raw 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.400
 Let's start by trying to wash properly until you include 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.850
 with a soft brush so as not to spoil the food of losing nutrients 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.420
 until the whole society and unions leave like lettuce as the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.230
 tomato that for example are going to be consumed and supplies is very important 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.500
 that are submerged in water in a solution of water the sodium hypochlorite of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.270
 teruel 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.730
 d a hypochlorite sodium spoon in a liter of water and this should stop 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.600
 during january 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 Juan Carlos minutes ago at least to ensure a really good food 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.870
 sure but it also made the numeral this world is very important 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.360
 so it seems that I had kept it with a helping hand to see and see 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.220
 what 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.640
 the advice you will give to moms 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.600
 that are not being seen throughout the country and very well this is another question where 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.760
 they believe they have skills and that in that encounter that is very common 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.580
 that the average age the moments the pictures 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.540
 we give up children boys 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.910
 that are fed by bottle 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.020
 bad hygiene, poor hygiene, preparation and preservation come through bad management 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.310
 Hundreds of Sofia to whom I want to tell you one thing Juan Carlos 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.300
 hygiene is very important 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.920
 the cinema we are going to retake some small concept of the previous Thursday 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.100
 the person who handles the food also be here yes there is only 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.140
 in health 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.650
 in clean clothes a trip to india I really picked it up hands correctly 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.790
 washed the preparation area 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.250
 all the utensils to use 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.870
 Julian also washed with detergent and not with bar soap because he fights 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.450
 easily to the walls of the plan 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.470
 wash with detergent 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.080
 rinse but then sterilize the bottles every so often 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.969
 for this it is important to place the container in an ounce take it to the fire 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.209
 covered with water 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.960
 for five minutes so that it stabilizes go watching 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.249
 and they met five minutes 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.369
 if we are going to place what the nipples are 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.300
 does not hire with a good foot because these elements 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.760
 can not stand ten minutes of life and sterilized melt it 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.180
 deforms the plastics and thereby generate a toxicity problem 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.430
 our babies but if this one can hold you give you rather ten 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.959
 minutes but 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.659
 is a bottle is important they have instructive we talked before with carla 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:47.599
 of labels 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.200
 and reading the food 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.620
 in this kind of thing you also have to read because not all its cover the 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.240
 sterilization process 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.960
 plastics are reformed for being a classic classic very fine and can 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.309
 generate disorders or poisoning and the baby 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:04.129
 but in addition to them there is a special service - rubén low grace to wash 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.619
 therefore the correct way of washing with a long-handled single 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:09.559
 which does not 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.649
 although you have to discard with rehn 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.349
 at my age because it is a very possible object that pollute has many 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.789
 experts are very wet if they join me but it is not like that but also once 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:21.569
 that the bottle is made 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.099
 now it is saved correctly so this one asked if it is empty I put the 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.689
 the cap on the nipple covered it like that and because it makes the refrigerator without having 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.040
 passed more than an hour of the lawyer so that no microbes are generated 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.879
 so that no microbes are generated because the park 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.799
 in this way is registered and inside the refrigerator does not contact with others 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.530
 raw foods that can contaminate as the famous cross-contamination 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.550
 between raw and cooked 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.060
 and a very important message moms daddy in charge of the babies 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.719
 bring children food that was left over from a previous shot 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.240
 that you really have to discard pants because it's not 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.140
 did not happen until hygienically in adequate quality to receive a baby 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.309
 there are multiple concepts say and bioethics leaving with much more 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.569
 important that this one 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.969
 and it is the contact of the food with the substance 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.209
 toxic optimists with rodents with insects 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:19.250
 those who many times we see domestic animals like kittens dogs 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:25.419
 birds or turtle near the pavement area I am a powerful 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.210
 polluter coexist millions of microbes that can affect trespass 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.120
 to the direct increase through the hands of us 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.120
 finally to wash the feed correctly 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.340
 put together in a ball 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.030
 hypocrite of the sodium or is feasible if it endures and bactericide with soap which 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.790
 juan carlos chávez is very common to find this union if one thinks that 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.949
 talavante correctly made phone 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.059
 in the crisis 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:54.289
 and the soap and actually on the porches of both are different there is another list 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.229
 in 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.580
 and stop being a cristina or I think the clean 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.240
 but not clean did not disinfect properly very well 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.310
 thank you claudia so important of all these tips very to keep in mind 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.789
 We are waiting for you next Thursday and Asia 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.169
 testimonies of exteriors what the Uruguayans think 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.589
 about our health
