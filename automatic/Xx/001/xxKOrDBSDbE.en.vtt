00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
so it's a smart carbon fiber bike which

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.730 
so it's a smart carbon fiber bike which
is<00:00:08.880> connected<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.360> your<00:00:09.450> phone<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.500> tracks

is connected to your phone so it tracks
everything<00:00:11.280> from<00:00:11.639> speed<00:00:12.030> calories<00:00:12.509> system

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
everything from speed calories system

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.509 
everything from speed calories system
and<00:00:13.019> has<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.320> navigation<00:00:13.860> system<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.280> board

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and has that navigation system on board

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.820 
and has that navigation system on board
so<00:00:14.700> turn-by-turn<00:00:15.000> navigation<00:00:15.350> through<00:00:16.350> LEDs

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
so turn-by-turn navigation through LEDs

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
so turn-by-turn navigation through LEDs
and<00:00:17.100> has<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> blind<00:00:17.970> spot<00:00:18.240> system<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.810> there

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
and has a blind spot system in there

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.609 
and has a blind spot system in there
okay<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.890> these<00:00:20.520> LEDs<00:00:21.090> how<00:00:21.420> do<00:00:21.480> they<00:00:21.689> pop<00:00:22.380> up

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
okay and these LEDs how do they pop up

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.529 
okay and these LEDs how do they pop up
or<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.910> imagine<00:00:24.480> going

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
or what are they for so imagine going

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.480 
or what are they for so imagine going
down<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.840> road<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.680> need<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> take<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> left

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.999 
take a left turn and you're going down
navigates<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.510> take<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:31.050> turn<00:00:31.230> connect

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
navigates you take a right turn connect

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.530 
navigates you take a right turn connect
it<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.250> phone<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.520> uses<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> Google<00:00:33.360> maps

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
it to your phone so uses the Google maps

and routes you through bike suggestions

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
and routes you through bike suggestions
and<00:00:36.090> tells<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.140> go<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.469> final

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and tells you to go to your final

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.260 
and tells you to go to your final
destination<00:00:37.760> okay<00:00:38.760> awesome

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
destination okay awesome

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.690 
destination okay awesome
so<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.230> else<00:00:40.440> does<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.579> are

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
so what what else does it have what are

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.750 
so what what else does it have what are
these<00:00:42.800> yeah<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> has<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> haptic<00:00:44.610> feedback

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
these yeah so it has a haptic feedback

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
these yeah so it has a haptic feedback
so<00:00:45.329> imagine<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:45.930> there's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> car<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
so imagine if there's a car right in

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
so imagine if there's a car right in
your<00:00:47.039> blind<00:00:47.190> spot<00:00:47.360> it'll<00:00:48.360> start<00:00:48.600> vibrating

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
your blind spot it'll start vibrating

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
your blind spot it'll start vibrating
telling<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> there's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.649> car<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.309> blind

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
telling you there's a car in your blind

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.330 
telling you there's a car in your blind
spot<00:00:50.610> watch<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.800> an<00:00:52.980> assay

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
spot watch out for it so it's an assay

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100 
spot watch out for it so it's an assay

and tell me about the the frame you guys
are<00:01:20.340> doing<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.820> yourself<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:21.420> yeah<00:01:21.780> so

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
are doing this yourself right yeah so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
are doing this yourself right yeah so
it's<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.740> proprietary<00:01:22.979> technology<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it's a proprietary technology it's a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
it's a proprietary technology it's a
single<00:01:24.509> uni<00:01:25.049> mold<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.460> from<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
single uni mold so it's not all from the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
single uni mold so it's not all from the
inside<00:01:27.180> unlike<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.470> other<00:01:28.590> frames<00:01:28.920> out

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
inside unlike all the other frames out

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.880 
inside unlike all the other frames out
there<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:30.479> has<00:01:30.689> internal<00:01:30.960> wall<00:01:31.290> structure<00:01:31.710> so

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
there it has internal wall structure so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
there it has internal wall structure so
imagine<00:01:32.280> having<00:01:32.400> bones<00:01:32.850> inside<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:33.840> bike

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
imagine having bones inside of your bike

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.840

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
wherever there's a stress force there's

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.359 
wherever there's a stress force there's
an<00:01:35.939> internal<00:01:36.119> wall<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.600> back<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.369> wow

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
an internal wall to back it up wow
