 it's called corrupt old mustard 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.279
 a little bit of the mustard grains 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.340
 three ingredients to make mustard 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.760

 mustard seeds that are those that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.180
 I have here in a cup try a cup 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.790
 because I'm going to put half a cup of 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.920
 mustard seeds in a bowl try to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 make a little glass well not in something 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.969
 I'm going to tell you why not 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.910
 put the visits you finish with chiquititas 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.950
 are a little yellow brown quotes 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 there is a clearer one you will find them in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.879
 any dietetics in any home 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.489
 spices is easy to get and they are 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.680
 very economical you're going to get this two 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.480
 thirds of a cup of wine vinegar 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.800
 white wine vinegar will go very 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.820
 well in this case the wine vinegar 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.640
 red and a third of a cup of water well 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.160
 mixed this if you're not going to leave two 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.770
 hydrate days you see the difference 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.540
 the ashes will go absorbing water 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.940
 Here I will show you one that has two 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.280
 days and the just the two days 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.680
 it absorbed water and sat the seeds 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.830
 absorbed from the water and absorbed the vinegar 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.240
 is growing if you see that you are missing 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.650
 the liquid because they have already left the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.660
 you can talk a little more liquid 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.670
 of water well we are making more houses 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.220
 coastal areas and how mustard is made 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.280
 good shopping and so I am visiting from 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.350
 mustard wine and water finely once 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.750
 that you left her two days and they hydrate 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.970
 the seeds are thus more sticky 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.800
 and more swollen the rougher to be 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.619
 look here you are going to see it I am going to put it 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.570
 in a mixer it's very simple when we go 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.580
 actionable today two days that the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.110
 you left hydrating guys you can 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.789
 be at room temperature if you do not 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.060
 too hot because it just has 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.680
 vinegar or put it in the refrigerator 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.540
 vinegar seeds and water when you're going to 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.930
 process you add a teaspoon of 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.450
 step app there goes a sugar of the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.880
 sir one of sugar if you refuse to 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.580
 to make yourself a honey mustard or 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.620
 spices here you can put that 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.120
 taste that I will add more if your 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.800
 process is now going to be very 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.810
 clarito will be like a mustard 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.570
 I'm going to add a little bit of French 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.820
 turmeric boy for the colors for 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.650
 that does not color the color exactly the 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.630
 American mustard color that is more 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.450
 yellow plus brown quote and now I'm going to 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.569
 make noise 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.969

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.799
 processor is missing cows for 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.629

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.389
 homemade mustard look at the process each 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.000
 it gets creamier as it is now 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.709

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.169
 with some mustard grains but I 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.000
 I'm going to liquefy it a little more so 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.840
 it's like the one you buy in the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.879
 super lamas as he creates it more exactly 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.069
 process a little more if you see that you have left 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.049
 very thick you add a little more 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.750
 water and this was the secret of the 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.890

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.120
