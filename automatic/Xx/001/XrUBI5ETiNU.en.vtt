it<00:01:30.030> interleaves<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.799> people

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it interleaves with what more people

it interleaves with what more people
that<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.310> used<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> playing<00:01:32.850> mmos<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.509> a

that are used to playing mmos it's a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.179 
that are used to playing mmos it's a
slower<00:01:33.900> pace<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.439> games<00:01:34.650> are<00:01:34.860> actually

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
slower pace the games are actually

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.800 
slower pace the games are actually
relatively<00:01:35.579> similar<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.630> there's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
relatively similar and you know there's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.270 
relatively similar and you know there's
a<00:01:36.900> lot<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> strategic<00:01:37.560> decisions<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.189> you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
a lot of strategic decisions that you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.470 
a lot of strategic decisions that you
make<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.579> an<00:01:38.670> MMO<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.390> those<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:40.049> have

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
make in an MMO we have those we have

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.080 
make in an MMO we have those we have
our<00:01:41.100> ability<00:01:42.100> tray<00:01:42.280> down<00:01:42.490> below<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:43.060> are

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
our ability tray down below that are

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.630 
our ability tray down below that are
more<00:01:43.300> strategic<00:01:43.900> bigger<00:01:44.350> powers<00:01:44.860> more<00:01:45.460> like

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
more strategic bigger powers more like

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.460 
more strategic bigger powers more like
you'd<00:01:45.790> expect<00:01:45.910> in<00:01:46.300> terms<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.780> superpowers<00:01:47.350> in

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
you'd expect in terms of superpowers in

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.260 
you'd expect in terms of superpowers in
a<00:01:47.530> third<00:01:47.680> person<00:01:47.920> action<00:01:48.160> game<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.880> then<00:01:49.180> we

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
a third person action game and then we

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.690 
a third person action game and then we
have<00:01:49.390> your<00:01:49.510> immediate<00:01:49.900> response<00:01:50.380> thing<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:51.010> we

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
have your immediate response thing so we

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.160 
have your immediate response thing so we
have<00:01:51.790> fully<00:01:51.940> distributed<00:01:52.270> physics<00:01:52.900> on<00:01:53.050> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
have fully distributed physics on the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.840 
have fully distributed physics on the
server<00:01:53.410> so<00:01:53.770> if<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:54.010> see<00:01:54.190> an<00:01:54.280> object<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.790> can

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
server so if you see an object you can

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.370 
server so if you see an object you can
pick<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:55.240> up<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.540> can<00:01:55.660> throw<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.050> at<00:01:56.230> your

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
pick it up you can throw it at your

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.080 
pick it up you can throw it at your
buddy<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.370> whack<00:01:57.520> them<00:01:57.670> over<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.940> head

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
buddy you can whack them over the head

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.000 
buddy you can whack them over the head
with<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.360> just<00:01:58.930> like<00:01:59.050> you'd<00:01:59.320> expect<00:01:59.530> and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
with it just like you'd expect and

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.470 
with it just like you'd expect and
everybody<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.730> world<00:02:00.910> is<00:02:01.120> seeing<00:02:01.300> that

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
everybody in the world is seeing that

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.450 
everybody in the world is seeing that
exact<00:02:01.840> same<00:02:02.050> thing<00:02:02.380> all<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.740> physics<00:02:03.340> are

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
exact same thing all the physics are

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.520 
exact same thing all the physics are
running<00:02:03.730> on<00:02:03.850> our<00:02:04.060> servers<00:02:04.540> all<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.170> combos

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
running on our servers all the combos

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.200 
running on our servers all the combos
are<00:02:05.590> built<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:05.950> same<00:02:06.040> way<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.490> there's<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.000> full

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
are built the same way so there's a full

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.120 
are built the same way so there's a full
progression<00:02:07.690> model<00:02:08.020> for<00:02:08.170> combos<00:02:08.560> there's<00:02:09.070> a

progression model for combos there's a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.740 
progression model for combos there's a
full<00:02:09.310> progression<00:02:09.760> model<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:10.119> supercars<00:02:10.600> and

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
full progression model for supercars and

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.960 
full progression model for supercars and
you<00:02:10.960> really<00:02:11.200> wanted<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.560> let<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:11.890> get<00:02:12.820> into

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
you really wanted to let you get into

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.000 
you really wanted to let you get into
the<00:02:13.120> world<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.420> DC<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.110> answer<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.530> experience

the world of DC and answer to experience
all<00:02:15.130> those<00:02:15.250> super<00:02:15.550> abilities<00:02:16.000> one<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
all those super abilities one of the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.390 
all those super abilities one of the
things<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.590> sort<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.860> brought<00:02:18.040> over<00:02:18.250> from

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
things that we sort of brought over from

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.820 
things that we sort of brought over from
the<00:02:18.700> world<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.970> MMOs<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.810> idea<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.260> roll<00:02:20.500> so

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
the world of MMOs is the idea of roll so

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.620 
the world of MMOs is the idea of roll so
we<00:02:20.950> have<00:02:21.070> people<00:02:21.310> each<00:02:21.670> person<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.390> group

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
we have people each person in a group

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.170 
we have people each person in a group
scenario<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.740> trip<00:02:23.920> combat<00:02:24.280> scenario<00:02:24.730> has<00:02:25.150> a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
scenario in a trip combat scenario has a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.340 
scenario in a trip combat scenario has a
different<00:02:25.600> role<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.900> they<00:02:26.020> need<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.260> perform

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
different role that they need to perform

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.350 
different role that they need to perform
to<00:02:26.710> keep<00:02:26.920> their<00:02:27.100> group<00:02:27.340> alive<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.120> do<00:02:28.330> have

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
to keep their group alive so we do have

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.630 
to keep their group alive so we do have
Elene<00:02:28.990> we<00:02:29.500> do<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.740> controllers<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.310> kind

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
Elene we do have controllers that kind

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.670 
Elene we do have controllers that kind
of<00:02:30.670> lock<00:02:30.880> people<00:02:31.120> down<00:02:31.420> more<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:32.440> do<00:02:32.560> have

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
of lock people down more we do have

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.280 
of lock people down more we do have
people<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.160> are<00:02:33.190> more<00:02:33.660> defense<00:02:34.660> or<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.080> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
people that are more defense or in it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.770 
people that are more defense or in it
and<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:36.100> take<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.250> lot<00:02:36.460> of<00:02:36.490> damage<00:02:36.760> also<00:02:37.450> put

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
and can take a lot of damage also put

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.690 
and can take a lot of damage also put
out<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.930> lot<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.320> damage<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.830> we<00:02:39.220> try<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.490> play

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
out a lot of damage so we try and play

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.550 
out a lot of damage so we try and play
these<00:02:39.880> all<00:02:40.060> back<00:02:40.300> into<00:02:40.570> roles<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:41.080> action
