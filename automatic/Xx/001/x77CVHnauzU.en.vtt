00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.150
 in a year 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.960
 it's the beginning of something 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:12.969
 i do not know anti americans and i'm for haunted the american 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.140
 but between the must in our time is to be landlords 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.169
 as my grandmother used to say 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.109
 if hypocrisy and lipids 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 the silence of death sent long ago 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859
 thanks to these my first joke 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.859
 in that sense we will have a good time together 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.690
 remember we know what to expect the street in september 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.540
 they have under the vaults of khazars after him 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.330
 however, he fell like that 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.050
 therefore the American authorities find the passport of one of the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.859
 terrorists 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.260
 empowering cities 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.090
 Saturday 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.280
 in the area of ​​tons of rubble qatar 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 and found the paw by bulgaria do 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.190
 it's not that way 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.070
 not respond to requests and we take for cons anyway a 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.070
 beautiful place during the holidays 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.300
 for the moment, we can see that the elected officials 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 me it's good apart it's good that's not what I'm going 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.210
 say do not wait 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.820
 I've been advertising for six years 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.900
 I wanted to do this for months before returning the boat lift 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.800
 so we can not send back 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.950
 especially since the period of mourning passed so we can do better than we 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.399
 have a period of mourning after the attacks of September 11th 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.320
 the cantons of basle-ville 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.320
 the museum all american 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.690
 the arrival of a cold front 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.920
 like others of the always 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.030
 why wait because the united states will return to the polls full 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.030
 but we were not aware 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.990
 it's age limit 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.660
 it's not that that's good for that 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.510
 especially since if we wanted sinik to be flown over they are 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.840
 fallen into the primary anti-Americanism to criticize it's not good 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.910
 this morning 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.220
 it's not good 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.740
 it's the focus of the paddock 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.899
 and I'm going to definition in the local press this week so the will 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.749
 American to tackle a charge motivates them 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.439
 that outweigh the rationalization 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.579
 always player 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.739
 for example in addition to traditional are on the way to achieve the feat 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.930
 we are going in the right direction wait when we are released by his aunt who 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.359
 keep four people 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.370
 at the same time, in the newspapers, it is starting again 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:27.149
 emotional and france info 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.149
 the euro has also blown a wind of this business of the fed 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.829
 the owner of the place listened to a speech to move the puck 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.379
 whore 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.379
 generational 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.030
 I told myself it's his faith it's likely it's me 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.020
 all that the following our tv screens in salvador after 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.680
 the event my son of the khazars council have been dad who has passed 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.579
 five years while rape points 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.579
 especially since it had to effect that my wife what was happening 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.889
 very comfortable with English 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.909
 then we must not repeat it stupidly morning that one of his helicopters 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.839
 understood what happened in lhasa and during the meeting yes 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.839
 and for the competent drink this time 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.739
 it is necessary to present in fact nothing half 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.310
 taylor phinney you on the moment of american propaganda tells us 35 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.069
 a thousand and forty thousand dead and the replica in the wardrobe anyway 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.139
 a lot 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.869
 but we do not derogate 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.729
 a week after that mysteries of 1000 dead then after we get to five 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:41.609
 military 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:42.439
 apparently the village 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.439
 frankly 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.309
 it's not sardines 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.299
 in marseille it's for a donation made to escape dozens of flights always 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.299
 beat records and that was ridiculous 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:01.549
 if we finally came up with 623 million 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.549
 3500 dead 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.439
 baccard lacaton firemen driving the papers cmcp biting him into the bone the 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.039
 phrasing relay was not in the starting towers 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.029
 benchmarks besides 3,200 people in planes good for them 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.810
 united states they came in the comedy was also not at the start 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:23.669
 so that's 4,800 so that's 1200 more than 3,400 people in the pentagon 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:27.059
 we never knew exactly how good it is to panthers before moving on 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.059
 in the same sense not very well who work for him 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.250
 when it will become apple results 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.280
 for 2010 300 and 400 dead for two towers of 450 meters of euros at 9 o'clock 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.370
 morning in the heart of new york milan 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.370
 it's a lot for me 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.359
 because the question is not fundamental to ask oneself it is especially by the risk 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.919
 this group 0 afp 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.259
 I think that we have to rebuild 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.259
 small victims 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.229
 6 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.080
 without even going strong but also christophe alveque must not do a 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.580
 tour in the united states 1 they released next october 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.860
 you spoke the table with a gaping mouth 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.290
 the vocal tone never but jean-claude suquet
