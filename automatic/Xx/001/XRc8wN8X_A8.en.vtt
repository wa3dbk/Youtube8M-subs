00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
about what they're going to do when they

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
get it can you prevent the amount of

get it can you prevent the amount of
times<00:01:01.269> that<00:01:01.390> they<00:01:01.570> actually<00:01:01.660> get<00:01:01.929> hold<00:01:02.140> of<00:01:02.199> the

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.110 
times that they actually get hold of the
ball<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.469> I<00:01:02.679> think<00:01:02.920> that's<00:01:03.100> been<00:01:03.309> our<00:01:03.489> that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
ball and I think that's been our that

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.630 
ball and I think that's been our that
was<00:01:04.239> how<00:01:04.600> we<00:01:04.680> focus<00:01:05.680> on<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:05.920> last<00:01:06.070> year<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.340> I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
was how we focus on it last year and I

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.980 
was how we focus on it last year and I
think<00:01:06.850> that's<00:01:07.210> not<00:01:07.420> going<00:01:07.540> to<00:01:07.630> change<00:01:07.660> too

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
think that's not going to change too

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
think that's not going to change too
much<00:01:08.050> this<00:01:08.320> year<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:09.370> know<00:01:09.490> they<00:01:09.670> are<00:01:09.880> and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
backs obviously a lot more of an aerial

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.900 
backs obviously a lot more of an aerial
threat<00:01:35.710> so<00:01:36.010> you<00:01:36.370> know<00:01:36.460> it's<00:01:36.610> obviously

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
threat so you know it's obviously

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.070 
threat so you know it's obviously
slightly<00:01:37.240> different<00:01:37.540> but<00:01:37.600> for<00:01:37.780> us<00:01:37.900> it's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
slightly different but for us it's

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.120 
slightly different but for us it's
always<00:01:38.260> about<00:01:38.410> you<00:01:38.530> know<00:01:38.680> keeping<00:01:38.920> them<00:01:39.070> out

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
always about you know keeping them out

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.400 
always about you know keeping them out
over<00:01:39.190> re<00:01:39.490> 18<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.180> reducing<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.110> amount<00:01:41.200> of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
over re 18 and reducing the amount of

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.820 
over re 18 and reducing the amount of
shots<00:01:41.650> they<00:01:41.860> get<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:42.430> know<00:01:42.550> on<00:01:42.670> goal<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.830> yeah

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
shots they get you know on goal and yeah

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.830 
shots they get you know on goal and yeah
and<00:01:45.010> making<00:01:45.460> sure<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:46.090> know<00:01:46.210> we're<00:01:46.390> solid<00:01:46.720> as

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
and making sure you know we're solid as

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.140 
and making sure you know we're solid as
a<00:01:46.870> unit<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:48.130> every<00:01:48.520> games<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.820> same<00:01:49.000> in

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
a unit and so every games the same in

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.930 
a unit and so every games the same in
that<00:01:49.270> sense<00:01:49.690> yeah<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:50.500> mean<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:50.860> mean<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.760> have

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
that sense yeah I mean I mean you have

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.190 
that sense yeah I mean I mean you have
to<00:01:52.090> think<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.360> Abby<00:01:52.480> is<00:01:52.630> probably<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.050> most

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
to think that Abby is probably the most

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.840 
to think that Abby is probably the most
effective<00:01:53.680> in<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.010> world<00:01:54.190> at<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:54.490> she<00:01:54.640> does

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
effective in the world at what she does

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.370 
effective in the world at what she does
so<00:01:55.120> obviously<00:01:55.420> that's<00:01:55.540> a<00:01:55.720> huge<00:01:55.930> threat<00:01:56.140> and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
so obviously that's a huge threat and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.300 
so obviously that's a huge threat and
you're<00:01:56.470> not<00:01:56.560> going<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.800> be<00:01:56.860> able<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.100> take<00:01:57.280> it

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
you're not going to be able to take it

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.850 
you're not going to be able to take it
away<00:01:57.460> completely<00:01:57.790> but<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.600> think<00:01:58.900> it's<00:01:59.050> um<00:01:59.320> you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
away completely but I think it's um you

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.320 
away completely but I think it's um you
know<00:01:59.950> a<00:01:59.980> lot<00:02:00.160> of<00:02:00.190> it's<00:02:00.370> about<00:02:00.460> timing<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:01.090> lot<00:02:01.240> of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
know a lot of it's about timing a lot of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.600 
know a lot of it's about timing a lot of
it's<00:02:01.480> about<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:02.680> positioning<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:03.370> lot<00:02:03.520> of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
it's about your positioning a lot of

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.780 
it's about your positioning a lot of
it's<00:02:03.730> about<00:02:03.850> denying<00:02:04.480> those<00:02:05.380> balls<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.640> get

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
it's about denying those balls that get

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.609 
it's about denying those balls that get
served<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.570> her<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.259> are<00:02:08.379> going<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.530> make

served in to her that are going to make

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.589 
served in to her that are going to make
her<00:02:08.860> dangerous<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:09.489> again<00:02:09.700> it's<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.209> our

opportunities on Wednesday in Kansas

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.860 
opportunities on Wednesday in Kansas
City<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.900> think<00:02:29.830> em<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.550> know<00:02:30.640> Kansas<00:02:30.910> are<00:02:31.750> a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
City I think em you know Kansas are a

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.230 
City I think em you know Kansas are a
very<00:02:32.080> good<00:02:32.290> good<00:02:32.740> team<00:02:32.980> defensively<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.090> you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
very good good team defensively and you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.400 
very good good team defensively and you
know<00:02:34.330> they<00:02:34.450> keep<00:02:34.600> their<00:02:34.780> shape<00:02:34.930> extremely

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
know they keep their shape extremely

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.030 
know they keep their shape extremely
well<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.980> think<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:38.350> know<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:38.590> stopped<00:02:38.890> us

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
well so I think you know they stopped us

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.680 
well so I think you know they stopped us
as<00:02:39.250> well<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.550> they<00:02:39.580> could<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.150> think<00:02:40.360> and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
as well as they could and I think and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.660 
as well as they could and I think and
for<00:02:41.500> us<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:42.010> about<00:02:42.220> getting<00:02:42.280> our

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
for us it's just about getting our

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.840 
for us it's just about getting our
movement<00:02:43.120> going<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.570> moving<00:02:44.530> moving<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
movement going and moving moving the

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.580 
movement going and moving moving the
defense<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.510> other<00:02:46.660> opponents<00:02:47.230> team<00:02:47.350> and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
defense of the other opponents team and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.140 
defense of the other opponents team and
then<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:47.800> working<00:02:48.160> off<00:02:48.280> each<00:02:48.430> other<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.880> I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
then just working off each other and I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.880 
then just working off each other and I
think<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.660> know<00:02:49.750> we<00:02:49.870> do<00:02:49.990> in<00:02:50.170> training<00:02:50.350> you
