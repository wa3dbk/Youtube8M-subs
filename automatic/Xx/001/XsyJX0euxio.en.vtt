00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
on putting accents on the the first

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:10.060 
on putting accents on the the first
strokes<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.570> paradiddle<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.980> do

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
strokes of the paradiddle and so I do

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.600 
strokes of the paradiddle and so I do
that<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.550> entire<00:02:10.640> time<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:13.280> really

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
that the entire time and it's really

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.840 
that the entire time and it's really
kind<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:13.970> hard<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.270> not<00:02:14.720> at<00:02:15.140> least<00:02:15.700> mess<00:02:16.700> around

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
kind of hard to not at least mess around

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.180 
kind of hard to not at least mess around
a<00:02:17.030> little<00:02:17.060> bit<00:02:17.300> just<00:02:17.690> do<00:02:18.230> something<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.770> focus

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
a little bit just do something and focus

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:28.750 
a little bit just do something and focus
on<00:02:19.520> what<00:02:19.700> you're<00:02:19.880> actually<00:02:20.510> practicing<00:02:27.760> see

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
on what you're actually practicing see

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.210 
on what you're actually practicing see
what<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.940> mean<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.270> just<00:02:29.360> get<00:02:30.020> off<00:02:30.140> track<00:02:30.380> okay

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
what I mean I just get off track okay

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.860 
what I mean I just get off track okay
then<00:02:31.459> maybe<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.970> third<00:02:32.150> commercial<00:02:32.660> break

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
then maybe the third commercial break

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.250 
then maybe the third commercial break
goes<00:02:33.380> by<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.920> let's<00:02:34.490> work<00:02:34.940> on<00:02:35.270> putting<00:02:35.959> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
goes by and let's work on putting the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.920 
goes by and let's work on putting the
accent<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.770> second<00:02:37.250> beat<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.570> second

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
accent on the second beat the second

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.370 
accent on the second beat the second
stroke<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.440> paradiddle<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:42.080> that

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
stroke of the paradiddle and that that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.990 
stroke of the paradiddle and that that
one's<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.920> hard<00:02:43.100> one<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.250> me<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:43.880> you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
one's the hard one for me so like you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.400 
one's the hard one for me so like you
know<00:02:44.120> find<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.510> ones<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.750> are<00:02:44.930> hard<00:02:45.140> and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
know find the ones that are hard and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.320 
know find the ones that are hard and
take<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.400> little<00:02:46.580> bit<00:02:46.730> more<00:02:46.880> time<00:02:47.090> with<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:53.030> I

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
take a little bit more time with it so I

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.420 
take a little bit more time with it so I
need<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.900> work<00:02:54.050> on<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.590> then<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.280> and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
need to work on that and then so on and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.320 
need to work on that and then so on and
so<00:02:55.670> on

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
so on

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.860 
so on
so<00:02:56.840> yeah<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.230> think<00:02:57.560> that's<00:02:57.739> just<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.100> really

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
so yeah I think that's just a really

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.229 
so yeah I think that's just a really
effective<00:02:59.870> way<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.739> use<00:03:00.980> your<00:03:01.310> time<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:02.180> you

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
effective way to use your time so you

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.820 
effective way to use your time so you
don't<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.600> sit<00:03:02.840> there<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.080> watch<00:03:03.230> TV<00:03:03.620> but

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
don't just sit there and watch TV but

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.370 
don't just sit there and watch TV but
you<00:03:04.280> watch<00:03:04.489> TV<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.570> learn<00:03:05.959> how<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.170> play

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
you watch TV and you learn how to play

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.729 
you watch TV and you learn how to play
drums<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.160> build<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.700> muscle<00:03:07.910> memory

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
drums and you build that muscle memory

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.080 
drums and you build that muscle memory
and<00:03:09.739> I<00:03:09.860> can<00:03:10.040> already<00:03:10.190> tell<00:03:10.400> after<00:03:10.760> thirty

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
and I can already tell after thirty

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.820 
and I can already tell after thirty
minutes<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:12.290> doing<00:03:12.500> the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.290 

it's<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.920> paradiddle<00:03:19.370> I'm<00:03:19.610> gonna<00:03:19.730> start<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.180> off

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
it's a paradiddle I'm gonna start it off

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.250 
it's a paradiddle I'm gonna start it off
and<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:21.290> was<00:03:21.410> choppy<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.490> was<00:03:22.880> ugly<00:03:23.260> and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
and it was choppy and it was ugly and

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.990 
and it was choppy and it was ugly and
it's<00:03:24.440> starting<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.220> get<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.580> little<00:03:25.760> bit

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
it's starting to get a little bit

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.480 
it's starting to get a little bit
cleaned<00:03:26.270> up<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.660> my<00:03:27.560> hands<00:03:27.950> are<00:03:28.040> doing<00:03:28.340> it
