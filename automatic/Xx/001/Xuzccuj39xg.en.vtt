00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.620 
hanging below it weighs about 30 pounds
and<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:22.250> pull<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.640> up<00:01:22.760> behind<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.360> all<00:01:23.570> the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
and you pull it up behind you all the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.000 
and you pull it up behind you all the
way<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.380> top<00:01:26.409> it's<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.560> lot<00:01:27.770> like<00:01:27.979> a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
way to the top it's a lot like a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.550 
way to the top it's a lot like a
spacewalk<00:01:28.790> where<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:29.869> have<00:01:30.049> to<00:01:30.200> remember<00:01:30.409> to

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
spacewalk where you have to remember to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.929 
spacewalk where you have to remember to
bring<00:01:30.770> everything<00:01:31.189> you're<00:01:31.520> going<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.820> need

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
bring everything you're going to need

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.950 
bring everything you're going to need
because<00:01:32.780> it's<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.049> long<00:01:33.350> way<00:01:33.619> down<00:01:37.750> once<00:01:38.750> you

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
because it's a long way down once you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.010 
because it's a long way down once you
reach<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.170> top<00:01:39.409> of<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.859> tower<00:01:40.039> itself<00:01:41.020> it's

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
reach the top of the tower itself it's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:54.040 
reach the top of the tower itself it's
time<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.560> go<00:01:42.679> outside
