00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.730
 and so hello to all today will be with us 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:21.720
 tournament 11 mid only and now and everything to me 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.100
 shorter wrote that I filmed here and I 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 I say that I'm too lazy 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:39.559
 Well in the end I feel like it's now become 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.559
 I decided to write the cut so 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:52.910
 Well, in short, I already played Kuchuk so solo 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.830
 mid only because here you can fill 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.230
 kill Meader how well both as me 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:06.650
 Basically , I nevermind in public before 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:09.890
 usually played like no kerry and realized 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.420
 the fact that mid is the only line in 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.660
 which you can check your personal 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.250
 skill that is, if something is not done 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.670
 it's already your fault 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.840
 Well, of course, don't give me up. 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.060
 I will not tell you what is not a big role 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.950
 they play there mostly mosquitoes tension 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.070
 that's it that's all game it's raw well and on and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:36.800
 the hero of course plays a role here as if 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.880
 plays the role of such know as I do not remember 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.880
 Well, let's 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.920
 honestly i won't tell you how it is 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.100
 everything is called here that thing mrs 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.280
 the head also has salt and what i do 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.080
 wrote in pgu in a dark room but I 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.390
 I did not think that would be a dark room but I 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.600
 generally lazy here and just the same way me 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.030
 beat and you know what I have to say what 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.300
 Now many people are shorter with flight 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.100
 one type of chip he is shorter 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.950
 the fact that it takes to write a guide 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.070
 schoolchildren like ha ha ha there grab 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.830
 here now a bunch of all morons too 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.210
 do like this of course all this 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.810
 such a trash so what to say from all I 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.620
 played 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.550
 five times no only 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.710
 and I will tell you so 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.270
 I won 4 rinks one lost because 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.630
 that against me is just a strong hall 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.850
 the hero 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.240
 but I could not do anything my hero 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.130
 weak here is shorter such a topic is that 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.130
 before the first product or up to two ways 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.600
 such topic 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.180
 what did flaku 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.069
 way flour kill but something to me 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.790
 a little lack of arrogance 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:28.260
 quite a bit of him right on the hands circle 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:31.400
 straight from the Russians so even in the end I 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.400
 honestly guys a lot of kripchikov 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.700
 pains i just this most looked not on 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:52.640
 creep life well shorter than a hand made 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:56.400
 dirty business, too, he needs his hand so 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.579
 I also watched the way such videos 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.480
 famous people 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:08.430
 well-known for these shorter 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:12.420
 mind of the unknown is such as Arad then 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.810
 yes who knows of course we are there right away 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.359
 it is seen 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.970
 the skill of these players to be honest here are the people 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:24.800
 think they are such powerful players a lot 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.240
 people subscribe to them yes that's it and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.490
 there you can see shorter when they record 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.410
 similar videos day there solo with skill 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.700
 there you see what they are 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.010
 crayfish are shorter here but they are of course the same 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.950
 Type not hide and such here these with 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.950
 runes of type do not hide such types oh 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.550
 starts to slander 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.030
 but I do nâ€™t really 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.120
 So . 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.560
 in fact they consider it all shorter 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.560
 look well, honestly stupid 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:27.190
 now you die again 1 kg 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.060
 Here is a shorter game, in principle, I tell you 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.729
 I wish you all 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.539
