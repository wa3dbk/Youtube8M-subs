fantastic so let's hop in here see what

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.219 
fantastic so let's hop in here see what
we<00:01:50.479> find

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
we find

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.279 
we find
of<00:01:52.220> course<00:01:52.550> if<00:01:52.789> you're<00:01:53.300> just<00:01:53.539> after<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
of course if you're just after the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.930 
of course if you're just after the
solution<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.860> can<00:01:55.009> just<00:01:55.220> fast<00:01:55.489> forward<00:01:55.849> I

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
solution you can just fast forward I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.910 
solution you can just fast forward I
usually<00:01:56.300> put<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.750> comment<00:01:57.020> on<00:01:57.349> my<00:01:57.560> video<00:01:57.830> you

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
usually put a comment on my video you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.219 
usually put a comment on my video you
know<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.640> solution<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.239> that<00:01:59.390> one<00:01:59.750> forty<00:02:00.200> two

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
know the solution is that one forty two

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.940 
know the solution is that one forty two
or<00:02:00.649> one<00:02:01.009> minute<00:02:01.910> whatever<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:02.750> oh<00:02:02.989> saying<00:02:03.770> that

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
or one minute whatever so oh saying that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.630 
or one minute whatever so oh saying that
that<00:02:04.039> is<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.429> actual<00:02:04.700> time<00:02:05.390> it'll<00:02:06.140> go<00:02:06.259> off<00:02:06.640> so

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
that is the actual time it'll go off so

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.949 
that is the actual time it'll go off so
this<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.239> dark<00:02:09.050> damp<00:02:09.610> scary<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.720> lights

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
puzzles are fun what you have to do very

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.550 
puzzles are fun what you have to do very
simple<00:03:16.879> let's<00:03:17.209> find<00:03:17.480> all<00:03:17.720> these<00:03:17.870> containers

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
simple let's find all these containers

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.039 
simple let's find all these containers
and<00:03:18.769> chuck<00:03:19.489> them<00:03:19.519> in<00:03:19.849> here<00:03:20.180> now<00:03:20.390> as<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.989> can

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
and chuck them in here now as you can

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.410 
and chuck them in here now as you can
see<00:03:21.230> there's<00:03:21.409> a<00:03:21.530> stopper<00:03:21.890> on<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:23.030> other<00:03:23.150> side

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
see there's a stopper on the other side

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.490 
see there's a stopper on the other side
so<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.470> basically<00:03:25.310> just<00:03:25.400> have<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.760> aim<00:03:26.500> like

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
so you basically just have to aim like

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.350 
so you basically just have to aim like
right<00:03:27.830> here<00:03:28.190> as<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.489> can<00:03:28.610> see<00:03:28.819> it's<00:03:29.000> pretty

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
right here as you can see it's pretty

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.020 
right here as you can see it's pretty
much<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.989> middle<00:03:30.260> close<00:03:31.099> to<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.489> end<00:03:31.730> and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
much in the middle close to the end and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.699 
much in the middle close to the end and
then<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.150> can<00:03:32.390> slide<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.959> hit<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.260> it's<00:03:33.440> fine

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
then it can slide and hit it it's fine

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.410 
then it can slide and hit it it's fine
so<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.069> just<00:03:34.250> got<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.579> love<00:03:34.819> them<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.180> there

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
so you just got to love them in there

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.729 
so you just got to love them in there
and<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:36.709> think<00:03:37.129> it's<00:03:37.280> four<00:03:37.579> of<00:03:37.610> them<00:03:38.590> but<00:03:39.590> it

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
and I think it's four of them but it

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.280 
and I think it's four of them but it
will<00:03:39.920> weigh<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.400> whole<00:03:40.610> thing<00:03:40.940> down<00:03:41.290> so

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
will weigh the whole thing down so

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.420 
will weigh the whole thing down so
there's<00:03:42.560> there's<00:03:42.829> another<00:03:43.040> one<00:03:43.220> down<00:03:43.370> here

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
there's there's another one down here

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.910 
there's there's another one down here
just<00:03:44.420> shot<00:03:44.810> where<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.140> oh<00:03:45.260> we<00:03:45.560> didn't<00:03:45.799> even

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
just shot where it oh we didn't even

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.380 
just shot where it oh we didn't even
need<00:03:46.069> that<00:03:46.129> one<00:03:46.459> there<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:46.730> go<00:03:46.819> just<00:03:47.000> three

need that one there you go just three

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.110 
need that one there you go just three
three<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.410> enough<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.220> now<00:03:49.370> we<00:03:49.430> chuck<00:03:49.819> them<00:03:49.940> all

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
three is enough so now we chuck them all
