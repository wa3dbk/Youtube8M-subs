00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello youtube 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hello, guests and followers of my 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:18.680
 channel today i will have an unusual 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:23.689
 video which is dedicated but I will say this 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.689
 super-secret bait rather bait 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.150
 which I used on 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.420
 over very long years at 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.800
 float fishing told me this about 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.370
 this bait bait I do not remember who 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.680
 but it was, let's say, the beginning 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.650
 seventies and here since 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.920
 how much do i fish 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.390
 I just did not meet a man who is well 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:05.910
 also uses this nozzle 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:08.650
 Now I 'll tell her how to do it 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:13.110
 in order for me to do this is needed 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:17.700
 here is the fabric but the usual white cloth 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.790
 Only I warn not morality 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.780
 I take a box like that 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.580
 everything is preliminary for to speed up 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.470
 here lies the dining room spoon 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.090
 it can be more depending on how many people need 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.660
 semolina 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:43.000
 so here is going to tight here and 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.050
 tied this i'll show now 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.280
 what it looks like 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.380
 Well, as if ready here, see here 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.020
 I get such a bag but I have it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.750
 life alone lost because he 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.650
 about four to five hours water and 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:05.330
 so here it is necessary from time to time 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.910
 the ball is this bag of flour and pour 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.180
 water because she will lose her 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.270
 transparency and become very dull 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.930
 that is to say simply we 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:21.770
 leave only but how to wash out all 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:26.150
 we are left with gluten that's it, we do not 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.760
 it is necessary here I’m kinda prepared and 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.190
 not yet untied maybe a little but i 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.970
 I feel that there is already something that I 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:40.130
 I need it now I 'll show you the whole thing 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:50.170
 now just cut the soul tied 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:50.170
 on a knot so 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:04.100
 well let's say there is a contact here 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.590
 It turns out such a substance see 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.860
 how does she look 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.620
 it is not yet completely washed but here it is 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.780
 but it looks like a big piece 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.210
 chewing gum you see here until 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.700
 end and wash out too i wouldn't advice 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.450
 collapse see here this fraction is small 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.380
 which remains on my fingers here 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.250
 she, too, is washed out during fishing and as 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.910
 would attract a little fish here too 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.950
 you can throw it here too 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:46.580
 to collect like this with a knife 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.530
 so this is all that remains 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.920
 on a rag here this grease it 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.290
 here's what you need here too 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.760
 amazing all this is possible now his 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.940
 so here rinse here and you get 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.260
 gorgeous 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:11.020
 fraction let's say so general guys who 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.900
 He loves to catch white fish here look 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:18.200
 let's say so bleak there the ram but i don't 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.420
 I know the crucian carp it but all this fishing 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.470
 going on a little hook 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.770
 that is, you break it off about such a cupcake 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.260
 a piece yes well, not just no small 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.100
 hook we all understand what I mean 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.100
 say yes here we are the most dress here 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.720
 this thing is on the hook 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:43.130
 Believe to knock down this crap almost 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.570
 it is impossible that you have such 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.840
 piece of bait 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.510
 enough for a month of fishing here that is you 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.480
