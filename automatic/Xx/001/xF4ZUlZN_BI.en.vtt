00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
out and just kind of weighing it down

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.710 
out and just kind of weighing it down
honest<00:06:32.900> so<00:06:33.140> it<00:06:33.380> still<00:06:33.830> it's<00:06:34.100> not<00:06:34.280> you<00:06:35.090> know<00:06:35.210> so

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
honest so it still it's not you know so

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.750 
honest so it still it's not you know so
laid<00:06:35.960> down<00:06:36.200> like<00:06:36.440> these<00:06:36.710> dripped<00:06:37.130> oil<00:06:37.430> on<00:06:37.640> your

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
laid down like these dripped oil on your

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.300 
laid down like these dripped oil on your
hair<00:06:38.060> it<00:06:38.480> will<00:06:38.780> be<00:06:38.930> if<00:06:39.020> you<00:06:39.170> used<00:06:39.290> too<00:06:39.470> much<00:06:39.620> but

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
hair it will be if you used too much but

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.740 
hair it will be if you used too much but
it's<00:06:40.460> just<00:06:40.640> just<00:06:40.940> the<00:06:41.090> right<00:06:41.240> amount<00:06:41.540> of

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
it's just just the right amount of

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.020 
it's just just the right amount of
weights<00:06:42.230> to<00:06:42.860> just<00:06:43.070> kind<00:06:43.250> of<00:06:43.310> help<00:06:43.490> hold<00:06:43.850> the

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
weights to just kind of help hold the

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.180 
weights to just kind of help hold the
style<00:06:44.330> and<00:06:44.660> it<00:06:44.870> does<00:06:45.050> shape<00:06:45.380> it<00:06:45.650> like<00:06:45.770> it<00:06:45.950> says

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
style and it does shape it like it says

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.370 
style and it does shape it like it says
so<00:06:46.850> I<00:06:46.880> believe<00:06:47.240> this<00:06:47.450> is<00:06:47.510> retails<00:06:48.140> around

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
so I believe this is retails around

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.460 
so I believe this is retails around
fifteen<00:06:48.740> to<00:06:48.830> seventeen<00:06:48.980> dollars<00:06:49.550> as<00:06:49.700> well<00:06:49.970> and

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470
