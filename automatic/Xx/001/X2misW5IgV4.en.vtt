Michael Young who's on 37 okay
cross-country<00:01:10.990> course<00:01:11.350> tomorrow<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:12.039> think

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
cross-country course tomorrow I think

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.389 
cross-country course tomorrow I think
this<00:01:12.940> year<00:01:13.300> it's<00:01:13.509> it's<00:01:14.259> certainly<00:01:14.649> a<00:01:14.740> decent

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
this year it's it's certainly a decent

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.219 
this year it's it's certainly a decent
three<00:01:15.640> star<00:01:15.910> test<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:16.509> maybe<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.869> little<00:01:16.899> bit

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
three star test it's maybe a little bit

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.699 
three star test it's maybe a little bit
stronger<00:01:17.500> than<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.860> was<00:01:18.009> last<00:01:18.039> year<00:01:18.580> when<00:01:19.709> I

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
stronger than it was last year when I

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.219 
stronger than it was last year when I
first<00:01:21.009> walked<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.550> up<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.539> offense<00:01:22.869> five<00:01:23.200> I

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
first walked it up to offense five I

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.960 
first walked it up to offense five I
thought<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:24.220> was<00:01:24.340> maybe<00:01:24.550> going<00:01:24.789> to<00:01:24.880> be<00:01:24.940> a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
thought it was maybe going to be a

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.809 
thought it was maybe going to be a
little<00:01:25.119> bit<00:01:25.239> softer<00:01:25.539> but<00:01:25.959> then<00:01:26.640> pence<00:01:27.640> five

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
little bit softer but then pence five

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.660 
little bit softer but then pence five
was<00:01:28.060> quite<00:01:28.300> difficult<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.619> then<00:01:29.920> coming<00:01:30.489> at

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
was quite difficult and then coming at

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.510 
was quite difficult and then coming at
fence<00:01:31.050> seven<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.140> think<00:01:32.410> as<00:01:32.560> or<00:01:32.800> as<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.310> water

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
fence seven I think as or as the water

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.639 
fence seven I think as or as the water
complex<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:34.450> really<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:34.810> quite<00:01:35.170> a

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
complex and that really is quite a

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.630 
complex and that really is quite a
decent<00:01:36.190> test<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:36.970> year<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:37.509> from<00:01:38.170> then<00:01:38.319> on

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
decent test this year and from then on

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.339 
decent test this year and from then on
the<00:01:39.640> course<00:01:39.880> stays<00:01:40.239> quite<00:01:40.630> big<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.080> quite

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:41.349 
the course stays quite big and quite

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:43.740 
the course stays quite big and quite
demanding<00:01:41.530> all<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.670> way<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.849> the<00:01:43.119> end<00:01:43.239> and<00:01:43.479> so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
demanding all the way to the end and so

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.380 
demanding all the way to the end and so
I<00:01:43.989> think<00:01:44.349> it<00:01:44.739> will<00:01:45.039> be<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> strong<00:01:45.849> three<00:01:46.179> sir

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
I think it will be a strong three sir

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.499 
I think it will be a strong three sir
test<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.670> weather<00:01:48.880> or<00:01:49.119> not<00:01:49.149> quite<00:01:49.479> sure

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
test the weather or not quite sure

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.850 
test the weather or not quite sure
what's<00:01:49.869> going<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.080> happen<00:01:50.410> we've<00:01:50.560> had<00:01:50.679> rain

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
what's going to happen we've had rain

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.029 
what's going to happen we've had rain
this<00:01:51.099> afternoon<00:01:51.539> I<00:01:52.539> think<00:01:53.349> its<00:01:53.470> forecast<00:01:53.890> to

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
this afternoon I think its forecast to

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.999 
this afternoon I think its forecast to
rain<00:01:54.250> tomorrow<00:01:54.550> morning<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.830> make

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
rain tomorrow morning and that can make

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.770 
rain tomorrow morning and that can make
a<00:01:57.069> big<00:01:57.190> difference<00:01:57.459> particularly<00:01:58.090> going<00:01:58.569> late

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
a big difference particularly going late

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.479 
a big difference particularly going late
in<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.080> day<00:01:59.259> at<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.709> ground<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.129> get<00:02:00.220> Philly

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
in the day at the ground and get Philly

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:03.029 
in the day at the ground and get Philly
well<00:02:00.670> cut<00:02:00.910> up<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:02.110> time<00:02:02.379> is<00:02:02.590> always<00:02:02.739> difficult

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
well cut up the time is always difficult

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.529 
well cut up the time is always difficult
to<00:02:03.280> get<00:02:03.459> in<00:02:03.580> buckle<00:02:03.849> oh<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.149> i<00:02:04.209> think<00:02:04.420> this

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
to get in buckle oh and i think this

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.440 
to get in buckle oh and i think this
year<00:02:04.599> will<00:02:04.810> be<00:02:05.020> no<00:02:05.200> exception<00:02:05.800> so<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.759> lot<00:02:07.300> to
