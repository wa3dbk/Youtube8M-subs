video<00:00:11.500> of<00:00:11.680> the<00:00:11.950> train<00:00:12.220> Technol<00:00:12.820> so<00:00:13.480> here<00:00:13.900> we<00:00:13.990> go

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
video of the train Technol so here we go

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.199 
video of the train Technol so here we go
I've<00:00:14.620> taken<00:00:14.889> two<00:00:15.610> signals

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
I've taken two signals

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.750 
I've taken two signals
I've<00:00:17.110> got<00:00:17.350> we've<00:00:17.560> got<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:17.830> four<00:00:18.130> aspect<00:00:18.580> one

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
I've got we've got the four aspect one

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.240 
I've got we've got the four aspect one
and<00:00:19.000> then<00:00:19.570> at<00:00:19.689> the<00:00:19.750> back<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.260> two<00:00:20.619> aspect

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
and then at the back the two aspect

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.370 
and then at the back the two aspect
signal<00:00:21.400> this<00:00:21.910> is<00:00:21.970> red<00:00:22.270> and<00:00:22.390> green<00:00:22.540> this<00:00:22.990> is<00:00:23.050> red

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
signal this is red and green this is red

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.050 
signal this is red and green this is red

pliers

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.380 

that's<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.980> some<00:01:32.250> soldiering<00:01:32.850> wire<00:01:33.030> which

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that's just some soldiering wire which

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.260 
that's just some soldiering wire which
I've<00:01:33.540> bent<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.110> u-shape<00:01:35.060> underneath<00:01:36.060> the

go<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> press<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> left<00:02:11.550> hand<00:02:11.760> controller

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
go then I press the left hand controller

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.070 
go then I press the left hand controller
again<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.250> program<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.660> left<00:02:15.930> hand

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
again and it's program so left hand

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.230 
again and it's program so left hand
controller<00:02:16.620> or<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.160> left<00:02:17.430> knob<00:02:17.670> part<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
controller or the left knob part of the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.140 
controller or the left knob part of the
controller<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.810> green<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:20.520> bottom<00:02:20.760> bit<00:02:20.910> is

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
controller is green the bottom bit is

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.720 
controller is green the bottom bit is
red<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.900> because<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.800> four<00:02:23.190> aspect<00:02:23.610> it

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
red and because it's a four aspect it

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.220 
red and because it's a four aspect it
needs<00:02:23.910> another<00:02:24.210> decoder<00:02:24.690> address

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
needs another decoder address

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.860 
needs another decoder address
so<00:02:25.620> I've<00:02:25.920> programmed<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.730> 91<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.780> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
so I've programmed it that 91 so if I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.110 
so I've programmed it that 91 so if I
automatically<00:02:28.380> scroll<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.800> 92<00:02:29.340> don't<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:30.000> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
automatically scroll to 92 don't have to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.060 
automatically scroll to 92 don't have to
program<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.810> automatically<00:02:31.410> does<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.740> for<00:02:31.950> you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
program it automatically does it for you

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.790 
program it automatically does it for you
double<00:02:32.400> yellow<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.510> single<00:02:34.050> yellow<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.530> then

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
double yellow and single yellow and then

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.380 
double yellow and single yellow and then
back<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.130> 91<00:02:36.050> right<00:02:37.050> hand<00:02:37.260> button<00:02:37.440> red<00:02:38.390> green

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
back to 91 right hand button red green

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.210 
back to 91 right hand button red green
so<00:02:39.990> once<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.320> program<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.740> first<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:41.100> you've

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
so once you program the first one you've

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220 
so once you program the first one you've
automatically<00:02:41.820> programmed<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.540> second<00:02:42.959> for

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
automatically programmed the second for

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.230 
automatically programmed the second for
your<00:02:43.350> second<00:02:43.860> address<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.850> double

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
your second address with the double

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.510 
your second address with the double
aspect<00:02:45.780> one<00:02:46.020> where<00:02:46.500> you've<00:02:46.650> got<00:02:46.860> two<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.370> these

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
aspect one where you've got two of these

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.220 
aspect one where you've got two of these
together<00:02:47.940> with<00:02:48.420> one<00:02:48.600> then<00:02:48.780> there's<00:02:49.080> another

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
together with one then there's another

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.860 
together with one then there's another
head<00:02:49.410> next<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.150> when<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.270> program<00:02:51.690> for

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
head next to it and when you program for

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.300 
head next to it and when you program for
example<00:02:51.930> one<00:02:52.350> on<00:02:52.500> number<00:02:52.740> one<00:02:52.920> it

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
example one on number one it

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.890 
example one on number one it
automatically<00:02:53.910> programs<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> other<00:02:54.600> one<00:02:54.720> on

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
automatically programs the other one on

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.540 
automatically programs the other one on
number<00:02:55.230> two<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.830> see<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.130> have<00:02:56.250> internet

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
number two to see if you have internet

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.250 
number two to see if you have internet
about<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.930> now<00:02:58.050> I'm<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.350> program<00:02:58.800> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
about so now I'm going to program the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.880 
about so now I'm going to program the
single<00:03:02.069> wall<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:03.330> again<00:03:03.569> get<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.890> contact

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
single wall so again get in the contact

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.010 
single wall so again get in the contact
when<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.250> starts<00:03:07.550> to<00:03:07.700> flash<00:03:07.910> you've<00:03:08.720> made<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
when it starts to flash you've made the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.110 
when it starts to flash you've made the
contact<00:03:09.380> state<00:03:10.220> that's<00:03:10.400> now<00:03:10.610> flashing<00:03:10.970> red

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
contact state that's now flashing red

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.480 
contact state that's now flashing red
green<00:03:11.360> I'll<00:03:11.960> then<00:03:12.230> set<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.680> at<00:03:12.830> 81<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.400> you

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
green I'll then set this at 81 so you

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.230 
green I'll then set this at 81 so you
press<00:03:13.670> 81<00:03:14.530> left<00:03:15.530> I'm<00:03:15.710> not<00:03:15.740> left<00:03:16.640> I'm<00:03:16.820> up<00:03:16.970> again

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
press 81 left I'm not left I'm up again

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.449 
press 81 left I'm not left I'm up again
and<00:03:17.750> it's<00:03:17.900> program<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.590> there<00:03:18.740> you<00:03:18.830> go
