anything that they want to this is

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.680 
anything that they want to this is
probably<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.130> first<00:02:25.280> time<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.819> maybe<00:02:25.970> five

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
probably the first time and maybe five

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.330 
probably the first time and maybe five
years<00:02:26.870> where<00:02:27.350> they've<00:02:27.470> had<00:02:27.590> such<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.860> big<00:02:28.100> break

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
years where they've had such a big break

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.990 
years where they've had such a big break
so<00:02:29.239> be<00:02:29.269> interesting<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.049> see<00:02:30.230> how<00:02:31.220> how<00:02:31.850> they

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
so be interesting to see how how they

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.360 
so be interesting to see how how they
come<00:02:32.209> back<00:02:32.360> after<00:02:32.720> after<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.680> break<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.190> and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
come back after after that break it and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.670 
come back after after that break it and
where<00:02:34.670> they've<00:02:34.880> improved<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.989> each<00:02:36.319> of<00:02:36.530> their

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680

cricket<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.150> did<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.930> watch<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> first<00:02:51.410> test

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
cricket and did you watch the first test

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.690 
cricket and did you watch the first test
and<00:02:51.799> what<00:02:52.130> did<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.310> think<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.549> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and what did you think of the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.610 
and what did you think of the
performance<00:02:52.819> is<00:02:53.209> oh<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.540> did<00:02:53.930> indeed<00:02:54.200> watch<00:02:54.410> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
performance is oh I did indeed watch the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.150 
performance is oh I did indeed watch the
first<00:02:54.830> test<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.730> think<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.650> outcome<00:02:58.010> was<00:02:58.130> very

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
first test I think the outcome was very

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.770 
first test I think the outcome was very
much<00:02:58.459> determined<00:02:59.060> by<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.209> nature<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.630> the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
much determined by the nature of the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.420 
much determined by the nature of the
pitch<00:03:00.100> which<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.250> think<00:03:01.519> many<00:03:02.329> people<00:03:02.420> will<00:03:02.810> say

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
pitch which I think many people will say

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.870 
pitch which I think many people will say
it<00:03:04.430> was<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.700> bit<00:03:04.880> of<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.060> shame<00:03:05.299> but

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.790 

you<00:03:08.690> know<00:03:08.780> we<00:03:08.930> were<00:03:09.020> probably<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.470> bit<00:03:09.560> too

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
you know we were probably a bit too

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.450 
you know we were probably a bit too

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.730

know<00:03:22.190> they<00:03:22.370> will<00:03:22.850> toiled<00:03:23.240> really<00:03:23.540> hard

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100

obviously<00:03:25.100> was<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> first<00:03:25.520> tee<00:03:25.730> with<00:03:25.970> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
obviously was the first tee with the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.060 
obviously was the first tee with the
most<00:03:26.300> experienced<00:03:26.960> who<00:03:27.170> picked<00:03:27.530> up<00:03:27.710> many<00:03:27.980> of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
most experienced who picked up many of

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.640 
most experienced who picked up many of
the<00:03:28.220> wickets<00:03:28.550> but<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:29.660> think<00:03:30.140> given<00:03:30.620> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
the wickets but I think given the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.920 
the wickets but I think given the
situation<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:31.550> think<00:03:31.610> they<00:03:31.820> worked<00:03:32.060> where

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
situation I think they worked where

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.080 
situation I think they worked where
their<00:03:33.080> socks<00:03:33.290> off<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.800> they<00:03:34.520> showed<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.760> lot<00:03:34.970> of

through<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.730> IPL<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.570> and<00:05:18.280> I've<00:05:19.280> been<00:05:19.490> able

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
through the IPL and and I've been able

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.590 
through the IPL and and I've been able
to<00:05:19.730> meet<00:05:19.910> them<00:05:20.060> at<00:05:20.180> various<00:05:20.480> different

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.780 
to meet them at various different
function<00:05:21.020> so<00:05:21.170> I<00:05:21.200> think<00:05:21.320> that<00:05:22.070> relationship<00:05:22.640> is

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
function so I think that relationship is

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.400 
function so I think that relationship is
already<00:05:23.120> there<00:05:23.270> and<00:05:23.330> that's<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:23.900> important

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
already there and that's so important

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.930 
already there and that's so important
when<00:05:24.560> you<00:05:24.650> go<00:05:24.770> into<00:05:24.980> the<00:05:25.130> commentary<00:05:25.520> box<00:05:25.700> to

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
when you go into the commentary box to
