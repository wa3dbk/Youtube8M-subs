take<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> look<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:27.990> how<00:00:28.140> manifests<00:00:28.650> works<00:00:28.830> to

make sure to keep them separated and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.770 
make sure to keep them separated and

battlefield to go to any zone like the

battlefield to go to any zone like the
hand<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:30.960> grave<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> game<00:01:32.400> ends<00:01:32.930> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
hand or grave or when the game ends you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.780 
hand or grave or when the game ends you
might<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.200> wondering<00:01:34.560> why<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
might be wondering why because a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.969 
might be wondering why because a
manifested<00:01:36.360> card<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.780> anything<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
manifested card can be anything and the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.640 
manifested card can be anything and the
reason<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.369> twofold<00:01:38.780> first<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.020> keeps<00:01:40.380> things

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
reason is twofold first it keeps things

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.560

Dryad<00:05:06.320> Arbor<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:06.710> manifest<00:05:07.220> if<00:05:07.789> you<00:05:08.270> put<00:05:08.419> a

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
Dryad Arbor and manifest if you put a

Dryad Arbor and manifest if you put a
Dryad<00:05:08.780> Arbor<00:05:08.840> facedown<00:05:09.440> can<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:10.250> turn<00:05:10.370> it

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
Dryad Arbor facedown can you turn it

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.879 
Dryad Arbor facedown can you turn it
face<00:05:10.639> up<00:05:10.669> for<00:05:11.000> nothing<00:05:11.650> unfortunately<00:05:12.650> the

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
face up for nothing unfortunately the

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.620 
face up for nothing unfortunately the
answer<00:05:13.039> is<00:05:13.190> no<00:05:13.340> because<00:05:13.940> while<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.479> game

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
answer is no because while the game

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.330 
answer is no because while the game
treats<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.050> lack<00:05:15.199> of<00:05:15.229> a<00:05:15.440> mana<00:05:15.620> cost<00:05:15.860> is<00:05:16.070> zero

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
treats the lack of a mana cost is zero

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.700 
treats the lack of a mana cost is zero
in<00:05:16.520> most<00:05:16.699> cases<00:05:16.910> in<00:05:17.270> this<00:05:17.900> case<00:05:18.110> we<00:05:18.440> look<00:05:18.470> at

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
in most cases in this case we look at

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.350 
in most cases in this case we look at
the<00:05:18.800> actual<00:05:19.160> mana<00:05:19.430> cost<00:05:19.699> there<00:05:19.910> and<00:05:20.120> not<00:05:20.240> the

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
the actual mana cost there and not the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.730 
the actual mana cost there and not the
converted<00:05:20.720> mana<00:05:20.780> cost<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.229> determine<00:05:21.620> what

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
converted mana cost to determine what

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.740 
converted mana cost to determine what
the<00:05:21.860> manifest<00:05:22.220> cost<00:05:22.430> is<00:05:22.639> and<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.330> game<00:05:23.510> sees

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
the manifest cost is and the game sees

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.719 
the manifest cost is and the game sees
nothing<00:05:23.930> since<00:05:24.830> there<00:05:25.010> isn't<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.310> mana<00:05:25.490> cost

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
nothing since there isn't a mana cost

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.939 
nothing since there isn't a mana cost
there<00:05:26.000> you<00:05:26.479> can't<00:05:26.780> pay<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.169> cost<00:05:27.380> and<00:05:27.710> the

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
there you can't pay that cost and the

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.460 
there you can't pay that cost and the
land<00:05:28.130> can't<00:05:28.370> be<00:05:28.490> flipped<00:05:28.699> up<00:05:29.199> alright<00:05:30.199> so

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
land can't be flipped up alright so

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.080 
land can't be flipped up alright so
