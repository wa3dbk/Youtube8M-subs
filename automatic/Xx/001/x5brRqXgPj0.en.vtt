figure out which car you're gonna use it
for<00:00:45.390> right<00:00:46.230> now<00:00:46.260> we're<00:00:46.530> gonna<00:00:46.649> test<00:00:46.859> it<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.219> H

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
for right now we're gonna test it on H

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.410 
for right now we're gonna test it on H
and<00:00:47.760> HPI<00:00:48.329> buggy<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:50.160> step<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.300> make

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and HPI buggy so first step is to make

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.549 
and HPI buggy so first step is to make
sure<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.660> take<00:00:51.839> off<00:00:51.989> these<00:00:52.140> little<00:00:52.350> blocks

sure you take off these little blocks
and<00:00:53.370> they're<00:00:53.460> gonna<00:00:53.579> slide<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.120> underneath

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and they're gonna slide it underneath

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.399 
and they're gonna slide it underneath
the<00:00:54.839> chassis<00:00:55.999> flip<00:00:56.999> it<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:58.350> you're

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
the chassis flip it up and then you're

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.009 
the chassis flip it up and then you're
gonna<00:00:58.499> put<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> block<00:00:59.100> back<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> make

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
gonna put the block back on just to make

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.640 
gonna put the block back on just to make
sure<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:01.649> points<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.399> both<00:01:02.909> corners

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
sure that these points on both corners

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
sure that these points on both corners
are<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:05.070> relation<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> middle<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.240> your

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
are in relation to the middle of your

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
are in relation to the middle of your
tires<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.320> sure<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.700> if

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
tires you want to make sure of that if

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
tires you want to make sure of that if
you<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:09.000> shorter<00:01:09.420> car<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:09.930> smaller<00:01:10.320> wheels

all you have to do is remove these

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.810 
all you have to do is remove these
blocks<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.420> it'll<00:01:12.540> work<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.079> well

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
blocks and it'll work for that as well

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
blocks and it'll work for that as well
so<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> first<00:01:15.119> thing<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.390> gonna<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.140> on

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
left you're gonna find a reference point

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
left you're gonna find a reference point
on<00:01:20.880> your<00:01:21.299> tire<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.840> any<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.170> these<00:01:22.320> ridges<00:01:22.829> or

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
from under your chassis and place it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.630 
from under your chassis and place it
back<00:01:47.880> into<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.299> front<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.719> your<00:01:48.840> car<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
back into the front of your car so the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.459 
back into the front of your car so the
first<00:01:50.880> part<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.329> you're<00:01:51.899> gonna<00:01:51.990> put<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
first part of this you're gonna put the

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.120 
first part of this you're gonna put the
left<00:01:52.710> side<00:01:52.979> back<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.789> that<00:01:53.939> reference<00:01:54.359> point

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
left side back on that reference point

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.499 
left side back on that reference point
now<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> right<00:01:56.579> side<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.060> should<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.299> able

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
now on the right side you should be able

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.660 
now on the right side you should be able
to<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.439> your<00:01:58.710> reference<00:01:58.890> point<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> off

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
to see that your reference point is off

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.480 
to see that your reference point is off
now<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.210> that's<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.539> you<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:00.930> towing

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
now and that's because you have towing

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.429 
now and that's because you have towing
so<00:02:02.490> right<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.270> about<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:03.990> degree<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
so right now we have about one degree of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.499 
so right now we have about one degree of
toen<00:02:04.770> each<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.490> these<00:02:05.579> little<00:02:05.880> notches<00:02:06.090> on

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
toen each one of these little notches on

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.499 
toen each one of these little notches on
the<00:02:06.539> right<00:02:06.810> side<00:02:07.109> shows<00:02:07.649> one<00:02:07.979> degree<00:02:08.509> if

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the right side shows one degree if

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.600 
the right side shows one degree if
you're<00:02:09.660> trying<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.990> measure<00:02:10.140> toe<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.830> instead

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you're trying to measure toe out instead

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.820 
you're trying to measure toe out instead
all<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:13.290> complete

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
all you have to do is this complete

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.720 
all you have to do is this complete
process<00:02:14.040> backwards<00:02:15.080> you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
process backwards you

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.820 
process backwards you
flip<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.690> do<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.020> front<00:02:18.290> first<00:02:18.530> and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
flip this and do the front first and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.680 
flip this and do the front first and
then<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.370> place<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.730> into<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:19.940> back<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.420> do

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
then you place it into the back and do

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.720 
then you place it into the back and do
the<00:02:20.810> rear<00:02:21.019> side<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:22.099> should<00:02:22.129> show<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the rear side and it should show you the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.940 
the rear side and it should show you the
toe<00:02:22.879> out<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:23.930> process<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.470> really<00:02:24.650> easy

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
toe out so this process is really easy

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.400 
toe out so this process is really easy
to<00:02:25.129> do<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:26.150> can<00:02:26.330> work<00:02:26.450> for<00:02:26.480> on-road<00:02:26.989> cars<00:02:27.290> as

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
to do it can work for on-road cars as

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.630 
to do it can work for on-road cars as
well<00:02:27.530> all<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.920> have<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.129> do<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.370> get<00:02:28.519> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
well all you have to do is get the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.040 
well all you have to do is get the
height<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:29.030> little<00:02:29.269> higher<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.900> put

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
height a little higher so you can put

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.050 
height a little higher so you can put
blocks<00:02:30.319> underneath<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:31.040> tire<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.849> want

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
blocks underneath the tire if you want

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.970 
blocks underneath the tire if you want
and<00:02:32.239> all<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.830> same
