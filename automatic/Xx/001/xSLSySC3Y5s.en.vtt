00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
couple of minutes but I got myself a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.810 
couple of minutes but I got myself a
screwdriver<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> found<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.369> giving

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820

right underneath it and popping it out
like<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.199> is<00:00:25.199> easier<00:00:25.740> than<00:00:25.769> using<00:00:26.539> pliers<00:00:27.539> or

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
