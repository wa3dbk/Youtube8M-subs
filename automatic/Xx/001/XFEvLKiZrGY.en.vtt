and we're just going to leave that in
the<00:00:37.920> water<00:00:38.070> whilst<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> rest

the water whilst we get on with the rest

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.299 
the water whilst we get on with the rest
of<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.379> set<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.680> aside<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
of it so you can just set that aside and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
of it so you can just set that aside and
that<00:00:44.489> will<00:00:44.610> be<00:00:44.760> adding<00:00:45.360> flavor<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> it

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that will be adding flavor to it

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.630 
that will be adding flavor to it
perfectly<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.770> hopefully<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.219> pan<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.550> be

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
perfectly so hopefully your pan will be

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
perfectly so hopefully your pan will be
getting<00:00:47.789> nice<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.239> hot<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> add

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
getting nice and hot so just need to add

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
getting nice and hot so just need to add
about<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.039> tablespoon<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.760> oil<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> pan

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
about a tablespoon of oil to the pan

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
about a tablespoon of oil to the pan
then<00:00:51.750> we're<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> put<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> prawns<00:00:52.890> in

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
then we're going to put the prawns in

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:12.320 
then we're going to put the prawns in
the<00:00:53.370> chillies<00:00:53.730> straight<00:00:54.510> in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:26.039 

and<00:01:12.870> just<00:01:13.080> give<00:01:13.230> it<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.410> stir<00:01:13.560> around<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.160> pan

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:35.450 

we<00:01:26.590> just<00:01:26.799> cook<00:01:27.009> this<00:01:27.219> for<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.549> minute<00:01:27.939> or<00:01:28.119> so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.370 

because

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.289 

just<00:01:39.950> keep<00:01:40.159> moving<00:01:40.520> them<00:01:40.640> around<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.060> pan

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
just keep moving them around the pan

00:01:41.299 --> 00:02:16.230 
just keep moving them around the pan
just<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.049> everything<00:01:42.439> doesn't<00:01:42.770> burn

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240

when you come back what you need to have
done<00:03:39.680> if<00:03:40.069> you<00:03:40.159> do<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.459> now<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:41.120> put<00:03:41.359> another

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
done if you do this now you put another

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.199 
done if you do this now you put another
400<00:03:42.170> milliliters<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.950> boiling<00:03:43.370> water<00:03:43.430> into

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
400 milliliters of boiling water into

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.300 
400 milliliters of boiling water into
your<00:03:44.450> measuring<00:03:44.810> cup<00:03:45.109> put<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.829> fish<00:03:46.040> bits

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
your measuring cup put the fish bits

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.909 
your measuring cup put the fish bits
back<00:03:46.639> in<00:03:46.879> there<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.359> leave<00:03:47.750> that<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.260> steep

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
back in there and leave that to steep

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.830 
back in there and leave that to steep
and<00:03:49.280> soak<00:03:49.760> up<00:03:49.939> all<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.209> flavor

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
and soak up all the flavor

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.589 
and soak up all the flavor
so<00:03:51.169> once<00:03:51.379> the<00:03:51.560> 10<00:03:51.769> minutes<00:03:52.099> is<00:03:52.250> up<00:03:52.639> most<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.389> the

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
so once the 10 minutes is up most of the

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.330 
so once the 10 minutes is up most of the
liquid<00:03:53.810> should<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:54.290> evaporated<00:03:54.980> from<00:03:55.010> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
liquid should have evaporated from the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.179 
liquid should have evaporated from the
risotto<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.389> then<00:03:57.079> just<00:03:57.379> do<00:03:57.709> what<00:03:57.919> we<00:03:58.010> did

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
risotto and then just do what we did

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.240 
risotto and then just do what we did
just<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:59.120> minute<00:03:59.359> ago<00:03:59.419> pour<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.409> water<00:04:00.620> through

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
just a minute ago pour the water through

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.599 
just a minute ago pour the water through
the<00:04:01.400> sieve<00:04:01.639> into<00:04:02.629> the<00:04:02.810> risotto<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:04.040> then

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
the sieve into the risotto and then

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.580 
the sieve into the risotto and then
leave<00:04:04.819> it<00:04:04.849> to<00:04:05.239> bubble<00:04:05.510> again<00:04:05.840> for<00:04:06.139> another<00:04:06.290> 10

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
leave it to bubble again for another 10

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.429 
leave it to bubble again for another 10
minutes<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:07.189> we'll<00:04:08.000> be<00:04:08.329> ready<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.810> finish<00:04:09.109> off

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
minutes and we'll be ready to finish off

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.349 
minutes and we'll be ready to finish off
so<00:04:09.680> that's<00:04:09.859> 20<00:04:10.280> minutes<00:04:10.579> in<00:04:10.760> total

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
so that's 20 minutes in total

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.959 
so that's 20 minutes in total
just<00:04:11.930> 10<00:04:12.500> minutes<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:14.150> then<00:04:14.419> 10<00:04:14.659> minutes
