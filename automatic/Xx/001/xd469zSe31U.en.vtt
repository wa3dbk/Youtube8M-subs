00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.129
 hello everyone has his hall gauges 

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:10.360
 as you may have noticed one of 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.889
 my last videos it was the 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.740
 unpacking the iphone 5s and well 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.910
 now we will go to tests in 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.680
 first we will talk about 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.640
 outside the product and afterwards 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.259
 of what we have inside at the level of 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.849
 design from compared to the iphone 5 it 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.920
 are not really change aside 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.109
 the home button that has totally changed 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.060
 you have a metal circle that is from 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.100
 the same color as your iphone that goes 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.540
 cover the home button and you have the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.570
 square in the middle we used to 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.590
 to have my that just disappeared 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.510
 after you have a new color that 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.340
 has been added the color gold that I have 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.750
 right in hand so it is proposed 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.210
 in three colors gray and white gold 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.390
 you have a height of 123 8 mm a 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.490
 width of 58.6 mm a depth of 7.6 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.920
 mm and a weight of 110 grams the device 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.110
 is thin and light the behind as well as 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.820
 the contours are aluminum and me 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.680
 as it is the gold version it is daury 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.439
 we stay on a 4 inch screen with a 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.210
 resolution of 1136 steps 640 pixels from 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.640
 face you have a sensor as well as a 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.619
 2 megapixel facetime camera that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.179
 shoot in 720p 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.289
 behind you have two flash as well 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:19.390
 a camera 8 megapixels years 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.679
 you have the power button down you 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.329
 have the mini jack jack that the 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.840
 lightning connector as well as the microphone 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.399
 hello by their pass on the side then 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.710
 left side you have the button 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.219
 silent as well as volume buttons 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.689
 more or less after right you have 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.109
 the location to put your nano 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.399
 cement we'll talk about speed 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.469
 the device starts after 20 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.659
 seconds and turns off after 20 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.859
 seconds then on this iphone the big 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.310
 novelty too is that you have the 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.979
 4g 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.439
 you should know that this iphone offers 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.689
 a ream of 1 giga like the iphone 5 a 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.060
 7 processor which is a processor of 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.799
 heart of 1.3 gigahertz and the first 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.630
 64-bit processor that was proposing on a 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.109
 smartphone the device is twice as much 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.329
 quick 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.979
 image rates are higher with 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.499
 more real textures and shadows 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.510
 canaille fun 5 and game graphics by 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.880
 example will be much better 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.980
 you also have a m 7 processor shot 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.660
 and 6 of the no nonsense it allows to 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.670
 manage more effectively some 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.370
 device data while retaining 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.110
 better battery life 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.550
 precisely speaking of battery is at 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.130
 about the same compared to the iphone 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.410
 5 but with the co processor you 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.770
 maybe win between thirty-one 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.590
 hours of autonomy and more so we go 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.640
 use geekbench which shows us 1400 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.420
 in single heart and in multi 2494 for 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.470
 iphone 5 s 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.690
 we will make a comparison with 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.410
 the iphone 5 where we have precisely the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.810
 half for each score 713 and 1284 this 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.790
 which is quite huge then at 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.200
 level photo it remains the same for the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.460
 most devices you have the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.590
 opportunity to take pictures of 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.670
 videos of photos in panorama of photos 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.260
 square and even to add filters 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.910
 so we stay with mega pixels like 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.220
 the iphone 5 but it has been improved 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.260
 the sensor and 15% bigger so the 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.970
 pixels are going to be bigger you have 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.380
 two flash led a yellow and a white 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.840
 who will regulate effectively 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.670
 Flash intensity and temperature 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.180
 of color to get a better 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.739
 photo in the dark for example 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.209
 so just to judge the quality 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.959
 I allowed myself to do some 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.519
 photos and some videos you have 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.530
 also a burst mode that allows 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.170
 take images per second when 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.930
 you film you make a video with 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.459
 120 frames per second in 720p and you 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.209
 can even play up to three times 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.209
 while filming 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.090
 e 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.220
 on this new iphone security is a 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.080
 first selling points of apple 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.480
 put your finger on the home button 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.100
 and your iphone unlocks more 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.020
 simple one code and it's much more 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.090
 fast which is also practical what 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.330
 your fingerprints can also accept 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.620
 your purchases on itunes and the app store 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.970
 so how does it work already it takes 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.040
 know that at the first start you will 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.000
 request to register a fingerprint and 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.690
 if you want to add more 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.910
 fingerprints 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.070
 it will go into the settings then 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.440
 in general code and footprints and there 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.550
 we're going to ask for a code that's the one 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.530
 you chose at the first 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.210
 startup it's nothing complicated after 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.990
 that we will record the footprint of 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.900
 any finger 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.280
 me for example I do with my thumb 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.210
 now you will have to put and 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.370
 remove the finger several times what he 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.040
 must also know if that if you want 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.170
 use all the fingers of your hands there 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.970
 will absolutely have to register at each 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.010
 time your finger because customs 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.990
 do not have the same footprints 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.700
 I recorded my thumb I'm going my 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.160
 inch and see the device get 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.950
 unlocks we're going now the 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.750
 lock and then we'll try to 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.590
 unlock but with a finger that I 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.660
 have not saved 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.790
 and you see it does not work it takes 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.870
 try again I put one of the fingers that I have 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.870
 recorded and it works 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.720
 iphone 5s integrate the new 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.460
 operating system the ios is you 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.600
 have all the apps as well as 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.270
 features that have been 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.620
 totally reviewed you have syie the app 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.320
 store you have plenty of applications 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.760
 paid and free to download you 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.740
 have the notification part that has changed 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.970
 to a new multitasking the control 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.950
 center that will allow you to have 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.660
 some settings as a shortcut 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.669
 if you want to have information 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.530
 complementary on the bones is I 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.270
 will put video links in the 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.250
 description to give you an idea of 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.169
 how he is 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.729
 the video test is over if you wish 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.440
 see more videos on the iphone 5 is 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.090
 this I will put all my videos as 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.830
 comparisons or my opinion on 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.380
 the iphone 5 aces in the description of 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.630
 the video for those who know me 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.580
 I'm not a French youtuber who 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.810
 made videos under ios and android where 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.040
 I propose tips of 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.720
 unpacking and lots of other things 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.340
 so do not hesitate to subscribe on
