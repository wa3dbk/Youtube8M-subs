00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.029
 Because Yes Dawn in I bought something good in the lullaby song round Jajan amazon 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.240
 I will open it 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.379
 Pretty big it made of its own weight hall 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.379
 Oolong Hmmm 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.140
 It was purchased this time I Wija Jean 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:27.680
 Fender checker flap of manufacturer named Kijima 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:32.000
 Part number 206 hyphen 9 round 1 number plate joint tightening type 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.510
 We purchased this thing called this Fender Checker flap so it is 800 yen here 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.940
 It is written but I 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.420
 tried to open can Was So little purchased at 864 yen free shipping amazon 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.690
 Let's go 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.050
 祐 窯 Eastern Europe together 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:52.049
 Yes it is a thing of something like this back is like this 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.500
 Well what I use is what I have in the rear fender part of the Super Cub 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:58.420
 Trying to attach this 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:03.820
 A cat hole in the place where the license plate of Diana is attached 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.699
 It's about tightening the plate and making it look like a muddy system 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.420
 Oh dear 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.490
 It said under the Once you have the license plate had this in here this is the Zehnder Lahn 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.229
 It feels like it hangs down 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.619
 I think it looks a bit fashionable if you look from behind 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.619
 Unexpectedly , there seems to be some people using this moped Nakata quite well 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.720
 It seems that there are a lot of people who use it in a fairly reasonable stock 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:30.930
 Well , even if you look at Amazon's review, it's surprisingly popular 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.980
 Surprisingly Eemaa popular feeling that say custom Petit custom that you can feel free I was good 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.110
 It seemed like there was 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.810
 Emaa the future of the moving image is also tentatively Well here like this Petit custom video yeah Well this video 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.729
 I don't know if it's OK 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.899
 I wonder if I'm going to release more and more videos like Puchikas from now on 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.590
 think 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.180
 Well, it is no longer possible that such a boy can put out pom pom, but maybe it will come out occasionally 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 I think 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.540
 Well that 's why that kind of super cub I've got is what I see from the back 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:04.000
 A little green and fender 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.790
 I wonder if I still that say a little Hey child everyone felt Looking at the fender and behind 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.680
 Because it feels like a business bike 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.780
 Well by attaching this some thin tires will not be so noticeable 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.830
 There is a lot of variety 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.530
 By attaching this, it looks surprisingly good I look from behind 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.580
 It was eyes Cho 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.430
 How well I think that I wonder if not it becomes so oh well I know this material Ma 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:31.280
 It looks like a rubbery material. 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:35.840
 Well, it's not even as much as I fluent there a thickness in surprisingly 1 seen over much thickness 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.550
 There is no feeling that it is so sloppy, but it has already been surprisingly moist 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.440
 It's so easy to tear a cat or crack 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:49.320
 It's not at all a problem I also Toka or around the I is not a material such as Chau 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:54.210
 It is not at all a problem It is completely okay to or wound in this Innovation the second floor floor glue 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:57.420
 Yes that's the size but it looks like there's a 27 cm shield 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.540
 Well there is almost 27 centimeters 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.879
 27 putty 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:09.790
 The width also changes slightly depending on the place in centimeters and sideways little by little . 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:16.720
 But in the case of amazon, it was written with 21 points 6 centimeters in the south down width 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:20.980
 A little measured and try dormer Well medium in most places wide the width of the my sentence 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:26.800
 It is only about 9 centimeters . 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:30.940
 So the heat was 1.4 mm and it was once written on the product page of amazon 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:36.710
 Yes, so the pitch of this screw hole part was written with centimeters freely 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:41.120
 Oh, it's almost like a total of 12 totally cured. 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:46.010
 Because there is floor width , I do not think that it does not fit well 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.760
 Well, I feel like that. Then I attached this fender checker flap 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.030
 Where 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:56.730
 I will you show to now it in please Yes like this 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.340
 Well I'm not a video, but it will be a little image, but after installing well 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:07.680
 It feels like it was shot like this, but it's hot now 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:12.599
 Hey properly yet Well, now it's not attached work in at all when you are put 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.599
 Ma Suma It is like this I think has come out mounting a finished image is now 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.720
 her a will actually feel like that 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:22.090
 Marmot other images 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:27.120
 I think I'm probably shooting something I think I put it on the blog 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.390
 If you would like to actually buy something about it, you should also read blog articles 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.650
 Please give me 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:40.320
 In this case, it was introduction of Hender checker flap of Iejima 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:45.539
 You can easily make a petit custom just by tightening them together at the number plate 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.949
 In this well to because you can buy at the root amazon in the recommended is the addition of about 800 yen 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:52.500
 Because price is cheap, too 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:54.639
 Reamer It is a kind of this, but there was only this pattern, but a little different person 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.930
 But the place below is nice 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.580
 A little design because there was also a guy that has become something this Naminami feeling rather not you 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.590
 Because there was another guy 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:11.340
 Well, I 'll put a link on it to blog posts, so if you care, articles 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.340
 Please also see the person, so it's also good- bye
