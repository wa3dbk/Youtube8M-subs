00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:26.180
 when the time it costs like hello 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.279
 Today I wanted to talk to you about the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.010
 different things we can do with 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.559
 polymer clay and is basically 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.129
 that polymeric garcia that comes in three 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.519
 of packets and if one buys it in a 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.950
 big package like this one for example 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:49.010
 then it comes out a little cheaper 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.010
 this polymer clay cost me about 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.290
 about 20 dollars and bring a pack of 10 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.290
 colors 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.640
 and basically we have each packet 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.780
 brings to more or less the amount to 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.780
 make some 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.810
 40 different types of projects and if 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.819
 one buys in different colors 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.609
 then one can do different 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:24.049
 projects the difference between clay 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:26.929
 polymeric and the normal clay or the 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.369
 normal putty like play doh and that's 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.880
 that for example when I take on the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.369
 Polymer clay number one does not let you 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.549
 any color on the finger to one and also 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.810
 it is easy to handle it adheres 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.960
 easily to different surfaces and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.670
 basically it's easy to work 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.070
 when one uses polymer clay 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.860
 for example they can make different 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.130
 projects as a speaker I do not know if they can 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.970
 see here this little cupcake like 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.400
 cake that you make if you do not see here and 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.450
 this other part made it easier for 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.119
 video and you will see well soon 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.610
 what one needs to do in the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.129
 project is with polymer chair is 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.830
 basically the polymer clay their 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.310
 hands 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.720
 if they need they can also use a 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:27.480
 needle with some normal like for example 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.300
 is what and practically as a roller 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.640
 to do what one needs to do is 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.930
 this emotion one can use a pencil 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.510
 or pencil 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.269
 and basically with the needle what would 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.750
 it's simply to be canceled 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.450
 the chairs as you see here 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.040
 if they need to have another type of 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.519
 tools for example I have this 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.020
 tool and basically all this was 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.390
 bought by my husband 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.550
 to bring you more tutorials about 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.070
 polymer clay and these tools 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.610
 they are tools that allow one 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:11.280
 do different types of health 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.280
 for example for one to do 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.620
 projects that have something to do like 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.050
 with surfaces that are flat or for 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.650
 make it hard on the surface to 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.650
 cut 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.590
 make crossover marks to cut 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.980
 again and so on like this 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.430
 toolkit cost me 11 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.900
 Dollars 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.590
 and regarding the tool that it brings and 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.049
 good the polymer clay so every 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.989
 little package costs more or less to hide 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.260
 about three dollars here and if one 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:57.280
 they buy the package and everything is right 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.889
 much cheaper more or less pay two 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.500
 dollars for each package when it costs 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.810
 about three to four dollars and one the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.879
 I bought the craft store so I 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.540
 I think it 's a good investment because 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:13.359
 one can do this kind of 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.509
 crafts and also sell them one you 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:19.930
 put a chain or do not put a keychain 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.609
 or you can put it as for phones 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.919
 cell phones 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.320
 etcetera so one can do 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.289
 different kind of things and I'm going to 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.849
 enter teaching in the next videos 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.370
 what things can you do with a chair 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.750
 polymeric and I hope you like it 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.750
 until the next goodbye 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.009
 ah
