00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.140
 Today we make cinnamon buns of all 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.050
 senses I have to honestly say that 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.160
 I have never eaten the original but 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.740
 I could imagine that 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.490
 Original tastes about it and it is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.100
 a dream 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.660
 that was with the best cinnamon rolls the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.130
 i ate i always had to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.810
 try it out a bit before I do 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.250
 to deliver you the best I think that is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.390
 really the best team snails 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.580
 concept that I know 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.010
 she crawls about 20 pieces and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.750
 A piece has about as much calories 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 But I have to say that it too 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.200
 really a really big juicy 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.640
 So it's worth it 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
 say we go directly to the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.219
 preparation so we need flour once 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 milk custard powder I have to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.860
 so convert this kaddor 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.320
 Pack the half for the Turkish 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.199
 434 vanilla flavor for a bit 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.180
 Help and clubhouse dice or once 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.340
 dry yeast a pack of sugar 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.670
 choice butter butter butter 1 egg then 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.170
 we still need brown sugar cinnamon and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
 powdered sugar the exact quantities 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.580
 you can always find them in the infobox 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.979
 but is it you first preparation 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.750
 I have each 500 grams of flour bent 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.259
 I am always very accurate until the end 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.180
 gram exactly over night but duel 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.210
 Over there we have sugar once 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.100
 Let's go with the second one and 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.150
 the whole stir then same too 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.159
 ever and pudding powder from hp den 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.619
 podcast dorsch so half of that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.990
 pack and once before good 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.280
 by mixing 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.140
 Alas, everything is always so difficult 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 because I always can not quite do that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.820
 convert into Turkish units 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.380
 pudding powder 37 grams are little and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:54.360
 that was a bit difficult so 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:57.090
 what a shortage of half a yeast 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.040
 half yeast pack so d'isere crumbly 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.439
 then in the tub milk and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.560
 he mixes that well with it 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.659
 even a bit bubbly then 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.940
 Let's give an egg in the predict 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.560
 mixed mix and then comes 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.740
 soft butter you can please 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.500
 to get out in front of it 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.380
 on room temperature too that comes 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 then everything in the kitchenaid and now 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.950
 This scraper gets it all so 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.860
 clean and then comes very slowly the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.780
 Milk yeast mix with pure and that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.200
 then everything becomes a nice smooth 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.080
 Dough processed with me that was unfortunately 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.310
 so the dough is still a bit too 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.230
 that's why I did not quite commit 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.510
 added some flour there 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.330
 So it just makes you so long 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.640
 your perfect day off that you notice 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.560
 then just stop it when it's really good 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.760
 so he should not stick anymore 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.540
 how do you knead that you can again 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.950
 nice by the child, I have noticed 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.390
 that would be on a cold plate 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.520
 Of course not so good, so best 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.830
 also have warm hands because then goes 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.960
 after that dat a bit better on that 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.380
 that whole film I then to a ball 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.540
 and there are whole in a bowl here 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.940
 from tupper and there I enter 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.670
 a little flour on top and the whole thing 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.800
 then comes for an hour under mine 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.390
 ceiling on a heated ceiling find 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.950
 I'm best on such a 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.530
 In the meantime I mix brown 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.480
 sugar and a bit together 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.910
 So those are the ingredients for the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.550
 filling so after an hour saw it that way 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.900
 out 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.280
 really good that the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.320
 determined on the heating blanket 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.670
 then things get more good times to 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.890
 the work surface kneaded out the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.480
 could knead so really good 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.490
 might have previously said charlie on 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.440
 to lose weight yes I have here 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.370
 Mine died from raul and stick extra 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.620
 stay here you can do that again 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.360
 super-g it really works 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.450
 impeccable and i am so glad that i am 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.450
 then 20 euros or 30 invested 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.510
 but also here the dough once 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:08.440
 and that must be a format with what 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.790
 a format that is me with the whole 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.780
 butter so there really must be 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.420
 whole butter 1 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.350
 you can do a bit on the edge 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.850
 leave blank because otherwise clip after 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.100
 not so good together we want that 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.440
 Neckar to stick together at the end and 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.260
 not after then so we go 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.040
 there all the sugar cinnamon mixture 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.320
 on top 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040
 when I think of this snail now 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.740
 that your delicious 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.570
 This still gives me in the nose and then 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.790
 we go there nor the purely walnuts 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.860
 or picker tastes that tastes so delicious 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.110
 with the walnuts so leave it on 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.630
 no case away that must be so then 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.640
 We want the whole one one I Roll 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.470
 must say not too thin 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.510
 do not roll too thick so exactly 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.280
 hit the golden middle and then have 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.460
 we're a really big one, so to speak 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.530
 big fat sausage you can dare before 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.990
 yes, but then we have this sausage 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.760
 we cut the whole into pieces myself 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:07.060
 have as I said 19 20 pieces approximately 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.710
 got out and we live the whole 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.490
 because I have a permanent back film here 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.540
 I put all the students on and then 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.550
 You can arrange them very well 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.780
 was before pressing a bit flat 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.940
 then they do not go up but 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.320
 in the broad and then sees the whole 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.530
 afterwards, when baking a bit more beautiful 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.390
 from who now on the outside on it 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.669
 pay attention so that we leave whole again 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.560
 go for an hour and then you will see 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.940
 like this 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.810
 yes baby so really right liquid 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.300
 I can not describe it either 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.030
 how it looks the same and the whole is coming 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.009
 then about 20 minutes in the 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.229
 oven the exact one 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.939
 the number can be found in the infobox and 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.830
 in the meantime, prepare like that 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.869
 frosting so the klausur once before 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.389
 here I once philadelphia with 

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:55.649
 Powdered sugar mixed and I have 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:58.270
 This time, 30 grams of butter added and 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:00.339
 liquid butter and then I still have 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.249
 a little bit vanilla flavoring 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:05.619
 Of course it would be better with the extract 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:07.300
 I had not come home yet 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:08.889
 Still I'm always looking for it 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.990
 Everything would be difficult here too 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.580
 so they all mix it then 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.009
 really good and then have 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.569
 her after that frosting for that if you 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.020
 that did come naturally 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:21.819
 Everything on the snails 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.349
 should be finished now and so are 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.779
 These snails look really nice 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:28.930
 golden brown and there you give thanks 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:30.219
 Glaze on top and I'm doing here 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.589
 right now for you a little one 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:34.389
 mini tasting so you see the 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:35.649
 snails have really worked well 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.349
 So they are perfect 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:39.699
 become and I was thrilled and the 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.649
 smell the whole apartment has after 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:44.439
 smelled and here I have a little 

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:50.559
