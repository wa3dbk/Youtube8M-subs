Q: A club senior(Boy) always tell me, "You will look beautiful if you do makeup, 'A little bit more'"

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.040
But he doesn't give any talks yet.. is this a good signal(green light)?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.140
I want to capture his heart. Please let me know I can do this through makeup, Greenlight Makeup

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.240

Eungkyoung Jung, Makeup Artist at Yoning

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.340
Today I am gonna show you how you can be attractive for him through Greenlight Makeup

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:37.352
S1: Apply primer slightly on T-zone to make soft-look skin.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.020
People asks how to use blusher in makeup.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.040
S2: Put cream-textured blusher on the center of the cheeks. And spread them using fingers softly. 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.900
Tip: Use the same blusher inner part of lips.

00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:23.214
Cream-typed texture make more soft and matte appeal on lips in comparison with lip gloss and lip locker.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.780
S3: Apply foundation on the entire face except cheeks blushed. The foundation having SPF features is highly recommended in summer.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.860
Use sponge to spread the foundation evenly.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.520
Use a latex puff to blend the unnatural boundary between cream blusher and foundation.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.540
This blending works as blooming as natural on your face.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.340
Tip: Using a compact or transparent power help hairs not to be clung to forehead or face because of sweat or water in summer.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.000
S4: Apply coral-colored pearl shadows with brush on upper part of the eyes softly after lashes curled.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.500
S5: To make eyes brighter, apply a mascara on the entire eyelashes.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.820
Put the mascara more on the center of the upper lashes. Repeat that under eye lashes.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.280
S6: Fill in the blanks on the brows using pencil-typed brows. 

00:03:23.658 --> 00:03:29.278
S7 : Apply highlighter on T-zone, around eyes, and lips. This gets the face much smaller on looking.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.540
Lastly use the highlighter on lips to make the lip line clear.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.900
So that's it. But one more.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.260
I am gonna put a little more the volume on the lips using tint gloss.
