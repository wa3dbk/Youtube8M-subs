00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569 
handles so it has like a nice grip
factor<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.380> doesn't<00:01:55.590> get<00:01:55.829> hot<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.430> know

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
factor to it it doesn't get hot you know

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.670 
factor to it it doesn't get hot you know
it<00:01:56.850> doesn't<00:01:57.060> feel<00:01:57.360> plastic<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> feels<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.439> nice

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it doesn't feel plastic it feels a nice

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.880 
it doesn't feel plastic it feels a nice
really<00:01:59.640> does<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.320> kind<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> weird

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
really does and this is kind of weird

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
really does and this is kind of weird
but<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> smells<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.790> chocolate<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.450> I'm<00:02:03.719> all

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
but it smells like chocolate and I'm all

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.410 
but it smells like chocolate and I'm all
down<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.909> now<00:02:05.969> let's<00:02:06.149> put<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
down for that so now let's put on the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.260 
down for that so now let's put on the
blue<00:02:06.689> one<00:02:07.160> taking<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> off<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.640> want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> I

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
blue one taking it off I just want to I

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.990 
blue one taking it off I just want to I
guess<00:02:10.050> start<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> handles<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
guess start with the handles just do it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.890 
guess start with the handles just do it
around<00:02:12.180> that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
around that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.670 
around that
then<00:02:13.290> work<00:02:13.470> your<00:02:13.590> way<00:02:14.480> going<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.780> way<00:02:15.989> strong

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
then work your way going this way strong

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.410 
then work your way going this way strong
to<00:02:16.799> be<00:02:16.860> too<00:02:16.980> rough<00:02:17.159> with<00:02:17.310> them<00:02:17.400> because<00:02:17.579> this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
to be too rough with them because this

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.960 
to be too rough with them because this
is<00:02:18.480> very<00:02:18.870> thin<00:02:19.260> material<00:02:19.409> here<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:20.610> could<00:02:20.730> say

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
is very thin material here you could say

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.020 
is very thin material here you could say
it<00:02:21.329> will<00:02:21.540> snap<00:02:22.280> let's<00:02:23.280> put<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.549> black<00:02:23.819> one

just I see this breaking in the near
future<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:20.459> for<00:03:20.760> honestly<00:03:21.419> it<00:03:21.569> was<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.810> it

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
future but for honestly it was like it

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.599 
future but for honestly it was like it
was<00:03:22.049> less<00:03:22.319> than<00:03:22.500> five<00:03:22.739> dollars<00:03:22.949> for<00:03:23.280> both<00:03:23.459> of

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
these together it's definitely a good

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.220 
these together it's definitely a good
