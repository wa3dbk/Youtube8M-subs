00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.729 

it<00:04:56.449> takes<00:04:56.689> the<00:04:56.809> same<00:04:57.019> did<00:04:57.349> the<00:04:57.439> different

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:57.739 
it takes the same did the different

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.879 
it takes the same did the different
parts<00:04:57.949> of<00:04:58.069> it<00:04:58.189> have<00:04:58.789> the<00:04:58.939> same<00:04:59.179> flavor<00:04:59.889> unlike

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
parts of it have the same flavor unlike

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.070 
parts of it have the same flavor unlike
a<00:05:01.159> chicken<00:05:01.639> where<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:02.479> brass<00:05:02.719> is<00:05:02.929> wrote<00:05:03.110> white

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
a chicken where the brass is wrote white

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.189 
a chicken where the brass is wrote white
so<00:05:06.080> I'd<00:05:06.949> say<00:05:07.189> if<00:05:07.249> you<00:05:07.309> like<00:05:07.489> pheasant<00:05:07.969> is<00:05:08.199> like

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.509 
so I'd say if you like pheasant is like
mild<00:05:09.499> pheasant<00:05:10.039> locates<00:05:10.399> like<00:05:12.159> okay<00:05:13.159> that's
