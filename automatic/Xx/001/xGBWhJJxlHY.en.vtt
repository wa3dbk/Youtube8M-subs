square and then press jump in r1 at the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.869 
square and then press jump in r1 at the
same<00:00:56.449> time<00:00:56.720> or<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.409> place<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:58.010> button

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
same time or the place it button

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.660 
same time or the place it button
whatever<00:00:59.059> it<00:00:59.360> is<00:00:59.479> on<00:00:59.629> xbox<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.409> then<00:01:01.339> you'll

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
whatever it is on xbox and then you'll

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.430 
whatever it is on xbox and then you'll
do<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.879> little<00:01:02.120> hop<00:01:02.420> when<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.809> place<00:01:03.049> it<00:01:03.260> and

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
do a little hop when you place it and

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.229 
do a little hop when you place it and
then<00:01:03.649> you'll<00:01:04.129> probably<00:01:04.699> have<00:01:04.940> done<00:01:05.089> it

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
then you'll probably have done it

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.550 
then you'll probably have done it
correctly<00:01:05.360> because<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.080> pretty<00:01:06.320> easy

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
correctly because this is pretty easy

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.070 
correctly because this is pretty easy
and<00:01:06.860> not<00:01:07.460> what<00:01:07.700> it'll<00:01:07.880> do<00:01:08.119> is<00:01:08.149> it'll<00:01:08.360> aim<00:01:08.840> at

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
and not what it'll do is it'll aim at

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.050 
and not what it'll do is it'll aim at
you're<00:01:09.200> at<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.039> enemy<00:01:10.310> team<00:01:10.490> but<00:01:10.759> it<00:01:10.850> won't

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
you're at the enemy team but it won't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.660 
you're at the enemy team but it won't
shoot<00:01:11.360> them<00:01:11.600> as<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.050> see<00:01:12.080> right<00:01:12.259> here<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:13.610> you

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
shoot them as you see right here now you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.820 
shoot them as you see right here now you
can<00:01:14.000> also<00:01:14.119> do<00:01:14.420> this<00:01:14.570> online<00:01:14.780> obviously<00:01:15.590> but

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
can also do this online obviously but

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.950 
can also do this online obviously but
I'm<00:01:15.979> not<00:01:16.190> really<00:01:16.369> sure<00:01:16.490> quite<00:01:17.360> why<00:01:17.539> you'd<00:01:17.690> want

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
I'm not really sure quite why you'd want

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.529 
I'm not really sure quite why you'd want
to<00:01:18.399> but<00:01:19.399> to<00:01:19.610> make<00:01:19.759> it<00:01:19.789> shoot<00:01:20.030> again<00:01:20.300> I'll<00:01:20.420> need

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
to but to make it shoot again I'll need

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.060 
to but to make it shoot again I'll need
to<00:01:20.659> do<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.810> pick<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.170> back<00:01:21.289> up<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.710> place<00:01:21.920> it

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
to do is pick it back up and place it

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.160 
to do is pick it back up and place it
again<00:01:22.280> normally<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.479> will<00:01:23.690> shoot<00:01:23.929> again

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
again normally and it will shoot again

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.809 
again normally and it will shoot again
but<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:24.890> could<00:01:25.039> be<00:01:25.190> a<00:01:25.220> pretty<00:01:25.490> funny

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
but this could be a pretty funny

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.389 
but this could be a pretty funny
trolling<00:01:26.149> glitch<00:01:26.450> i<00:01:26.600> guess<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.710> it's<00:01:27.950> alright

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
trolling glitch i guess so it's alright

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.029 
trolling glitch i guess so it's alright
but<00:01:29.300> there's<00:01:29.690> it's<00:01:29.960> almost<00:01:30.380> like<00:01:30.619> treyarch
