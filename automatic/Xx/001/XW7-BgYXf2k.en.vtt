drivers that we have here if they came
too<00:00:19.820> close<00:00:19.849> together<00:00:20.419> we<00:00:20.630> might<00:00:20.810> not<00:00:20.989> have<00:00:21.050> the

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
too close together we might not have the

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
enough room you know but just to make

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:42.890 
enough room you know but just to make

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.450 

yeah<00:00:43.900> there's<00:00:44.500> definitely<00:00:44.560> more<00:00:45.100> than<00:00:45.250> 12

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
yeah there's definitely more than 12

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.490 
yeah there's definitely more than 12
foot<00:00:45.670> there<00:00:45.880> now<00:00:46.300> just<00:00:46.690> for<00:00:46.840> your<00:00:46.960> common

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
foot there now just for your common

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.020 
foot there now just for your common
knowledge<00:00:47.650> your<00:00:48.190> standard<00:00:48.550> trail<00:00:48.760> is<00:00:48.910> going

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
knowledge your standard trail is going

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.640 
knowledge your standard trail is going
to<00:00:49.090> be<00:00:49.180> eight<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.540> half<00:00:49.600> wide<00:00:49.989> 8<00:00:50.380> foot<00:00:50.620> 6

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
to be eight and a half wide 8 foot 6

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.460 
to be eight and a half wide 8 foot 6
watt<00:00:51.040> so<00:00:51.790> we<00:00:52.690> should<00:00:52.840> definitely<00:00:52.960> have<00:00:53.290> more

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
watt so we should definitely have more

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.690 
watt so we should definitely have more
