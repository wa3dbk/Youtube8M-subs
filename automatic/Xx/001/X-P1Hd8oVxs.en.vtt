say as you can see it's being split from
the<00:00:15.949> the<00:00:16.949> rear<00:00:17.160> that's<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.330> extend<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the the rear that's so we can extend the

and that's to allow the front arms of
the<00:00:41.100> suspension<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.860> flex<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the suspension so they can flex up and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.330 
the suspension so they can flex up and
down<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> cows<00:00:44.940> running<00:00:46.129> you<00:00:47.129> don't

across<00:01:31.729> up<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> where<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.060> original<00:01:33.600> /

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
across up to where the original /

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.539 
across up to where the original /
shorter<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.920> we'll<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
shorter it would be we'll have to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.080 
shorter it would be we'll have to
manufacture<00:01:35.939> those<00:01:39.979> both<00:01:40.979> sides

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
manufacture those both sides

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.109

then<00:01:44.049> we'll<00:01:44.289> have<00:01:44.469> to<00:01:44.530> modify<00:01:45.460> all<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.880> front

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
then we'll have to modify all the front

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.340 
then we'll have to modify all the front
there<00:01:46.329> because<00:01:46.539> this<00:01:46.689> is<00:01:46.840> what's<00:01:47.079> going<00:01:47.289> to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
there because this is what's going to

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.669 
there because this is what's going to
end<00:01:47.409> up<00:01:47.560> being<00:01:47.829> our<00:01:48.359> luggage<00:01:49.359> compartment<00:01:50.079> so

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
end up being our luggage compartment so

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.289 
end up being our luggage compartment so
there'll<00:01:50.950> be<00:01:50.979> lots<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.340> fabricating<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.179> do

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
there'll be lots of fabricating to do

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.529 
there'll be lots of fabricating to do
there<00:01:52.539> were<00:01:53.880> let's<00:01:54.880> put<00:01:55.119> all<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.359> in<00:01:55.569> place

that<00:02:29.920> still<00:02:30.220> remains<00:02:30.670> there<00:02:31.030> for<00:02:31.870> our<00:02:32.160> our<00:02:33.160> car

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
that still remains there for our our car

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.550 
that still remains there for our our car
we're<00:02:33.700> going<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:33.910> have<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.269> make<00:02:35.049> access

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
we're going to have to make access

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.699 
we're going to have to make access
through<00:02:35.799> here<00:02:36.099> so<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.090> actual<00:02:37.239> kick<00:02:37.780> Doc's

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
through here so the actual kick Doc's

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.550 
through here so the actual kick Doc's
will<00:02:38.980> be<00:02:39.099> functional<00:02:39.849> for<00:02:40.290> cooling<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.379> rear

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
will be functional for cooling the rear

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.800 
will be functional for cooling the rear
brakes<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.790> because<00:02:43.090> our<00:02:43.239> engine<00:02:43.599> is<00:02:43.660> going

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
brakes and because our engine is going

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.420 
brakes and because our engine is going
to<00:02:43.870> be<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.140> rear<00:02:44.349> we're<00:02:44.829> going<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
to be in the rear we're going to have to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.750 
to be in the rear we're going to have to
somehow<00:02:46.709> tackle<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.829> problem<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.310> cool<00:02:48.579> in

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
somehow tackle the problem of cool in

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.069 
somehow tackle the problem of cool in
the<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.959> rear<00:02:50.200> engine<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.900> if<00:02:52.989> you

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
the the rear engine because if you

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.390 
the the rear engine because if you
imagine<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.620> don't<00:02:53.769> have<00:02:53.859> any<00:02:54.010> cool<00:02:54.220> and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
imagine if you don't have any cool and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.160 
imagine if you don't have any cool and
feel<00:02:54.519> their<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.150> big<00:02:55.389> bob<00:02:55.600> running<00:02:56.019> it's

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
feel their that big bob running it's

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.770 
feel their that big bob running it's
going<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> get<00:02:56.799> very<00:02:56.859> warm<00:02:57.250> very<00:02:57.370> quickly<00:03:00.780> this

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
going to get very warm very quickly this

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.550 
going to get very warm very quickly this
area<00:03:02.260> here<00:03:03.930> will<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.170> be<00:03:05.260> modified

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
area here will have to be modified

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.710 
area here will have to be modified
that's<00:03:06.010> where<00:03:06.220> all<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.430> fuel<00:03:07.239> tanks<00:03:07.599> are

that's where all the fuel tanks are
going<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> sit<00:03:08.109> we<00:03:08.950> will<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.130> one<00:03:09.340> fuel<00:03:09.609> tank

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
going to sit we will have one fuel tank

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.199 
going to sit we will have one fuel tank
either<00:03:10.209> side<00:03:14.609> very<00:03:15.609> similar<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.150> original

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
either side very similar to the original

we'll<00:03:24.280> have<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.609> manufacture<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.859> fabricate

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
we'll have to manufacture and fabricate

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:35.490 
we'll have to manufacture and fabricate
the<00:03:27.930> air<00:03:28.930> intakes<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.720> even<00:03:34.989> though<00:03:35.139> we<00:03:35.169> are

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
the air intakes so even though we are

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.409 
the air intakes so even though we are

outfitting the extreme kit and it's very
very<00:03:40.690> different<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:41.079> going<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.290> be<00:03:41.440> one<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:41.859> a
