00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.049
 the market for electric vehicles 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.080
 the horizon of 2020 is expected to 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.520
 10% of the global market in France 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.910
 in a market with two million 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.770
 vehicles 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.720
 it corresponds to about 200 thousand 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.800
 vehicles per year that will be 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.330
 electric vehicles by 2020 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.170
 renault's desire is to be a leader 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.360
 in this market 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.310
 the electric vehicle program these 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.200
 4 billion euros in investment 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.789
 the share of renault and others down we go 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.020
 rely on a full range of 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.789
 electric vehicles as well the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
 commercial vehicles as vehicles 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.339
 individuals who may correspond to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 the entirety of our customers is a 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.999
 company that is very experienced in 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 the field of electrical installation 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.579
 and who is one of the leading companies 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.469
 in this market 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.600
 so we took advantage of our experience in 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.629
 this area there to develop precisely 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.399
 a specific terminal offer that allows 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.780
 to load all the vehicles 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.210
 electric devices on the market 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.210
 French 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.920
 it's been 30 years since the cia makes us 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.170
 trust for the purchase of vehicles 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.570
 it seemed to us interesting indeed 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.610
 to be able to work together so that 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.430
 distributors can see what 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.550
 the electric vehicle through laborde 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.500
 have marketed in the case of our 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.430
 national promotion organized 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.320
 common animations with renault and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.690
 our distributors of equipment 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.520
 electric it allows to make known 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.450
 the charging terminal with 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.150
 local installers and put them in 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.310
 confrontation with the dealers 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.740
 renault the distributor who will resell 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.700
 the charging station then to the company 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.410
 war we decided with the war of 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.240
 put forward this electrical terminal 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.700
 in partnership also with the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.590
 renault manufacturer to make try 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.110
 this car to our craftsmen who 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.670
 could see all the good of a car 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.399
 electric for their use of all 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.160
 the days there are a lot of questions 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.979
 as for electric vehicles 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.479
 whether it's about kangaroo on the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.340
 area and that's the people appreciate 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.030
 much all that is motorization 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.220
 electric 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.760
 there is a lot of praise on the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.370
 forbidden electric vehicle 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.659
 I was very surprised of course by the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.670
 silence already of this vehicle 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.640
 so of course I'm quite ready to 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.060
 equip but different customers or 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.980
 terminals the war what I find that the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.069
 war terminal is rather nice she has 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.239
 a soft side of a futuristic a 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.170
 technical level I think it's 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.000
 easy enough to install 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.390
 that's where a small formation has closed 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.459
 a worrying series since that's the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680
 war partnered with renault for 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.150
 label the installers and 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.000
 also labeled the facilities 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.950
 so the critical terminal we 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.620
 let's market in relation to the label 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.840
 lift and z would have said the first step 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.340
 for an installer is to come in 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.709
 training at our center in 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.810
 closest formation distributed to the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.859
 level France and leave at the end of 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.810
 this day with a certificate 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.489
 proving that he is now able to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.750
 implement in accordance with the wool 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.079
 and it is brittle and the recommendations 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.079
 of the label of the terminals to convey lake 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.569
 the electric car really has a strong 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.269
 potential 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.790
 on the one hand because there are 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.180
 builders who believe in it 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.349
 public who believe so I think 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.669
 this terminal is going to be really a product 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.049
 standard and who will go into the 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.049
 common part of installers
