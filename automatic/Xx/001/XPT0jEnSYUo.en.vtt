the hell open I guess he bit on the
play-action<00:04:47.420> that<00:04:47.720> badly<00:04:47.990> nonetheless

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
play-action that badly nonetheless

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.050

though<00:04:48.950> we<00:04:49.070> are<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.340> field<00:04:49.580> goal<00:04:49.730> range<00:04:49.760> to

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
though we are in field goal range to

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.190 
though we are in field goal range to
make<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.360> two<00:04:50.480> possession<00:04:50.630> game<00:04:50.900> so<00:04:51.140> that's

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
make it a two possession game so that's

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.720 
make it a two possession game so that's
pretty<00:04:51.440> big<00:04:51.620> right<00:04:51.860> now<00:04:52.010> as<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.550> clock
