four minutes once the dough is kneaded
what<00:02:40.880> I'm<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.239> do<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.660> place<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.530> dough

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
what I'm going to do is place the dough

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.560 
what I'm going to do is place the dough
in<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.920> same<00:02:43.280> Bowl<00:02:43.520> that<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:44.000> needed<00:02:44.209> earlier

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
in the same Bowl that we needed earlier

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.330 
in the same Bowl that we needed earlier
and<00:02:48.280> cover<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.489> with<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.940> bowl<00:02:50.980> keep<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.160> aside

we<00:02:55.640> will<00:02:55.790> proceed<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.269> make<00:02:56.450> our<00:02:56.630> pulleys<00:02:57.170> for

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
we will proceed to make our pulleys for

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.550 
we will proceed to make our pulleys for
the<00:02:57.590> pani<00:02:57.769> puri<00:02:58.660> my<00:02:59.660> dough<00:02:59.720> has<00:03:00.140> been<00:03:00.260> resting

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
the pani puri my dough has been resting

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.970 
the pani puri my dough has been resting
for<00:03:00.769> about<00:03:00.920> 30<00:03:01.370> minutes<00:03:01.670> now<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:03.500> really

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
for about 30 minutes now and it's really

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.410 
for about 30 minutes now and it's really
soft<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.760> smooth<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.610> got<00:03:07.610> itself<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.090> lot<00:03:08.299> of

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
soft and smooth and got itself a lot of

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.360 
soft and smooth and got itself a lot of
gluten<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:09.410> perfect<00:03:09.860> for<00:03:09.890> making<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
gluten it's just perfect for making the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.640 
gluten it's just perfect for making the
pulleys<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.510> now<00:03:11.660> what<00:03:11.870> I'm<00:03:11.989> going<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.230> do<00:03:12.410> is

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
pulleys so now what I'm going to do is

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.430 
pulleys so now what I'm going to do is
to<00:03:12.920> split<00:03:13.160> this<00:03:13.489> into<00:03:13.940> three<00:03:14.209> portions<00:03:14.540> the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
to split this into three portions the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.110 
to split this into three portions the
reason<00:03:15.829> is<00:03:15.950> we<00:03:16.100> want<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.370> make<00:03:16.489> small<00:03:16.880> batches

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
reason is we want to make small batches

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.630 
reason is we want to make small batches
at<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.450> time<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:18.530> I'm<00:03:18.650> going<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.890> make<00:03:19.100> three

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
at a time so I'm going to make three

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.569 
at a time so I'm going to make three
portions<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:20.269> this<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:21.130> just<00:03:22.130> take<00:03:22.310> one

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
portions of this and just take one

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.509 
portions of this and just take one
potion<00:03:22.850> out<00:03:23.260> cover<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.470> other<00:03:24.590> portion<00:03:25.100> back

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
potion out cover the other portion back

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.009 
potion out cover the other portion back
through<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.000> bowl<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.540> had<00:03:26.630> covered<00:03:26.930> it

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
through the bowl that you had covered it

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.930 
through the bowl that you had covered it
earlier<00:03:27.850> put<00:03:28.850> it<00:03:28.940> aside

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.040 

have<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.840> roll<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.260> dough<00:03:33.440> really<00:03:33.890> thin<00:03:34.310> and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
have to roll the dough really thin and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.830 
have to roll the dough really thin and
to<00:03:36.050> do<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.440> I'm<00:03:36.710> going<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.340> grease<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
to do that I'm going to grease the

the dough out into a very thin sheet the
pulleys<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:47.150> be<00:03:47.270> nice<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.720> crisp<00:03:48.140> and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
pulleys have to be nice and crisp and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.360 
pulleys have to be nice and crisp and
they<00:03:49.100> have<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.430> be<00:03:49.520> thin<00:03:50.770> now<00:03:51.770> that<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.130> sheet

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
they have to be thin now that the sheet

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.250 
they have to be thin now that the sheet
is<00:03:52.400> rolled<00:03:52.760> out<00:03:52.910> really<00:03:53.240> thin<00:03:53.360> I'm<00:03:53.750> going<00:03:54.170> to

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
is rolled out really thin I'm going to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.070 
is rolled out really thin I'm going to
use<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.770> cutter<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:56.240> is<00:03:56.300> from<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.570> cocktail

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
use a cutter this is from a cocktail

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.230 
use a cutter this is from a cocktail
shakers<00:03:57.530> lid<00:03:57.770> you<00:03:58.070> can<00:03:58.250> also<00:03:58.400> use<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.820> cookie

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
shakers lid you can also use a cookie

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.330 
shakers lid you can also use a cookie
cutter<00:03:59.270> to<00:04:00.230> cut<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.710> poorest

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
cutter to cut the poorest

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.440 
cutter to cut the poorest
so<00:04:01.970> make<00:04:02.630> circles<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.770> the<00:04:03.830> poorest<00:04:04.580> with<00:04:05.330> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
so make circles of the poorest with the

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.110 
so make circles of the poorest with the
cutter<00:04:05.710> make<00:04:06.710> just<00:04:06.980> few<00:04:07.250> circles<00:04:07.670> at<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.850> time

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
cutter make just few circles at a time

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.540 
cutter make just few circles at a time
because<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.230> dough<00:04:09.410> tends<00:04:09.830> to<00:04:09.950> pull<00:04:10.220> itself

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
because the dough tends to pull itself

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.620 
because the dough tends to pull itself
back<00:04:11.290> when<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:13.100> take<00:04:13.340> them<00:04:13.520> out<00:04:13.640> I'm<00:04:13.970> going<00:04:14.570> to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
back when you take them out I'm going to

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.410 
back when you take them out I'm going to
roll<00:04:14.840> them<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.140> little<00:04:15.560> more<00:04:15.710> further<00:04:16.330> so<00:04:17.330> it

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
roll them a little more further so it

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.910 
roll them a little more further so it
becomes<00:04:17.720> little<00:04:17.989> thin<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:20.020> have<00:04:21.020> some<00:04:21.260> hot<00:04:21.680> oil
