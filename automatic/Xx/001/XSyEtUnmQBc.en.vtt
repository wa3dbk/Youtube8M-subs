00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.179
 hello everyone I'm over 6 more than 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.179
 let us begin 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.830
 within a year the games are celebrated 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.230
 river Olympians and how in each 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.539
 championship the technical team of usa 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.539
 has a very difficult task 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.820
 very difficult that I ask only 12 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.460
 players that will be part of the great 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.849
 USA selection the candidate selection 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.860
 and favorite to gold and forgive me if you've 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.410
 seen a lot but it is that I repeat is very 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.149
 difficult to choose twelve players in the USA 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.039
 there are many players with a lot of quality 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.250
 that could be part perfectly 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.409
 of the team I say usa can present 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.749
 three teams the team the team and the 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.749
 team will go who would win 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:50.550
 surely the gold medal after 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.559
 be doing an analysis and studying 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.499
 the players in today's video I'm going 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.479
 to present my selection for the usa 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:59.850
 I repeat it has been very difficult I had to 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.460
 leave stars and superstars 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.440
 outside the team the future is sad 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.530
 but it is what there is in the end they can only 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.970
 enter with players 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.729
 I believe that the selection of states 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.920
 united will take three bases the first 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.780
 it will be crisis for a player who already has 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.400
 experience by the selection that is very 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.680
 good that adapts well to basketball 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.350
 we could say more European is a 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.759
 smart player who already knows very 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.530
 well to the players the coach to 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.390
 all the technical team and I think you can 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.970
 be a very important value for this 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.820
 selecting the second base that would lead 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.500
 it's stephen carr and a champion sent me a 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.750
 player with a lot of magic and a lot of talent 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.580
 two carry triples can come very 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.560
 well to the team in those matches in which 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.660
 the marker is very tight and in that 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.210
 the mining companies are not very clear and 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.340
 finally fall and ervin the player to 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.240
 me with the best ball handling of all 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.410
 the world 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.050
 Irvine has already shown sometimes 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.759
 previous that has the sufficient level 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.759
 to do great things in this team 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.450
 we go with the escorts the first of 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.280
 them is james harden a player that the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.320
 last season was about to 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.149
 take the mtv and have this next 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.070
 season in one of the favorites for 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.680
 Take them and Carmen has a lot of talent 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.719
 a lot of quality and the attack is lethal 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.159
 does it does it well except for the 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:19.840
 defense that can still improve 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:21.700
 quite and the other reason westbrook I already know 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.980
 which is a couple I know but russell westbrook 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.109
 I had to put it in yes or yes have some 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.939
 spectacular physical qualities and 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.090
 can occupy that position perfectly 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:34.569
 I have done in other occasions already played but 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.579
 he did very well because he is not physically and 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.010
 once westbrook brings a lot 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.650
 energy contributes points contributes mates to 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.599
 intangible door and even westbrook 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.889
 has a well-deserved site in this 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.889
 selection that gold can win 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.739
 we will take the fret out 2 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.780
 probably the best three eaves 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.360
 of the world and I think you already know 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.970
 who are the first lebron james 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.129
 it was clear the best player in the world 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.780
 for me I'm not saying that they are 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.790
 Lebron is a player who has already won 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.230
 everything that has been consecrated as one of 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.940
 the best ones and that will end his career 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.390
 as one of the best of all the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.780
 history 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.989
 the second is kevin during a player 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.480
 lethal to me in the offensive aspect the 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.670
 better when in killer mode he puts it 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.890
 everything can already be defended by the best 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.690
 defense or you can come two he 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.629
 continue scoring scoring scoring 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.150
 until he gets tired and finally carmelo 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.889
 anthony melo is one of the most 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.569
 elegant in the world is very 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.269
 talented and has tremendous facility 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.519
 to write down that you can score 30 or 40 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.230
 points without ruffling just in a good 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.329
 shot from line 3 and also knows 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.859
 generate your own shot very well 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.639
 Carmelo also has a very 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:48.040
 deserved the time has come for the 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.520
 indoor and start on both the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.850
 friend 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.540
 the first anthony davis kobe ​​bryant and 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.390
 Lebron James 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.130
 once light animates continues 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.860
 playing like this and continues to evolve 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.690
 as a player it will be one of the great one 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.610
 of the greats of all history 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.530
 I believe that lebron and kobe understand 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.550
 a lot of basketball and if they say this for 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.430
 something will be 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.220
 davis in the future is the present and the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.710
 crack has a very lie and the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.510
 second power forward blake griffin a 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.900
 player who say he only knows how to do 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.900
 mate 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.060
 griffin has shown that it has grown 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:25.789
 as a player and throughout these years 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.560
 has been perfecting his game has gone 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.020
 incorporating many offensive resources 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.909
 not only you know how to kill it and 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.280
 he has a good shot from a distance and 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:37.000
 every year he refines it in addition to 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.949
 a good pot is quick bounce to 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.539
 recover balls assists everyone 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.120
 the paintings very complete and has a 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.090
 deserved position 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.370
 and finally the two pivots and the first 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.259
 demarcus cousins and I've been saying it 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.969
 for a long time when this 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.879
 box does not focus 100% on the 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.659
 silly basketball will be the best pivot 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.909
 of the world 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.069
 hollins is a dominant pivot is a 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:04.039
 heavyweight pivot feels a lot no longer 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.659
 it's very well the other one is cool howard yes 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.400
 I know it is not in its best version and 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.710
 that is still recovering that rhythm 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.569
 so good that I wish we'll see again 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.520
 orlando magic playing in Hobart 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.289
 dominant that nobody could with him the 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.639
 sports of the world but good 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.889
 also the player of the houston 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.199
 rockets does not serve in a very player 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.030
 physical that plugs rebound to intimidates 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.370
 a lot and also 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.840
 many kilos in the area continues to be 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.430
 a dominant pivot and I think the 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.550
 selection of these nests can come 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.560
 very good and these are my 12 players 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.720

 your 12 players that would form 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.570
 part of the USA selection and it's not worth 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.780
 that you put me yobal mckee kendrick 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.870
 perkins víctor claver even if it's not 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.850
 us because this selection would sweep and 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.860
 we do not want a more real selection by 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.630

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.070
