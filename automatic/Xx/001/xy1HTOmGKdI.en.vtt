00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
I actually used an 64 controller for

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.080 
I actually used an 64 controller for
these<00:01:38.340> triggers<00:01:39.340> if<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.549> can<00:01:39.670> tell<00:01:39.850> from<00:01:39.880> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
these triggers if you can tell from the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.670 
these triggers if you can tell from the
side<00:01:40.299> here<00:01:40.539> this<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:40.960> this<00:01:41.140> would<00:01:41.289> be<00:01:41.409> like<00:01:41.530> the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
side here this is this would be like the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.919 
side here this is this would be like the
L<00:01:41.799> button<00:01:42.039> and<00:01:42.340> then<00:01:43.149> same<00:01:43.390> over<00:01:43.600> there<00:01:43.750> for

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
L button and then same over there for

L button and then same over there for
the<00:01:43.990> R<00:01:44.110> button<00:01:44.319> but<00:01:44.590> anyway<00:01:47.190> there's<00:01:48.190> the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
the R button but anyway there's the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.600 
the R button but anyway there's the
controller<00:01:49.030> slot<00:01:49.420> here<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:51.100> obviously

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
controller slot here it's obviously

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.590
