00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.130 
was coming olawale you know he's a great
technician<00:01:29.189> he's<00:01:29.909> very<00:01:30.180> smart<00:01:30.509> player<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.049> he

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
technician he's very smart player and he

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
technician he's very smart player and he
really<00:01:31.409> wants<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.770> good<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.280> he

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
really wants to be good I think he

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.580 
really wants to be good I think he
understands<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.659> tradition<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.229> Clemson

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
understands to the tradition of Clemson

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.020 
understands to the tradition of Clemson
defensive<00:01:35.070> lineman<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.939> gives

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
defensive lineman and I think that gives

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.810 
defensive lineman and I think that gives
them<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.360> extra<00:01:37.079> burst<00:01:37.259> any<00:01:37.470> time<00:01:37.740> other<00:01:38.369> side

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
them a extra burst any time other side

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.719 
them a extra burst any time other side
of<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.750> defensive<00:01:40.530> end<00:01:40.650> spot<00:01:40.890> Andre<00:01:41.400> branch

you<00:02:10.890> always<00:02:11.039> hear<00:02:11.340> about<00:02:11.400> how<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.819> offensive

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
you always hear about how the offensive

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.940 
you always hear about how the offensive
