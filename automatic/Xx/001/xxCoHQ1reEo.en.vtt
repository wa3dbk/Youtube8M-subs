00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
my garage I was setting it up and I mean

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900 
my garage I was setting it up and I mean
it<00:00:25.199> seems<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.859> better<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.220> low<00:00:26.430> light<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
it seems like it's better in low light I

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.519 
it seems like it's better in low light I
know<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.210> main<00:00:27.449> camera<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.050> supposed<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> be

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
know the main camera is supposed to be

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.599 
know the main camera is supposed to be
better<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.859> low<00:00:29.010> light<00:00:29.220> because<00:00:29.490> that's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
better in low light because that's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.849
