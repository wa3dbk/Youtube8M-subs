00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.150
 and then another crowd gameplay sniper 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.960
 This does not mean that I'm playing 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.009
 very uneven I'm actually insisting 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.470
 on snow plays 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'm realizing that I feel the game 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 is getting a bit easier to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.369
 few not on any given map 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.289
 maps I can play better but maps 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.810
 such as that of man, for example, very far 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.599
 and do something reasonable but the game 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.430
 This is interesting actually for 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.140
 continue playing the cod series with a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.450
 A little more enthusiasm, I think. 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.960
 who have a certain challenge to play shot 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.540
 gun 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.360
 It was a challenge for me to play snip now. 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.450
 another challenge and I think with this type 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.579
 a little different class I can 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.430
 keep a little more interest then 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.670
 has played a lot of unevenness and then it 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.649
 all playing the games so I stay 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.219
 until positive but that thing is left 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:04.710
 16 to 13 to 15 to 14 and one or other heading 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.750
 the score is more elastic catch those 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.490
 the strikes so a little more with a 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.439
 little more ease 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.869
 Just as I can make this start 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.700
 I saw the crowd moving through this 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.979
 I took the opportunity to make a 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.509
 sequence will give a face more gration 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.939
 that it really was a little bit 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.369
 Weird connection after it gets a 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.890
 little better than I tried to move 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.020
 a little more by the map and what I 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.720
 I realized I did an experiment we tried 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.860
 play with normal formatting 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.290
 normal discount econ and kobe ​​that I 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 I did very well playing in code 4 but did not 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.409
 punctured the last church was not 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 the same thing in modern 3 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.619
 example I do not say the aim is thermal 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.079
 thermal or something because it has certain 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.979
 maps people benefit by seeing 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.820
 the heat of the body but this type of sight 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.970
 she did not do for me in the modern and three of the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.479
 same kind of effect and I think this 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.210
 was due to the fact that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.930
 pc is much more improved a lot more 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.860
 strong fast for you to pull nair 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.250
 modern three there in code 4 as sniper has 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.710
 a slow pull sorry sorry slower 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.800
 I think that's why when I put 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.840
 I remember touch 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.960
 I ended up pulling aim and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.040
 sign a little faster code there is 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.070
 disadvantages of this e-mail exchange 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.680
 ricoy uff with a little harmed so 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.150
 When I do not answer first what is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.030
 very common 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 I end up taking the second shot a little 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.630
 The harder you have to do that 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.910
 effort and have to have a little bit more 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.190
 of calm and cold and I do not 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 getting in the modern and 3 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.930
 What I have seen is the following msr 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.760
 Shoot for me is better 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.700
 then come 118 l air only they it 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.680
 fails too much that is actually gives a lot 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.110
 recently 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.300
 It's time you hit and it does not kill you. 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.269
 It's much more constant, I think. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.370
 She's better off I do not know 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.930
 exactly the reason for looking at 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.510
 her settings do not give as much 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.300
 precision damage difference but this 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.330
 happens is the same as there in the modern no 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:33.209
 that at 40 to 3 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.040
 it has a lower recall than air 700 and 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.870
 it turns out to be much easier to use 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.690
 although they are very similar until 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.590
 aesthetically so that this 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.750
 happens 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.060
 I have been trying to play with some 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.880
 success in some games more than 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.680
 But for me, what really matters is 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.730
 try to make the game a bit more 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.739
 challenging and also taking into 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.660
 Consider this I will give some opinions 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.030
 and I would even like to know from the comment 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.610
 What the guys think you think? 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.860
 My first opinion is taking into 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.380
 consideration to a black ops 2 and 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.049
 future franchise games I think the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.220
 more often than not at the time 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.709
 good check in why because I think 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.079
 the greater grace to play with her 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.840
 exactly it has a higher level of 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.630
 difficulty in a level of impossibility 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.360
 one more difficulty you need to 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.710
 dedicate a lot more I 'm sending you to 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.660
 improve on snipe 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.460
 I 'm already so much better than I am 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.010
 It was before but I am very far from being 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.890
 a good player and I think maybe when 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.630
 is to see r4 mode if I can 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:45.510
 so that the mother has a certain 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.460
 continue the game proved israel 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.620
 every day so I must be in a 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.500
 level of security by playing a 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.510
 little is like a little more mastery of the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.360
 which is quite different when you think a 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.400
 assault rifle on the sub machine that you 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.610
 is already beginning to be easier to 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.320
 all and even a shot a shot gun is 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.300
 of champion as space 12 is more difficult 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.940
 to use but you succeed 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.800
 dominate faster if you find a 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.660
 pace a little faster then 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.610
 I think that women should be the greatest 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.860
 part boucek I think it would make the game 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.200
 richer for those who want to play and 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.890
 I'm very is so 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.560
 believer that those snipers in the skoke 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.340
 What happened at the game place is a good one. 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.760
 option 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.800
 I think this is weird I do not know the 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.630
 that this will mean yet another 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.690
 I do not think it has the same beauty to 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.610
 The gun will finally make me well. 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.010
 wrong also have the fear that the 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.979
 black ops two did not put much emphasis on 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.290
 great listening disney pixar up but did not see 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.240
 like the good ones are working not 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.790
 I saw a lot of comment I did not see much 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.820
 gameplay and I even have this doubt will take 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.500
 that it works well because the two 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.130
 classes that I most want to be playing 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:06.660
 now shot gun snip because they think 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:09.360
 that the game stays like this but it's a real horny 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.550
 The longer you take the longer you get sick because 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.050
 you have a level of difficulty and this 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.930
 It means I 'm not worried. 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.410
 in making gameplay effective way playing 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.550
 and destroying but rather picking up a rhythm of 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.200
 different game 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.140
 to be able to extract sometimes a little 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.480
 more skill could be yes me 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.630
 I felt more challenged even if I did the 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.590
 score a much lower fred 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:37.230
 Well I think so, so much so 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.600
 about the songs I liked 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.430
 the people of a return also indicated 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.870
 there are several that I do not know 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.470
 bands that I do not know others I 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.300
 that 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.340
 I 'm running up there. 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.300
 asked which sound is heavier than 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.730
 I 'm listening 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.800
 I like to listen, it's all type 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.200
 rock music but what I more 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.750
 I listen today so to be more sincere 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.000
 It's called the painted chicken. 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.250
 baby song in my son listens 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.410
 every day and he has that phase of 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.270
 repetition then listen 50 thousand times I 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.680
 I just got more decorated than I 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.440
 Anything else should be done soon. 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.280
 It's time to listen to patati. 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.140
 potato 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.220
 so I think the sky is more hardcore than 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.290
 I'm listening 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.470
 This is it, I hope you liked it. 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.420
 leave your opinion you think is good 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.380
 check in and I also have it in my head 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:28.140
 I'd rather shot shot be 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.970
 most fampe action also because 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.040
 I think it gets a lot better I do not like it 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.520
 much of that debut style that the 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 To go out and down the 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.960
 it seems that it is not that there is not so 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.020
 it seems that there is not even a need 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.470
 making sights spoke to the crowd earned 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.470
 next
