00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
strong very deep tap roots so getting

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.480 
strong very deep tap roots so getting
rid<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.170> getting<00:02:04.590> getting

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
to remove that very large tap root or

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.229 
to remove that very large tap root or
kill<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> systemic<00:02:11.370> herbicide<00:02:11.489> like

kill it with a systemic herbicide like

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.410 
kill it with a systemic herbicide like
glyphosate

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
glyphosate

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.410

okay<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.480> again<00:02:16.440> another<00:02:16.739> another<00:02:17.670> weedy<00:02:18.120> vine

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
okay so again another another weedy vine

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.229 
okay so again another another weedy vine
that<00:02:18.629> looks<00:02:18.810> very<00:02:19.019> similar<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.940> hedge

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
that looks very similar to the hedge

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.280 
that looks very similar to the hedge

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
bindweed and field bindweed is this but

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.820 
bindweed and field bindweed is this but
this<00:02:25.500> again<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:27.349> not<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.650> morning

characteristic of the smartweed family
and<00:03:12.629> it's<00:03:13.049> how<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.500> distinguish<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.310> as

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
and it's how you can distinguish this as

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.599 
and it's how you can distinguish this as
being<00:03:14.819> wild<00:03:15.329> buckwheat<00:03:16.190> while<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.400> weed

being wild buckwheat while this weed

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.699 
being wild buckwheat while this weed
looks<00:03:17.910> very<00:03:18.150> similar<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.900> weeds<00:03:19.139> in<00:03:19.530> the

looks very similar to the weeds in the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.319 
looks very similar to the weeds in the
morning<00:03:20.010> glory<00:03:20.220> family<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.819> we<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.090> looked

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
morning glory family that we just looked

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.470 
morning glory family that we just looked
at<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:22.319> one<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.889> in<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.910> completely<00:03:24.329> different

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
at this one is in a completely different

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
distinction is that the leaves come off

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.690 
distinction is that the leaves come off
or<00:03:33.120> arranged<00:03:33.840> oppositely<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.099> they're<00:03:35.430> too

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
or arranged oppositely so they're too

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
ranked at every node there is two leaves

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.379 
ranked at every node there is two leaves
coming<00:03:38.250> off<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> heart<00:03:39.389> shaped<00:03:39.750> leaf

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
coming off they have a heart shaped leaf

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.059 
coming off they have a heart shaped leaf
again<00:03:42.389> it<00:03:42.750> looks<00:03:42.840> very<00:03:43.139> similar<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.739> Morning
