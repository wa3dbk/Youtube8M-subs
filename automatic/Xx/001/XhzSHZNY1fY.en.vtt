00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
take your toes in and out I found that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.600 
take your toes in and out I found that
for<00:02:46.550> myself<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.570> toe<00:02:48.020> pockets<00:02:48.560> were<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> little

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
for myself the toe pockets were a little

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.580 
for myself the toe pockets were a little
on<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.880> narrow<00:02:50.150> side<00:02:50.210> my<00:02:50.810> toes<00:02:51.110> are<00:02:51.320> kind<00:02:51.530> of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
on the narrow side my toes are kind of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.760 
on the narrow side my toes are kind of
bulbous<00:02:51.950> on<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.220> end<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.350> when<00:02:54.350> my<00:02:54.530> feet

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
bulbous on the end and so when my feet

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.840 
bulbous on the end and so when my feet
were<00:02:54.920> dry<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:57.110> was<00:02:57.260> really<00:02:57.530> difficult<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.550> slip

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
were dry it was really difficult to slip

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.610 
were dry it was really difficult to slip
my<00:02:59.090> foot<00:02:59.390> into<00:02:59.930> these<00:03:00.410> rubberized<00:03:00.830> pockets

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
my foot into these rubberized pockets

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.430 
my foot into these rubberized pockets
once<00:03:03.620> my<00:03:03.800> feet<00:03:04.460> got<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:05.030> little<00:03:05.450> sweaty<00:03:05.780> er<00:03:05.900> as

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
once my feet got a little sweaty er as

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.920 
once my feet got a little sweaty er as
you<00:03:06.680> can<00:03:06.830> imagine<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.780> doesn't<00:03:08.780> breathe

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
you can imagine this is doesn't breathe

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.660 
you can imagine this is doesn't breathe
particularly<00:03:09.590> well<00:03:09.710> so<00:03:09.920> your<00:03:10.070> feet<00:03:10.250> do<00:03:10.460> get

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
particularly well so your feet do get

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.380 
particularly well so your feet do get
sweaty<00:03:10.910> ER<00:03:11.030> my<00:03:11.900> toes<00:03:12.170> were<00:03:12.440> able<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.680> get<00:03:12.890> in

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
sweaty ER my toes were able to get in

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.300 
sweaty ER my toes were able to get in
really<00:03:14.390> easily<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.870> especially<00:03:15.560> had<00:03:15.920> problems

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
really easily I especially had problems

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.940 
really easily I especially had problems
with<00:03:16.370> my<00:03:16.430> pinky<00:03:16.910> toe<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.270> just<00:03:17.540> doesn't<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.710> just

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
with my pinky toe it just doesn't I just

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.340 
with my pinky toe it just doesn't I just
couldn't<00:03:19.400> get<00:03:19.460> it<00:03:19.520> straight<00:03:20.000> in<00:03:20.210> here<00:03:20.450> very

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
couldn't get it straight in here very

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.050 
couldn't get it straight in here very
easy<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.540> sole<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:23.990> these<00:03:24.170> shoes<00:03:25.060> doesn't

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
easy the sole of these shoes doesn't

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.810 
easy the sole of these shoes doesn't
have<00:03:26.300> any<00:03:26.600> sort<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.080> tread<00:03:27.980> or<00:03:28.280> anything<00:03:28.489> on<00:03:28.790> it

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
have any sort of tread or anything on it

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.970 
have any sort of tread or anything on it
so<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.390> basically<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.590> second

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
so it's basically just like a second

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.030 
so it's basically just like a second
skin<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:31.430> got<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.580> little<00:03:31.730> bit<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.000> textured

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
skin it's got a little bit of textured

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.710 
skin it's got a little bit of textured
on<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.430> make<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:34.700> kind<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.970> look<00:03:35.510> like<00:03:35.540> a

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
on it to make it kind of look like a

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.080 
on it to make it kind of look like a
fingerprint<00:03:36.290> or<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.560> footprint<00:03:37.100> but<00:03:37.910> other

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
fingerprint or a footprint but other

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.390 
fingerprint or a footprint but other
than<00:03:38.330> that<00:03:38.390> there's<00:03:38.750> really<00:03:39.130> nothing<00:03:40.130> on<00:03:40.250> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
than that there's really nothing on the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.270 
than that there's really nothing on the
soles<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.000> shoes<00:03:41.290> in<00:03:42.290> here<00:03:42.590> I<00:03:42.770> don't<00:03:43.160> know

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
soles of the shoes in here I don't know

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.010 
soles of the shoes in here I don't know
how<00:03:43.489> well<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.700> can<00:03:43.850> see<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.450> can<00:03:44.600> see<00:03:44.840> the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
how well you can see it you can see the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.320 
how well you can see it you can see the
textured<00:03:45.380> pattern<00:03:45.770> on<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.120> inside<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.239> the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
textured pattern on the inside of the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:54.640 
textured pattern on the inside of the
shoe<00:03:48.820> so<00:03:50.140> when<00:03:51.140> wearing<00:03:51.410> these<00:03:51.680> shoes<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:53.650> tried

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
shoe so when wearing these shoes I tried

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.740 
shoe so when wearing these shoes I tried
a<00:03:54.680> couple<00:03:54.770> things<00:03:55.190> with<00:03:55.340> them<00:03:55.489> I<00:03:56.270> tried<00:03:56.720> just

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
a couple things with them I tried just

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.500 
a couple things with them I tried just
doing<00:03:57.200> some<00:03:57.380> casual<00:03:57.770> activity<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.520> and<00:03:59.390> I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
doing some casual activity and and I

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.860 
doing some casual activity and and I
also<00:03:59.690> tried<00:04:00.050> doing<00:04:00.320> a<00:04:00.470> little<00:04:00.620> bit<00:04:00.739> of<00:04:00.830> running

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
also tried doing a little bit of running

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.240 
also tried doing a little bit of running
and<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.700> what<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.570> found<00:04:05.660> was<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:06.250> because

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
and so what I found was that because

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.100 
and so what I found was that because
these<00:04:07.820> toes<00:04:08.620> these<00:04:09.620> toe<00:04:09.860> pockets<00:04:10.310> were<00:04:11.300> rather

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
these toes these toe pockets were rather

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.220 
these toes these toe pockets were rather
snug<00:04:12.590> around<00:04:12.860> my<00:04:13.190> toes<00:04:13.810> when<00:04:14.810> I<00:04:14.870> was<00:04:15.080> just

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
snug around my toes when I was just

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.080 
snug around my toes when I was just
sitting<00:04:15.530> at<00:04:15.680> rest<00:04:15.890> or<00:04:16.160> not<00:04:16.430> really<00:04:16.640> doing<00:04:16.880> much

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
sitting at rest or not really doing much

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.449 
sitting at rest or not really doing much
moving<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.750> actually<00:04:18.310> cut<00:04:19.310> off<00:04:19.340> the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
moving it actually cut off the

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.370 
moving it actually cut off the
circulation<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:20.299> my<00:04:20.480> toes<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:20.750> little<00:04:20.959> bit<00:04:21.140> so<00:04:21.350> I

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
circulation of my toes a little bit so I

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.810 
circulation of my toes a little bit so I
found<00:04:21.739> it<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:22.100> be<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.250> little<00:04:22.580> bit<00:04:22.669> too

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
found it to be a little bit too

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.640 
found it to be a little bit too
restricting<00:04:23.419> for<00:04:23.630> me<00:04:25.090> at<00:04:26.090> rest<00:04:26.540> but<00:04:26.930> as<00:04:27.470> soon

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
restricting for me at rest but as soon

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.680 
restricting for me at rest but as soon
as<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:27.830> started<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.250> move<00:04:28.430> as<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:29.090> walk<00:04:29.300> or<00:04:29.570> to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
as I started to move as to walk or to

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.890 
as I started to move as to walk or to
run<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.870> little<00:04:30.080> bit<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:31.520> know<00:04:31.640> as<00:04:31.880> my<00:04:32.510> feet

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
run a little bit you know as my feet

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.409 
run a little bit you know as my feet
began<00:04:33.229> to<00:04:33.440> move<00:04:33.590> and

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
began to move and

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.309 
began to move and
my<00:04:34.500> toes<00:04:35.500> began<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:36.009> move<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.840> problem<00:04:38.199> was

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
my toes began to move the problem was

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.249 
my toes began to move the problem was
not<00:04:38.500> noticeable<00:04:39.129> so<00:04:40.090> for<00:04:40.389> me<00:04:40.479> I<00:04:40.509> find<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:41.080> the

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
not noticeable so for me I find that the

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.159 
not noticeable so for me I find that the
issues<00:04:41.530> are<00:04:41.560> best<00:04:41.979> for<00:04:42.520> use<00:04:42.759> when<00:04:43.210> moving<00:04:43.689> in

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
issues are best for use when moving in

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.140 
issues are best for use when moving in
use<00:04:44.379> I<00:04:44.560> found<00:04:44.860> these<00:04:45.039> shoes<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.460> be<00:04:45.610> sort<00:04:45.879> of<00:04:45.939> a

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
use I found these shoes to be sort of a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.760 
use I found these shoes to be sort of a
mixed<00:04:46.539> bag<00:04:46.689> for<00:04:46.990> me<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:48.569> found<00:04:49.569> that<00:04:49.780> they<00:04:50.560> have

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
mixed bag for me I found that they have

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.800 
mixed bag for me I found that they have
excellent<00:04:51.490> ground<00:04:52.210> field<00:04:52.539> they're

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
excellent ground field they're

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.760 
excellent ground field they're
incredibly<00:04:53.319> flexible<00:04:53.789> but<00:04:55.409> I'm<00:04:56.409> not<00:04:56.560> really

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
incredibly flexible but I'm not really

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.309 
incredibly flexible but I'm not really
sure<00:04:57.090> when<00:04:58.090> I<00:04:58.120> would<00:04:58.389> use<00:04:58.569> them<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:59.199> the

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
sure when I would use them and the

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.219 
sure when I would use them and the
reason<00:04:59.439> for<00:04:59.740> that<00:04:59.830> is<00:05:00.099> I<00:05:00.750> find<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.900> if<00:05:02.080> I'm

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
reason for that is I find that if I'm

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.939 
reason for that is I find that if I'm
doing<00:05:02.500> any<00:05:02.680> kind<00:05:02.949> of<00:05:03.099> vigorous<00:05:03.460> activity<00:05:03.969> the

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
doing any kind of vigorous activity the

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.619 
doing any kind of vigorous activity the
material<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.460> silicon<00:05:06.879> material<00:05:07.330> that<00:05:07.479> these

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
material the silicon material that these

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.529 
material the silicon material that these
shoes<00:05:07.870> are<00:05:08.050> made<00:05:08.199> out<00:05:08.349> of<00:05:08.469> is<00:05:09.150> really<00:05:10.150> not

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
shoes are made out of is really not

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.450 
shoes are made out of is really not
breathable<00:05:10.990> at<00:05:11.169> all<00:05:11.319> and<00:05:11.620> so<00:05:11.770> my<00:05:11.889> feet<00:05:12.129> end<00:05:12.340> up

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
breathable at all and so my feet end up

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.089 
breathable at all and so my feet end up
swimming<00:05:12.819> in<00:05:13.270> sweat<00:05:13.779> and<00:05:14.050> it's<00:05:14.740> not<00:05:14.889> very

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
swimming in sweat and it's not very

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.969 
swimming in sweat and it's not very
comfortable<00:05:15.490> for<00:05:16.710> activities<00:05:17.710> where<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:19.979> am

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
comfortable for activities where I am

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.689 
comfortable for activities where I am
not<00:05:21.759> particularly<00:05:23.069> active<00:05:24.069> so<00:05:24.279> whether<00:05:24.490> it's

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
not particularly active so whether it's

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.420 
not particularly active so whether it's
just<00:05:24.759> walking<00:05:25.210> or<00:05:25.569> hanging<00:05:25.930> around<00:05:26.169> I<00:05:27.069> just

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
just walking or hanging around I just

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.209 
just walking or hanging around I just
assumed<00:05:27.969> be<00:05:28.150> barefoot<00:05:28.659> innovate<00:05:29.620> lists<00:05:30.069> these

assumed be barefoot innovate lists these

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:35.240 
assumed be barefoot innovate lists these

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.499 
shoes as having a lifetime of 150 miles
that's<00:05:36.250> not<00:05:36.400> very<00:05:36.550> much<00:05:36.789> especially

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
that's not very much especially

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.089 
that's not very much especially
considering<00:05:37.990> that<00:05:38.020> you<00:05:38.620> know<00:05:38.710> people<00:05:38.889> have

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
considering that you know people have

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.249 
considering that you know people have
known<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.490> get<00:05:39.610> over<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.389> thousand<00:05:40.930> miles<00:05:41.080> on<00:05:41.229> a

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.110 
pair of five fingers so granted these
shoes<00:05:44.229> do<00:05:44.409> cost<00:05:44.710> less<00:05:44.979> but<00:05:45.310> still<00:05:46.120> I<00:05:46.629> think<00:05:48.120> for

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
shoes do cost less but still I think for

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.159 
shoes do cost less but still I think for
the<00:05:49.210> price<00:05:51.330> one<00:05:52.330> would<00:05:52.509> expect<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:52.930> get<00:05:53.110> a

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
the price one would expect to get a

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.029 
the price one would expect to get a
little<00:05:53.379> more<00:05:53.469> mileage<00:05:53.740> out<00:05:53.979> of<00:05:54.039> them<00:05:54.219> I

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
little more mileage out of them I

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.579 
little more mileage out of them I
suppose<00:05:57.039> if<00:05:57.219> you're<00:05:58.199> spending<00:05:59.199> a<00:05:59.259> lot<00:05:59.440> of<00:05:59.469> time

00:05:59.579 --> 00:05:59.589 
suppose if you're spending a lot of time

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:04.140 
suppose if you're spending a lot of time
on<00:06:01.710> surfaces<00:06:02.710> that<00:06:02.770> are<00:06:02.979> not<00:06:03.250> too<00:06:03.460> rough<00:06:03.699> like

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
on surfaces that are not too rough like

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.959 
on surfaces that are not too rough like
grass<00:06:04.569> or<00:06:04.960> dirt<00:06:05.020> you'd<00:06:06.009> get<00:06:06.250> more<00:06:06.460> mileage<00:06:06.729> out

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
grass or dirt you'd get more mileage out

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.300 
grass or dirt you'd get more mileage out
of<00:06:07.029> them<00:06:07.210> but<00:06:07.419> definitely<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.500> sole<00:06:08.740> is<00:06:09.009> not

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
of them but definitely the sole is not

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.600 
of them but definitely the sole is not
designed<00:06:09.909> for<00:06:10.120> really<00:06:11.110> rough<00:06:11.610> environments

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
designed for really rough environments

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.899 
designed for really rough environments
like<00:06:12.759> sharp<00:06:13.210> rock<00:06:13.509> or<00:06:13.900> abrasive<00:06:14.770> pavement<00:06:15.370> for

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
like sharp rock or abrasive pavement for

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.459 
like sharp rock or abrasive pavement for
at<00:06:16.240> least<00:06:16.330> for<00:06:16.509> any<00:06:16.599> length<00:06:16.870> of<00:06:17.050> time<00:06:17.110> or

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
at least for any length of time or

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:19.920 
at least for any length of time or
extended<00:06:18.310> period<00:06:18.550> of<00:06:18.580> time<00:06:18.669> so<00:06:19.599> in<00:06:19.719> conclusion

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
extended period of time so in conclusion

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.649 
extended period of time so in conclusion
I<00:06:20.469> guess<00:06:21.069> I<00:06:21.250> have<00:06:21.490> this<00:06:21.759> to<00:06:21.939> say<00:06:22.089> about<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:22.419> Evo

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
I guess I have this to say about the Evo

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.089 
I guess I have this to say about the Evo
skins<00:06:23.490> while<00:06:24.490> I<00:06:24.520> like<00:06:24.849> the<00:06:25.029> idea<00:06:25.389> I<00:06:25.919> like<00:06:26.919> the

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
skins while I like the idea I like the

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:29.159 
skins while I like the idea I like the
fact<00:06:27.250> that<00:06:27.370> they're<00:06:27.550> lightweight<00:06:28.169> very

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
fact that they're lightweight very

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.980 
fact that they're lightweight very
minimalist<00:06:29.830> very<00:06:30.400> flexible<00:06:30.939> I<00:06:31.529> find<00:06:32.529> that<00:06:32.680> the

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
minimalist very flexible I find that the

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.659 
minimalist very flexible I find that the
material<00:06:34.990> that<00:06:35.080> they<00:06:35.229> are<00:06:35.349> made<00:06:35.560> of<00:06:35.710> is<00:06:36.370> just

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
material that they are made of is just

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.540 
material that they are made of is just
not<00:06:36.819> breathable<00:06:37.150> enough<00:06:37.509> and<00:06:37.750> so<00:06:38.370> they<00:06:39.370> I

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
not breathable enough and so they I

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.389 
not breathable enough and so they I
sweat<00:06:40.089> too<00:06:40.120> much<00:06:40.270> in<00:06:40.569> them<00:06:42.240> so<00:06:43.240> I<00:06:44.250> can't<00:06:45.250> see

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:45.399 
sweat too much in them so I can't see

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:47.250 
sweat too much in them so I can't see
them<00:06:45.550> as<00:06:45.699> a<00:06:45.729> shoe<00:06:45.909> that<00:06:46.060> I<00:06:46.120> would<00:06:46.360> use<00:06:46.569> in

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
them as a shoe that I would use in

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.810 
them as a shoe that I would use in
physical<00:06:47.650> doing<00:06:47.860> any<00:06:48.010> kind<00:06:48.190> of<00:06:48.310> physical

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
physical doing any kind of physical

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.900 
physical doing any kind of physical
activity<00:06:49.500> and<00:06:50.500> then<00:06:51.070> for<00:06:51.280> anything<00:06:51.490> that

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
activity and then for anything that

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.200 
activity and then for anything that
really<00:06:52.690> is<00:06:52.930> more<00:06:53.800> sedentary<00:06:54.160> where<00:06:55.120> it

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
really is more sedentary where it

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.790 
really is more sedentary where it
wouldn't<00:06:55.420> be<00:06:55.510> necessarily<00:06:55.900> sweating<00:06:56.320> I<00:06:56.500> would

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
wouldn't be necessarily sweating I would

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.000 
wouldn't be necessarily sweating I would
just<00:06:56.950> assume<00:06:57.220> go<00:06:57.430> barefoot<00:06:58.530> I'd<00:06:59.530> say<00:06:59.770> if<00:06:59.860> they

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
just assume go barefoot I'd say if they

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.960 
just assume go barefoot I'd say if they
can<00:07:00.160> figure<00:07:00.340> out<00:07:00.430> a<00:07:00.550> way<00:07:00.790> to<00:07:02.340> make<00:07:03.340> the<00:07:03.550> shoes

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
can figure out a way to make the shoes

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.110 
can figure out a way to make the shoes
breathe<00:07:04.750> better<00:07:04.930> then<00:07:05.680> I<00:07:06.100> think<00:07:06.610> this<00:07:06.760> product

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
breathe better then I think this product

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.120 
breathe better then I think this product
has<00:07:07.270> a<00:07:07.300> lot<00:07:07.510> more<00:07:07.540> potential<00:07:07.990> on<00:07:08.710> the<00:07:08.920> plus

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
has a lot more potential on the plus

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.230 
has a lot more potential on the plus
side<00:07:09.370> they<00:07:10.150> are<00:07:10.300> dishwasher<00:07:10.630> safe
