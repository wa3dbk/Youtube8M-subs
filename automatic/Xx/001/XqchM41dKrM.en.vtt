um<00:00:58.250> they<00:00:59.250> tend<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.670> put<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> mic<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.809> where

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
um they tend to put the mic just where

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.130 
um they tend to put the mic just where
the<00:01:02.039> sound<00:01:02.280> comes<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:03.090> theoretically<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the sound comes out theoretically and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
the sound comes out theoretically and
this<00:01:05.040> often<00:01:05.250> overloads<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> microphone

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
this often overloads the microphone

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.590 
this often overloads the microphone

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it and it misses important overtones so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.340 
it and it misses important overtones so
today's<00:01:15.030> subject<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
today's subject is going to be the

today's subject is going to be the
violin<00:01:16.770> why<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> most<00:01:19.049> painful

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
to listen to when it's mike wrong and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.630 
to listen to when it's mike wrong and
it's<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:22.890> easy<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.100> first<00:01:26.280> way

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it's really easy to do so the first way

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.539 
it's really easy to do so the first way

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
wrong is like a guitar they tend to put

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.670 
wrong is like a guitar they tend to put
the<00:01:34.590> microphone<00:01:35.600> right<00:01:36.600> above<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the microphone right above the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.899 
the microphone right above the
soundboard<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:40.140> picks<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.860> lot<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
soundboard and this picks up a lot of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.990 
soundboard and this picks up a lot of
the<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.210> high<00:01:42.570> harsh<00:01:42.930> frequencies<00:01:43.619> that

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
the really high harsh frequencies that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
the really high harsh frequencies that
you<00:01:45.000> wouldn't<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.590> if<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.860> had<00:01:47.040> miked<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.490> in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you wouldn't get if you had miked it in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
you wouldn't get if you had miked it in
like<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.570> open<00:01:48.810> room<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.320> were

listening to the mic to the violent in
person<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> here's<00:01:54.420> an<00:01:54.689> example<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:55.290> what<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
person so here's an example of what it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:19.530 
person so here's an example of what it
sounds<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.460> might<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.939> this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.570 

the<00:02:20.540> next<00:02:20.930> way<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.710> people<00:02:21.890> tend<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.430> my

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
the next way that people tend to my

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.030 
the next way that people tend to my
violence<00:02:23.090> wrong<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:24.020> same<00:02:24.260> way<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.830> you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
violence wrong is the same way that you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.070 
violence wrong is the same way that you
would<00:02:25.070> like<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:25.700> fill-in<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.420> supplemental

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
would like a fill-in a supplemental

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.250 
would like a fill-in a supplemental
miking<00:02:27.440> situation<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:29.030> when<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:30.020> fiddle

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
miking situation that is when the fiddle

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.200 
miking situation that is when the fiddle
is<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.500> state<00:02:30.860> performing<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.670> you're<00:02:31.910> trying

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
is on state performing and you're trying

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.300 
is on state performing and you're trying
to<00:02:32.510> make<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.020> sounds<00:02:33.410> carry<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> way<00:02:34.250> to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
to make the sounds carry all the way to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.720 
to make the sounds carry all the way to
the<00:02:34.460> back<00:02:34.610> via<00:02:34.850> thorium<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:37.070> do<00:02:37.250> this<00:02:37.490> by

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
the back via thorium you do this by

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.240 
the back via thorium you do this by
placing<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.300> mic<00:02:38.540> right<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:39.470> front<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
placing the mic right in front of the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.910 
placing the mic right in front of the
violin<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:42.080> picks<00:02:42.410> up<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.770> high

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
violin and this picks up the high

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.860 
violin and this picks up the high
frequencies<00:02:43.520> really<00:02:43.940> well<00:02:44.120> good<00:02:44.630> for

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
frequencies really well good for

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.630 
frequencies really well good for
supplemental<00:02:45.410> miking<00:02:45.770> because<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.490> high

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
supplemental miking because the high

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.460 
supplemental miking because the high
frequencies<00:02:47.240> don't<00:02:47.450> travel<00:02:47.720> as<00:02:47.990> well<00:02:48.020> as<00:02:48.320> the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
frequencies don't travel as well as the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.010 
frequencies don't travel as well as the
low<00:02:48.620> ones<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.850> not<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.450> good<00:02:50.480> for<00:02:50.690> sound

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
low ones but not so good for sound

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.050 
low ones but not so good for sound
recording<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.830> definitely<00:02:52.190> will<00:02:52.670> overload

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
recording you definitely will overload

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.550 
recording you definitely will overload
your<00:02:53.240> microphone<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:53.870> way<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.320> you're

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
your microphone this way and you're

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.490 
your microphone this way and you're
bound<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.340> get<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.670> screeching<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:57.350> bow

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
bound to get the screeching of the bow

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.970 
bound to get the screeching of the bow
against<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.040> strings<00:02:59.140> here's<00:03:00.140> an<00:03:00.290> example<00:03:00.620> of

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
against the strings here's an example of

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:26.670 
against the strings here's an example of
what<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.400> sounds<00:03:01.820> like

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.140 

so<00:03:27.680> you've<00:03:27.860> heard<00:03:27.980> two<00:03:28.250> ways<00:03:28.490> of<00:03:28.730> making<00:03:29.060> it

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
so you've heard two ways of making it

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.170 
so you've heard two ways of making it
wrong<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:30.320> what<00:03:31.100> is<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.460> that<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:31.670> hear<00:03:32.000> that

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
wrong but what is it that you hear that

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.420 
wrong but what is it that you hear that
tells<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.810> you've<00:03:32.990> done<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.410> wrong<00:03:33.590> well

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
tells you that you've done it wrong well

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.190 
tells you that you've done it wrong well
the<00:03:34.520> first<00:03:34.550> thing<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.210> you<00:03:35.450> have<00:03:35.750> no<00:03:35.780> room

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
the first thing is you have no room

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.830 
the first thing is you have no room
sound<00:03:36.590> there's<00:03:36.980> absolutely<00:03:37.700> no<00:03:38.060> echoes<00:03:38.630> off

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
sound there's absolutely no echoes off

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.800 
sound there's absolutely no echoes off
of<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.170> wall<00:03:39.350> no<00:03:40.330> no<00:03:41.330> no<00:03:41.840> room<00:03:42.140> sound<00:03:42.560> at<00:03:42.920> all

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
of the wall no no no room sound at all

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.690 
of the wall no no no room sound at all
the<00:03:44.810> other<00:03:44.840> problem<00:03:45.470> with<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.800> is<00:03:46.070> that

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
the other problem with this is that

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.790 
the other problem with this is that
there's<00:03:47.090> no<00:03:47.240> bottom<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.720> you've<00:03:48.230> overloaded

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
there's no bottom and you've overloaded

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.440 
there's no bottom and you've overloaded
the<00:03:49.010> microphone<00:03:49.610> using<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.330> high

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
the microphone using the high

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.560 
the microphone using the high
frequencies<00:03:51.110> and<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.760> mic<00:03:52.940> then<00:03:53.150> couldn't

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
frequencies and so the mic then couldn't

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.780 
frequencies and so the mic then couldn't
pick<00:03:53.720> up<00:03:53.870> any<00:03:54.050> of<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.320> nuance<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.310> body<00:03:55.580> of

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
pick up any of the nuance of the body of

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.170 
pick up any of the nuance of the body of
the<00:03:55.910> instrument<00:03:56.770> this<00:03:57.770> is<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.760> result<00:03:58.910> of

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
the instrument this is the result of

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.510 
the instrument this is the result of
this<00:03:59.300> is<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.570> it<00:03:59.750> makes<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.950> recording

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
this is that it makes the recording

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.850 
this is that it makes the recording
sound<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:02.150> lot<00:04:02.810> like<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:03.110> middle<00:04:03.500> school<00:04:03.740> or

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
sound a lot like a middle school or

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.740 
sound a lot like a middle school or
playing<00:04:04.130> on<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.400> cheap<00:04:04.700> violin<00:04:05.150> even<00:04:05.600> though

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
playing on a cheap violin even though

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.620 
playing on a cheap violin even though
the<00:04:05.930> violinist<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.940> perfectly<00:04:07.940> capable<00:04:08.270> of

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
the violinist is perfectly capable of

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.560 
the violinist is perfectly capable of
hitting<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.760> hitting<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.820> pitch<00:04:10.970> properly

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
hitting it to hitting a pitch properly

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.470 
hitting it to hitting a pitch properly
or<00:04:12.050> keeping<00:04:12.500> rhythm<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.700> sounds<00:04:14.300> more

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
or keeping rhythm it just sounds more

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.479 
or keeping rhythm it just sounds more
juvenile<00:04:14.990> because<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.740> high<00:04:15.920> frequencies

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
juvenile because of the high frequencies

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.979 
juvenile because of the high frequencies
and<00:04:16.700> lath<00:04:16.910> of<00:04:17.150> fullness<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:19.760> right<00:04:20.150> way<00:04:20.450> to

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
and lath of fullness the right way to

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.640 
and lath of fullness the right way to
mike<00:04:21.170> a<00:04:21.700> violin<00:04:22.700> in<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.090> studio<00:04:23.420> setting<00:04:23.750> is

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
mike a violin in the studio setting is

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.100 
mike a violin in the studio setting is
to<00:04:24.950> put<00:04:25.160> them<00:04:25.310> like<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.670> phone<00:04:25.880> at<00:04:26.120> least<00:04:26.480> one

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
to put them like the phone at least one

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.730 
to put them like the phone at least one
near<00:04:27.530> away<00:04:28.180> from<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.300> violin<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:29.960> have<00:04:30.650> an

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
near away from the violin and have an

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.850 
near away from the violin and have an
angle<00:04:31.100> slightly<00:04:31.640> above<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.780> violin<00:04:33.230> pointing

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
angle slightly above the violin pointing

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.950 
angle slightly above the violin pointing
down<00:04:34.070> for<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.550> soundboard<00:04:35.030> here's<00:04:35.810> an

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
down for the soundboard here's an

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.540 
down for the soundboard here's an
example<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.470> what<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.710> sounds<00:04:37.010> like<00:04:37.100> when<00:04:37.220> you

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
example of what it sounds like when you

00:04:37.550 --> 00:05:00.580 
example of what it sounds like when you
do<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.790> right

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.679 

so<00:05:01.590> there's<00:05:01.830> one<00:05:02.129> more<00:05:02.490> really<00:05:03.270> defining

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689 
so there's one more really defining

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.230 
so there's one more really defining
factor<00:05:04.020> in<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.740> quality<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.460> your<00:05:05.550> recording

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
factor in the quality of your recording

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.629 
factor in the quality of your recording
and<00:05:06.419> that's<00:05:07.229> going<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.710> be<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.159> quality<00:05:08.580> of

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
and that's going to be the quality of

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.110 
and that's going to be the quality of
your<00:05:08.729> microphone<00:05:09.530> yeah<00:05:10.530> it's<00:05:10.919> it's<00:05:11.370> hard<00:05:11.819> to

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
your microphone yeah it's it's hard to

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.570 
your microphone yeah it's it's hard to
get<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.270> hold<00:05:12.330> with<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.979> $15,000<00:05:13.979> microphones

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
get a hold with the $15,000 microphones

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.610 
get a hold with the $15,000 microphones
when<00:05:14.879> you're<00:05:15.000> just<00:05:15.210> starting<00:05:15.449> out<00:05:15.719> but<00:05:16.469> you

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
when you're just starting out but you

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.649 
when you're just starting out but you
need<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.889> at<00:05:17.009> least<00:05:17.159> be<00:05:17.460> aware<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.849> the<00:05:18.360> effect

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
need to at least be aware of the effect

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.350 
need to at least be aware of the effect
it's<00:05:18.810> going<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.110> have<00:05:19.229> on<00:05:19.379> your<00:05:19.530> recording<00:05:20.360> for

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
it's going to have on your recording for

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.110 
it's going to have on your recording for
instance<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.990> cheap<00:05:22.379> microphone<00:05:22.770> is<00:05:23.189> far<00:05:23.819> more

instance a cheap microphone is far more

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.790 
instance a cheap microphone is far more
likely<00:05:24.449> to<00:05:24.689> be<00:05:24.990> blown<00:05:25.259> out<00:05:25.439> by<00:05:25.469> high

likely to be blown out by high
frequencies<00:05:26.400> than<00:05:26.759> a<00:05:26.819> more<00:05:27.060> expensive<00:05:27.389> one<00:05:27.830> we

frequencies than a more expensive one we

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.399 
frequencies than a more expensive one we
redid<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.729> previous<00:05:30.240> three<00:05:30.479> recordings<00:05:31.199> that

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
redid the previous three recordings that

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.110 
redid the previous three recordings that
you've<00:05:31.560> heard<00:05:31.740> with<00:05:32.370> a<00:05:32.400> more<00:05:32.759> expensive

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
you've heard with a more expensive

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.059 
you've heard with a more expensive
microphone<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:34.199> recordings<00:05:34.650> that<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:34.830> heard

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
microphone the recordings that you heard

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.610 
microphone the recordings that you heard
were<00:05:35.250> done<00:05:35.430> on<00:05:35.639> a<00:05:35.699> $55<00:05:36.479> all-purpose<00:05:37.080> mics<00:05:37.440> and

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
were done on a $55 all-purpose mics and

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.640 
were done on a $55 all-purpose mics and
these<00:05:38.490> are<00:05:38.699> done<00:05:38.879> on<00:05:39.090> a

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
these are done on a

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.379 
these are done on a
three-thousand-dollar<00:05:40.650> microphone<00:05:41.400> so

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
three-thousand-dollar microphone so

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.709 
three-thousand-dollar microphone so
here's<00:05:43.110> an<00:05:43.259> example<00:05:43.349> of<00:05:43.979> what<00:05:44.490> are<00:05:44.729> worse

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
here's an example of what are worse

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.260 
here's an example of what are worse
recording<00:05:46.469> from<00:05:46.949> the<00:05:47.069> first<00:05:47.310> batch<00:05:47.580> sounded

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
recording from the first batch sounded

00:05:48.270 --> 00:06:13.560 
recording from the first batch sounded
like<00:05:48.449> when<00:05:49.110> done<00:05:49.349> with<00:05:49.529> a<00:05:49.590> proper<00:05:49.949> microphone

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.909 

so<00:06:14.570> by<00:06:14.750> now<00:06:14.900> you<00:06:14.960> might<00:06:15.260> be<00:06:15.440> asking<00:06:15.470> yourself

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
so by now you might be asking yourself

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.340 
so by now you might be asking yourself
why<00:06:16.669> does<00:06:16.850> it<00:06:17.000> even<00:06:17.030> matter<00:06:17.449> if<00:06:17.660> you<00:06:17.900> record<00:06:18.229> it

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
why does it even matter if you record it

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.250 
why does it even matter if you record it
properly<00:06:18.770> in<00:06:19.040> this<00:06:19.760> day<00:06:20.000> and<00:06:20.030> age<00:06:20.270> you<00:06:20.810> can<00:06:21.020> fix

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
properly in this day and age you can fix

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.920 
properly in this day and age you can fix
your<00:06:21.440> recordings<00:06:21.979> you<00:06:22.220> can<00:06:22.460> alter<00:06:23.270> the<00:06:23.419> EQ

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
your recordings you can alter the EQ

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.010 
your recordings you can alter the EQ
using<00:06:24.530> your<00:06:24.680> own<00:06:25.000> relatively<00:06:26.000> inexpensive<00:06:26.630> of

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
using your own relatively inexpensive of

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.850 
using your own relatively inexpensive of
sound<00:06:27.949> editing<00:06:28.280> software<00:06:28.820> um<00:06:29.350> you<00:06:30.350> can<00:06:30.530> always

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
sound editing software um you can always

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.180 
sound editing software um you can always
get<00:06:31.370> your<00:06:31.850> studio<00:06:32.840> recorder<00:06:33.410> to<00:06:33.680> do<00:06:33.800> this<00:06:33.949> for

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
get your studio recorder to do this for

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.469 
get your studio recorder to do this for
you<00:06:34.400> if<00:06:34.580> you<00:06:34.729> don't<00:06:34.910> have<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.389> resources

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
you if you don't have the resources

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.300 
you if you don't have the resources
yourself<00:06:36.199> but<00:06:36.889> this<00:06:37.190> does<00:06:37.460> cost<00:06:37.789> money<00:06:39.310> you

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
yourself but this does cost money you

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.760 
yourself but this does cost money you
can<00:06:40.490> always<00:06:40.669> add<00:06:41.000> room<00:06:41.539> sound<00:06:41.960> adding<00:06:42.560> reverb

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
can always add room sound adding reverb

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.939 
can always add room sound adding reverb
the<00:06:43.190> same<00:06:43.370> way<00:06:43.520> that<00:06:43.669> you<00:06:43.789> get<00:06:43.970> it<00:06:44.090> eq<00:06:44.740> but<00:06:45.740> the

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
the same way that you get it eq but the

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.029 
the same way that you get it eq but the
problem<00:06:46.400> with<00:06:46.550> this<00:06:46.729> is<00:06:47.060> again<00:06:47.979> studio<00:06:48.979> time

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 
problem with this is again studio time

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.760 
problem with this is again studio time
is<00:06:49.430> really<00:06:49.639> expensive<00:06:49.940> the<00:06:50.870> program's<00:06:51.440> can

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
is really expensive the program's can

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.960 
is really expensive the program's can
get<00:06:52.010> pretty<00:06:52.310> pricey<00:06:52.400> and<00:06:54.010> it's<00:06:55.010> a<00:06:55.280> lot<00:06:55.669> of

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
get pretty pricey and it's a lot of

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.550 
get pretty pricey and it's a lot of
money<00:06:56.180> that<00:06:56.270> you<00:06:56.449> don't<00:06:56.660> have<00:06:56.810> to<00:06:56.870> spend<00:06:57.229> if

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
money that you don't have to spend if

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.529 
money that you don't have to spend if
you<00:06:57.830> just<00:06:58.070> recorded<00:06:58.669> properly<00:06:58.910> in<00:06:59.419> the<00:06:59.449> first

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
you just recorded properly in the first

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:03.070 
you just recorded properly in the first
place<00:06:59.870> and<00:07:00.580> the<00:07:01.580> other<00:07:01.729> problem<00:07:02.210> is<00:07:02.360> that<00:07:02.599> a

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
place and the other problem is that a

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.440 
place and the other problem is that a
bad<00:07:03.440> take<00:07:03.830> is<00:07:04.099> always<00:07:04.789> going<00:07:04.940> to<00:07:05.030> be<00:07:05.060> a<00:07:05.150> bad

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
bad take is always going to be a bad

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.629 
bad take is always going to be a bad
take<00:07:05.810> and<00:07:06.020> it<00:07:06.410> doesn't<00:07:06.770> matter<00:07:06.800> how<00:07:07.099> you<00:07:07.340> edit

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
take and it doesn't matter how you edit

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.050 
take and it doesn't matter how you edit
it<00:07:07.880> it's<00:07:08.570> sort<00:07:08.810> of<00:07:08.990> like<00:07:09.169> if<00:07:09.680> you<00:07:10.520> go<00:07:10.669> get<00:07:10.910> her

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
it it's sort of like if you go get her

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.990 
it it's sort of like if you go get her
cheese<00:07:11.270> chocolate<00:07:11.590> if<00:07:12.590> you<00:07:13.190> know<00:07:13.430> it<00:07:13.639> tastes

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
cheese chocolate if you know it tastes

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.060 
cheese chocolate if you know it tastes
like<00:07:14.060> chocolate<00:07:14.419> exceeds<00:07:14.960> its<00:07:15.169> pretty<00:07:15.650> decent

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
like chocolate exceeds its pretty decent

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.900 
like chocolate exceeds its pretty decent
but<00:07:16.760> once<00:07:17.389> you've<00:07:17.630> had<00:07:17.810> Godiva<00:07:18.410> it's<00:07:19.280> pretty

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
but once you've had Godiva it's pretty

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.800 
but once you've had Godiva it's pretty
hard<00:07:20.300> to<00:07:20.539> make<00:07:20.870> her<00:07:21.080> shoes<00:07:21.320> taste<00:07:21.650> that<00:07:21.860> good

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
hard to make her shoes taste that good

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.469 
hard to make her shoes taste that good
well<00:07:23.810> that's<00:07:24.650> all<00:07:24.830> we<00:07:24.979> have<00:07:25.010> time<00:07:25.310> for<00:07:25.370> today<00:07:26.180> I

well that's all we have time for today I
