okay here we have the right side as you

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.580 
okay here we have the right side as you
can<00:01:43.760> see<00:01:43.910> it<00:01:44.030> has<00:01:44.150> one<00:01:44.180> intake<00:01:44.870> fan<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.380> eighty

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
can see it has one intake fan in eighty

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.810 
can see it has one intake fan in eighty
millimeter<00:01:46.070> fan<00:01:46.370> variable<00:01:47.300> speed<00:01:48.670> which<00:01:49.670> is

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
millimeter fan variable speed which is

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.480 
millimeter fan variable speed which is
nice<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.780> back<00:01:51.080> we<00:01:51.350> see<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.680> power<00:01:51.920> supply

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
nice the back we see the power supply

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.960 
nice the back we see the power supply
the<00:01:53.240> i/o<00:01:53.420> plate<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:55.480> four<00:01:56.480> PCI<00:01:57.290> slots

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
the i/o plate and the four PCI slots

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.140 
the i/o plate and the four PCI slots
PCIe<00:01:58.970> PCIe<00:01:59.450> slots<00:01:59.860> these<00:02:00.860> are<00:02:01.280> low<00:02:01.460> profile<00:02:01.970> so

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
PCIe PCIe slots these are low profile so

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.710 
PCIe PCIe slots these are low profile so
only<00:02:02.390> low<00:02:02.540> profile<00:02:03.140> cards<00:02:03.470> will<00:02:03.620> work<00:02:03.860> on<00:02:04.720> the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
only low profile cards will work on the

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.800 
only low profile cards will work on the
left<00:02:06.260> side<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.770> have<00:02:06.800> just<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.340> plain<00:02:07.550> left

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810

and<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.590> top<00:02:12.860> we<00:02:13.159> see<00:02:13.190> for<00:02:13.849> ventilation<00:02:14.540> so

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
and on the top we see for ventilation so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.850 
and on the top we see for ventilation so
you<00:02:14.780> don't<00:02:14.930> want<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.110> put<00:02:15.200> anything<00:02:15.440> on<00:02:15.620> top<00:02:15.800> of

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
you don't want to put anything on top of

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.750 
you don't want to put anything on top of
here<00:02:16.159> opening<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.150> up<00:02:17.269> we<00:02:18.110> see<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:19.730> has

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
here opening it up we see that it has

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.190 
here opening it up we see that it has
the<00:02:20.390> parts<00:02:21.280> for<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.430> case<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.510> power<00:02:23.720> supply

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the parts for the case the power supply

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.690 
the parts for the case the power supply
which<00:02:24.409> is<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.769> only<00:02:24.920> bad<00:02:25.190> thing<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.519> don't<00:02:25.550> like

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700
