00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.960
 we like mostly traveling 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 and we try to avoid curves and ports 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.030
 of mountain because in the end they finish marÃ­a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.220
 lost two impossible and when you go 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.010
 tour you arrive at the site more or less for the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.660
 time to eat between you eat 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.550
 Kate is in fact if she is or I'm going to see 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.360
 the obelisk 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.140
 of the obelisk or is it going to operate 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.870
 has fascinated us above all the way 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.730
 they have to live like everyone 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.850
 it's super kind the truth 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 they have a culture and a musical folklore 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.160
 very authentic to me it surprises me that weigh 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.860
 to the kilometers that there is that there is a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.699
 movement away really I 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.699
 It looks like a puddle 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.330
 not in flight time but when you arrive 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.330
 the site says we are not so different 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.160
 we have the same concerns here 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 that the truth is that it's good to travel 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.740
 neither is it a thing that much 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.800
 people say travel must be done in the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.900
 life because it's true that it's going very well 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.580
 but there are people who can not travel and do not 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.540
 nothing happens 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.790
 I was 25 years without sun, I had not gone 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.110
 nor andorra and I was super happy and that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.760
 make change that happens now that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.670
 we have traveled by dices was giving the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:32.430
 tobacco and the truth that now that is that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 we can travel because we do it every time 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.310
 that we can feel at home in a 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.530
 North America Latin America in the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.890
 North South North South America 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.010
 of North and South South America 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.670
 - Brazil that does not end that south 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.570
 America 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.640
 of hooking there in more of tambourines 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.440
 because when we went to japan we got 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.670
 bad we had not discovered the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.510
 pleasures of Japanese gastronomy 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.780
 so I did not finish it either 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.780
 discover 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.819
 a little more chicken teriyaki but good 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.330
 now I eat salmon nikki of what 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.860
 put me of everything of whatever and when 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.530
 you get there, of course, the changes in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.200
 smells the spices and hunger cisco 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.390
 I will spend looking for bourgeois tokyo 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.390
 Prieto Mount Fuji but in passing 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.390
 goodbye 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.170
 but good the truth that 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.770
 we visit things but we do not know what 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.000
 is mobilizing all this in Japanese 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.680
 because the people that we go are going to 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.180
 go with a guide we have it very clear because 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.190
 is that you really do not hear about 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.650
 nothing apart as there are no stores or anything 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.430
 everything is up or down 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.099
 leaving ask what japan is where 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.409
 is the street they feel like and you 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.860
 accompany the site are thrown 15 minutes 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.560
 with you there are people that take you where 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.000
 is this that we follow him seems that he wants 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.829
 to tell us to follow him if he wants 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.580
 communicate with us afterwards takes us 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.650
 to the site and then it goes 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.650
 and we said 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.480
 water water nothing 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.030
 same 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.750
 wilder goal 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.750
 It was water but I did not understand 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.950
 I have given me 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.709
 new york is that you see it is like being 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.090
 in a movie it seems that it's going to 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.769
 seem with chila at any time 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.329
 king kong is a different feeling and 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.110
 after in europe almost all of europe 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:02.970
 baxter dance tip of the east 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.550
 the sea lions lion and wet 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.480
 and so look a little bit of work is the 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.730
 last bar in the world 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.180
