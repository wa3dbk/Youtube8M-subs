goes into like a warps warp speed and
Hedden<00:01:23.189> flies<00:01:23.460> through<00:01:23.790> space<00:01:23.850> really

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
Hedden flies through space really

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.719 
Hedden flies through space really
quickly<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.049> let's<00:01:25.229> try<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.650> over<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:28.729> and

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
quickly so let's try that over here and

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.969 
quickly so let's try that over here and
you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> jetpack<00:01:30.860> shooting<00:01:31.860> out

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you can see the jetpack shooting out

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
you can see the jetpack shooting out
there<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.700> let's<00:01:32.970> check<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.420> some<00:01:33.450> other

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900

change the flight speed we'll crank that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.530 
change the flight speed we'll crank that
up<00:01:42.979> asteroid<00:01:43.979> frequency<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.939> we'll<00:01:45.090> increase

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
up asteroid frequency so we'll increase

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.980 
up asteroid frequency so we'll increase
those<00:01:46.670> energy<00:01:47.670> style<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.329> I'm<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
those energy style so I'm going to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.090 
those energy style so I'm going to
change<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.350> Google<00:01:49.890> colors<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.960> character

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.690 
will go with spaceship star brightness
we'll<00:01:57.360> crank<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.409> well<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.130> we'll

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.600 
we'll crank that up as well and we'll
leave<00:01:59.820> everything<00:02:00.119> else<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> same<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.399> let's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
leave everything else the same so let's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.080 
leave everything else the same so let's
go<00:02:02.820> back<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.469> go<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.829> have

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
go back and there we go now we have

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.969 
go back and there we go now we have
Google<00:02:06.090> colors<00:02:06.600> surrounding<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.350> spaceship

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
Google colors surrounding the spaceship

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770 
Google colors surrounding the spaceship
perhaps<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.940> would<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.179> been<00:02:09.300> better<00:02:09.450> for

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
perhaps that would have been better for

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.410 
perhaps that would have been better for
the<00:02:09.899> Android<00:02:10.679> robot<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the Android robot but you get the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
the Android robot but you get the
picture<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.720> double<00:02:13.260> tapping<00:02:13.440> on<00:02:13.650> this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
picture so double tapping on this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.130 
picture so double tapping on this
Green<00:02:14.100> let's<00:02:14.460> go<00:02:14.670> ahead<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.090> enter<00:02:15.750> here

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
Green let's go ahead and enter here

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.350 
Green let's go ahead and enter here
double<00:02:16.890> tapping<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.670> top<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> screen

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
double tapping on the top of the screen

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.910 
double tapping on the top of the screen
sends<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.410> spaceship<00:02:19.890> into<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:21.090> faster<00:02:21.660> speed

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
sends the spaceship into a faster speed

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.059 
sends the spaceship into a faster speed
we<00:02:23.540> tap<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> middle<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> screen<00:02:25.470> does

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
we tap on the middle of the screen does

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.660 
we tap on the middle of the screen does
a<00:02:26.100> barrel<00:02:26.520> roll<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.890> pretty<00:02:29.190> cool<00:02:29.340> let's<00:02:29.459> go

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
a barrel roll so pretty cool let's go

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.030 
a barrel roll so pretty cool let's go
ahead<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.180> take<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:30.990> look<00:02:31.290> at<00:02:31.500> some<00:02:31.800> other

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
ahead and take a look at some other

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:41.199 
ahead and take a look at some other
features<00:02:34.040> or<00:02:35.040> some<00:02:35.250> other<00:02:35.459> setups<00:02:36.020> settings

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.260 

pixelated<00:02:42.209> I'm<00:02:42.270> not<00:02:42.450> sure<00:02:42.660> what<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.470> does

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
pixelated I'm not sure what this does

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.210 
pixelated I'm not sure what this does
seems<00:02:45.270> pretty<00:02:45.569> much<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.900> same<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.800> first

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
seems pretty much the same as the first

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.820 
seems pretty much the same as the first
one<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:47.550> try<00:02:47.820> let's<00:02:48.660> go<00:02:48.959> back<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:54.410> go<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.500> none

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
one we try let's go back to go to none

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.430 
one we try let's go back to go to none
for<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.970> character<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.110> see<00:02:58.260> now

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
for the character and as you can see now

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.430 
for the character and as you can see now
we<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.390> no<00:03:00.390> character<00:03:00.810> there<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.320> it's

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
we just have no character there and it's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.370 
we just have no character there and it's
just<00:03:01.530> space<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:02.970> still<00:03:03.269> boost<00:03:04.080> in

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
just space and you can still boost in

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.620 
just space and you can still boost in
sort<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.769> like<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> first-person<00:03:05.550> point<00:03:06.480> of

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
sort of like a first-person point of

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
sort of like a first-person point of
view<00:03:06.840> there<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.769> we'll<00:03:07.950> go<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> settings<00:03:09.650> bring

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
view there so we'll go to settings bring

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.110 
view there so we'll go to settings bring
