in<00:01:44.079> one<00:01:44.289> pass<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:45.549> by<00:01:45.700> far<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.030> easiest

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
in one pass this is by far the easiest

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.270 
in one pass this is by far the easiest
on<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.780> first<00:01:47.110> pass<00:01:47.350> before<00:01:47.649> you've<00:01:48.009> killed

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
on the first pass before you've killed

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.789 
on the first pass before you've killed
anyone<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.450> run<00:01:49.659> straight<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:50.140> cover<00:01:50.500> and

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
anyone just run straight to cover and

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.410 
anyone just run straight to cover and
jump<00:01:51.039> on<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.250> turret<00:01:51.429> before<00:01:51.909> killing<00:01:52.119> any

this<00:02:09.770> can<00:02:09.950> be<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.099> challenge<00:02:10.580> because<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.910> have

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
this can be a challenge because you have

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.000 
this can be a challenge because you have
to<00:02:11.120> do<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.239> lot<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.660> damage<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.560> juggernaut

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
to do a lot of damage to the juggernaut

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.610 
to do a lot of damage to the juggernaut
but<00:02:13.340> not<00:02:13.489> too<00:02:13.970> much<00:02:14.050> what<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.080> found<00:02:15.349> is<00:02:15.590> that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
but not too much what I found is that

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.110 
but not too much what I found is that
the<00:02:15.860> amount<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.220> damage<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.730> almost<00:02:16.940> exactly

the amount of damage is almost exactly
