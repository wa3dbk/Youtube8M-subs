we're going to continue this tutorial by
finishing<00:00:15.719> off<00:00:16.020> our<00:00:16.199> bullet<00:00:16.710> class<00:00:16.949> and

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
finishing off our bullet class and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.200 
finishing off our bullet class and
adding<00:00:18.900> some<00:00:19.109> other<00:00:19.260> events<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.859> there<00:00:20.210> and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
adding some other events in there and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.720 
adding some other events in there and
just<00:00:21.600> finishing<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.710> first<00:00:23.400> thing<00:00:23.580> I'm

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
just finishing it up so first thing I'm

just finishing it up so first thing I'm
going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.890> add<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> collision<00:00:26.519> event

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
going to do is add a collision event

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.130 
going to do is add a collision event
with<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.619> wall<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.539> I'm<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.869> put

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
with the wall and I'm just going to put

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.250 
with the wall and I'm just going to put
a<00:00:31.349> simple<00:00:31.920> balance<00:00:32.130> block<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.930> again<00:00:33.930> solid

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
a simple balance block here again solid

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.670 
a simple balance block here again solid
objects<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.010> doesn't<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.370> precisely

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
objects it doesn't have to be precisely

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.049 
objects it doesn't have to be precisely
okay<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:37.829> good<00:00:38.010> next<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.610> want<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
okay that's good next we want to have a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
okay that's good next we want to have a
draw<00:00:39.420> event<00:00:39.750> add<00:00:40.020> some<00:00:40.950> code<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
draw event add some code in here and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
draw event add some code in here and
then<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.710> we're<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.100> when

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
then this is what we're going to do when

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.740 
then this is what we're going to do when
we're<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> draw<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> shadow

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
we're going to want to draw the shadow

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.000 
we're going to want to draw the shadow
and<00:00:47.360> actual<00:00:48.360> sprite<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.410> want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> draw<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and actual sprite so we want to draw the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.430 
and actual sprite so we want to draw the
shadow<00:00:50.340> first<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> actual<00:00:51.750> sprite<00:00:52.199> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
shadow first so the actual sprite is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.920 
shadow first so the actual sprite is
drawn<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.710> top<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> shadow<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.840> I'm

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
drawn on top of the shadow so what I'm

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.119 
drawn on top of the shadow so what I'm
going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:57.739> click<00:00:58.739> draw<00:00:59.329> sprite<00:01:01.129> extra

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
going to do is click draw sprite extra

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.179 
going to do is click draw sprite extra
and<00:01:03.409> I'll<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> put<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> sprite

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and I'll just going to put a sprite

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.590 
and I'll just going to put a sprite
sprite<00:01:05.549> index<00:01:06.860> move<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.010> over<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
sprite index move this over here some of

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.499 
sprite index move this over here some of
it<00:01:09.689> may<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.409> image<00:01:12.049> index<00:01:13.610> x<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.000> y<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.299> want

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it may just image index x and y we want

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.940 
it may just image index x and y we want
it<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.140> offset<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.830> I'm

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it to be a little bit offset so I'm

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.890 
it to be a little bit offset so I'm
going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> offset<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.640> by<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.180> pixels<00:01:18.600> on

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
going to offset it by like two pixels on

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.679 
going to offset it by like two pixels on
both<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.040> x<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.490> y<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:22.890> go<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.689> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
both the x and y so there we go and the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.399 
both the x and y so there we go and the
X<00:01:24.900> scale<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.409> rotation

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
X scale is just one to one and rotation

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.280 
X scale is just one to one and rotation
is<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.640> image<00:01:29.970> angle<00:01:30.390> leave<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
is going to be image angle leave the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.590 
is going to be image angle leave the
same<00:01:31.500> rotation<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> actual<00:01:32.610> bullet<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
same rotation of the actual bullet the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
same rotation of the actual bullet the
color<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.680> zero<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.310> completely

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
color is going to be zero or completely

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.960 
color is going to be zero or completely
black<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.409> alpha<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.610> 0

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
black and the alpha is going to be 0

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.710 
black and the alpha is going to be 0
point<00:01:39.390> 5<00:01:39.689> or<00:01:39.990> basically<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.159> half<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.759> half

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
point 5 or basically just half the half

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.920 
point 5 or basically just half the half
the<00:01:42.960> transparency<00:01:44.479> okay<00:01:45.479> now<00:01:45.630> we're<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the transparency okay now we're going to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
the transparency okay now we're going to
actually<00:01:46.049> draw<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.680> sprite<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.490> can

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
actually draw our sprite which we can

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
actually draw our sprite which we can
basically<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.119> copy<00:01:48.329> off<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.229> just

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
basically just copy off this and just

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.999 
basically just copy off this and just
get<00:01:50.310> rid<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:51.329> rid<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.170> our

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
get rid of that get rid of that and our

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.499 
get rid of that get rid of that and our
color<00:01:53.689> can<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.829> negative<00:01:55.829> 1<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:57.329> that's

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
color can be negative 1 I think that's

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.760 
color can be negative 1 I think that's
it<00:01:58.430> an<00:01:59.430> image<00:01:59.850> alpha<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.570> default<00:02:01.290> that's<00:02:01.500> one

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it an image alpha a default that's one

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.399 
it an image alpha a default that's one
so<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.250> should<00:02:02.430> show<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:04.049> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
so it should show up like that and I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.449 
so it should show up like that and I
think<00:02:04.619> we're<00:02:04.740> good<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.479> on<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.459> next

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
think we're good to go on that next

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.130 
think we're good to go on that next
thing<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.690> bullets<00:02:09.929> actually

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
thing is to have the bullets actually

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.400 
thing is to have the bullets actually
fly<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:10.830> once<00:02:11.790> we<00:02:11.940> shoot<00:02:12.120> them<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.660> I'm

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
fly out once we shoot them so I'm

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.260 
fly out once we shoot them so I'm
going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> copy<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.130> because<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:14.910> almost

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
going to copy this because it's almost

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.720 
going to copy this because it's almost
like<00:02:15.690> shooting<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> bullet<00:02:16.550> except<00:02:17.550> we're

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
like shooting a bullet except we're

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.250 
like shooting a bullet except we're
going<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.180> name<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.690> s<00:02:18.860> for<00:02:19.860> shell<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:22.020> just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
going to name and s for shell and just

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.420 
going to name and s for shell and just
get<00:02:22.380> rid<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:23.270> we<00:02:24.270> don't<00:02:24.390> need<00:02:25.430> actually

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
get rid of this we don't need actually

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.740 
get rid of this we don't need actually
do<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:26.640> need<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.420> think<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:30.600> give

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
do we need that I think we do just give

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.470 
do we need that I think we do just give
me<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.870> sec<00:02:31.050> yeah<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.040> think<00:02:32.280> yeah<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.210> do<00:02:33.330> need

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
me a sec yeah I think yeah we do need

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.150 
me a sec yeah I think yeah we do need
that<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:36.110> don't<00:02:37.110> think<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.500> need<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.740> do

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
that and I don't think we need this do

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.520 
that and I don't think we need this do
we<00:02:38.310> because<00:02:38.760> we<00:02:38.850> set<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.270> bullet<00:02:39.600> we

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
we because we set it in the bullet we

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.550 
we because we set it in the bullet we
set<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.400> bullet<00:02:41.730> right<00:02:42.330> yeah<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.440> we

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
set it in the bullet right yeah so we

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.190 
set it in the bullet right yeah so we
already<00:02:43.680> set<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> bullet<00:02:44.570> speed<00:02:45.570> over<00:02:45.930> there

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
already set the bullet speed over there

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.460 
already set the bullet speed over there
so<00:02:47.120> all<00:02:48.120> we<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.600> do<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:51.320> set<00:02:52.320> its

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so all we have to do is set its

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.980 
so all we have to do is set its
direction<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:54.330> actually<00:02:54.450> going<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.810> come

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
direction it's actually going to come

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.510 
direction it's actually going to come
out<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.500> same<00:02:55.680> place<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> bullets<00:02:56.340> going<00:02:56.430> to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
out the same place the bullets going to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.680 
out the same place the bullets going to
come<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.240> leave<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.570> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
come out so we can just leave that the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.900 
come out so we can just leave that the
same<00:02:57.930> and<00:03:00.050> instead<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.350> two<00:03:02.180> loops<00:03:04.910> we

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
same and instead is going two loops we

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.540 
same and instead is going two loops we
have<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.270> object<00:03:06.660> bullets<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.160> I'm<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.370> to

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
have to object bullets so I'm going to

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.000 
have to object bullets so I'm going to
name<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.700> something<00:03:09.210> different<00:03:10.010> object

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
name this something different object

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.930 
name this something different object
bullet<00:03:11.660> shell<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.490> going<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.640> be<00:03:14.730> called

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
bullet shell so it's going to be called

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:24.380 
bullet shell so it's going to be called
bullet<00:03:15.330> shell<00:03:19.340> okay<00:03:20.340> there<00:03:20.550> we<00:03:20.640> go<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:23.390> get

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
bullet shell okay there we go and get

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.949 
bullet shell okay there we go and get
rid<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:26.150> direction<00:03:27.150> we're<00:03:27.510> going<00:03:27.540> to

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
rid of this and direction we're going to

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.170 
rid of this and direction we're going to
make<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:28.320> sort<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.800> random<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.880> we're<00:03:30.060> going

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
make this sort of random and we're going

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.550 
make this sort of random and we're going
to<00:03:30.209> want<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.600> be<00:03:30.720> coming<00:03:31.020> out<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:31.500> side

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
to want it to be coming out of one side

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.690 
to want it to be coming out of one side
of<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.010> gun<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:33.000> I'm<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.870> say<00:03:33.990> image

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
of the gun so I'm going to say image

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:43.240 
of the gun so I'm going to say image
angle<00:03:35.700> minus<00:03:36.480> 90<00:03:37.020> degrees<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:39.770> let's<00:03:40.770> have<00:03:41.370> it

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
angle minus 90 degrees and let's have it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.510 
angle minus 90 degrees and let's have it
like-<00:03:46.100> 90-100<00:03:47.100> 10<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.520> that's<00:03:47.760> 90<00:03:48.180> +<00:03:49.340> 220<00:03:50.340> and

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
like- 90-100 10 so that's 90 + 220 and

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.790 
like- 90-100 10 so that's 90 + 220 and
the<00:03:51.060> reason<00:03:51.300> I'm<00:03:51.390> doing<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:51.989> I'm<00:03:52.620> going

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
the reason I'm doing this is I'm going

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.010 
the reason I'm doing this is I'm going
to<00:03:52.890> add<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.520> random<00:03:54.239> amount<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:54.840> going<00:03:54.959> to

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
to add a random amount and it's going to

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.090 
to add a random amount and it's going to
be<00:03:55.110> 40<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.190> going<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:57.200> randomize<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.620> 40

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
be 40 so it's going to randomize in 40

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:07.250 
be 40 so it's going to randomize in 40
degrees<00:03:59.459> between<00:04:01.580> 19<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:04.850> 100<00:04:05.850> negative<00:04:06.720> 110

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
degrees between 19 a 100 negative 110

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.770 
degrees between 19 a 100 negative 110
degrees<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:09.709> negative<00:04:11.150> 70<00:04:12.150> degrees<00:04:12.510> i

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
degrees and negative 70 degrees i

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.930 
degrees and negative 70 degrees i
believe<00:04:13.050> so<00:04:13.860> that's<00:04:14.220> how<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:14.610> going<00:04:14.760> to

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
believe so that's how it's going to

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.920 
believe so that's how it's going to
differ<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.480> then<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.410> image<00:04:17.040> angle<00:04:17.930> let's

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
differ and then the image angle let's

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.680 
differ and then the image angle let's
just<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.580> we<00:04:20.580> just<00:04:20.790> have<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.299> completely

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
just see we just have it completely

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.930 
just see we just have it completely
random

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
random

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.159 
random
okay<00:04:24.940> so<00:04:25.660> random<00:04:27.449> all<00:04:28.449> right<00:04:28.570> let's<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:29.020> sit

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
okay so random all right let's just sit

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.570 
okay so random all right let's just sit
180<00:04:29.800> that's<00:04:30.130> fine<00:04:30.449> so<00:04:32.280> I'm<00:04:33.280> going<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.460> go<00:04:33.550> ahead

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
180 that's fine so I'm going to go ahead

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.030 
180 that's fine so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:33.970> test<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.419> pause<00:04:34.900> it<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.320> see<00:04:35.949> if

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
and test this pause it and see if

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.500 
and test this pause it and see if
everything<00:04:37.650> okay<00:04:38.650> we're<00:04:38.949> back<00:04:38.979> and<00:04:39.370> as<00:04:40.000> you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
everything okay we're back and as you

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.480 
everything okay we're back and as you
can<00:04:40.660> see<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:41.080> start<00:04:41.530> shooting<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:42.100> there's

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
can see I start shooting and there's

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.550 
can see I start shooting and there's
like<00:04:42.610> bullet<00:04:42.940> shells<00:04:43.180> flying<00:04:43.600> out<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:44.020> one

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
like bullet shells flying out of one

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.920 
like bullet shells flying out of one
side<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.949> me<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:46.270> gives<00:04:46.449> a<00:04:46.540> pretty<00:04:46.810> nice

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
side of me and it gives a pretty nice

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.460 
side of me and it gives a pretty nice
effect<00:04:47.320> without<00:04:47.620> lagging<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.400> game<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:50.290> just

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
effect without lagging the game it just

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.159 
effect without lagging the game it just
adds<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.860> new<00:04:51.040> element<00:04:51.720> later<00:04:52.720> on<00:04:52.900> we'll<00:04:53.139> be

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
adds a new element later on we'll be

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.689 
adds a new element later on we'll be
doing<00:04:53.590> pretty<00:04:53.710> much<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.919> same<00:04:54.160> exact<00:04:54.490> thing

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
doing pretty much the same exact thing

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.719 
doing pretty much the same exact thing
except<00:04:55.030> for<00:04:55.060> body<00:04:55.389> point<00:04:55.690> parts<00:04:56.169> so<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
except for body point parts so the

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.700 
except for body point parts so the
zombies<00:04:58.150> body<00:04:58.449> parts<00:04:58.840> will<00:04:58.960> actually<00:04:59.350> be<00:04:59.500> like

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
zombies body parts will actually be like

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.730 
zombies body parts will actually be like
flying<00:05:00.010> around<00:05:00.600> once<00:05:01.600> we<00:05:01.720> kill<00:05:01.930> them<00:05:02.110> so

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
flying around once we kill them so

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.800 
flying around once we kill them so
they'll<00:05:02.979> be<00:05:03.100> like<00:05:03.280> dismembered<00:05:03.880> which<00:05:04.660> is

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
they'll be like dismembered which is

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.480 
they'll be like dismembered which is
pretty<00:05:04.960> cool<00:05:05.169> so<00:05:05.410> as<00:05:05.560> you<00:05:05.680> can<00:05:05.770> see<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.190> bullet

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
pretty cool so as you can see the bullet

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.230 
pretty cool so as you can see the bullet
shells<00:05:06.850> are<00:05:07.000> just<00:05:07.150> like<00:05:07.300> lying<00:05:08.080> there<00:05:09.240> forever

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
shells are just like lying there forever

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.670 
shells are just like lying there forever
and<00:05:10.479> it's<00:05:10.600> not<00:05:10.750> really<00:05:11.020> slowing<00:05:11.289> down<00:05:11.500> the

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
and it's not really slowing down the

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.060 
and it's not really slowing down the
game<00:05:11.830> because<00:05:12.610> it's<00:05:12.880> just<00:05:12.970> drawing<00:05:13.449> one<00:05:13.630> image

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
game because it's just drawing one image

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.379 
game because it's just drawing one image
and<00:05:15.070> it<00:05:15.160> doesn't<00:05:15.400> really<00:05:15.490> matter<00:05:15.729> how<00:05:16.180> many

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
and it doesn't really matter how many

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.930 
and it doesn't really matter how many
bullets<00:05:16.630> you<00:05:16.900> shoot<00:05:17.260> it's<00:05:18.070> still<00:05:18.340> drawing<00:05:18.669> one

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
bullets you shoot it's still drawing one

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.610 
bullets you shoot it's still drawing one
sprite<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.570> it's<00:05:19.750> not<00:05:19.900> slowing<00:05:20.169> down<00:05:20.260> game

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
sprite and it's not slowing down game

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.460 
sprite and it's not slowing down game
time<00:05:21.000> so<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:25.240> actually<00:05:25.389> is<00:05:25.690> sort<00:05:25.930> of<00:05:25.960> laggy<00:05:26.229> on

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
time so it actually is sort of laggy on

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.140 
time so it actually is sort of laggy on
my<00:05:26.650> system<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.130> that's<00:05:27.340> because<00:05:27.490> i'm<00:05:27.849> running

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
my system and that's because i'm running

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.740 
my system and that's because i'm running
a<00:05:28.210> minecraft<00:05:28.660> server<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:30.460> internet<00:05:30.849> my<00:05:31.450> email

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
a minecraft server the internet my email

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.629 
a minecraft server the internet my email
and<00:05:31.900> all<00:05:32.020> these<00:05:32.410> other<00:05:32.470> applications<00:05:33.220> at<00:05:33.490> the

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
and all these other applications at the

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.520 
and all these other applications at the
same<00:05:33.820> time<00:05:33.970> so<00:05:34.330> that's<00:05:34.990> why<00:05:35.139> you're<00:05:35.289> seeing<00:05:35.440> a

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
same time so that's why you're seeing a

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.210 
same time so that's why you're seeing a
little<00:05:35.919> bit<00:05:36.039> slow<00:05:36.789> but<00:05:37.950> that's<00:05:38.950> pretty<00:05:39.130> much

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
little bit slow but that's pretty much

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.190 
little bit slow but that's pretty much
it<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:40.289> think<00:05:41.289> we<00:05:41.410> can<00:05:41.530> start<00:05:41.919> moving<00:05:42.070> on<00:05:42.400> to

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
it I think we can start moving on to

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.400 
it I think we can start moving on to
enemy<00:05:44.250> dismemberment<00:05:46.080> but<00:05:47.080> I<00:05:47.110> think<00:05:47.320> this

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
enemy dismemberment but I think this

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.140 
enemy dismemberment but I think this
will<00:05:47.530> be<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.740> end<00:05:47.889> of<00:05:47.979> this<00:05:48.099> tutorial<00:05:48.250> sorry<00:05:49.120> I
