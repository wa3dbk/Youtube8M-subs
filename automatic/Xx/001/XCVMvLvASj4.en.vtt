00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.600 
so to make the any cycle actually mood
you<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:03.870> lean<00:01:04.229> forward<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> computer

you just lean forward and the computer

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:15.080 
you just lean forward and the computer

Wow tried riding a unicycle before
unlesss<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:25.259> impossible<00:01:26.040> it's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
unlesss that's impossible it's

unlesss that's impossible it's
impossible<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.840> rate<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.320> learning<00:01:28.530> here

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
impossible the the rate of learning here

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.850 
impossible the the rate of learning here
feels<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.670> much<00:01:29.909> quicker<00:01:30.380> then<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.470> was<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
feels so much quicker then it was just a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.069 
feels so much quicker then it was just a
small<00:01:31.979> matter<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> less<00:01:33.000> oh<00:01:33.299> and

small matter of the less oh and
mastering<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> steering

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.270 

the<00:01:38.330> pedals<00:01:38.690> make<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:39.020> wheel<00:01:39.260> tilt<00:01:39.680> left<00:01:40.010> or

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the pedals make the wheel tilt left or

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.730 
the pedals make the wheel tilt left or
right<00:01:40.580> just<00:01:40.970> like<00:01:41.150> leaning<00:01:41.600> would<00:01:41.750> on<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:41.990> bike

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740

and the spring acts as a damper to make
riding<00:01:47.900> easier<00:01:48.490> okay<00:01:49.490> okay<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.780> wasn't<00:01:51.170> long

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
riding easier okay okay it wasn't long

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
mass producing any cycle I could take it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.490 
mass producing any cycle I could take it
any<00:02:33.290> way<00:02:33.790> anyone<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:35.090> learn<00:02:35.300> how<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.600> use<00:02:35.810> it

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.950 

it's<00:02:38.860> top<00:02:39.190> speed<00:02:39.370> may<00:02:39.790> only<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.240> 10<00:02:40.540> miles<00:02:40.750> an

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
it's top speed may only be 10 miles an

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.140 
it's top speed may only be 10 miles an
hour<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.710> just<00:02:42.040> doesn't<00:02:42.220> matter<00:02:42.520> cause

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
hour but that just doesn't matter cause

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.330 
hour but that just doesn't matter cause
it's<00:02:43.330> impossible<00:02:44.080> not<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.350> love<00:02:44.650> riding<00:02:45.190> it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
it's impossible not to love riding it

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.340 
it's impossible not to love riding it
and<00:02:45.580> after<00:02:46.030> nearly<00:02:46.240> exhausting<00:02:46.930> its<00:02:47.080> three

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
and after nearly exhausting its three

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.500 
and after nearly exhausting its three
hour<00:02:47.470> battery<00:02:47.950> charge<00:02:48.220> I'd<00:02:48.580> even<00:02:49.000> cracked<00:02:49.300> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
hour battery charge I'd even cracked the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.140 
hour battery charge I'd even cracked the
secret<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.170> staying<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.680> control<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.790> forget

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
secret of staying in control just forget

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.580 
secret of staying in control just forget
that<00:02:52.330> your<00:02:52.450> only<00:02:52.570> balancing<00:02:53.080> on<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.380> wheel

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
that your only balancing on one wheel

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.920 
that your only balancing on one wheel
but<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> see<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.460> can't<00:02:54.550> because<00:02:55.270> it's<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.510> much

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
but you see I can't because it's so much

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.430 
but you see I can't because it's so much
fun<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.410> defy<00:02:56.980> anybody<00:02:57.490> not<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.480> enjoy<00:02:58.900> riding

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
fun I defy anybody not to enjoy riding

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.960

one of these and now that I've mastered

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.130
