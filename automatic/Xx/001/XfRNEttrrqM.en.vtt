00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
poison actually deflected it I'm a rule

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.080 
poison actually deflected it I'm a rule
when<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.930> made<00:00:43.590> poison<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.280> lose<00:00:44.489> probably

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
when I made poison will lose probably

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.299
