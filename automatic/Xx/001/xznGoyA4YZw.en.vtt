00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
opportunity and finally hand hand combat
which<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.950> basically<00:01:11.189> martial<00:01:11.640> arts<00:01:11.820> all

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
which is basically martial arts all

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.120 
which is basically martial arts all
right<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> ultimate<00:01:13.409> self

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
right so this is like the ultimate self

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
right so this is like the ultimate self
defense<00:01:14.400> scenario<00:01:14.580> where<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.659> need

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
defense scenario where you know you need

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
defense scenario where you know you need
to<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.439> tools<00:01:16.830> available<00:01:17.009> arm<00:01:17.490> you

to have all your tools available arm you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.550 
to have all your tools available arm you
know<00:01:18.299> hopefully<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.750> civilians<00:01:19.229> will<00:01:19.350> never

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
know hopefully as civilians will never

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200 
know hopefully as civilians will never
have<00:01:19.740> experienced<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.369> type<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> event<00:01:20.759> but

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

soldiers police officers cetera you know

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.050 
soldiers police officers cetera you know
hopefully<00:01:23.280> though<00:01:23.520> they<00:01:23.729> don't<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
hopefully though they don't have the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.640 
hopefully though they don't have the
experience<00:01:24.150> either<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.439> what

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
experience either but this is what

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.630

they're trained hand on a day-to-day
basis<00:01:27.240> all<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> talk<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:29.310> h2h

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
knife sound like that you know it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.969 
knife sound like that you know it
there's<00:01:48.750> all<00:01:48.930> those<00:01:49.079> multi<00:01:49.380> levels<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
there's all those multi levels of that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
there's all those multi levels of that
so<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.390> next<00:01:51.659> level<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.110> would

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so going out to the next level I would

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
so going out to the next level I would
say<00:01:53.009> would<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.189> something<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.700> home

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
say would be something like a home

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429 
say would be something like a home
invasion<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.509> basically<00:01:54.810> scary<00:01:55.170> shit

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
invasion which basically scary shit

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.700 
invasion which basically scary shit
right<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.710> close-range

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
right so this is when a close-range

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.330 
right so this is when a close-range
weapon<00:01:58.829> such<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> gun<00:01:59.729> a<00:02:00.530> shotgun<00:02:01.530> really

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
weapon such as a gun a shotgun really

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
weapon such as a gun a shotgun really
comes<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.700> handy<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:03.149> when<00:02:03.360> you're<00:02:03.540> when

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
comes in handy know when you're when

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.990 
comes in handy know when you're when
you're<00:02:04.200> when<00:02:04.890> you're<00:02:04.979> home<00:02:05.189> alone<00:02:05.219> or<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.880> get

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
waking up all right you would let the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.650 
waking up all right you would let the

have a shot or a handgun so the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.400

drawers<00:03:19.180> under<00:03:19.840> stress<00:03:20.080> on<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.350> regular<00:03:20.680> basis

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
drawers under stress on a regular basis

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.800 
drawers under stress on a regular basis
I<00:03:21.190> mean<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.700> almost<00:03:21.880> have<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.180> treat<00:03:22.450> gun

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
I mean you almost have to treat gun

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.650 
I mean you almost have to treat gun
drawers<00:03:23.080> as<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.410> martial<00:03:23.980> art<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:25.120> think<00:03:25.360> that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
drawers as a martial art so I think that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.820 
drawers as a martial art so I think that
if<00:03:25.840> you're<00:03:25.930> going<00:03:26.020> to<00:03:26.080> carry<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.440> gun<00:03:26.590> you

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
if you're going to carry a gun you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.400 
if you're going to carry a gun you
should<00:03:27.070> be<00:03:27.190> training<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.610> but<00:03:28.270> to<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:29.230> like

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
should be training this but to it's like

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.990 
should be training this but to it's like
it's<00:03:29.590> not<00:03:29.770> as<00:03:29.980> easy<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.400> think<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.850> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
it's not as easy you think that the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.610 
it's not as easy you think that the
really<00:03:31.390> just<00:03:31.540> pull<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.930> gun<00:03:32.020> in<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.410> middle

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
really just pull out a gun in the middle
