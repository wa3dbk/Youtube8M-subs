00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.330 

for<00:00:06.660> many<00:00:06.810> years<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.319> tempo<00:00:07.770> run<00:00:07.980> has<00:00:08.309> been

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
for many years the tempo run has been

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.060 
for many years the tempo run has been
considered<00:00:09.179> as<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.450> linchpin<00:00:10.019> around<00:00:10.679> which<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
considered as a linchpin around which a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.850 
considered as a linchpin around which a
lot<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.340> top<00:00:12.090> athletes<00:00:12.630> training<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.349> done<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
lot of top athletes training is done and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.939 
lot of top athletes training is done and
tempo<00:00:14.610> running<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.420> often<00:00:15.960> ill-defined<00:00:16.289> as

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
tempo running is is often ill-defined as

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.429 
tempo running is is often ill-defined as
well<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.310> misunderstood<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
well and misunderstood because of the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.529 
well and misunderstood because of the
different<00:00:20.039> grasps<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:20.880> tempo<00:00:21.240> running

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
different grasps of what tempo running

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.509 
different grasps of what tempo running
really<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.990> tempo<00:00:22.740> running<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.130> often

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
really is tempo running is often

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.179 
really is tempo running is often
associated<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:24.330> about<00:00:24.840> 2.5<00:00:25.529> million<00:00:25.980> miles

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
associated with about 2.5 million miles

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.880 
associated with about 2.5 million miles
of<00:00:26.340> lactate<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.570> most<00:00:28.109> people<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.710> have

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
of lactate but most people don't have

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.460 
of lactate but most people don't have
access<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.699> lactate<00:00:30.449> measurement<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
access to lactate measurement and so you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.440 
access to lactate measurement and so you
have<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> base<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.369> velocity<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.120> heart

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
have to base it on velocity on heart

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.889 
have to base it on velocity on heart
rate<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.130> two<00:00:35.430> are<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> two<00:00:36.239> paces

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
rate and that the two are the two paces

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.590 
rate and that the two are the two paces
that<00:00:37.140> that's<00:00:37.440> most<00:00:37.739> associated<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.730> or<00:00:39.000> your

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that that's most associated with or your

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.110 
that that's most associated with or your
marathon<00:00:39.960> pace<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:41.280> half<00:00:41.579> marathon

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

pace<00:00:42.360> tempo<00:00:43.290> running<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.829> shorter<00:00:44.160> distances

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
pace tempo running for shorter distances

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.810 
pace tempo running for shorter distances
like<00:00:44.910> for<00:00:45.120> 10k<00:00:45.360> races<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:46.170> doing<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
like for 10k races like doing a

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.240 
like for 10k races like doing a
three-mile<00:00:47.820> run<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> six<00:00:48.809> mile<00:00:49.050> race<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
three-mile run for a six mile race that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880 
three-mile run for a six mile race that
might<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.730> too<00:00:51.120> much<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:51.809> -<00:00:52.079> higher<00:00:52.320> intensity

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
might be too much at - higher intensity

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
might be too much at - higher intensity
and<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.250> interval<00:00:53.730> training<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> better

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and then interval training is a better

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.830 
and then interval training is a better
idea<00:00:55.039> similarly<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> 5k<00:00:56.579> runner<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.480> takes

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
idea similarly for a 5k runner it takes

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
idea similarly for a 5k runner it takes
quite<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> lot<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.410> time<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.859> recover<00:00:59.250> from<00:00:59.460> say

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
quite a lot of time to recover from say

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.110 
quite a lot of time to recover from say
a<00:00:59.730> 2k<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> 3k<00:01:01.199> run<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.010> two-mile<00:01:02.640> run<00:01:02.910> if

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
a 2k or a 3k run or a two-mile run if

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850 
a 2k or a 3k run or a two-mile run if
you<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.449> you're<00:01:03.600> training<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> 5-mile<00:01:04.619> race

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
you if you're training for a 5-mile race

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.830 
you if you're training for a 5-mile race
and<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.519> might<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.880> better<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.180> doing<00:01:06.600> for

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and you might be better off doing for

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
and you might be better off doing for
hundreds<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.320> eight<00:01:07.500> hundreds<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.040> 1000<00:01:08.670> meter

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
hundreds or eight hundreds or 1000 meter

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.390 
hundreds or eight hundreds or 1000 meter
repeats<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.350> fashion<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.979> little

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
repeats in that in that fashion a little

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219 
repeats in that in that fashion a little
bit<00:01:11.640> faster<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.630> tempo<00:01:12.960> run<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
bit faster so the tempo run is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
bit faster so the tempo run is
associated<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.280> heart<00:01:14.580> marathon

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
associated more with a heart marathon

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
associated more with a heart marathon
and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.630> marathon<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.650> were<00:01:16.770> training

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and the marathon so if you were training

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
and the marathon so if you were training
for<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.340> marathon<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.880> tempo<00:01:18.330> run<00:01:18.360> might<00:01:18.750> be

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
for a marathon a tempo run might be

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.399 
for a marathon a tempo run might be
something<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.970> nine<00:01:20.970> miles<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.780> eight<00:01:22.080> miles

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
something like nine miles or eight miles

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.950 
something like nine miles or eight miles
at<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.799> marathon<00:01:23.220> pace<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.750> it's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
at your marathon pace and it's in it's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.690 
at your marathon pace and it's in it's
that<00:01:25.170> shorter<00:01:25.680> distance<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.580> are

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that shorter distance so that you are

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.450 
that shorter distance so that you are
able<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.030> recover<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.950> very

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
able to recover from that very very

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.850 
able to recover from that very very
quickly<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.119> day<00:01:30.270> after<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.170> maybe<00:01:31.530> two

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
quickly the day after or even maybe two

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
quickly the day after or even maybe two
days<00:01:32.040> off<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:33.150> able<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.479> back<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
days off that and be able to get back to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.929 
days off that and be able to get back to
easy<00:01:34.049> running<00:01:34.350> immediately<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> able

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
easy running immediately and to be able

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.490 
easy running immediately and to be able
to<00:01:36.060> get<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> quality<00:01:37.020> training<00:01:37.259> within

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to get back to quality training within

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.460 
to get back to quality training within
one<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:37.890> two<00:01:37.920> days<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:40.200> not

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
one or two days and so if you are not

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
one or two days and so if you are not
able<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.640> there's<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:42.030> ways<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
able to do that then there's two ways to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050 
able to do that then there's two ways to
go<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.380> shorter<00:01:44.189> tempo<00:01:44.579> runs<00:01:44.820> so

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
go at that is do shorter tempo runs so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.399 
go at that is do shorter tempo runs so
as<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> marathon<00:01:45.630> runner<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.899> might<00:01:45.960> only<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
as a marathon runner you might only do a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.560 
as a marathon runner you might only do a
six<00:01:46.710> mile<00:01:46.920> tempo<00:01:47.310> run<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> five<00:01:47.939> mile<00:01:48.180> tempo

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
six mile tempo run or a five mile tempo

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.170 
six mile tempo run or a five mile tempo
run<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:48.990> two<00:01:49.680> fractionalize<00:01:50.430> your<00:01:50.640> tempo<00:01:51.000> runs

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
run or two fractionalize your tempo runs

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.670 
run or two fractionalize your tempo runs
which<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.509> something<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.960> find<00:01:52.170> very<00:01:52.290> very

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
which is something I find very very

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.710 
which is something I find very very
useful<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> marathon<00:01:54.090> runner<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.689> might

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
useful so as a marathon runner you might

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.870 
useful so as a marathon runner you might
want<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> run<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.380> 15<00:01:55.860> mile<00:01:56.100> tempo<00:01:56.520> run<00:01:56.729> which

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
want to run a 15 mile tempo run which

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.550 
want to run a 15 mile tempo run which
would<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.240> ideal<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:58.140> your<00:01:58.229> marathon

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
would be ideal for your marathon

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
would be ideal for your marathon
distance<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.640> takes<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.939> lot<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.090> emotional

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
distance but it takes a lot of emotional

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.270 
distance but it takes a lot of emotional
mental<00:02:01.110> energy<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.770> takes<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.070> long<00:02:02.219> time

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
mental energy and it takes a long time

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
mental energy and it takes a long time
to<00:02:02.490> recover<00:02:02.790> from<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> might<00:02:03.990> be

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
to recover from that so you might be

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.749 
to recover from that so you might be
able<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> fractionalize<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.399> might<00:02:05.579> do

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
able to fractionalize that you might do

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.510 
able to fractionalize that you might do
something<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.240> four<00:02:06.689> or<00:02:06.960> five<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.439> five<00:02:07.770> K<00:02:08.069> or

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
something like four or five by five K or

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580 
something like four or five by five K or
three<00:02:08.849> by<00:02:09.000> five<00:02:09.270> mile<00:02:09.629> all<00:02:10.050> right<00:02:10.259> makes<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
three by five mile all right makes it a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.750 
three by five mile all right makes it a
little<00:02:10.649> easier<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.190> wrap<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.580> head<00:02:11.640> around

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
little easier to wrap your head around

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.250 
little easier to wrap your head around
with<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> short<00:02:12.480> recovery<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
with a short recovery and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.509 
with a short recovery and
maybe<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.650> minute<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.099> half<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.489> three

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
minutes in between each you get the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.619 
minutes in between each you get the
neuromuscular<00:02:17.519> benefit<00:02:17.909> of<00:02:18.030> running<00:02:18.329> at<00:02:18.450> your

neuromuscular benefit of running at your

your marathon you just want to recover

your marathon you just want to recover
in<00:02:33.360> time<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.049> maybe<00:02:34.200> three<00:02:34.560> weeks<00:02:34.769> before<00:02:34.980> two

thing<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.909> consider<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.049> you're<00:02:43.230> an

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
thing to consider is is if you're an

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.440 
thing to consider is is if you're an
Ironman<00:02:43.829> or<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:44.010> half<00:02:44.250> ironman<00:02:44.519> athlete<00:02:45.239> and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
Ironman or a half ironman athlete and

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.809 
Ironman or a half ironman athlete and
you<00:02:45.930> want<00:02:46.109> to<00:02:46.200> train<00:02:46.470> your<00:02:47.040> masculinity

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
you want to train your masculinity

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.119 
you want to train your masculinity
correctly<00:02:48.540> then<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.079> might<00:02:49.319> go<00:02:49.590> out<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.980> do

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
correctly then you might go out and do

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.789 
correctly then you might go out and do
some<00:02:50.430> tempo<00:02:50.879> runs<00:02:51.150> at<00:02:51.450> you're<00:02:52.049> off<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.590> bike

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
some tempo runs at you're off the bike

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.369 
some tempo runs at you're off the bike
pace<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:53.909> you<00:02:54.060> wouldn't<00:02:54.359> have<00:02:54.569> preloaded

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
pace but you wouldn't have preloaded

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.530 
pace but you wouldn't have preloaded
that<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.889> bike<00:02:56.129> all<00:02:56.790> right<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.120> use<00:02:57.299> two

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
that with the bike all right so use two

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.390 
that with the bike all right so use two
ways<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.870> consider<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> brick<00:02:58.950> workout

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
ways to consider that so a brick workout

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.339 
ways to consider that so a brick workout
preload<00:03:00.000> there<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.510> then<00:03:00.629> go<00:03:00.840> out<00:03:01.049> for<00:03:01.079> a

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
preload there and then go out for a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.030 
preload there and then go out for a
five-mile<00:03:02.310> run<00:03:02.519> or<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:03.180> 2x3<00:03:03.659> mile<00:03:04.109> or<00:03:04.379> even<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.769> 3

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
five-mile run or a 2x3 mile or even a 3

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
by 4 by 2 mile run something like that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.460 
by 4 by 2 mile run something like that

at your proposed race intensity but

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.140 
at your proposed race intensity but
sometimes<00:03:10.829> it's<00:03:11.040> okay<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.489> go<00:03:11.790> out<00:03:11.970> there

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
sometimes it's okay to just go out there

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.619 
sometimes it's okay to just go out there
fresh<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.959> run<00:03:13.859> a<00:03:14.190> tempo<00:03:14.790> run<00:03:14.819> at<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.420> pace

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
fresh and run a tempo run at the pace

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.390 
fresh and run a tempo run at the pace
that<00:03:15.659> you<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.349> need<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.590> run<00:03:16.859> off<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.190> bike

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
that you you need to run off the bike

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.920 
that you you need to run off the bike
for<00:03:17.639> because<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.180> lot<00:03:18.569> of<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.810> is

45 for the marathon and they might be

45 for the marathon and they might be
220<00:03:30.720> marathon<00:03:31.199> runners<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:32.220> go<00:03:32.370> out<00:03:32.549> and

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
220 marathon runners and to go out and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.479

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
do a tempo run at 220 marathon pace it's

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.009 
do a tempo run at 220 marathon pace it's
kind<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.879> risky<00:03:36.209> because<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:36.629> pretty<00:03:36.810> hard

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
kind of risky because it's pretty hard

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.050 
kind of risky because it's pretty hard
on<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.169> legs<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.650> recover<00:03:37.980> from<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.609> so

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
on the legs to recover from that and so

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.909 
on the legs to recover from that and so
what<00:03:39.239> they<00:03:39.389> might<00:03:39.629> do<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.049> they<00:03:40.199> go<00:03:40.410> go<00:03:40.739> out

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
what they might do is is they go go out

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.759 
what they might do is is they go go out
and<00:03:41.069> run<00:03:41.129> a<00:03:41.190> 240<00:03:41.819> or<00:03:41.849> 245<00:03:42.660> marathon<00:03:43.230> pace<00:03:43.470> and

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
tempo run you might want to look at

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.119 
tempo run you might want to look at

the principle of specificity you try to

exactly the pace that you're looking for

exactly the pace that you're looking for
on<00:04:16.530> race<00:04:16.739> day<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.639> remember<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.090> there<00:04:18.539> will

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
be able to run the exact pace but you

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.830 
be able to run the exact pace but you

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
in city or if you are at altitude one of

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.030 
in city or if you are at altitude one of
the<00:04:28.449> things<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.840> do<00:04:28.930> in<00:04:29.199> my<00:04:29.230> tempo<00:04:29.710> runs<00:04:29.889> at

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
the things that I do in my tempo runs at

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.980 
the things that I do in my tempo runs at
altitude<00:04:30.580> is<00:04:30.699> is<00:04:30.820> I<00:04:30.970> have<00:04:31.180> my<00:04:31.330> athletes<00:04:31.750> run

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
altitude is is I have my athletes run

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.290 
altitude is is I have my athletes run
slightly<00:04:32.530> downhill<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.940> reason<00:04:34.150> why<00:04:34.270> I

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
slightly downhill and the reason why I

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.150 
slightly downhill and the reason why I
have<00:04:34.479> them<00:04:34.630> run<00:04:34.810> downhill<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.040> they

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
have them run downhill is so that they

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.659 
have them run downhill is so that they
don't<00:04:36.310> have<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.669> cardiovascular<00:04:37.630> needs<00:04:38.669> that

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
don't have the cardiovascular needs that

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.540 
don't have the cardiovascular needs that
they<00:04:39.970> would<00:04:40.630> need<00:04:40.840> at<00:04:41.080> sea<00:04:41.350> level<00:04:41.530> alright<00:04:42.340> so

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
they would need at sea level alright so

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.980 
they would need at sea level alright so
in<00:04:42.610> other<00:04:42.699> words<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:42.970> altitude<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.540> hard<00:04:43.810> to

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
in other words that altitude is hard to

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.689 
in other words that altitude is hard to
get<00:04:44.139> sufficient<00:04:44.680> oxygen<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:45.220> be<00:04:45.340> able<00:04:45.580> to

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699

get sufficient oxygen to be able to
maintain<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.630> kind<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.960> pace<00:04:47.020> but<00:04:47.169> if

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
maintain that kind of pace but if

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.810 
maintain that kind of pace but if
they're<00:04:47.590> running<00:04:47.680> downhill<00:04:48.040> they<00:04:48.490> have<00:04:48.669> the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
they're running downhill they have the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.760 
they're running downhill they have the
advantage<00:04:49.270> of<00:04:49.389> gravity<00:04:49.600> but<00:04:50.260> they<00:04:50.410> get<00:04:50.620> the

advantage of gravity but they get the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.409 
advantage of gravity but they get the
neuromuscular<00:04:51.520> benefits<00:04:51.940> by<00:04:52.090> running

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
neuromuscular benefits by running

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.480 
neuromuscular benefits by running
downhill<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:53.380> try<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.650> next<00:04:53.979> time<00:04:54.220> with<00:04:54.370> your

workout<00:04:57.190> think<00:04:57.729> carefully<00:04:58.000> about<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.600> pace

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
workout think carefully about the pace

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.600 
workout think carefully about the pace
that<00:04:58.840> you're<00:04:59.110> going<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.440> run<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.740> at<00:04:59.889> and<00:05:00.070> use

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
that you're going to run it at and use

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.550 
that you're going to run it at and use
it<00:05:00.820> sparingly<00:05:01.090> because<00:05:01.690> it<00:05:01.840> has<00:05:02.080> got<00:05:02.350> some
