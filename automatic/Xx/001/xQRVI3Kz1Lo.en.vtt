00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.599 
sitting there I ran out of time today
and<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.710> think<00:00:19.920> I'm<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.130> gonna<00:00:20.189> drill<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> hole

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and I think I'm just gonna drill a hole

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.230 
and I think I'm just gonna drill a hole
when<00:00:20.910> bolted<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.359> um<00:00:22.910> how'd<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.000> need<00:00:24.180> to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
when bolted in um how'd you need to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.000 
when bolted in um how'd you need to
bleed<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> brakes<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> didn't<00:00:25.830> put<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
bleed the brakes so I didn't put the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.230 
bleed the brakes so I didn't put the
drive<00:00:26.189> shaft<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.609> because<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:26.910> i<00:00:27.029> put<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
drive shaft in because if i put the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.550 
drive shaft in because if i put the
drive<00:00:27.449> shaft<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.840> i'd<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.050> tempted<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.380> drive

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
drive shaft in i'd be tempted to drive

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960 
drive shaft in i'd be tempted to drive
it<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.949> since<00:00:29.160> i<00:00:29.279> need<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> bleed<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.699> brakes

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
it and since i need to bleed the brakes

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.650 
it and since i need to bleed the brakes
I<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:31.199> kind<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> huh<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.480> but<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> got

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
I was kind of huh so but I got

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.000 
I was kind of huh so but I got
everything<00:00:33.960> else<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> timing<00:00:37.320> when

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
everything else in it in the timing when

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.920 
everything else in it in the timing when
I<00:00:38.070> first<00:00:38.309> started<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:38.940> only<00:00:39.210> getting<00:00:39.390> 18

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I first started it was only getting 18

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.069 
I first started it was only getting 18
with<00:00:40.290> full<00:00:40.530> vacuum<00:00:40.770> advance<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> i<00:00:42.750> tried

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
with full vacuum advance so i tried

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.200 
with full vacuum advance so i tried
retarding<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.770> much<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:43.950> i<00:00:44.160> could<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
retarding it as much as i could but the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.119 
retarding it as much as i could but the
hose<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> heater<00:00:46.440> core<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> way

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
hose for the heater core got in the way

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.410 
hose for the heater core got in the way
so<00:00:47.190> i<00:00:47.399> had<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> pull<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> distributor<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so i had to pull the distributor and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.139 
so i had to pull the distributor and
move<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.660> over<00:00:48.750> tooth<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.410> then<00:00:50.280> re<00:00:50.730> time<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
move it over tooth and then re time the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
move it over tooth and then re time the
whole<00:00:51.239> thing<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.469> now

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
whole thing and get it good so right now

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.420 
whole thing and get it good so right now
we're<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:52.860> 18<00:00:53.280> initial<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:56.250> vacuum

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
we're at 18 initial and the vacuum

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.880 
we're at 18 initial and the vacuum
advance<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.690> ported<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> we're<00:00:58.770> at

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
advance is on the ported and we're at

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.139 
advance is on the ported and we're at
about<00:00:59.039> 900<00:00:59.399> for<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> RPM<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.940> other<00:01:02.940> than

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
about 900 for the RPM and other than

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.340 
about 900 for the RPM and other than
that<00:01:03.270> we're<00:01:03.420> good<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.660> go<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.260> figured

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that we're good to go so I just figured

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.020 
that we're good to go so I just figured
I'd<00:01:04.589> show<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.220> sounds<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.489> sounds

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
I'd show you what it sounds like sounds

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.120 
I'd show you what it sounds like sounds
good<00:01:06.180> couple<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.720> exhaust<00:01:07.049> leak<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.500> that's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
good couple of exhaust leak or that's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:23.520 
good couple of exhaust leak or that's
because<00:01:08.369> i<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.610> cheap<00:01:08.820> gaskets

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.880 

full<00:01:24.100> 18<00:01:24.820> inches<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.180> vacuum<00:01:25.560> notice<00:01:26.560> it's<00:01:26.799> not

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
full 18 inches of vacuum notice it's not

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.760 
full 18 inches of vacuum notice it's not
shuttering<00:01:27.460> or<00:01:28.000> bouncing<00:01:28.600> around<00:01:28.690> at<00:01:29.140> all<00:01:29.380> I

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
shuttering or bouncing around at all I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.600 
shuttering or bouncing around at all I
did<00:01:30.700> rebuild<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.210> Holly<00:01:31.420> it's<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:31.920> 3310<00:01:32.920> 750
