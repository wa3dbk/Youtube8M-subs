 Hello everyone, and today I want to tell 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.120
 analogs 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.179
 manfrotto pskov adapter with 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.769
 quick release pad 357 it's from 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.859
 third-party likely 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.119
 this is Chinese 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.119
 got7 621 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.460
 manfrotto vsk and i shipped but i 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.150
 acquired with a long quick release 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.660
 the ground 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.660
 this chinese man with short picking it 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.020
 adapter itself for removable pad 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.370
 there is almost no visual difference 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 not how it almost did not differ from 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.059
 manfrotto all who fuse 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.629
 latch works fine 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.360
 good reliable 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.300
 there are here additional levels you can 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.660
 control the parallelism of the earth 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.809
 here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.760
 bolt for fastening with such is convenient and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.740
 wrap for wrap with. what 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.210
 more sites in size 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.830
 long and shorter which supplies with 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.320
 Whether they produced any third-party 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.320
 what is the difference only in length in width 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:32.010
 Morozovskaya perfectly sits on it 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.680
 it sits down great NATO 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.200
 pad if at cost manfrotto 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.060
 I was bought in Ukraine together 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.690
 delivery cost not 450 hryvnia here 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.690
 this adapter 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:58.090
 was on ebay it costs there $ 35 and 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.259
 here is this adapter without quick-detachable 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.000
 the site is worth 25 dollars that is it 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.740
 62 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.740
 taking into account the delivery that is actually it 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.450
 good enough budget solution to 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.190
 problems when you need your idea 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.470
 camera quickly transfer one with 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.140
 tripod on stadicam 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.239
 or on the slider were bought by me for 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.820
 In order not to change before used 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.150
 in the ban Omsk tripod principle now 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.130
 I use it well, that's such a quick-detachable 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.989
 the playground is not very convenient for 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.190
 in order not to buy and new count and 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.569
 out buying new 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.719
 new head on the slider and 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.439
 do not change the quick-release pad to 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:52.549
 steadicam and I demanded these all 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:55.249
 there is enough space for it 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.540
 budget at the same time very good 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:02.209
 option for such a solution here 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.769
 when you update your 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.879
 equipment at the same time do not want 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:13.209
 spend a lot of money on it thanks for 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.209
 View and all until new meetings
