00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
hi I'm Tom and we just got done doing

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.780 
hi I'm Tom and we just got done doing
the<00:00:06.600> grading<00:00:06.839> here<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:08.189> retaining<00:00:08.519> wall

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
the grading here and the retaining wall

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.610 
the grading here and the retaining wall
so<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.540> talked<00:00:09.809> about<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.139> broken<00:00:10.290> concrete

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
so we talked about the broken concrete

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.680 
so we talked about the broken concrete
earlier<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> walls<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.000> all<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> soil

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
earlier on the walls and all the soil

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.560 
earlier on the walls and all the soil
was<00:00:12.929> actually<00:00:13.519> transferred<00:00:14.519> from<00:00:15.389> other

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
was actually transferred from other

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.240 
was actually transferred from other
areas<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.230> garden<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.859> made<00:00:17.100> these

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
areas in the garden and we made these

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.890 
areas in the garden and we made these
berms<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.970> privacy<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.890> also<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
berms for privacy and also to use the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.359 
berms for privacy and also to use the
solo<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.470> don't<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> dump<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
solo so we don't have to dump it at the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
solo so we don't have to dump it at the
dump<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.269> basically<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:24.990> we're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.289> do

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
dump so basically what we're going to do

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.400 
dump so basically what we're going to do
here<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.800> put<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.480> fender<00:00:27.480> board<00:00:27.720> plastic

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
here we put the fender board plastic

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.580 
here we put the fender board plastic
fender<00:00:28.619> board<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.310> side<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:31.170> gravel

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
fender board on the side of the gravel

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.979 
fender board on the side of the gravel
pathway<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.700> laid<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.630> string

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
pathway we laid it out with a string

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
pathway we laid it out with a string
line<00:00:34.200> first<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.670> put<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> bender

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
line first and then we put the bender

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.080 
line first and then we put the bender
board<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> stakes<00:00:37.770> about<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> inch

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
board in you put the stakes about a inch

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.150 
board in you put the stakes about a inch
below<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> top<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> bender<00:00:40.710> board<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.070> you

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
below the top of the bender board so you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.100 
below the top of the bender board so you
can't<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> stakes<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> fender<00:00:42.840> board

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
can't see the stakes so the fender board

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.459 
can't see the stakes so the fender board
basically<00:00:43.820> is<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:46.430> recycled<00:00:47.430> rubber<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
basically is this recycled rubber and

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.410 
basically is this recycled rubber and
it's<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.190> stakes<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.670> an<00:00:50.760> inch<00:00:50.940> below<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> top

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's the stakes or an inch below the top

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
it's the stakes or an inch below the top
so<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.140> by<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> time<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.800> put<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> dirt<00:00:53.340> in

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
so but by the time we put the dirt in

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
so but by the time we put the dirt in
the<00:00:53.610> mulch<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.809> gone<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.590> don't<00:00:55.770> see

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the mulch it's all gone you don't see

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.950 
the mulch it's all gone you don't see
anything<00:00:56.129> except<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.850> edge<00:00:57.090> now<00:00:57.750> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
anything except for this edge now this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
anything except for this edge now this

you<00:01:37.290> put<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.530> more<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:37.860> two<00:01:38.040> inches<00:01:38.220> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you put it more than two inches you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
you put it more than two inches you
squish<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> gravels<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> doesn't

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
squish in the gravels and it doesn't
feel<00:01:40.619> good<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> keep<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.700> minimum

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
feel good so you want to keep it minimum

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.109 
feel good so you want to keep it minimum
an<00:01:42.509> inch

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
an inch

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.859 
an inch
maximum<00:01:43.810> two<00:01:43.990> inches<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:46.479> enough<00:01:46.720> to

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
maximum two inches and that's enough to

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.210 
maximum two inches and that's enough to
cover<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.200> wheat<00:01:47.380> mat<00:01:47.560> but<00:01:47.740> not<00:01:47.920> too<00:01:48.100> much

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
cover the wheat mat but not too much

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.580 
cover the wheat mat but not too much
they<00:01:48.460> don't<00:01:48.579> swish<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.210> anyway<00:01:50.079> so<00:01:50.110> that's<00:01:50.439> an

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
they don't swish it anyway so that's an

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.590 
they don't swish it anyway so that's an
easy<00:01:50.740> way<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.009> do<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.280> gravel<00:01:51.789> walkway<00:01:52.180> which<00:01:52.420> is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
easy way to do a gravel walkway which is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.020 
easy way to do a gravel walkway which is
not<00:01:53.140> only<00:01:53.439> great<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.549> environment

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
not only great for the environment

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.660 
not only great for the environment
