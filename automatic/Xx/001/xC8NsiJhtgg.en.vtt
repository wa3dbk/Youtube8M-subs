00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.039 
pretty easy for us just to take that
apart<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.030> now<00:01:57.299> you'll<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.840> be

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
apart and do that so now you'll just be

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.170 
apart and do that so now you'll just be
able<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> take<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:58.740> controller<00:01:59.130> board<00:01:59.490> take

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
able to take your controller board take

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.319 
able to take your controller board take
it<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.310> set<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:02.640> down<00:02:02.700> into

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
it like so and set it back down into

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.959 
it like so and set it back down into
your<00:02:04.110> controller<00:02:04.560> shell<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> then<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:05.939> ahead

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
your controller shell and then go ahead

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.210 
your controller shell and then go ahead
and<00:02:06.270> snap<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.780> back<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.350> you'll<00:02:07.590> feel<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> snap

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and snap it back on you'll feel the snap

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
and snap it back on you'll feel the snap
