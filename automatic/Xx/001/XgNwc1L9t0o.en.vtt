you<00:04:39.410> can<00:04:39.560> just<00:04:39.590> do<00:04:39.860> this<00:04:39.980> on<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.190> fly<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.730> just

you can just do this on the fly so just

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.420 
you can just do this on the fly so just
pick<00:04:41.810> whichever<00:04:42.080> gun<00:04:42.380> that<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.650> want<00:04:42.920> get

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.380 
player for red LED and all you need to
do<00:04:49.700> is<00:04:49.730> use<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.750> left<00:04:51.020> trigger<00:04:51.710> for<00:04:52.370> going<00:04:53.180> up

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
do is use the left trigger for going up

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.810 
do is use the left trigger for going up
and<00:04:53.600> speed<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.140> use<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.980> right<00:04:55.130> trigger<00:04:55.400> to

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
and speed and use the right trigger to

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.990 
and speed and use the right trigger to
test<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.630> speed<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:57.830> right<00:04:58.280> now<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.580> started

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
test that speed so right now it started

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
get to whatever speed that we want let's

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.820 
get to whatever speed that we want let's
say<00:05:15.470> that's<00:05:16.130> good<00:05:16.520> tested<00:05:17.120> it<00:05:17.240> perfect<00:05:17.900> tap

the sync button now we're ready to go
it's<00:05:23.180> modded<00:05:23.690> set<00:05:24.590> to<00:05:24.800> that<00:05:24.950> speed<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:26.110> that's

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
it's modded set to that speed so that's

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.690 
it's modded set to that speed so that's
pretty<00:05:27.320> much<00:05:27.440> it<00:05:27.500> everything<00:05:28.280> that<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:28.520> see
