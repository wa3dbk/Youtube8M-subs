00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.610
 Why do you make you have the light in your heart? 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:20.100
 Not even when turned off medical bills and hurt the clothes, and yet hate 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.240
 It does not have a cup, so you have a chance to get another chance

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.330
 Buy rice 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.600
 It's really hard to pay my grief. 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 Ah 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.570
 I also have a delicious and wonderful test . 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.270
 I 'm doing it. 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.270
 It's cold on the cold day 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:06.080
 You do not need to tell me where to place it. 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.009
 Please do not go buy me one example of 5 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.600

 Thank you. You'll be happy. Yes. 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.490
 If the patient is co 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.359
 Oh, what do you have at that, why are you the same person who used to keep frequently yisujeong 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.370
 I do not do it without you . 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:45.510
 For the former judge hasyeotdaguyo 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.030
 But now I'm talking about that . 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.260
 If a lady like a lecturer continued the judge 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.909
 I think there's a lot of bad people out there. 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.260
 There's no warmth. 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.760
 Indeyo shape and correct mistaken for something a judge and a keen judge 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.209
 It is a job 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.370
 Not at all, but at least you have to understand people. 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:12.239
 At least on a benchmark that person is not worth the help . 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.010
 Because I did not live very hard, 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.030
 There are a lot of people on the floor. 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.670
 iot Does not accept the way I lived hard, robust himself in some ways 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.740
 He's a very happy person. 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.710
 I see that if you try, 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.890
 I do not want to argue anymore. 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.520
 U 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.400
 Anyway, people who have different viewpoints need to talk to each other. 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.940
 Yes, without Bob or even more 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.940
 I'm hungry. 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:51.200
 I never thought people like aquatic seeds would use that great compassion . 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:55.610
 Still it's unfair to talk about it You're really persistent. So it seems unfair machi 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.860
 Mr. yisujeong right eojjeom like was hoping robust conclusions as I have heard say jeossi 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.300
 I could have used it 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:07.290
 But still okay okay I haneunge 9 people out of 10 people per day majesty 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:12.210
 Even I'm using him and said okay this is imperative 2,000 won 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:17.450
 The Joshu study is a person who can not even struggle to live hard . 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.450
 The last choice is someone who can not afford to sell it. 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:27.760
 It's not just the money that anybody can discard 2,000 won or 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:31.690
 So far I have not had enough money to buy a vending machine coffee . 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.840
 Nani ttansori not eat four to sell coffee at the coffee shop once a week 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.819
 I bought it. 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.900
 But minutes earlier that if 2,000 won a desperate man when I rejected the rest 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:46.160
 You're trampling on hope. 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:49.360
 It is now happened this description still make bad ride per person salrijago Oh destiny 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.360
 It's not right. 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.010
 Cause you're everything happens on both sides of the coin 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.050
 You can live your own life . 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.050
