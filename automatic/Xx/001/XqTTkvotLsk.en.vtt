00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.880
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:08.849
 It is participation 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:14.490
 Today's cookware here 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:19.520
 We want mounting this that over of a different place 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.520
 So why did you decide to do so ? 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.630
 Well the appearance is not so good, isn't it? 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.680
 Well then 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.980
 Yesterday night Kana Yesterday night 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.310
 It's this I fell in when is it is 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:44.860
 The noise is loud 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:48.450
 After all I just do it usually with a suction cup so I just do it 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.850
 Little by little they come in. The air is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.289
 In yesterday 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:03.539
 I bought it for the first time since I fell, but I fell for the first time, but I still fell after all 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:08.590
 I think so I think that the number of times it falls will increase as the 9th becomes old from now on 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:14.649
 In new places before falling again and again 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:19.500
 I think that it is better to attach the side, and here is a diy installation diy 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.500
 I would like to post 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.150
 So this time 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.810

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:39.869
 Kana pronunciation good in this bracket plastic kit is a plastic packet 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:44.200
 Like this , it is attached to the wall in an L-shape. 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.810
 It can also be done to put the board on top like this 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.020
 It means 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.370
 Please look here 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.370
 Screw 8 minutes a month 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:58.909
 Will it lucky I also the beginning of the year this maybe perhaps it is in this 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.170
 Over there in a plastic open in this 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.550
 I think they are there 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.580
 I bought Brown and I bought two Bran . 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.850
 With that 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.020
 Here 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.569
 It is a Paris stick 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.230
 Use this 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.150
 Where to put on this time 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.150
 Here's the refrigerator 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:29.930
 The wall of this part 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:31.930
 I'd like to attach my prey to the nine sides at once because here is vacant 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.170
 So the positional relationship is 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.220
 On that side 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.220
 It's like that 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.770
 Yes 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.120
 I have attached a bracket here 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.209
 8 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.770
 But this cat face I on the screw is four (4) there is a place to stop the total fermentation with one screw 4 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.250
 Already 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.130
 I was tired with these two 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.540
 Two more already 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.410
 Because it is firm 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.310
 2 Tsude is nice I 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:13.370
 I'm tired and I thought I was here but 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:17.640
 I'm tired because I think there is a hard place so I shouldn't open it a bit 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.630
 We stopped in two by two in the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.370
 And then 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.569
 Here 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.770
 Stick to 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.140
 can enter 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.110
 Here in Is that not a this design to crying Claire 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.400
 Sometimes buy 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.470
 here 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.590
 I checked to see if I could get into the lock and bought it 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.800
 It turns out that super enters 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.680
 Here 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.330
 The 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.470
 Hmm 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.100
 Well 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.400
 I a whistle 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.400
 Doing Tei 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.390
 I wonder if Okitsu 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.420
 Hmm 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.900
 Yes 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.770
 In this way we were able two shops 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.550
 Here in 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:18.440
 I want to hang on here 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.530
 Here also I'd put the s-shaped hook to 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.430
 this 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.040
 8 The hook I used there 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.360
 It is this but this 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.110
 Horror 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.449
 There was this 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.500
 This hook is thinner than this stick 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:42.200
 Enter this way of handling 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.689
 That's right, this is usually meho 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:50.409
 I can not take it 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:53.079
 I was keen on earning with confidence in my hands , I thought I was not going to enter one kind, but I was keen on 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.289
 There are four buildings here 

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:57.300
 tj 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.900
 From here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:07.129
 Put the s-shaped hook and put it in this 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:12.709
 When taken or that this is Somehow your ball, which we were able to see the 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.459
 I think that I wonder if was good to reverse since it will not say I fell Oh I fell for each hook 

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:18.700
 I will 

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:24.689
 It looks like this 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:27.990
 What quite cramped feeling so it had been arranged in all this a row to Kano now 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:30.150
 It is this time but I think that was 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.310
 Thus in two columns 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.330
 Thanks to you 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.860
 I can see it now 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:43.710
 When 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:48.930
 Because I have to screw in that special skill here 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:52.770
 Kedomo I'm a little neck is much lest not open sleep a hole 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:59.590

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:05.110
 Also I'm often one and do not hit the nail I'd say you were disease where Tteyuu 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.889
 There is a place I am borrowing 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.100
 Is the thumbtack ok 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:13.300
 Stem 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.800
 It's ok to sell it, but when you leave this room 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.430
 It is said that you will get money when you leave the room 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.430
 Welcome 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.660
 I'm troubled, but I'm too nervous and I already have a neck 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:32.480
 Sold 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:34.470
 It is not that it is the nail by all means because there is also the place of ng 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.530
 I think it is difficult 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:41.529
 I'd tried to Tsu Na or stopped in that thumbtack that's It was impossible disease the needle is too short 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.339
 The 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:47.880
 I'm going to move soon so this is iron because of the weight of this 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:51.780
