00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240

of course this was a custom unit for
them

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.470 

ok

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.340 

I<00:01:20.570> got<00:01:21.260> adjustable<00:01:22.250> straps<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.910> back<00:01:23.350> silk

I got adjustable straps in the back silk

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.690 
I got adjustable straps in the back silk
top<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.880> look<00:01:26.570> it's<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.650> closed<00:01:28.010> silk<00:01:28.430> top

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
top and look it's a closed silk top

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.170 
top and look it's a closed silk top
which<00:01:29.120> is<00:01:29.150> great<00:01:32.560> some<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.770> them<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:34.040> get<00:01:34.340> are<00:01:34.850> so

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
which is great some of them I get are so

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.500 
which is great some of them I get are so
far<00:01:35.510> back<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.370> it<00:01:37.370> really<00:01:37.670> makes<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.300> line

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
far back that it really makes the line

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.620 
far back that it really makes the line
of<00:01:38.750> demarcation<00:01:41.800> visible<00:01:42.800> I<00:01:43.300> think<00:01:44.300> when<00:01:44.450> it's

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
of demarcation visible I think when it's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.240 
of demarcation visible I think when it's
close<00:01:44.870> to<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.110> front<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:45.650> can<00:01:45.680> hide<00:01:46.070> it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
close to the front you can hide it

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.070 
close to the front you can hide it
better<00:01:47.860> but

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.370 

can<00:01:52.980> I<00:01:53.130> show<00:01:53.370> this

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.040 

now

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.380 

this<00:02:02.650> isn't<00:02:03.040> actually<00:02:03.250> like<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:03.940> one<00:02:04.150> that's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
this isn't actually like the one that's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.040 
this isn't actually like the one that's
on<00:02:04.540> their<00:02:04.750> website<00:02:09.150> but<00:02:10.150> I<00:02:10.420> took<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.869> anyway

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
on their website but I took it anyway

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.890 
on their website but I took it anyway
because<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:12.280> was<00:02:12.490> like<00:02:12.670> I'll<00:02:12.970> try<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.480> make<00:02:13.870> it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.340 
because I was like I'll try to make it
work<00:02:14.640> even<00:02:15.640> though<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.090> they<00:02:16.570> got<00:02:16.780> my<00:02:16.990> order

texture<00:04:10.320> is<00:04:10.560> supposed<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.220> be<00:04:11.510> like<00:04:12.510> yeah<00:04:12.780> key

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
texture is supposed to be like yeah key

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.570 
texture is supposed to be like yeah key
and<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:15.420> really<00:04:15.690> feels<00:04:16.080> more<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.580> silky

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
and it really feels more like silky

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.030 
and it really feels more like silky
straight

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.380 

but<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.150> don't<00:04:22.690> mind<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:23.290> because<00:04:24.390> sometimes

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
but I don't mind that because sometimes

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.140 
but I don't mind that because sometimes
you<00:04:25.810> get<00:04:26.020> ya<00:04:26.320> key<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.770> it's<00:04:26.950> 22<00:04:28.320> course<00:04:30.150> to

you get ya key and it's 22 course to

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.500 
you get ya key and it's 22 course to
thicken<00:04:31.710> all<00:04:32.710> right<00:04:32.890> well<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:36.090> guess<00:04:37.090> this<00:04:37.300> is

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
thicken all right well I guess this is

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.120 
thicken all right well I guess this is

isn't exactly what I order but this is

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.810 
isn't exactly what I order but this is
like<00:05:10.990> odeon<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:14.250> anyway<00:05:15.250> this<00:05:15.520> is<00:05:15.790> my

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
like odeon so anyway this is my

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.360 
like odeon so anyway this is my
show-and-tell<00:05:18.000> four-wicket<00:05:19.000> lace<00:05:19.270> wigs<00:05:20.370> I'll

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
show-and-tell four-wicket lace wigs I'll

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.470 
show-and-tell four-wicket lace wigs I'll
leave<00:05:21.640> their<00:05:21.850> information<00:05:22.360> down<00:05:22.840> below<00:05:23.550> and

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.270 

later<00:05:28.480> on<00:05:28.690> I'll<00:05:28.870> probably<00:05:29.080> do<00:05:29.350> an<00:05:29.470> update<00:05:29.830> if<00:05:30.100> I

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
later on I'll probably do an update if I

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.600 
later on I'll probably do an update if I
actually<00:05:30.490> wear<00:05:31.420> it<00:05:31.570> for<00:05:31.750> any<00:05:31.900> period<00:05:32.140> of<00:05:32.290> time

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
actually wear it for any period of time

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.980 
actually wear it for any period of time
this<00:05:33.610> is<00:05:33.820> definitely<00:05:34.030> something<00:05:34.630> I'm<00:05:34.840> not

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
this is definitely something I'm not

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.320 
this is definitely something I'm not
going<00:05:35.200> to<00:05:35.290> be<00:05:35.350> wearing<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:35.740> work<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.940> I<00:05:40.060> think

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
going to be wearing to work and I think

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.230 
going to be wearing to work and I think
this<00:05:40.480> was<00:05:40.780> 22<00:05:41.470> inches<00:05:41.860> so<00:05:42.670> it's<00:05:42.880> extremely

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
this was 22 inches so it's extremely

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.350 
this was 22 inches so it's extremely
long<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:45.580> this<00:05:45.790> is<00:05:45.970> like<00:05:46.180> some<00:05:46.510> divalicious

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
long so this is like some divalicious

00:05:48.360 --> 00:06:00.200 
long so this is like some divalicious
party<00:05:49.360> hair<00:05:50.430> well<00:05:51.430> see<00:05:51.820> ya

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.270
