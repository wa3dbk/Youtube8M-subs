00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.450 
few times to not noticed I think it was
only<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> third<00:01:49.649> time<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> came

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
only the third time or so that I came

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.740 
only the third time or so that I came
here<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.000> finally<00:01:51.240> figured<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.600> was

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
here that I finally figured I was

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.450 
here that I finally figured I was
which<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.440> pretty<00:01:53.619> useful<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.070> by<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.280> time

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
which is pretty useful so by the time

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.460 
which is pretty useful so by the time
that<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.760> get<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.030> gun<00:01:55.299> you<00:01:55.720> don't<00:01:55.840> have<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> club

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
that you get a gun you don't have a club

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.230 
that you get a gun you don't have a club
you<00:01:56.799> actually<00:01:57.040> have<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.430> device<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.090> again

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
you actually have a device it again

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.990 
you actually have a device it again
fired<00:01:58.510> bullets<00:01:58.840> from<00:01:59.100> which<00:02:00.100> tends<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.880> be

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
fired bullets from which tends to be

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.210 
fired bullets from which tends to be
rare<00:02:01.210> in<00:02:01.810> act<00:02:02.110> 1<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:02.710> by<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.920> time<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.159> get

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
rare in act 1 so by the time you get

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.980 
rare in act 1 so by the time you get
back<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.549> or<00:02:03.759> find<00:02:04.270> your<00:02:04.360> first<00:02:04.479> pistol<00:02:04.659> you'll

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
back to or find your first pistol you'll

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.140 
back to or find your first pistol you'll
be<00:02:05.110> all<00:02:05.170> set<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.640> skip<00:02:06.850> forward<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.060> little

be all set and I skip forward a little

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.880 
be all set and I skip forward a little
bit<00:02:07.240> just<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.659> say<00:02:07.869> sometime<00:02:08.200> but<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:08.800> is

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
bit just to say sometime but this is

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.949

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.620 
school because as I'm sure you know that
the<00:02:15.610> last<00:02:15.730> thing<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.000> want<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.300> getting

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
the last thing you want is getting

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.320 
the last thing you want is getting
ganked<00:02:17.110> by<00:02:17.260> some<00:02:17.560> zombies<00:02:17.860> like<00:02:18.010> group<00:02:18.330> back

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
ganked by some zombies like group back

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.949 
ganked by some zombies like group back
is<00:02:19.480> turned

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
is turned

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.990 
is turned
and<00:02:20.739> actually<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.459> think<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.819> more

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
and actually the I think the more

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.270 
and actually the I think the more
dangerous<00:02:22.450> Dombey<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.930> actually<00:02:23.290> that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
dangerous Dombey is actually that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.860 
dangerous Dombey is actually that
infected<00:02:24.700> because<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> rate<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.390> speed<00:02:25.570> at

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
infected because of the rate of speed at

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.930 
infected because of the rate of speed at
which<00:02:25.959> they<00:02:26.110> tied<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:27.040> walkers<00:02:27.400> take<00:02:27.790> forever

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
which they tied the walkers take forever

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.729 
which they tied the walkers take forever
to<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> could<00:02:28.840> probably<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.650> know

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739
