that's<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:07.310> fairly<00:01:08.310> larger<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.970> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that's going to be fairly larger so it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.179 
that's going to be fairly larger so it
doesn't<00:01:09.299> rub<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:09.720> feet<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.770> wrong<00:01:10.950> way

you don't get blisters otherwise
something<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:15.840> decent

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
something like this can be pretty decent

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.609 
something like this can be pretty decent
for<00:01:16.740> swimming<00:01:17.610> anyways<00:01:18.420> enough<00:01:19.259> about<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
for swimming anyways enough about the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.940 
for swimming anyways enough about the
fins<00:01:20.420> these<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.780> almost<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.290> must<00:01:22.560> because

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
fins these are almost a must because

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.950 
fins these are almost a must because
they<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.520> allow<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.090> swim<00:01:24.750> longer<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
they will allow you to swim longer and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.590 
they will allow you to swim longer and
strengthen<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.140> legs<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.650> said<00:01:28.860> before

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
strengthen your legs like I said before

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.999 
strengthen your legs like I said before
typically<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> would<00:01:31.049> start<00:01:31.590> out<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.860> you're

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
typically I would start out if you're

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.950 
typically I would start out if you're
starting<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.430> swimming<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.030> would<00:01:33.509> use<00:01:33.780> these

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
starting out swimming I would use these

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.469 
starting out swimming I would use these
fins<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:35.250> most<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.759> workout<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
fins for most of the workout if you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.520 
fins for most of the workout if you
however<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.020> feel<00:01:37.259> comfortable<00:01:37.909> I<00:01:39.530> would

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
however you feel comfortable I would

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.249 
however you feel comfortable I would
start<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.040> doing<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.759> backstroke<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
start out doing just backstroke with the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.819 
start out doing just backstroke with the
fins<00:01:43.820> anywhere<00:01:44.820> between<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.810> hundred<00:01:46.500> meters

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
fins anywhere between a hundred meters

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.770 
fins anywhere between a hundred meters
to<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:47.399> hundred<00:01:47.700> meters<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.240> starting<00:01:48.630> out

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to two hundred meters for starting out

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.149 
to two hundred meters for starting out
on<00:01:49.590> backstroke

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.870 

there<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.609> go<00:01:55.759> these<00:01:55.969> about<00:01:56.329> it<00:02:00.579> next<00:02:01.579> on<00:02:01.759> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
there you go these about it next on the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.160 
there you go these about it next on the
list<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:02.359> have<00:02:03.490> these<00:02:04.490> are<00:02:04.700> called<00:02:05.049> these<00:02:06.049> are

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
list we have these are called these are

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.510 
list we have these are called these are
kind<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:06.500> your<00:02:06.590> hybrid<00:02:07.039> these<00:02:07.250> are<00:02:07.369> like

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
kind of like your hybrid these are like

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.140 
kind of like your hybrid these are like
paddles<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:09.080> gonna<00:02:09.229> be<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.500> little<00:02:09.739> bit

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
paddles it's gonna be a little bit

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.000 
paddles it's gonna be a little bit
different<00:02:11.150> though<00:02:11.330> if<00:02:12.140> they're<00:02:12.319> plastic<00:02:12.890> or

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
different though if they're plastic or

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.949 
different though if they're plastic or
the<00:02:13.129> hard<00:02:13.400> they're<00:02:14.060> gonna<00:02:14.150> fit<00:02:14.480> over<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.750> hand

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
the hard they're gonna fit over the hand

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.250 
the hard they're gonna fit over the hand
like<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.180> these<00:02:17.180> are<00:02:17.390> just<00:02:17.480> soft<00:02:17.810> they're<00:02:18.049> kind

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
like so these are just soft they're kind

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.660 
like so these are just soft they're kind
of<00:02:18.290> like<00:02:18.470> gloves<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:18.980> they<00:02:19.129> go<00:02:19.310> over<00:02:19.549> your
