00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.950
 We think we have to go to the Olpe Poll to Return to the Olpe 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.639
 still fight against the descent after all, the Zwickau are third you have to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.490
 Imagine you think it is all paletti the president stays 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.400
 but there is the downer of the playmaker's hand so gloomy on the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.470
 injured last matchday last Sunday 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.740
 Fibula fracture precipitates for a long time who now takes over his role 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.740
 Andreas Bosbach the passenger door the answer 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.859
 It was Sven Günther who was deported today with the situation in Pakistan 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.820
 the job of a playmaker, however, had coach detrimental to 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.800
 several shoulders 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.760
 The captain saw it with gypsum in the middle of the 7600 spectators of the double 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.200
 He was still lying at least for the rest of the year 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.940
 but even without a filter at the FSV year already won for example against Bochum 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.740
 and also against Unterhaching 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.340
 from beginning to 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.340
 Schreiber missed borrowed 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.970
 Bayern had to get out of the immediate embrace of the hosts 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.200
 Initially not to solve second chance forgot this time 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.380
 after nearly twenty minutes of play then way first attack of the guests 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.500
 a free kick 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.110
 he is skilfully extended twice by Rade Bacon to Markus 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.469
 Oberleitner Dead a little effort to score the goal 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.659
 Minute to 1 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.950
 Leadership against it 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.090
 completely surprising 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 at this moment 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.670
 the answer of the Saxons they asked themselves with even more vigor with the Ascom 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.310
 Despair to the fore Kamprad 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.920
 Zwickau's highest virtue 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.700
 his so far immaculate home record of 8 wins they have achieved 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 and that should eventually have existed 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.700
 they did not give the opponent time to breathe 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.270
 The ball was distracted, Jörg Kirstein was distracted by the 1 2 1 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.300
 football world again straightened 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.860
 through his seventh goal of the season 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 everything was up again at halftime 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.909
 Brunner wanted to and had to be stopped by percent as well 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.800
 then of course this Gegentores Appliances can settle and the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.950
 Oberhausen 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.899
 Boards percent express people were made at the top or bottom gate 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.849
 and we will be at 19 cents a minute 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.760
 second half of the picture you can but the Bayern laid meanwhile little 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.329
 with a compact and disciplined 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.989
 Schneider tries better 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.149
 with a distance shot 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.289
 less compact against the fsv-defensive the Sachsenspiegel 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.379
 forgot to have that one 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.999
 defend sometimes » 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.159
 second attack 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.099
 second goal for Unterhaching 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.099
 by Stefan Reich more effective 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.359
 the opposite of effectively unfortunately the Zwickauer attack efforts chances 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.289
 there was still to buy 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:44.160
 transform 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.709
 today are none 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.409
 another example ten minutes before the final whistle 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.230
 Norbert Wittmann is lying on the ground he warned Jack people the pattern is 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.290
 also be 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.980
 Of course, there was also 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.709
 Scolding of the finds 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.600
 Zwickaus we far anyway we know but at least a draw 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.190
 that would have been highly deserved but the Saxons messed up until the final whistle 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.239
 very best chances 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.629
 He actually wanted enough chances to win this game Helen 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.720
 Waldron also did not identify themselves 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.769
 Obama will now be investigated 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.139
 everything has an end only the sausage has two 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.889
 against Unterhaching Zwickau loses the first home game 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.909
 this one 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.349
 Of course this has an effect on the table, but first we want the 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.510
 See results of this matchday the seventeenth Leipzig against Jena 2 to 0 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.809
 Zwickau Unterhachings one to two 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.949
 harder against Wattenscheid 1 2 2 had already led with 1 0 then 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.249
 still the defeat already yesterday Hannover Bielefeld 0 to 1 and Bochum 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.279
 against Mainz three to zero 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:50.279
 the table at Bochum so clear leader Leipzig now in place 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:52.599
 three Zwickau slips to five 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.869
 Jena is seventh and the Chemnitzer they let this is a sport
