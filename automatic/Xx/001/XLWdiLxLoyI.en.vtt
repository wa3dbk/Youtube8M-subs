00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
you can see there that's one more screw

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.279 
you can see there that's one more screw
I've<00:00:50.329> taken<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.930> screw<00:00:51.230> out<00:00:51.379> first<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:53.360> under

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
I've taken the screw out first and under

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.830 
I've taken the screw out first and under
here<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:55.039> can<00:00:55.219> see<00:00:55.460> we<00:00:55.610> have<00:00:55.789> one<00:00:56.090> screw<00:00:56.780> on

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
here you can see we have one screw on

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.549 
here you can see we have one screw on
this<00:00:57.050> side<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.820> other<00:00:58.850> screw<00:00:59.559> because

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
this side and the other screw because

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.849 
this side and the other screw because
all<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:01.010> 13<00:01:01.460> screws<00:01:01.940> are<00:01:02.120> out<00:01:02.359> and<00:01:02.870> as<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.710> can

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
all the 13 screws are out and as you can

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:12.010 
all the 13 screws are out and as you can
see<00:01:07.360> they<00:01:08.360> are<00:01:08.390> different<00:01:08.990> lengths<00:01:09.470> but<00:01:11.020> the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
see they are different lengths but the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.130 
see they are different lengths but the
longer<00:01:12.560> ones<00:01:12.740> all<00:01:13.100> go<00:01:13.940> at<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.149> bottom<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.929> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
longer ones all go at the bottom of the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.149 
longer ones all go at the bottom of the
r7<00:01:15.950> nearest<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.640> hinge<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:18.590> have<00:01:18.740> longer

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
r7 nearest the hinge so we have longer

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.640 
r7 nearest the hinge so we have longer
screws<00:01:19.520> here<00:01:20.180> here<00:01:20.780> here<00:01:21.200> here<00:01:22.299> here<00:01:23.299> here

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
screws here here here here here here

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.690 
screws here here here here here here
here<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:24.799> here

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
here and here

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.690 
here and here
those<00:01:26.570> are<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.840> longer<00:01:27.350> screws<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.009> the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
those are the longer screws and the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.289 
those are the longer screws and the
shorter<00:01:29.060> screws<00:01:29.240> just<00:01:29.630> go<00:01:30.140> up<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.350> top<00:01:31.299> near

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
shorter screws just go up the top near

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.749 
shorter screws just go up the top near
the<00:01:32.450> speakers<00:01:32.720> with<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.409> screws<00:01:33.680> off<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.520> as

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
the speakers with the screws off it's as

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.600 
the speakers with the screws off it's as
simple<00:01:34.939> as<00:01:35.270> just<00:01:35.630> lifting<00:01:36.619> off<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:36.829> backplate

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
simple as just lifting off the backplate

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:48.190 
simple as just lifting off the backplate
that's<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.380> we're<00:01:42.380> inside<00:01:46.600> my<00:01:47.600> model<00:01:48.020> is

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
that's it and we're inside my model is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.830 
that's it and we're inside my model is
the<00:01:48.759> r7<00:01:49.759> v<00:01:50.240> 7<00:01:50.720> 1g<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.880> see<00:01:56.119> it's<00:01:56.270> got<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
the r7 v 7 1g you can see it's got the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.300 
the r7 v 7 1g you can see it's got the
hard<00:01:57.229> drives<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.890> mSATA<00:01:58.750> over<00:01:59.750> here<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.310> if

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
hard drives the mSATA over here and if

you want to upgrade the RAM in your

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.270 
you want to upgrade the RAM in your
computer<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.689> RAM<00:02:06.049> slot<00:02:06.409> here<00:02:06.680> you

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
computer this is the RAM slot here you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.039 
computer this is the RAM slot here you
can<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.610> put<00:02:07.820> more<00:02:08.000> memory<00:02:08.360> in<00:02:08.390> its<00:02:08.630> long<00:02:08.810> to

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
can just put more memory in its long to

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.220 
can just put more memory in its long to
replace<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.679> 2.5<00:02:10.459> inch<00:02:10.519> hard<00:02:11.000> drive<00:02:11.269> with<00:02:12.049> an

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
replace the 2.5 inch hard drive with an

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.740 
replace the 2.5 inch hard drive with an
SSD<00:02:12.500> perhaps<00:02:13.010> it's<00:02:13.400> as<00:02:14.030> simple<00:02:14.150> as<00:02:14.390> removing

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
SSD perhaps it's as simple as removing

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.080 
SSD perhaps it's as simple as removing
the<00:02:15.049> screws<00:02:15.410> let's<00:02:15.739> attach<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
the screws let's attach it to the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.319 
the screws let's attach it to the
computer<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.890> here's<00:02:19.100> one<00:02:19.370> screw<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:22.329> the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
computer so here's one screw and the

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.720 
computer so here's one screw and the
other<00:02:23.480> screw<00:02:23.840> they<00:02:24.769> just<00:02:25.010> had<00:02:25.160> two<00:02:25.340> screws<00:02:25.579> on

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
other screw they just had two screws on

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.780 
other screw they just had two screws on
my<00:02:25.910> one<00:02:26.120> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
my one and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.339 
my one and
then<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:28.590> will<00:02:28.739> lift<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.930> comes<00:02:31.170> out

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
then that will lift out that comes out

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.759 
then that will lift out that comes out
it<00:02:31.650> should<00:02:31.859> be<00:02:31.980> quite<00:02:32.219> easy<00:02:32.549> let's<00:02:33.239> see<00:02:33.769> it's

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
it should be quite easy let's see it's

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.509 
it should be quite easy let's see it's
easier<00:02:35.069> with<00:02:35.189> two<00:02:35.370> hands<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.790> course<00:02:37.519> that

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
easier with two hands of course that

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.849 
easier with two hands of course that
you'll<00:02:39.209> just<00:02:39.359> wiggle<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.049> oh<00:02:40.260> there<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.739> go

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
you'll just wiggle out oh there we go

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.709 
you'll just wiggle out oh there we go
okay<00:02:41.310> I'm<00:02:41.430> back<00:02:41.609> from<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.939> store<00:02:42.209> I've<00:02:42.420> picked
