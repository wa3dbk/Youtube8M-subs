00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.710

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.190

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.660
 entertainment that happened yesterday and that 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.139
 will cover for many months 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 surely and it is the fight that happened between 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.150
 luis fonsi and adamari lopez two of the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.660
 most reserved personalities of his life 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.720
 private 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 the most sheltered and the least 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.369
 is spoken then that's why it has turned out 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.019
 so controversial and so surprising 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.500
 for all journalists and their fans 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.630
 that all of a sudden it starts then what does not 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 it seems worthy of them everything started 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.460
 when adamari lopez as you will remember 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.489
 spoke with Maria Celeste arrarÃ¡s del rojo 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.800
 live where he confesses that luis fonsi 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 he was unfaithful and while they were married 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.420
 evidently 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.960
 and not only that but you said you no longer 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.320
 I wish as a woman 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.360
 ended the relationship with her by 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.890
 phone without me understanding the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.590
 reasons why it was what's what 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.449
 it happened then this was the week 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.159
 Last but yesterday, Luis Fonsi took a 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.530
 letter in the newspaper a new day of 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.390
 puerto rico a very long letter where 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.420
 says this is the first and last time 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.090
 I'm going to talk about the subject and say this is a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.970
 lie this is a personal attack of 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 Adamari lopez towards me who has nothing 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.840
 what to do with the reality that we live 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.420
 you believe that adamari lopez would have 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.640
 need to invent him that luis fonsi 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.369
 it was unfaithful that it ended with her 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.649
 phone that told you I do not want you anymore 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.119
 woman so that so I would have to 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.509
 invent the maria yesterday when I saw 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.940
 face to face and the truth in his eyes 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.710
 the transparency in his eyes was more than 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.320
 obvious she let out a tear and also confessed 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.270
 that went to therapy that for many 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.369
 years all this was saved and therefore not 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.009
 had spoken that you better see 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.770
 the response of loving and lopez in 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.790
 Terra.com cameras that have not been read 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.090
 the book 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.610
 is the only thing I could say that in the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.210
 book is all the beautiful things that 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.369
 we live and the processes by which 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.670
 we passed to get ahead of the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.340
 disease 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.459
 and many beautiful things that we passed as 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 He also talks about the hard moments that 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.450
 it touched us 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.670
 it touched us 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:32.430
 when he asks me for a divorce 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.379
 and since I do not understand the reason 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.840
 I can not force anyone to be to me 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.109
 side if you do not want me but there were many 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.390
 things that happened that I did not understand and 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.960
 what 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.150
 and that caused a lot of pain because of the way 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.209
 and also in those that passed in which 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.420
 they gave 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:56.090
 and if I see your letter what I can understand 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.370
 is that he let himself be carried by headlines 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.920
 I can talk to you about what I 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.629
 I speak in the book that I hold and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.489
 that I affirm because it is what we live 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.489
 because it's the truth of what happened 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.100
 and I talked about it at the time when I 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.360
 I could process and understand for myself other 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.360
 people have the ability to 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.280
 go through your moments much faster 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.940
 It did not happen to me, I needed my 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.300
 time to detach myself from what I felt 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.090
 to be able to understand it in order to heal and 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.750
 to be able to move forward and that's why 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.750
 I speak so far
