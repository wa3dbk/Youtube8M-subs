Thor and I think his little helmet is so
cute<00:01:46.910> so<00:01:47.680> there<00:01:48.680> we<00:01:48.770> go<00:01:48.970> then<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.090> have<00:01:50.270> Black

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
cute so there we go then I have Black

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.670 
cute so there we go then I have Black
Widow<00:01:54.160> Hawkeye<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.729> in<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.960> comics<00:01:57.410> his

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
Widow Hawkeye and in the comics his

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.790 
Widow Hawkeye and in the comics his
costume<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.370> kind<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.820> purple<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.690> that's<00:02:00.650> the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
costume is kind of purple so that's the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.260 
costume is kind of purple so that's the
reasoning<00:02:01.070> why<00:02:01.190> this<00:02:01.340> cupcake<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.880> purple
