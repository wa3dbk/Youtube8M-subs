00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.480
 I understood that you will lose coma 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.100
 diagnosed visiting doctors 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.460
 experienced clinical death turned 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.900
 Alexandrov completely different person 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.950
 the surprise of those around him opened 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.950
 new talents

 Muscovite Velimir 1985 fought in 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.030
 Afghanistan, one November day became 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.040
 for him the fateful day that paramedic 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.050
 Melnikov, as usual, tied up his 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.600
 wounded comrades at the medical station and 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.070
 unexpectedly hit mortars 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.050
 the fragments took over my attacked chan 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.590
 I got a blast wave 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.100
 clinical death as assured later 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.300
 come to our rescue later 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.660
 the captain of her service will begin after a brief 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:07.770
 he said that you were somewhere around 78 minutes 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.429

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.160
 tragedy 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.989
 turned into an incredible gift for him 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.120
 of fate 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.239
 soon the millers discovered in themselves rare 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.239
 abilities 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.470
 it happens very rarely 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.960
 exception to all rules first 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.600
 accident serious brain injury 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.330
 and after a while the unexpected 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.890
 turning a man's fate like 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.760
 opens it and which is hidden what 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.760
 for rations 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.420
 but 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.770
 in early 2007 in one of the defense 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.300
 US Department Discussed 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.820
 military together with scientists discussed 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.920
 the possibility of surprise chips in the brain 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.140
 soldiers to raise their level 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.300
 opportunities supporters of this program 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.760
 assured that science already knows enough about 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.460
 tom as well as the last section 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.590
 decades called brain decades 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.900
 the bravest of scientists claims that 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.060
 it's time instead of the ancient call 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.160
 know yourself put before 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.160
 a new task to create yourself 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.770
 first talked about this and a half 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.480
 centuries ago in 1848 unhappy 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.640
 a case on the railroad produced 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.410
 real furor 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.300
 neurophysiology uk worker 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.520
 find great seriously hurt by 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.650
 accidental explosion not and steel bar 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.350
 went through his brain 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.200
 scientists were amazed gage not only 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.900
 survived but preserved intelligence however 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.260
 more striking was another fact of his 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.720
 first recorded science as a result 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.350
 this terrible gage injury is very 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.290
 to change 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.380
 they used to know him as a kindly gentle man 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.200
 even to female pleasers after being wounded he 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.340
 became stubbornly rude and hated the weak 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.700
 Gender Scientists have vigorously debated this case. 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.890
 if the brain is the very person of the person means 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.710
 in our power to change that person 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.530
 talked about it what could not lord 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.890
 can make science destroy at everyone 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.950
 vices and weaknesses add to any mind and 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.190
 nobility 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.190
 for this you need only to penetrate the brain 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.630
 human brain is on one side 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.240
 there are a lot of nerve cells 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.520
 billions of nerve cells and the second is 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.150
 a huge number of links between these 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.400
 cells 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.340
 Now if you take the total fiber length 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.230
 that bind diane cells 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.210
 seven or eight times must be back 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.750
 one person in one suit in the heart 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.740
 session the complexity of this network 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.720
 Svyatoslav Medvedev directs 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.240
 studies of complex mental 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.310
 brain functions in the works of remembrance and 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:05.670
 emotions exploring the super alive 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.950
 man is not only the nerve cells but 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.080
 and constantly working system we are so 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.080
 here is the interaction between the willows 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.639
 still aristotle in the fourth century before our 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.410
 era found in his talented people 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.230
 time a certain inclination 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.490
 a painful state of the brain they 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.770
 suffered from depression 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.100
 mania addictions and even 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.530
 schizophrenia modern scientists have amassed 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.230
 enough information confirming the fact 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.620
 prominent people have brain disease 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.270
 are more common than usual 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.970
 however, scientists believe that the disease can 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.970
 just ignite the creative energy
