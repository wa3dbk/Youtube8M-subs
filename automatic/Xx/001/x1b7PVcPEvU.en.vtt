I'm going to show you how to draw a
cartoon<00:00:12.219> slice<00:00:12.969> of<00:00:13.210> watermelon<00:00:13.450> so<00:00:14.230> first<00:00:14.650> up

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
cartoon slice of watermelon so first up

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:27.070 
cartoon slice of watermelon so first up
what<00:00:14.889> we<00:00:15.040> do<00:00:15.190> is<00:00:16.090> we<00:00:16.270> draw<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.450> circle

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.170 

and<00:00:27.500> then<00:00:27.740> we<00:00:27.830> just<00:00:27.950> take<00:00:28.070> a<00:00:28.130> line<00:00:28.430> probably

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
and then we just take a line probably

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.830 
and then we just take a line probably
about<00:00:29.740> two-thirds<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.850> way<00:00:32.780> up

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
about two-thirds of the way up

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.870 
about two-thirds of the way up
just<00:00:35.840> bring<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.290> across<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.710> air<00:00:36.830> and<00:00:37.250> then<00:00:37.820> we

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
just bring it across the air and then we

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.510 
just bring it across the air and then we
draw<00:00:38.059> another<00:00:38.450> circle<00:00:41.800> just<00:00:42.800> copy<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:43.280> well

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
draw another circle just copy it well

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.060 
draw another circle just copy it well
half<00:00:44.360> a<00:00:44.510> sack<00:00:44.660> really<00:00:44.960> just<00:00:45.170> inside<00:00:46.040> that

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
half a sack really just inside that

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.280 
half a sack really just inside that
first<00:00:47.140> first<00:00:48.140> circle<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.830> then<00:00:49.519> another<00:00:49.820> one

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
first first circle and then another one

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.110 
first first circle and then another one
just<00:00:51.290> slightly<00:00:51.500> close<00:00:51.830> to<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.129> air<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:53.090> that

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
just slightly close to the air to that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:03.250 
just slightly close to the air to that
second<00:00:55.059> second<00:00:56.059> line

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.990 

let's<00:01:03.560> bring<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:03.950> out<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.100> little<00:01:04.280> bit<00:01:04.430> further

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
let's bring it out a little bit further

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.230 
let's bring it out a little bit further
yeah<00:01:07.450> then<00:01:08.450> we<00:01:08.510> draw<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.990> little<00:01:09.620> oval<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.880> then

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
yeah then we draw a little oval and then

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.840 
yeah then we draw a little oval and then
another<00:01:11.600> little<00:01:11.840> over<00:01:12.260> for<00:01:12.470> an<00:01:12.560> eye<00:01:12.760> with<00:01:13.760> a

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
another little over for an eye with a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.080 
another little over for an eye with a
circle<00:01:14.210> for<00:01:14.360> highlight<00:01:15.490> then<00:01:16.490> another<00:01:16.729> circle

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
circle for highlight then another circle

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.960 
circle for highlight then another circle
for<00:01:17.240> highlight<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.460> then<00:01:19.460> we<00:01:19.550> draw<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.729> half

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
for highlight and then we draw a half

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.020 
for highlight and then we draw a half
circle<00:01:20.000> for<00:01:20.660> a<00:01:20.690> mouth<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:21.340> little<00:01:22.340> circle<00:01:22.850> for<00:01:23.000> a

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
circle for a mouth a little circle for a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.640 
circle for a mouth a little circle for a
cheek<00:01:23.210> there<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.720> then<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.900> little<00:01:24.050> circle<00:01:24.500> for

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
cheek there and then a little circle for

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.890 
cheek there and then a little circle for
a<00:01:24.710> cheek<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:25.009> that<00:01:25.190> side<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.970> then<00:01:26.660> for<00:01:26.810> the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
a cheek on that side and then for the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
a cheek on that side and then for the
seeds<00:01:27.700> perps<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:29.119> are<00:01:29.360> just<00:01:30.320> or<00:01:30.560> another

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
seeds perps we are just or another

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.870 
seeds perps we are just or another
circle<00:01:32.440> as<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.500> guide<00:01:33.860> another<00:01:34.250> half<00:01:34.430> circle<00:01:34.790> as

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
circle as a guide another half circle as

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.060 
circle as a guide another half circle as
a<00:01:34.970> guide<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.360> air<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.780> let<00:01:36.590> me<00:01:36.649> just<00:01:36.680> draw<00:01:36.979> a

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
a guide the air and let me just draw a

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.480 
a guide the air and let me just draw a
little<00:01:37.160> teardrop<00:01:37.789> shape<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:38.539> one<00:01:40.119> two<00:01:41.119> three

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
little teardrop shape so one two three

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:52.529 
little teardrop shape so one two three
four<00:01:45.700> five<00:01:47.289> six<00:01:48.910> seven<00:01:50.410> just<00:01:51.410> along<00:01:51.680> there

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
four five six seven just along there

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.700 
four five six seven just along there
then<00:01:53.539> what<00:01:53.660> we<00:01:53.780> do<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:53.960> we<00:01:54.259> just<00:01:54.289> grab<00:01:54.590> our

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
then what we do is we just grab our

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.320 
then what we do is we just grab our
black<00:01:54.950> pins<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:55.429> go<00:01:55.490> back<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.119> can<00:01:56.240> the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
black pins and go back in it and can the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:27.630 
black pins and go back in it and can the
pencil<00:01:56.660> lines

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.400 

then<00:02:28.240> we<00:02:28.300> just<00:02:28.450> go<00:02:28.600> back<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.170> double<00:02:29.350> up

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
then we just go back in and double up

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.840 
then we just go back in and double up
the<00:02:29.440> thickness<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> main<00:02:30.250> parts<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
the thickness of the main parts of the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.220 
the thickness of the main parts of the
illustration<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.510> make<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.870> look<00:02:31.990> even<00:02:32.110> more

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
illustration to make it look even more

00:02:32.230 --> 00:03:03.150 
illustration to make it look even more
cartoony

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.530 

then<00:03:03.730> we<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:03.910> wait<00:03:04.060> for<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.270> ink<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> dry

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.460 

then<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.600> just<00:03:07.720> go<00:03:07.840> back<00:03:08.020> in<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.230> rub<00:03:08.350> out<00:03:08.410> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
then we just go back in and rub out the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:24.750 
then we just go back in and rub out the
pencil<00:03:08.830> lines

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.149 

so<00:03:25.629> there<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.870> have<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.319> cartoon<00:03:26.560> slice<00:03:26.980> of

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
so there you have it a cartoon slice of

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.900 
so there you have it a cartoon slice of
watermelon<00:03:27.690> happy<00:03:28.690> drawing
