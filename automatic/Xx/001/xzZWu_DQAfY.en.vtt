00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 there is god there is evidence of the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.620
 existence of god comments your 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.920
 experience on this subject in the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.559
 description of the video response exists 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.619
 God, I find it interesting that 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.840
 so much attention to this debate the last 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.730
 surveys tell us that about 90 per 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.070
 a hundred of the people in the world today 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.279
 believe in the existence of god or in some 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.560
 higher power however somehow 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.750
 the responsibility is placed on 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 those who believe that god exists 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.910
 to somehow approve that he in 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
 reality exists I personally think 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.290
 that the responsibility lies with the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.360
 who do not believe however the existence 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.090
 of God can not be proven or 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.640
 denied even the bible says that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.489
 we should accept by faith the fact of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.160
 that god exists but without faith is impossible 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.050
 please God because it is necessary that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.090
 whoever approaches God believes that there is 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.610
 and that he is awarded of those who 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.280
 they look for Hebrews 11 yes 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.739
 if God wanted it that way simply 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.350
 could appear and prove to everyone 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.170
 that he exists but if he did not 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.730
 there would be a need for faith jesus told him 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.310
 because you have seen me 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.690
 you believed blessed those who did not 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.240
 they saw and believed hwan 2029 however 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.330
 that does not mean that there is no evidence of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.940
 the existence of god the bible declares 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.890
 the heavens tell the glory of God and 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.250
 the firmament announces the work of its 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.410
 hands one day issues word to another day and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.830
 one night to another night declares wisdom 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.310
 there is no language or words or is heard 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.320
 his voice throughout the earth came out his voice and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.330
 to the end of the world his words 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.550
 Psalm 19 14 by looking at the stars at 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.140
 understand the immensity of the universe at 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.930
 observe the wonders of nature 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.420
 Seeing the beauty of the sunset 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.649
 we see that all of them point towards a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.970
 creator god if this was not enough 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.159
 there is also evidence of god in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.489
 our own hearts 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.500
 Ecclesiastes 311 tells us and has put 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.660
 eternity in the hearts of men 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.849
 there is something deep in our being 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.950
 which recognizes that there is something beyond 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.500
 this life and someone beyond this 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.690
 intellectually we can deny 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.790
 this knowledge but the presence of 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.450
 God in us and through us 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.430
 It is still there despite all this 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.739
 bible warns us that there is still 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.830
 some who deny the existence of god 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:40.200
 says the fool in his heart there is no god 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.269
 psalms 14 1 because over 98% of 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.489
 people through history 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.829
 all cultures in all 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.440
 civilizations on all continents 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.620
 believe in the existence of some kind of 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.680
 there must be something or someone who causes 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.599
 this belief in addition to the arguments 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.930
 biblical for the existence of god there are 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.569
 logical arguments first we have the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.060
 ontological argument the most 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.220
 popular of the ontological argument usa 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.280
 basically the concept of god for 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.940
 prove its existence this begins with 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.340
 the define 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.370
 of God like that from which it can not be 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.260
 conceived a bigger one then it 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.390
 maintains that existing is greater than not 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.210
 exist and therefore the greatest being 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.700
 conceivable must exist if god does not 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.860
 existed then god would not be the greatest 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.160
 be conceivable but that would go to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.950
 contradict the very definition of god 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.140
 the second is the theological argument the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.360
 theological argument says that since 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.670
 the universe displays such a wonderful 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.670
 design must have been a designer 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.070
 divine for example even if the earth 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.620
 I was a few hundred miles 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.960
 closer or farther from the sun it would not be 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.330
 able to maintain much of life that 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.580
 currently does it if the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.380
 elements in our atmosphere were 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.930
 different still in a small percentage 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.140
 every living thing on earth 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.940
 would die the probabilities of a simple 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.250
 protein molecule formed by 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.530
 chance is 1 the 10 raised to the 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.750
 power 243 that is 10 followed by 243 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.910
 zeros 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.100
 a simple cell consists of millions of 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.200
 a third protein molecules 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.970
 logical argument for the existence of 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.940
 god is the so-called argument 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.700
 cosmological each effect must have a 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.370
 cause this universe and everything in it 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.670
 there is an effect there must be something that 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.220
 It caused all there eventually must 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.270
 have something without reason in order to provoke 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.240
 that everything else exists that unreason is 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.910
 God a fourth argument is known 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.890
 as the moral argument every culture to 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.740
 through history has had some 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.770
 all have a sense of law 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.260
 the right thing and the wrong the murder the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.590
 lie theft and immorality are 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.510
 almost universally rejected from where 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.810
 came that sense of right and what 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.120
 wrong but a god holy despite 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.460
 all this the bible tells us that the 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.680
 people will reject knowledge 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.580
 clear and undeniable of God and instead of 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.950
 do you believe a Roman lie 125 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.729
 declares since they changed the truth of 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.830
 God for the lie honoring 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.080
 and worshiping the creatures before 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.169
 to the creator who is blessed by the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.270
 centuries amen the bible also proclaims 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.219
 that people have no excuse for not 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.559
 believe in God because things 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.990
 invisible of him his eternal power and 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.999
 deity are clearly visible 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.129
 since the creation of the world being 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:44.669
 understood by means of things done 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:47.580
 so they have no Roman excuse 120 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.749
 people demand not to believe in God because 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.059
 It is not scientific or because there is no evidence 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:56.339
 the real reason is that once the 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.990
 people admit that there is a god too 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.360
 they must realize that they are 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.379
 responsible towards god and who are 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:08.550
 in need of his Roman pardon 3 23 and 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:10.919
 8 23 if god exists then we are 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.279
 responsible for our actions towards 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.139
 he if god does not exist then we can 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:19.080
 do what we want without having to 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.300
 worry about God judging us I think 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.399
 that is the reason why many in 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.039
 this society are so strongly 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.449
 clinging to evolution to give to the 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.240
 people an alternative to 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.099
 in a god creator god there is already the 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.860
 long everyone knows that he exists 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:37.349
 the very fact that some try 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.330
 so aggressively refute its existence 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.879
 is in fact an argument for your 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.909
 existence allow me to give one last 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:47.610
 argument for the existence of god 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:49.680
 As I know there is a god, I know that God 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.710
 it exists because I talk to him all the 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.770
 days I do not hear him speaking to me with a voice 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.710
 audible but I feel its presence I feel 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.110
 Your guide I know your love I desire your grace 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.120
 things have happened in my life that do not 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.539
 they have another possible explanation without 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.979
 hates god has saved me so 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.930
 miraculously and has changed my life that 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:12.599
 I can not help but recognize and praise his 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.180
 none of these arguments exist 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.939
 in themselves they can persuade someone that 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.219
 refuses to recognize what is so clear to the 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:23.689
 final the existence of god must be 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:26.029
 accepted by Hebrew faith 11 6 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:28.639
 and faith in God is not a blind leap to 

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:31.069
 the darkness this is a sure step to 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:34.299

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:37.219
