and some burn surgery and and the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.300 
and some burn surgery and and the
surgeons<00:01:13.440> would<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.620> very<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.070> tired

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
surgeons would be very very tired

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
surgeons would be very very tired
obviously<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.940> I'd<00:01:15.000> give<00:01:15.210> them<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> different

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
obviously so I'd give them a different

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.540 
obviously so I'd give them a different
sampled<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.770> come<00:01:17.010> back<00:01:17.160> that's<00:01:17.460> it

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
sampled and that come back that's it

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.400 
sampled and that come back that's it
doesn't<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.150> much<00:01:18.300> there's<00:01:18.720> nonsense<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
doesn't do much there's nonsense for the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.660 
doesn't do much there's nonsense for the
menses<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.190> hogwash<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
menses and that you know hogwash and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
menses and that you know hogwash and
quackery<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.840> they're<00:01:21.990> fine<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.650> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
quackery so they're fine and and I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
quackery so they're fine and and I
formulated<00:01:23.580> again<00:01:23.910> and<00:01:24.119> eventually<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.570> found

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
formulated again and eventually I found

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.150 
formulated again and eventually I found
a<00:01:24.960> few<00:01:25.080> combinations<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.740> I'll<00:01:25.890> give<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
a few combinations that I'll give it to

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.590 
a few combinations that I'll give it to
someone<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.580> drink<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.210> I've<00:01:27.300> come<00:01:27.450> back

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
someone that drink it and I've come back

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.880 
someone that drink it and I've come back
and<00:01:27.660> I<00:01:27.810> said<00:01:27.930> oh<00:01:28.080> that's<00:01:28.260> great<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.740> did<00:01:28.830> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and I said oh that's great what did you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.590 
and I said oh that's great what did you
put<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.520> working<00:01:29.880> I'm<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.330> fire

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
put in there this is working I'm on fire

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.830 
put in there this is working I'm on fire
so<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.740> my<00:01:31.860> R&amp;B<00:01:32.340> sort<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> backstage<00:01:33.180> even

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
so I bit my R&amp;B sort of backstage even

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.999 
so I bit my R&amp;B sort of backstage even
before<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.500> concept<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:34.979> really

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
before that the concept was really

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
before that the concept was really
important<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.790> product<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.840> first<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.440> got

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
important to a product and first we got

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
important to a product and first we got
to<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> very<00:01:37.979> exact<00:01:38.310> science<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.790> what<00:01:39.060> formulas

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
to a very exact science of what formulas

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.780 
to a very exact science of what formulas
are<00:01:39.660> working<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.140> aren't<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
are working what aren't and and then it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
are working what aren't and and then it
comes<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.030> challenge<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> taste<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.140> is

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
comes a challenge of taste so this is

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.990 
comes a challenge of taste so this is
where<00:01:43.440> we<00:01:43.560> used<00:01:43.800> a<00:01:44.190> good<00:01:44.399> blend<00:01:44.580> house<00:01:44.759> called

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
where we used a good blend house called

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.160 
where we used a good blend house called
a<00:01:45.090> free<00:01:45.240> clinic<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.660> we<00:01:45.750> went<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> them<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a free clinic and we went to them and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.510 
a free clinic and we went to them and
say<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.369> make

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
say this is what we want in it you make

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.120 
say this is what we want in it you make

this<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.329> difficult<00:03:27.599> answer<00:03:28.109> I've<00:03:28.680> always

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
this is a difficult answer I've always

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.860 
this is a difficult answer I've always
bought<00:03:29.159> that<00:03:29.340> for<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.970> environment<00:03:30.750> of

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
bought that for the environment of

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.390 
bought that for the environment of
believing<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.439> do<00:03:31.500> anything<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.099> nothing

believing I can do anything so nothing

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.250 
believing I can do anything so nothing
is<00:03:32.459> impossible<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.569> had<00:03:33.689> a<00:03:33.720> good<00:03:33.870> idea<00:03:33.989> I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
is impossible and I had a good idea I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.929 
is impossible and I had a good idea I
liked<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.889> decided<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.730> way<00:03:35.909> to

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
liked it I decided it's a way to

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.149 
liked it I decided it's a way to
actually<00:03:36.450> benefit<00:03:36.930> many<00:03:37.139> people<00:03:37.290> many<00:03:37.769> messes
