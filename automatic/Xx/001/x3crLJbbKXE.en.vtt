mention that as well as this one too so
very<00:02:11.520> cool<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.450> getting<00:02:12.720> onto<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.989> review

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
very cool so getting onto the review

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.530 
very cool so getting onto the review
after<00:02:13.980> using<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:14.580> several<00:02:14.910> days<00:02:15.270> I

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
after using this for several days I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.930 
after using this for several days I
really<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.709> it's<00:02:16.860> exceeding<00:02:17.850> my

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
really like it it's exceeding my

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.920 
really like it it's exceeding my
expectations<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:19.650> speed<00:02:20.430> wise<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.569> loading

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
expectations in speed wise as in loading

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.699 
expectations in speed wise as in loading
time<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:23.190> uses<00:02:23.580> USB<00:02:23.910> 2.0<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.170> that's<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
time it uses USB 2.0 so that's the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.900 
time it uses USB 2.0 so that's the
fastest<00:02:26.130> speed<00:02:26.760> it'll<00:02:26.940> go<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.660> not<00:02:27.900> 3.0<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
fastest speed it'll go it's not 3.0 and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.670 
fastest speed it'll go it's not 3.0 and
so<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.420> mention<00:02:30.630> some<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.200> features

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
so just to mention some of the features

so just to mention some of the features
that<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.890> liked<00:02:32.220> about<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.670> product<00:02:33.230> before

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that I liked about this product before

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.140

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
we go there I want to mention the cons

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.449 
we go there I want to mention the cons
about<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.739> features<00:02:38.370> you

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
about it so one of the features you

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.040 
about it so one of the features you
showed<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.880> boxes<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.660> see<00:02:39.870> that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
showed on the boxes you can see that

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.590 
showed on the boxes you can see that
there<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.560> rubber<00:02:41.069> lining<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:42.060> here<00:02:42.420> and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
there is a rubber lining on here and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.560 
there is a rubber lining on here and
what<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.560> supposedly<00:02:44.280> does<00:02:44.550> is<00:02:44.819> prevent<00:02:45.390> it

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
what that supposedly does is prevent it

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.330 
what that supposedly does is prevent it
from<00:02:45.600> skidding<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.410> your<00:02:46.650> table<00:02:47.070> when<00:02:47.190> you're

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
from skidding on your table when you're

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.060 
from skidding on your table when you're
plugging<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.269> media<00:02:48.690> card<00:02:48.930> reader<00:02:49.070> now

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
plugging in your media card reader now

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.930 
plugging in your media card reader now
as<00:02:51.110> using<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.200> for<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.440> few<00:02:52.769> times<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.370> found

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
as using this for a few times I found

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.240 
as using this for a few times I found
out<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.330> doesn't<00:02:54.510> really<00:02:54.630> work<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.800> see

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
out it doesn't really work so if you see

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.150 
out it doesn't really work so if you see
if<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.519> take<00:02:56.820> my<00:02:57.030> finger<00:02:57.110> if<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:58.410> push<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.980> it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
if I take my finger if I just push it it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.050 
if I take my finger if I just push it it
moves<00:02:59.760> very<00:03:00.239> easily<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:02.310> was<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> con<00:03:02.790> for

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
moves very easily so that was a con for

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.360 
moves very easily so that was a con for
one<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.739> was<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.920> only<00:03:05.040> con<00:03:05.340> I

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
one I think that was the only con I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.880 
one I think that was the only con I
found<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.180> product<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.260> getting<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
it on its backside and it will prevent

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.449 
it on its backside and it will prevent
dust<00:03:24.209> from<00:03:24.360> getting<00:03:24.510> into<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.200> ports<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.860> it

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
dust from getting into the ports and it

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.880 
dust from getting into the ports and it
does<00:03:26.640> not<00:03:26.790> scratch<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.660> surface<00:03:27.930> here<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:28.530> it

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
does not scratch the surface here so it

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.699 
does not scratch the surface here so it
still<00:03:29.130> keeps<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:29.549> gloss<00:03:29.820> finish<00:03:30.299> as<00:03:30.540> well<00:03:30.709> as

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
driver yet and that is removable so this

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.769
