00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.970
 and a youtube camera and friends from 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.910
 mexico of the world as they are here 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.070
 commenting on a video and how they see today 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.860
 we're in minecraft and we started with a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.500
 tiny pixel art there from the america 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.700
 to see and so many of us are going to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 hate when they see this but I do not 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.910
 it matters and it's worth 1.7 update today 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.740
 point 3 Friday July 13 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.350
 we already have two pistons as you see here 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.600
 Pistons and piston adhesive is worth what 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.859
 primerito today is going to be a tutorial of 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.370
 how to make an automatic watering can with 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.219
 cameras 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.890
 and well this is good this will be your 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.210
 shower then they would take and they said 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.550
 good ok we open and we have our 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.829
 not water and good since we always left 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.809
 It is very cool because nothing else 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.649
 only thing we have to do is to 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.450
 agÃ¼ita save this close and it will 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.730
 the experiment 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.860
 or invented as they want to call it and then 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.980
 This circuit is not very complicated 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.980
 true 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.930
 and let's go let's go there not first that 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.580
 nothing like the pistons are worth going 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.820
 to urge pebble 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.720
 we're going to need bullion planks 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.460
 of iron and reddish stone ok we 're going 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.080
 to the mechanisms section and the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.710
 mechanism we are going to find the pistons 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.420
 now we raise pistons is worth it since 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.390
 we have our pistons to make the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.700
 adhesives we will need is line 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.550
 bowls that was what it was called but 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.610
 right now it's called disgusting little ball 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.050
 disgusting and good with one of these and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.180
 assess the mechanisms and already having 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.220
 created our normal pistons come on 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.140
 down and we will be able to do 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.270
 piston sticky vale 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 then it is worth now if we start our 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 tutorial that we are going to need 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.369
 we're going to need a piston of the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:04.049
 normal a cube of water reddish stone 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.200
 a lever a 64 of anything 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.709
 Well, what are you going to do? 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.140
 Glass bathtub and repeaters in case 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.930
 will come to need in case we are 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.049
 will finish the energy 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.000
 then we start with a three by three 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:25.700
 it is worth reinforcing this we will go 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.980
 rising little by little first three others 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.219
 three more up three first ones worth 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.680
 we already have three in this let's leave 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.810
 These two are good, we do not leave well 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.730
 we grab our piston and put it on 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.099
 looking towards us so we 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.050
 we can see it as you see it 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:48.210
 ok then this one we're going to leave like this 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.210
 here we continue up 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.860
 up 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.610
 and it's worth it until we have 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.380
 ready this then the only thing that we 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.070
 will miss is to upload one more so that 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.130
 remain five of height is worth we go down and 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.210
 as you see, we have infringing 1234 good 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.730
 66 tall with 6 tall with that going 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.820
 to be worth then now what 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:23.020
 we have to do is here in this up 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:24.970
 put one put another one better and here one 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.040
 so that nothing else remains here 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.900
 empty that when nothing else has to 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.030
 to be empty the one that they have to be 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.800
 here next to the piston ok or is this us 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.470
 it has to be empty so that it is 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.480
 open track ok ok since we have 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.270
 we only cover this and height 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.940
 here we leave two or three according to your 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.500
 as they like your bathtub criteria which 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.870
 let's cover little by little 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.560
 it's okay until we're left here alone 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.530
 little box no minutes 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.700
 that continues after this is worth here 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.170
 to be two deep and in this 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.209
 we put a crystal and we went out on 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.860
 crystal serves to stop the water worth 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.470
 that is not that we do not spread towards 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.840
 here or to her well just left a 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.360
 hen worth 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.980
 then one in depth crystal two 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.990
 of depth and a crystal for 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.990
 to make sure our water does not go away 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:26.639
 it is worth then now although in our 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:31.259
 circuit that would be a 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.360
 like ladder so to speak is worth a 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.710
 ladder that takes us straight up 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.529
 where is the piston we do not dictate 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.800
 small box and we began to give our 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.569
 circuit is worth then here is going to have 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.580
 that a lever is not the bone 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.770
 we press the lever and go down here 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.629
 is going to stay then to join lever 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.279
 with stone because it is very easy cultural 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:54.900
 mechanisms let's see here is going to be the 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.159
 lever then network are they have to 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.069
 be here but then we can not put 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:02.430
 well because no official here but here 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.960
 ok then we remove this we put a 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.500
 ulna 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.590
 and ready redstone and now if it's at 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.810
 desired height is not worth we put our 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.540
 lever 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.880
 and we got it working on the glass 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.169
 let's see who runs everything is very worth 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.630
 well they have current we are all 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:24.490
 repeaters the piston stays open 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.490
 so it goes that it has to be worth 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.090
 with our water bucket we are going to 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.340
 grab and we're going to put it here when 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.960
 we have our open piston that is 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.940
 we have to activate the lever and since 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.400
 we have it open we put here our 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.170
 cubito dice vale we break this 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.760
 It's just to go up in you can 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.639
 do it however you want with the stairs or 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.999
 as you want to see 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.490
 and then, here we have what 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:54.150
 would be our mechanism worth and so that 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.639
 be as the dahlia would be that 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.009
 we have to do one more to this milestone 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.810
 more than once to decorate or be it already 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.259
 You can do it from 20 paintings 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.389
 towards the side 30 years really this is 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.999
 a bath but you can do 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:12.539
 what they want and just look 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:15.389
 we occupy 64 blocks worth to do everything 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.729
 this although we do not spare any here 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.189
 there is nothing 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.229
 and then it is worth having this already 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.199
 they had our circuit our piston 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:28.259
 open and the water and we will have ready 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:33.249
 our bathtub let's see if it works 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:36.849
 Ok let's go for a good bath 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:39.939
 and it's worth comrades this is a tutorial and 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:42.729
 well since nothing else obviously this is going to 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:44.979
 be activating the network are clear no or 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.599
 be when the water falls this has to 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.729
 be off because the piston is not going to 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:50.199
 be in operation move the piston 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.209
 open what it does is stop the water 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:56.289
 now it can not happen here as you see it is 

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:58.749
 closed if we make and chop 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:00.699
 here our lever the piston opens 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:02.799
 the stones network is activated and 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:05.709
 automatically the piston opens and as 

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:07.269
 the water bucket is up then it falls 

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:09.819
 the water but the piston open the 

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:11.949
 stop a cube up and that's 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:14.739
 basically in our operation 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.209
 ok I hope you have served this 

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:18.549
 tutorial that I started a lot for 

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:21.069
 you comrades if it was this degree by 

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:22.569
 please subscribe or give a like for 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.379
 know if it was liked if it was until 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.149
 grade 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:27.610
 obviously ask me for tutorials of what 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:29.529
 you want to pistons of anything 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.039
 and good one little thing more look at who I am 

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:32.039
 a box fighter 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.090
 well this is the new pack of skins 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.449
 well he's not a newbie but we can already 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.939
 select who we want 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:42.999
 and it's worth here I leave you and see you in the 

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:42.999
 next
