 Hello, I have a Soviet hacksaw 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.019
 metal under a short canvas but there is 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.400
 but one 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:17.460
 short canvases not available 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 years so it is probably 5 so that the hacksaw is not 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.230
 lay useless junk accounted for 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.230
 shorten the standard canvas yourself 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.199
 same little pocket on 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.199
 chew 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 there was no nature for her 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.890
 never and if not well, it really means 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.870
 must be done correctly from one 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:56.010
 standard canvases can be made two 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:58.440
 short do markup here we are 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.960
 we will saw through but first you need to do 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.589
 hole 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:11.930
 drill bit for drilling tiles 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:11.930
 Four sharpening factory, I did not bring 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.600
 correct a little 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.079
 Now we are starting to drill holes 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.820
 everything 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.820
 with 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:02:00.710
 drill without cooling and without lubrication mouth 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.710
 Chinese have hryvnia for what 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.170
 now cut in half 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.040
 diamond cutting disc 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.420
 at 90 in a bird market one little man 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:41.569
 sold these discs for 50 kopecks apiece 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:44.020
 and she packed but one thing left 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.020
 last thing 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.500
 with 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.190
 we also cut the second canvas 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.960
 it was possible to break off but not always 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.960
 it turns out exactly 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.970
 canvas is very fragile 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:48.700
 rounding out a little ennobled 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:13.040
 diamond is a great thing not only takes 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.040
 hard alloy but also high speed and 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.730
 instrumental 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:39.620
 on the nose like a native 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.140
 now we collect the smallest 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:19.000
 insert the canvas and fasten the poles 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:28.120
 instead of the pins, the screws are done on 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:37.590
 a cup of cloth grandfathers with a sign 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:37.590
