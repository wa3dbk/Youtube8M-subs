00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.759
 russia siberian landscapes something 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.450
 resemble pontoon at all although not quite 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.880
 other 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.690
 and all because here lies under water 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.240
 ice frozen ground never give it away 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.929
 id it is called the eternal state 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 permafrost 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.880
 but when it is thawed 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 released methane which is 23 times 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.699
 stronger in action than co2 scientists 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.170
 fear that in a situation of global 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.170
 warming this can happen 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.600
 in this region are concentrated the main 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.680
 Russian oil and gas reserves 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.060
 well visible from above 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.220
 Surgut deposits 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.860
 where a lot of gas comes from 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.140
 Europe from here to my house a few 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.780
 thousand kilometers and looking at the pipe 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.950
 gas pipeline I think how can this one know 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.950
 the gas goes just there 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.990
 marsh vegetation gradually 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.240
 form a silt surface it looks like 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.300
 on solid ground but the helicopter is not 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 I'll put it I've never seen such 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.680
 unusual surface 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.390
 but 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.790
 Siberia is one of the regions of the world with the most 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.190
 high temperature limit 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.740
 from plus 40 degrees in summer 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.740
 to -40 in winter 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.260
 so low she was when we shot 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:10.149
 Lake Baikal is so amazing 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:12.690
 spectacle is the most ancient deepest 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.720
 lake in the world and one of the largest 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.000
 reservoirs of the planet water in the lake such 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.310
 net that at a depth of 40 meters all 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 it is seen 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.420
 winter due to temperature fluctuations ice 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.970
 breaks cracks freezes again and 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.660
 amazing ice forms are obtained and 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.760
 patterns 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.810
 they overlap each other throughout 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.110
 lake surface 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.010
 I haven't flown this amazing yet 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.600
 the spectacle is like under me black and white 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.600
 painting artist sticks
