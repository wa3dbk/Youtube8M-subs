anything to talk about thing that that's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.830 
anything to talk about thing that that's
kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.260> showing<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:59.129> now<00:00:59.160> anyway<00:00:59.940> that's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
kind of showing right now anyway that's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
kind of showing right now anyway that's
the<00:01:00.989> reason<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.680> fast<00:01:02.100> forwarded<00:01:02.609> here

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the reason it's all fast forwarded here

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
the reason it's all fast forwarded here
I<00:01:02.969> actually<00:01:03.300> show<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.960> part<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> end<00:01:04.530> where

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
I actually show a part at the end where

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
I actually show a part at the end where
