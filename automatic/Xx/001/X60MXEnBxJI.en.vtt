00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there so only water can escape to the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
there so only water can escape to the

certain<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:30.090> might<00:01:31.079> use<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> when

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
certain one and I might use that when

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.510 
certain one and I might use that when
they<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.890> bigger<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.130> don't<00:01:32.400> know

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
they get a little bigger I don't know

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.520 
they get a little bigger I don't know
then<00:01:32.939> again<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.229> food

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
then again because of some like food

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.340 
then again because of some like food
parkil<00:01:34.979> falls<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> thing's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
parkil falls here you know that thing's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
parkil falls here you know that thing's
not<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.770> strong<00:01:38.040> enough<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> pull<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
not going to be strong enough to pull it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
not going to be strong enough to pull it
up<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:41.070> be

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
up like that so I think this would be

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.770 
up like that so I think this would be
superior<00:01:41.579> because<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.180> mean<00:01:42.329> stuff<00:01:42.509> floating

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
superior because I mean stuff floating

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.469 
superior because I mean stuff floating
around<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> water<00:01:43.290> Boosh<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:45.000> so

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
around the water Boosh right in there so

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
around the water Boosh right in there so
the<00:01:45.570> angelfish<00:01:45.960> fried<00:01:46.200> getting<00:01:46.500> pretty<00:01:46.710> big<00:01:46.860> i

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the angelfish fried getting pretty big i
