00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.730

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.530
 mcintosh it is gray laugh grids 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.910
 like 99% of people who buy at mac 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.840
 because they do not want to cum 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 stickers on months before 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.110
 I had a model and community I 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.960
 I was no longer another plan the summit 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.259
 like a maxi beautiful game but not all of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.150
 after 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.710
 except that precisely there are ways to 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.230
 make it even more beautiful and beautiful 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.689
 it's called a sticker just on 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.740
 astique hours me who sent us a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.179
 little world aunisiens would tell you from 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.320
 discover a little what we do and we have 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.269
 looked at their catalogs so 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.519
 general stickers are not necessarily 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.159
 pretty I find unfortunately there is a super 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.930
 catane others come see this is the 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.120
 catalog 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.339
 you can see the number this is the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.409
 beautiful white snow 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.900
 there are full full as you can 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:52.799
 see some very nice stuff the little cat 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.809
 here the superman to the mayor in the process of 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.799
 to eat the apple etc and so on and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.909
 site is pretty well done there is a 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.339
 little video to explain how 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:05.189
 we are doing well we will test 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.420
 with this beautiful dark vador and we're going 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.090
 do it live 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.760
 so how do we first do I 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 just left the clips with every little 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.030
 sticker it provides a notice that you 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.470
 explain in three words how does 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.420
 finally five mounts several first 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 a clean you so I took a soap 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.500
 so you see I've spent more 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.430
 topics remove everything there was that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.970
 to clean but in fact it does 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.920
 was not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.300
 step number 2 I put the apple in the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.830
 common sense 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.140
 in this case you will let it dry 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.880
 it's done taking off with care 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.050
 tic is in fact that's all that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.060
 is in the middle of the green that is going to be 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.500
 take off and see if there is an apple 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.090
 who appears in this life art apple 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.430
 that I hold on to that so we 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.820
 I'm going to do it and it's without 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.820
 faking 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:57.409
 this is the apple we lift I go 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.520
 stick it we could have poured 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.740
 rather this little smarter in Falla 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.840
 mercenaries game rather little known the date 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.810
 to members May 1st I always dreamed 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.739
 to glue sticking stickers 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.860
 as on m6 valérie damidot 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.330
 this is what is said well in the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.360
 notice that must be positioned as a 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:35.030
 compared to the apple so I do not know 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:36.920
 to miss me well wedged compared to the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.640
 apple then there I think I'm 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.940
 rather not bad 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.530
 and there you will grab a map so 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.819
 for example this one a map a little 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.150
 rigid credit card style 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.570
 here we go and we go slowly to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.570
 hands 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.280
 why to avoid air bubbles and 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.650
 we go slowly there you see 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.030
 that it's going very well and I 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.500
 you usually swear at me I'm doing them on 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.129
 my iphone i'm still a big 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.640
 a hail and there it goes nickel or 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.849
 so because the stickers 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.069
 sticker me fantômas ul-haq on a stick 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.180
 is delivered and of excellent quality it is 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.170
 thick so really applies very very 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.769
 well, I've already done 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.060
 much finer stickers sincerely 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.000
 it was an integral galley since 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.079
 being too hungry well it was taking 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.760
 tore me do it was a galley 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.910
 here we are almost done with the dark 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.910
 vador we go we finish with the helmet 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:53.489
 here we are going to avoid rio my mac sees 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:56.280
 there and frankly got a little 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.700
 bubble of a little air bubble my god 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.010
