 joaquim rodriguez and and laurent the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 did not say a lot of differences 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.910
 between these three yoakim currents 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.260
 rodrigues may be a bit superior 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.270
 before runners who accompanied him to 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.279
 brave roman bardet who cling 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.439
 watch there allow to put on 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.140
 youtube google seems impossible 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.910
 for the moment of pure yoakim rodriguez 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.279
 to get rid of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.649
 Roman parents that there are as fuglesang 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.230
 23 seconds last and quarter with miral 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.120
 14 each of the accelerations the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 joaquín rodríguez then go away 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.129
 look at fulsang bardet and news 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.809
 tony gallopin is important nicolas 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.100
 he was dropped by the jersey bunch 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.110
 yellow tony gallopin indeed distanced 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 with a group with mathias frank with 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.309
 your wells with sepulveda it is about 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.899
 a hundred meters from andrew 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.610
 ski talent while just in front 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.440
 we are warren barguil there that comes 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.390
 to let go distanced Warren Barguil 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.550
 about fifty meters from the place 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 good yellow jersey alberto contador did not 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.539
 put teammates in front burst mike 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.119
 after the effort has just been distanced 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.670
 while christopher still chills two 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.140
 teammates here it's samuel sanchez who 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.259
 has just been released rodriguez who 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.020
 back on myrhol 14 ski the champion of 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.270
 world has been heroic today without 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.170
 doubt maybe even hasty answer from 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.259
 everything without letting go 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.460
 roman bardet cédric thomas bardel chopped 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.140
 but we suspected a little bit 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.640
 unfortunately I feared him 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.290
 actually Roman bardet who 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.759
 was starting to show first signs 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.500
 of fatigue his pedal stroke was a 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.210
 little less smoking does not disarm and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.460
 dray if know this ascension he 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.610
 he recognized him at jakob fulgsang a few 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.680
 meters in front of him but really yoakim 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.969
 rodriguez seems the strongest i have 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.009
 really feel like he's trying 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.810
 to fly to a second victory 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.640
 stage even if he still needs to 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.829
 get rid of the ski adq he's on 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.509
 his land there is that they die gases 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.219
 is gone yes it's played at a pace 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.229
 great thing rodriguez is not either 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.610
 imperial is he let go it's true he 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.350
 must seem to me and stuffed with runners who 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 also are suffering these 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.890
 last days with difficulty has them 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.820
 dropped with difficulty had to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.820
 resume several times and
