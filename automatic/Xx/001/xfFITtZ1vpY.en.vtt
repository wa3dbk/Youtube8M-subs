00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
side and did not know most of those

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.910 
side and did not know most of those
players<00:00:12.240> but<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> right<00:00:12.960> forward<00:00:13.320> had<00:00:13.500> 90

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
pace and the midfield was quite

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.779 
pace and the midfield was quite
impatient<00:00:16.260> as<00:00:16.350> well<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.949> he<00:00:17.340> will<00:00:17.460> get<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.569 
I wanted to win the title and see me at
quite<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> few<00:00:37.380> chances<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.100> tribal<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
quite a few chances and I tribal the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.950 
quite a few chances and I tribal the
ball<00:00:38.760> past<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> key<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> should<00:00:39.930> probably

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
ball past the key but I should probably

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
ball past the key but I should probably
had<00:00:40.440> tried<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> pass<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.309> class<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.670> take<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
had tried to pass the class to take the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.720 
had tried to pass the class to take the
easy<00:00:42.180> goal<00:00:42.530> but<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.590> kept<00:00:43.950> creating<00:00:44.340> chances

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
easy goal but I kept creating chances

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
easy goal but I kept creating chances
and<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> end<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.690> ball<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.079> actually

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and in the end the ball will actually

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.470 
and in the end the ball will actually
fall<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.980> name<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.340> who<00:00:47.760> managed<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.059> take<00:00:48.360> out

not win the title of this division so I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.289 
not win the title of this division so I
went<00:01:22.320> into<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> new<00:01:22.920> division<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.939> decided

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
went into a new division and I decided

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.940 
went into a new division and I decided
to<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> different<00:01:25.229> approach<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to go with a different approach and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.670 
to go with a different approach and
mainly<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> defensive<00:01:27.479> approach<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:28.140> when

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
mainly a defensive approach because when

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.010 
mainly a defensive approach because when
i<00:01:28.710> play<00:01:29.070> i'm<00:01:29.280> very<00:01:29.340> impatient<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> defense

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
i play i'm very impatient in the defense

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
because i want to get the ball back a
straight<00:01:32.970> away<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.780> using<00:01:34.320> skill

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
straight away and get on using skill

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
straight away and get on using skill
moves<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.520> means<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.909> i<00:01:35.939> washed<00:01:36.210> my

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
moves and that means that i washed my

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.899 
moves and that means that i washed my
defenders<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.170> quite<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
defenders for a quite a lot and so I

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.280 
defenders for a quite a lot and so I
went<00:01:39.150> into<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.479> game<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> completely

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.499 
went into this game with a completely
different<00:01:40.710> approach<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.189> played<00:01:41.850> defensive<00:01:42.420> i

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
different approach I played defensive i

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.749 
different approach I played defensive i
had<00:01:42.720> my<00:01:42.899> defenders<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.590> position<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.220> they

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
had my defenders in position and they

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.789 
had my defenders in position and they
forced<00:01:45.090> my<00:01:45.210> opponent<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.170> wide<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
