instructions<00:03:16.540> for<00:03:16.870> building<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:22.950> got

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
instructions for building it this got

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.949 
instructions for building it this got
that<00:03:26.939> okay<00:03:27.939> so<00:03:28.000> there's<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.750> packaging<00:03:30.959> you

Fury<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:08.150> is<00:04:08.800> quite<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.830> feat<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.370> Engineering

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
Fury this is quite a feat of Engineering

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.990 
Fury this is quite a feat of Engineering
there's<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.810> rubber<00:04:12.500> band<00:04:12.890> inside<00:04:13.400> here<00:04:13.610> you

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
there's a rubber band inside here you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:51.760 
there's a rubber band inside here you
crank<00:04:14.450> this<00:04:15.440> tail<00:04:15.890> wind<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:17.030> up<00:04:50.470> okay<00:04:51.470> well

crank this tail wind it up okay well
this<00:04:52.040> seems<00:04:52.460> like<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.730> pretty<00:04:53.090> impressive<00:04:53.570> toy

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.180 

it's<00:05:01.090> just<00:05:01.449> like<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.810> man<00:05:02.020> from<00:05:02.050> this<00:05:02.560> pant<00:05:02.860> it

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
it's just like the man from this pant it

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.180 
it's just like the man from this pant it
really<00:05:03.610> flies<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.120> almost<00:05:04.630> done<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:05.199> up<00:05:05.410> on

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
really flies and almost done it up on

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.610 
really flies and almost done it up on
the<00:05:06.580> rough<00:05:06.790> this<00:05:07.540> will<00:05:07.780> probably<00:05:08.020> give<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.530> a

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
the rough this will probably give it a

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.830 
the rough this will probably give it a
thumbs<00:05:08.889> up<00:05:09.160> and<00:05:09.370> go<00:05:09.850> fine<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.419> have<00:05:10.630> some
