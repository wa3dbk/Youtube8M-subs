this<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.570> bat<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.050> if<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.620> no

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
this is the bat for you if you have no

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.770 
this is the bat for you if you have no
power<00:03:35.040> actually<00:03:36.030> I'm<00:03:36.239> thinking<00:03:36.270> if<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.630> do

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
power actually I'm thinking if you do

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.690 
power actually I'm thinking if you do
have<00:03:36.959> power<00:03:37.170> because<00:03:37.890> I'm<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.250> power<00:03:38.459> hitter

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
have power because I'm a power hitter

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.760 
have power because I'm a power hitter
and<00:03:39.000> when<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.360> hit<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.630> I'm<00:03:39.810> hitting<00:03:40.140> bloopers

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
and when I hit it I'm hitting bloopers

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.990 
and when I hit it I'm hitting bloopers
so<00:03:41.750> it's<00:03:42.750> either<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.170> or<00:03:43.230> really<00:03:43.700> low<00:03:44.700> pop

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
so it's either that or really low pop

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.500 
so it's either that or really low pop
wise

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
wise

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.900 
wise
so<00:03:45.800> this<00:03:46.800> batter<00:03:47.040> would<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.370> recommend<00:03:47.670> I

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
so this batter would not recommend I

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.850 
so this batter would not recommend I
recommend<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.510> for<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.780> QI<00:03:49.020> work<00:03:49.260> maybe<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
recommend it for the QI work maybe the
