most<00:00:01.199> people<00:00:01.680> think<00:00:01.890> that<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.159> can't

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
most people think that you can't

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.940 
most people think that you can't
overclock<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.149> CPU<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:04.170> your<00:00:04.410> laptop

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
overclock the CPU and your laptop

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.499 
overclock the CPU and your laptop
because<00:00:05.130> it'll<00:00:05.490> catch<00:00:05.670> on<00:00:05.879> fire

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
because it'll catch on fire

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.839 
because it'll catch on fire
well<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:07.230> won't<00:00:07.500> if<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.770> have<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> good<00:00:08.580> enough

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
well it won't if you have a good enough

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.549 
well it won't if you have a good enough
cooling<00:00:09.090> system<00:00:09.690> yeah<00:00:09.929> if<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.349> have<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
cooling system yeah if you have a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.110 
cooling system yeah if you have a
MacBook<00:00:10.830> Pro<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.610> want<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.969> suggest

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
MacBook Pro I want to suggest

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.360 
MacBook Pro I want to suggest
overclocking<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.679> if<00:00:13.799> you've<00:00:13.920> got<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> good

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
overclocking it but if you've got a good

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.359 
overclocking it but if you've got a good
high<00:00:14.580> power<00:00:14.849> gaming<00:00:15.599> laptop<00:00:16.109> then<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:17.220> could

high power gaming laptop then you could

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.040 
high power gaming laptop then you could
go<00:00:17.490> ahead<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.699> overclock<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.270> or<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.869> have

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
go ahead and overclock it or if you have

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.529 
go ahead and overclock it or if you have
some<00:00:19.289> crazy<00:00:19.500> cooling<00:00:20.189> rig<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:21.029> I'm<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
some crazy cooling rig but I'm going to

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.630 
some crazy cooling rig but I'm going to
show<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.720> guys<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> maximum

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
show you guys how to get the maximum

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.349 
show you guys how to get the maximum

tuned learn how overclocking your CPU

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.049 
tuned learn how overclocking your CPU
helps<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> lot<00:00:32.009> when<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.489> comes<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.790> video

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
helps out a lot when it comes to video

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.709 
helps out a lot when it comes to video
editing<00:00:33.360> even<00:00:34.079> gaming<00:00:35.300> alright<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.480> first

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
editing even gaming alright so first

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
editing even gaming alright so first
we're<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> benchmark<00:00:37.980> called

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
we're going to do a benchmark called

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.290 
we're going to do a benchmark called
Cinebench<00:00:39.000> r15<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.190> my<00:00:41.300> processor

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
Cinebench r15 this is with my processor

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
Cinebench r15 this is with my processor
not<00:00:42.600> overclocked<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.590> fast-forwarding

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
not overclocked I'm fast-forwarding

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
not overclocked I'm fast-forwarding
through<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.050> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> takes<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> while

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
through it because kind of takes a while

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.069 
through it because kind of takes a while
it<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:46.770> stresses<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.610> CPU<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.899> it

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it really stresses your CPU and how it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.500 
it really stresses your CPU and how it
performs

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
performs

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.250 
performs
so<00:00:51.510> yeah<00:00:51.809> fast<00:00:52.079> forwarding<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.910> my<00:00:53.910> score<00:00:54.539> for

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so yeah fast forwarding and my score for

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.189 
so yeah fast forwarding and my score for
this<00:00:55.440> particular<00:00:55.800> benchmark<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:59.359> hold<00:01:00.359> on

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.620 

got<00:01:04.460> 691<00:01:05.460> which<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.479> good

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
got 691 which is actually really good

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.500 
got 691 which is actually really good
for<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.990> laptop<00:01:07.460> that's<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> base<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
for a laptop that's what the base of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.350 
for a laptop that's what the base of
this<00:01:09.720> running<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.200> 3.8<00:01:10.920> gigahertz<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.729> here's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this running a 3.8 gigahertz and here's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.520 
this running a 3.8 gigahertz and here's
a<00:01:12.479> video<00:01:13.580> just<00:01:14.580> rendering<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.420> nine<00:01:16.170> files

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a video just rendering like nine files

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
a video just rendering like nine files
or<00:01:16.799> something<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.580> no<00:01:18.210> effects<00:01:18.600> or

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
or something like that no effects or

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.160 
or something like that no effects or
anything<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> we're<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.000> outputting<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
anything so we're just outputting and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.530 
anything so we're just outputting and
I'm<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> fast<00:01:22.830> forward<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.400> here

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
I'm going to fast forward right here

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.760 
I'm going to fast forward right here
because<00:01:24.540> nobody<00:01:24.990> wants<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> stare<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.590> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
because nobody wants to stare at this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.280 
because nobody wants to stare at this
going<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:28.549> for<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.350> get<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.850> 59

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
going on and on for this we get about 59

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.280 
going on and on for this we get about 59
seconds<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.619> 59<00:01:35.400> seconds<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.420> export

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
seconds or so 59 seconds just to export

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.819 
seconds or so 59 seconds just to export
that<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.100> overclock<00:01:38.520> using<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.030> intel

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
that and I overclock using a intel

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
that and I overclock using a intel
extreme<00:01:40.829> tuning<00:01:41.759> utility<00:01:42.540> or<00:01:44.210> xt<00:01:45.210> use<00:01:45.659> what

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
extreme tuning utility or xt use what

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.780 
extreme tuning utility or xt use what
they<00:01:46.229> want<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> call<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.369> yeah<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> go

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
they want to call it so yeah you go

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.929 
they want to call it so yeah you go
through<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> interface<00:01:48.509> um<00:01:49.460> go<00:01:50.460> over<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> core

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
through the interface um go over to core

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
through the interface um go over to core
you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.930> control<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.590> gives

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
you can do all control you know gives

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.260 
you can do all control you know gives
you<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> warning<00:01:53.310> saying<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.820> damage<00:01:54.060> your

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you a warning saying you can damage your

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
you a warning saying you can damage your
system<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> first<00:01:58.469> thing<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.070> do

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
system and so first thing I like to do

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.810 
system and so first thing I like to do
is<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> bump<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> cores<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.820> some

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
is I like to bump all the cores up some

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.459 
is I like to bump all the cores up some
people<00:02:03.180> their<00:02:03.509> laptops<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.380> an

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
people their laptops if you have an

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.410 
people their laptops if you have an
extreme<00:02:04.770> processor<00:02:05.310> its<00:02:05.460> unlock<00:02:06.000> everywhere

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
extreme processor its unlock everywhere

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.960 
extreme processor its unlock everywhere
and<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.750> push<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.079> much<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> want<00:02:07.680> and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
and you can push as much as you want and

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.309 
and you can push as much as you want and
you<00:02:08.970> know<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.119> got<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.390> add<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.869> electricity

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
you know you got to add more electricity

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.910 
you know you got to add more electricity
and<00:02:10.800> power<00:02:10.979> if

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and power if

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.460 
and power if
you<00:02:11.980> want<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.940> think<00:02:16.599> this<00:02:17.290> is

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
you want to do this so I think this is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.500 
you want to do this so I think this is
the<00:02:17.590> default<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.099> honestly<00:02:19.090> don't<00:02:19.270> know<00:02:19.420> what

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
the default I honestly don't know what

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.300 
the default I honestly don't know what
the<00:02:19.599> default<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:20.470> if<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.010> have<00:02:21.099> cooling

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
the default is but if you have cooling

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.710 
the default is but if you have cooling
under<00:02:21.610> control<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.090> can<00:02:22.209> add<00:02:22.330> more<00:02:22.480> power

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
under control you can add more power

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.500 
under control you can add more power
because<00:02:23.050> more<00:02:23.260> power<00:02:23.470> more<00:02:23.830> heat<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.480> here<00:02:25.480> I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
because more power more heat so here I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.970 
because more power more heat so here I
am<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.349> know<00:02:26.470> raising<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.930> power

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
am just you know raising the power

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.180 
am just you know raising the power
limits<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.850> we<00:02:31.209> got<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.709> hit<00:02:32.920> apply

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
limits and we got this and you hit apply

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.240 
limits and we got this and you hit apply
and<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:35.050> know<00:02:35.170> boom<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.709> see<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.010> jump

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
and you know boom you can see the jump

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.650 
and you know boom you can see the jump
up<00:02:36.930> I'm<00:02:37.930> about<00:02:38.200> on<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.860> 4.2<00:02:39.730> gigahertz<00:02:40.060> um

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
up I'm about on that 4.2 gigahertz um

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.750 
up I'm about on that 4.2 gigahertz um
right<00:02:41.650> there<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:42.010> just<00:02:42.130> because<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.580> guess

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
right there that's just because I guess

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.120 
right there that's just because I guess
more<00:02:43.000> than<00:02:44.010> one<00:02:45.010> core<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.400> being<00:02:45.610> used<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
more than one core is being used so you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.830 
more than one core is being used so you
know<00:02:48.250> we<00:02:48.400> got<00:02:48.519> this<00:02:48.700> going<00:02:48.940> on<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.390> we're

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
know we got this going on and we're

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.660 
know we got this going on and we're
going<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.019> do<00:02:50.110> Cinebench<00:02:50.680> again

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
going to do Cinebench again

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.650 
going to do Cinebench again
and<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.799> with<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:53.980> overclock<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:55.269> again

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
and this is with the overclock so again

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.840 
and this is with the overclock so again

overclocked<00:03:08.250> 763<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.340> mean<00:03:09.640> that's<00:03:09.850> more<00:03:10.209> than

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
overclocked 763 I mean that's more than

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.809 
overclocked 763 I mean that's more than
a<00:03:10.810> whole<00:03:11.019> lot<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.830> desktops<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.580> mean<00:03:12.730> I'm

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
a whole lot of desktops I mean I'm

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.280 
a whole lot of desktops I mean I'm
getting<00:03:13.030> up<00:03:13.180> there<00:03:13.360> close<00:03:13.630> with<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.640> 477<00:03:15.640> K

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
getting up there close with the 477 K

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.380 
getting up there close with the 477 K
and<00:03:17.430> yeah<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.700> mean<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:18.970> got<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> big

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
and yeah so I mean I got a big

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.630 
and yeah so I mean I got a big
performance<00:03:19.630> boost<00:03:20.260> right<00:03:20.500> there<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.549> I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
performance boost right there and I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.150 
performance boost right there and I
didn't<00:03:21.880> even<00:03:21.970> increase<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.690> cache<00:03:23.160> frequency

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
didn't even increase the cache frequency

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.490 
didn't even increase the cache frequency
so<00:03:25.150> now<00:03:25.390> we're<00:03:25.570> doing<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.870> exact<00:03:26.140> same<00:03:26.170> video

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
so now we're doing the exact same video

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.979 
so now we're doing the exact same video
-<00:03:26.920> same<00:03:27.280> export<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.090> at<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.690> time<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.930> this

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
- same export and at the time of this

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.009 
- same export and at the time of this
video<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.290> didn't<00:03:29.650> have<00:03:29.769> an<00:03:29.890> SSD<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.840> could

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
video I didn't have an SSD so that could

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.930 
video I didn't have an SSD so that could
have<00:03:32.109> actually<00:03:32.200> been<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.500> bottleneck<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.190> here

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
have actually been a bottleneck and here

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.840 
have actually been a bottleneck and here
we've<00:03:34.120> got<00:03:34.180> about<00:03:34.390> 45<00:03:34.750> seconds<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:35.890> yeah<00:03:36.160> 14

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
we've got about 45 seconds so yeah 14

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.050 
we've got about 45 seconds so yeah 14
seconds<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.600> may<00:03:37.720> not<00:03:37.900> think<00:03:38.170> much<00:03:38.380> but<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:39.220> uh

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
seconds you may not think much but it uh

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.650 
seconds you may not think much but it uh
over<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:40.989> long<00:03:41.230> period<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.620> time<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:42.220> uh<00:03:42.660> like

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
over a long period of time you uh like

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.060 
over a long period of time you uh like
if<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.900> have<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.049> video<00:03:44.290> with<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.709> ton<00:03:45.040> of

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
if you have a video with a ton of

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.920 
if you have a video with a ton of
effects<00:03:45.489> then<00:03:45.820> you'll<00:03:46.000> definitely<00:03:46.570> see<00:03:46.780> the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
effects then you'll definitely see the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.170 
effects then you'll definitely see the
difference<00:03:46.959> or<00:03:47.950> if<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.430> longer<00:03:48.640> video<00:03:48.910> or

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
difference or if it's a longer video or

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.430 
difference or if it's a longer video or
if<00:03:49.269> there's<00:03:49.510> different<00:03:49.810> layers<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.260> mean

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
if there's different layers so I mean

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.780 
if there's different layers so I mean
that's<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:50.680> like<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:51.160> best-case<00:03:51.760> scenario

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
that's just like the best-case scenario

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.020 
that's just like the best-case scenario
but<00:03:52.480> if<00:03:52.660> as<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.260> can<00:03:53.440> see<00:03:53.680> there's<00:03:54.579> more<00:03:54.760> heat

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
but if as you can see there's more heat

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.500 
but if as you can see there's more heat
this<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.329> a<00:03:55.510> stress<00:03:56.109> test<00:03:56.350> full<00:03:56.709> load<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:56.950> mean

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
this is a stress test full load I mean

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.400 
this is a stress test full load I mean
97<00:03:58.510> degrees<00:03:58.870> Celsius<00:03:59.670> 98<00:04:00.670> so<00:04:01.329> yeah<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.870> adds<00:04:02.170> a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
97 degrees Celsius 98 so yeah it adds a

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.220 
97 degrees Celsius 98 so yeah it adds a
lot<00:04:02.739> of<00:04:02.799> heat
