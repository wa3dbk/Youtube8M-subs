well so far no complaints then we have
the<00:00:33.930> Wi-Fi<00:00:34.110> card<00:00:34.530> which<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.070> simple

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the Wi-Fi card which is just a simple

the Wi-Fi card which is just a simple
tp-link<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:37.110> moving<00:00:37.469> over<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.219> see

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
tp-link one now moving over we can see

our<00:00:38.610> hard<00:00:38.969> drive<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.660> hybrid<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
our hard drive this is a hybrid one so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.670 
our hard drive this is a hybrid one so
it's<00:00:40.680> supposedly<00:00:41.570> faster<00:00:42.570> than<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.079> average

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it's supposedly faster than the average

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.889 
it's supposedly faster than the average
hard<00:00:43.950> drive<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.399> still<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> form<00:00:45.719> factor

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
hard drive but still in the form factor

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.560 
hard drive but still in the form factor
of<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.620> normal<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> that's<00:00:48.180> very<00:00:48.390> good

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
of a normal one and that's very good

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.420 
of a normal one and that's very good
that's<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.079> terabyte<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:49.860> sure<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that's one terabyte I'm not sure the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.060 
that's one terabyte I'm not sure the
name<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.660> I'll<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.860> the

did<00:02:00.250> at<00:02:00.400> first<00:02:00.430> use<00:02:00.910> DVI<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:02.050> yeah

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
did at first use DVI so yeah

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.710 
did at first use DVI so yeah
everything's<00:02:03.490> really<00:02:03.670> come<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:03.940> handy<00:02:03.970> then

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
everything's really come in handy then

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.950 
everything's really come in handy then
obviously<00:02:05.229> we<00:02:05.440> have<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.770> hdmi<00:02:06.100> below<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.640> DVI

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
obviously we have the hdmi below the DVI

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.320 
obviously we have the hdmi below the DVI
then<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.350> blue<00:02:08.709> ports<00:02:09.250> are<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.610> USB<00:02:10.000> 3<00:02:10.179> port

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
then the blue ports are the USB 3 port

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.630 
then the blue ports are the USB 3 port
we<00:02:10.600> have<00:02:10.750> four<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.050> them<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.560> next<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.550> the

we have four of them and next to the
bottom<00:02:13.000> two<00:02:13.390> we<00:02:13.720> have<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.230> ethernet<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.180> then

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
bottom two we have the ethernet and then

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.630 
bottom two we have the ethernet and then
we<00:02:16.450> have<00:02:16.600> all<00:02:16.780> our<00:02:16.810> audio<00:02:17.320> stuff<00:02:17.590> at<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.400> very

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.660 
we have all our audio stuff at the very

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
bottom then moving down just a tiny bit

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.979 
bottom then moving down just a tiny bit
we<00:02:22.030> find<00:02:22.330> our<00:02:22.980> Wi-Fi<00:02:24.060> signal<00:02:25.060> bars<00:02:25.300> completely

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
we find our Wi-Fi signal bars completely

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.199 
we find our Wi-Fi signal bars completely
forgotten<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.440> name<00:02:26.470> right<00:02:26.830> now<00:02:27.030> they<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.180> a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
special name antenna bars that's it and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.250 
special name antenna bars that's it and
then<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.790> very<00:02:30.970> bottom<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.360> have<00:02:31.480> our<00:02:31.900> power

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
then a very bottom we have our power

supply on and off button and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:35.739> much<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.070> for<00:02:36.310> all<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.610> ports<00:02:37.150> apart

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
pretty much it for all the ports apart

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.570 
pretty much it for all the ports apart
from<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.930> course<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.500> front<00:02:38.830> where<00:02:39.400> we're

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
from of course the front where we're

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.940 
from of course the front where we're
taking<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.880> look<00:02:40.000> now<00:02:40.060> on<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.050> very<00:02:41.290> front<00:02:41.620> on

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
taking a look now on the very front on

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.330 
taking a look now on the very front on
the<00:02:42.190> top<00:02:42.489> we<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.090> two<00:02:43.750> USB<00:02:44.019> 3.0<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:45.100> try<00:02:45.280> and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the top we have two USB 3.0 just try and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.940 
the top we have two USB 3.0 just try and
get<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.670> better<00:02:46.120> look<00:02:46.330> at<00:02:46.480> them<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.950> they

get you a better look at them and they

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.160 
get you a better look at them and they
are<00:02:48.190> very<00:02:48.220> handy<00:02:48.850> on<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.120> top<00:02:49.420> as<00:02:49.660> well<00:02:49.840> as<00:02:50.049> a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
are very handy on the top as well as a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.340 
are very handy on the top as well as a
fan<00:02:50.380> control<00:02:50.739> we<00:02:50.860> have<00:02:50.890> low<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.430> high<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:52.350> yet

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
fan control we have low and high and yet

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.199 
fan control we have low and high and yet
I<00:02:53.620> mean<00:02:53.829> this<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.310> don't<00:02:54.459> really<00:02:54.700> need<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> lot

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
I mean this I don't really need it a lot

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.819 
I mean this I don't really need it a lot
because<00:02:55.299> I'm<00:02:55.510> normally<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:56.019> only<00:02:56.350> on<00:02:56.650> low

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
because I'm normally just only on low

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.560 
because I'm normally just only on low
because<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.190> don't<00:02:57.459> really<00:02:57.519> do<00:02:57.790> anything<00:02:58.000> that

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
because I don't really do anything that

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.400 
because I don't really do anything that
really<00:02:58.930> needs<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.650> high<00:03:00.459> fan<00:03:00.970> sort<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.870> speeds

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
really needs a high fan sort of speeds

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.350 
really needs a high fan sort of speeds
but<00:03:03.100> if<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.459> ever<00:03:03.549> did<00:03:03.760> that's<00:03:03.970> handy<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.329> have

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
but if I ever did that's handy to have

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.390 
but if I ever did that's handy to have
their<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.840> control<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.410> then<00:03:06.190> we<00:03:06.280> obviously

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
their to control it then we obviously

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.550 
their to control it then we obviously
have<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.730> power<00:03:06.970> buttons<00:03:07.329> there<00:03:07.570> is<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.900> power

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
have to power buttons there is a power

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.680 
have to power buttons there is a power
button<00:03:08.739> on<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.160> top<00:03:09.459> with<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.880> blue<00:03:10.209> LED<00:03:10.540> it

see<00:03:43.900> what<00:03:43.930> sort<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.290> benchmarks<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.040> gets<00:03:45.310> so

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
see what sort of benchmarks it gets so

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.360 
see what sort of benchmarks it gets so
here<00:03:46.180> we<00:03:46.329> have<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.540> nice<00:03:46.810> view<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.290> me<00:03:47.680> pressing

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
here we have a nice view of me pressing

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.120 
here we have a nice view of me pressing
the<00:03:48.459> button<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.000> seeing<00:03:49.959> through<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.650> window

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
the button and seeing through the window

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.910 
the button and seeing through the window
door<00:03:51.459> everything<00:03:52.450> turning<00:03:52.720> on<00:03:52.959> so<00:03:53.590> here<00:03:53.800> we

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
door everything turning on so here we

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.380 
door everything turning on so here we
have<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.190> hackintosh<00:03:54.459> up<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:54.970> running<00:03:55.239> and

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
have the hackintosh up and running and

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.059 
have the hackintosh up and running and
we're<00:03:55.599> first<00:03:55.840> going<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.319> black

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
we're first going to do a black

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.250 
we're first going to do a black
magic<00:03:57.430> dis<00:03:57.700> speed<00:03:57.969> test<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.170> the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
magic dis speed test and this is on the

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.589 
magic dis speed test and this is on the
SSD<00:03:59.739> and<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.519> first<00:04:00.730> try<00:04:00.939> did<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.299> didn't<00:04:01.510> get

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
SSD and the first try did I didn't get

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.190 
SSD and the first try did I didn't get
very<00:04:01.749> good<00:04:01.870> speeds<00:04:02.319> on<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.650> right<00:04:03.340> speeds<00:04:03.670> and

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
very good speeds on the right speeds and

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.690 
very good speeds on the right speeds and
that<00:04:05.200> i'm<00:04:05.469> not<00:04:05.650> sure<00:04:05.829> why<00:04:05.980> if<00:04:06.159> anyone<00:04:06.400> who<00:04:06.489> tell

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
that i'm not sure why if anyone who tell

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.670 
that i'm not sure why if anyone who tell
me<00:04:06.730> let<00:04:07.060> me<00:04:07.180> know<00:04:07.359> but<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.049> second<00:04:08.379> time<00:04:08.409> I<00:04:08.560> did

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
me let me know but the second time I did

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.640 
me let me know but the second time I did
it<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:09.099> did<00:04:09.159> get<00:04:09.670> better<00:04:09.969> speeds<00:04:10.359> almost<00:04:10.719> 300

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
it I did get better speeds almost 300

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.000 
it I did get better speeds almost 300
megabytes<00:04:11.950> write<00:04:12.639> speeds<00:04:13.359> and<00:04:13.719> almost<00:04:14.260> 500

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
megabytes write speeds and almost 500

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.370 
megabytes write speeds and almost 500
read<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.969> that's<00:04:16.120> pretty<00:04:16.359> good<00:04:16.599> obviously

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
read so that's pretty good obviously

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.409 
read so that's pretty good obviously
much<00:04:17.799> better<00:04:17.949> than<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.280> standard<00:04:18.940> hard<00:04:19.180> drive

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
much better than a standard hard drive

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.539 
much better than a standard hard drive
so<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.690> makes<00:04:19.989> me<00:04:20.169> happy<00:04:20.220> but<00:04:21.220> now<00:04:21.370> we're

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
so that makes me happy but now we're

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.310 
so that makes me happy but now we're
going<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.729> go<00:04:21.789> into<00:04:22.150> geekbench<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.080> do<00:04:23.289> a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
going to go into geekbench and do a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.560 
going to go into geekbench and do a
geekbench<00:04:24.070> score<00:04:24.160> as<00:04:24.759> many<00:04:24.970> people<00:04:25.300> like<00:04:25.419> to

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
geekbench score as many people like to

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.839 
geekbench score as many people like to
compare<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.169> real<00:04:26.380> max<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.009> whether<00:04:27.639> or

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
compare this to real max and whether or

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.070 
compare this to real max and whether or
not<00:04:27.940> it's<00:04:28.120> worth<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.599> build<00:04:28.870> your<00:04:28.990> own

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
not it's worth it to build your own

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.040 
not it's worth it to build your own
hackintosh<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:30.070> believe<00:04:30.880> so<00:04:31.150> other<00:04:31.780> people

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
hackintosh I believe so other people

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.390 
hackintosh I believe so other people
have<00:04:32.169> different<00:04:32.410> opinions<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:33.190> I'm<00:04:33.280> actually

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
have different opinions so I'm actually

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.279 
have different opinions so I'm actually
just<00:04:33.610> going<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:33.910> skip<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:34.539> because<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.960> took<00:04:35.229> a

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
just going to skip it because it took a

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.950 
just going to skip it because it took a
few<00:04:35.770> minutes<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.479> here<00:04:37.479> we<00:04:37.509> can<00:04:37.660> see<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:37.930> have

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
few minutes and here we can see we have

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.790 
few minutes and here we can see we have
a<00:04:38.080> very<00:04:38.440> nice<00:04:38.650> multi-core<00:04:39.220> score<00:04:39.340> at<00:04:39.780> 11,000

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
a very nice multi-core score at 11,000

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.890 
a very nice multi-core score at 11,000
175<00:04:41.800> which<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.580> extremely<00:04:43.060> good<00:04:43.389> much<00:04:43.720> better

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
175 which is extremely good much better

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.659 
175 which is extremely good much better
than<00:04:44.080> my<00:04:44.199> macbook<00:04:44.560> pro<00:04:44.860> although<00:04:45.250> I<00:04:45.280> do<00:04:45.430> love

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
than my macbook pro although I do love

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.100 
than my macbook pro although I do love
my<00:04:45.849> macbook<00:04:46.180> pro<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.509> is<00:04:46.570> definitely<00:04:47.050> a

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
my macbook pro this is definitely a

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.230 
my macbook pro this is definitely a
beast<00:04:47.440> machine<00:04:47.889> and<00:04:48.370> we<00:04:48.460> also<00:04:48.580> have<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.849> single

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
beast machine and we also have a single

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.920 
beast machine and we also have a single
core<00:04:49.449> score<00:04:49.780> of<00:04:50.820> 3506<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.150> here<00:04:52.630> we<00:04:52.720> have<00:04:52.750> all

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
core score of 3506 and here we have all

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.150 
core score of 3506 and here we have all
the<00:04:52.990> details<00:04:53.139> I<00:04:53.530> don't<00:04:53.710> really<00:04:53.800> know<00:04:53.979> what<00:04:54.070> it

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
the details I don't really know what it

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.830 
the details I don't really know what it
means<00:04:54.340> but<00:04:54.550> I'm<00:04:54.940> pretty<00:04:55.360> sure<00:04:55.570> that's<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.810> good

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
means but I'm pretty sure that's a good

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.439 
means but I'm pretty sure that's a good
score<00:04:56.520> okay<00:04:57.520> now<00:04:57.789> we're<00:04:57.940> going<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.120> just<00:04:58.330> take

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
score okay now we're going to just take

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.480 
score okay now we're going to just take
a<00:04:58.509> look<00:04:58.690> around<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.050> hackintosh<00:04:59.320> and<00:04:59.650> see<00:04:59.860> how

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
a look around the hackintosh and see how

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.029 
a look around the hackintosh and see how
it<00:05:00.639> runs<00:05:00.820> as<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.270> mac<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:01.960> whether<00:05:02.349> or<00:05:02.470> not<00:05:02.710> it

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
it runs as a mac and whether or not it

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.460 
it runs as a mac and whether or not it
is<00:05:03.099> worth<00:05:03.460> other<00:05:04.210> people<00:05:04.690> interested<00:05:05.199> in

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
is worth other people interested in

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.710 
is worth other people interested in
building<00:05:05.680> a<00:05:05.889> hackintosh<00:05:06.150> for<00:05:07.150> them<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.419> do<00:05:07.570> it

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
building a hackintosh for them to do it

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.290 
building a hackintosh for them to do it
so<00:05:08.320> going<00:05:08.560> into<00:05:08.740> about<00:05:08.860> this<00:05:09.130> Mac<00:05:09.340> we<00:05:09.909> can<00:05:10.090> see

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
so going into about this Mac we can see

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.279 
so going into about this Mac we can see
that<00:05:10.599> it<00:05:10.810> notices<00:05:11.500> that<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.370> have<00:05:12.639> a<00:05:12.669> 3.5<00:05:13.419> 59

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
that it notices that I have a 3.5 59

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.350 
that it notices that I have a 3.5 59
gigahertz<00:05:14.740> intel<00:05:15.430> core<00:05:15.610> i5<00:05:15.729> which<00:05:16.210> is

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
gigahertz intel core i5 which is

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.580 
gigahertz intel core i5 which is
actually<00:05:16.479> incorrect<00:05:16.900> i<00:05:17.259> believe<00:05:17.470> it's

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
actually incorrect i believe it's

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.890 
actually incorrect i believe it's
actually<00:05:17.650> 3.4<00:05:18.550> gigahertz<00:05:18.789> but<00:05:19.180> it<00:05:19.270> recognizes

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
actually 3.4 gigahertz but it recognizes

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.520 
actually 3.4 gigahertz but it recognizes
it<00:05:20.080> as<00:05:20.490> 3.59<00:05:21.490> not<00:05:22.090> sure<00:05:22.270> why<00:05:22.479> but<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.470> does

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
it as 3.59 not sure why but it does

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.950 
it as 3.59 not sure why but it does

the<00:07:34.360> very<00:07:34.630> small<00:07:34.990> design<00:07:35.320> but<00:07:36.130> I<00:07:36.610> just

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:37.600 
the very small design but I just

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.960 
the very small design but I just

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:39.970 
personally think what is design if it's

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.360 
personally think what is design if it's
sitting<00:07:40.360> on<00:07:40.600> your<00:07:40.840> desk<00:07:41.110> and<00:07:41.470> nobody<00:07:42.160> else<00:07:42.250> is
