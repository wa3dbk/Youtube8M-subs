00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.460
 hammer that is in front of where I 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.480
 it cost yours to say it but it is also 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.580
 the measures more than anything that has to 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.640
 give exact one side 25 whatever and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.960
 another 25 or 50 and 50 clear well 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.970
 we have here details details that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.290
 we can say with details below in 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.850

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.640
 OK 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.040
 what fear here gave me the mast with 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.050
 your candles will come back here white 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.050
 while we have the little candles 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.909
 behind the ship with this one of the black 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.689
 for a more luxurious detail with its 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.689
 two candlesticks worth think that up 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.810
 there is also the chandelier in the middle 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.250
 equal the east central stick that holds 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.840
 boat that is to go sideways 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.970
 for another if you have climbed in the frame 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.760
 of the fair you will already know what 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.690
 that goes like this we go is that it's pretty 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.630
 well modeled and accurate to your to your real 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.760
 good here in the front of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.550
 ship 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.950
 and nothing here you see the wooden structure 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.470
 that also holds the airy ship and the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.180
 beams and this here also there are 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.580
 like two beams one that they held with the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.860
 that holds from the ground if you see any 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.770
 here you are looking at the side as if you 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.130
 I put the photos of the real ship how 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.040

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.280
 the reality álex that is an old man in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.200

 Internet came from different objects 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.040

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.270
