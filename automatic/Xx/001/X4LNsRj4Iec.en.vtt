Nintendo<00:04:04.560> Power<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:04.860> think<00:04:05.870> another<00:04:06.870> memory<00:04:07.260> I

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
Nintendo Power I think another memory I

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.800 
Nintendo Power I think another memory I
have<00:04:07.590> was<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.220> same<00:04:08.459> friend<00:04:08.790> it's<00:04:09.240> playing<00:04:09.630> at

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
have was the same friend it's playing at

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.990 
have was the same friend it's playing at
a<00:04:09.840> camping<00:04:10.320> lot<00:04:10.470> he<00:04:11.220> had<00:04:11.250> enough<00:04:11.550> cards<00:04:11.880> to

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
a camping lot he had enough cards to

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.940

make<00:04:12.120> dedicated<00:04:12.690> decks<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.230> think<00:04:13.709> he<00:04:13.800> had

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
make dedicated decks I think he had

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.699 
make dedicated decks I think he had
decks<00:04:14.250> like<00:04:14.580> psychic<00:04:15.420> electric<00:04:15.930> fire<00:04:16.410> leaf

and water fighting or something like

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900 
and water fighting or something like
that<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.530> we<00:04:19.830> would<00:04:19.919> swap<00:04:20.190> out<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.549> decks<00:04:20.729> in

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910
