00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the config lua file and here I've added

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.560 
the config lua file and here I've added
some<00:00:24.689> lines<00:00:25.369> within<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.609> content<00:00:27.000> portion<00:00:27.420> of

a<00:00:39.120> moment<00:00:39.450> we'll<00:00:39.540> take<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> look<00:00:39.899> at<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
a moment we'll take a look at the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.680 
a moment we'll take a look at the
constructor<00:00:40.590> new<00:00:41.399> image<00:00:42.059> wrecked<00:00:42.420> that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
constructor new image wrecked that

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.060 
constructor new image wrecked that
allows<00:00:43.410> us<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:44.329> create<00:00:45.329> images<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.829> take

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
allows us to create images that can take

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
allows us to create images that can take
advantage<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.090> image<00:00:48.510> suffix<00:00:49.020> portion

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
advantage of this image suffix portion

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
advantage of this image suffix portion
of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> config<00:00:50.579> da<00:00:50.700> lua<00:00:50.910> file<00:00:51.180> which<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
of the config da lua file which is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.549 
of the config da lua file which is
essentially<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.879> portion<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.170> defines<00:00:55.170> image

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
essentially a portion that defines image

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.389 
essentially a portion that defines image
scaling<00:00:55.949> according<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.600> suffix<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> we'll

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
scaling according to the suffix so we'll

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
scaling according to the suffix so we'll
close<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.710> now<00:01:02.149> take<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> look<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
close this and now take a look in the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
close this and now take a look in the
folder<00:01:05.720> images<00:01:06.770> there's<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.220> dot<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:08.880> our

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
folder images there's the dot from our

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.500 
folder images there's the dot from our
previous<00:01:09.210> movie<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.880> here's<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.090> dot<00:01:12.240> twice

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
previous movie and here's the dot twice

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.679 
previous movie and here's the dot twice
as<00:01:12.689> large<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.380> 2x<00:01:13.710> suffix<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.509> this

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
as large with the at 2x suffix so this

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.590 
as large with the at 2x suffix so this
we<00:01:16.380> will<00:01:16.560> code<00:01:16.979> according<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.150> original

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
we will code according to the original

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
we will code according to the original
version<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.400> we'll<00:01:20.580> take<00:01:20.790> note<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
version and as well we'll take note the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.380 
version and as well we'll take note the
height<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.689> width<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.229> 120<00:01:22.950> pixels<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
height and width are 120 pixels but the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
height and width are 120 pixels but the
height<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.689> width<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.320> version<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
height and width of this version here is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.789 
height and width of this version here is
240<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.979> explains<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.520> two<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
240 so that explains the two in the

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.880 
240 so that explains the two in the
config<00:01:31.799> da<00:01:31.950> Lua<00:01:32.540> ok<00:01:33.540> let's<00:01:33.990> edit<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> main<00:01:34.530> lua

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
config da Lua ok let's edit the main lua

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.700 
config da Lua ok let's edit the main lua
file<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.820> type<00:01:36.030> local<00:01:36.770> circle<00:01:37.770> o<00:01:37.979> 1<00:01:38.509> equals

file will type local circle o 1 equals
display<00:01:41.119> new<00:01:42.259> image<00:01:43.259> wrecked<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:45.450> that's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
display new image wrecked so that's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
display new image wrecked so that's
different<00:01:46.020> than<00:01:46.140> before<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.890> before<00:01:47.100> we

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
different than before because before we

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.719 
different than before because before we
didn't<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> wrecked<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.079> end<00:01:49.729> open

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
didn't have the wrecked on the end open

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.929 
didn't have the wrecked on the end open
and<00:01:50.820> close<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.200> parentheses<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and close the parentheses and now the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.819 
and close the parentheses and now the
string<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> path<00:01:55.200> images<00:01:56.189> /<00:01:57.090> dot<00:01:57.630> 0<00:01:57.960> 1

string that is the path images / dot 0 1
dot<00:01:59.100> PNG<00:01:59.689> now<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.200> don't<00:02:01.530> need<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.549> put<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> at

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.950 
dot PNG now you don't need to put the at
2x<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.810> because<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.619> new<00:02:04.860> image<00:02:05.100> wrecked

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
2x here because this new image wrecked

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.389 
2x here because this new image wrecked
will<00:02:06.960> take<00:02:07.200> care<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> image<00:02:07.979> scaling

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
will take care of the image scaling

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.710 
will take care of the image scaling
okay<00:02:10.329> we'll<00:02:11.110> type<00:02:11.439> comma<00:02:12.069> now<00:02:12.760> we<00:02:13.239> do<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.450> to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
okay we'll type comma now we do have to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.920 
okay we'll type comma now we do have to
enter<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.319> width<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:15.060> height<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.480> this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
enter the width and the height and this

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.449 
enter the width and the height and this
is<00:02:17.049> the<00:02:17.170> width<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.500> height<00:02:17.560> at<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.010> one

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
is the width and the height at the one

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.729 
is the width and the height at the one
to<00:02:18.579> one<00:02:18.760> ratio<00:02:19.030> not<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.689> at<00:02:19.810> 2x<00:02:20.230> which<00:02:20.560> is

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
to one ratio not the at 2x which is

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.530 
to one ratio not the at 2x which is
really<00:02:20.920> 240<00:02:21.549> x<00:02:22.180> 240<00:02:23.250> save<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.700> let's<00:02:25.299> take<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
really 240 x 240 save and let's take a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.899 
really 240 x 240 save and let's take a
look<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.709> there<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.159> but<00:02:27.489> you'll<00:02:27.609> notice

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
look so there it is but you'll notice

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.940 
look so there it is but you'll notice
that<00:02:27.939> it's<00:02:28.209> different<00:02:29.049> from<00:02:29.230> when<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:29.560> created

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
that it's different from when we created

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.610 
that it's different from when we created
using<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.549> new<00:02:30.700> image<00:02:31.030> constructor<00:02:31.599> in<00:02:31.780> that

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
using the new image constructor in that

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.170 
using the new image constructor in that
the<00:02:33.689> 00<00:02:34.689> of<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.170> image<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.790> center<00:02:37.150> of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the 00 of the image is in the center of

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.000 
the 00 of the image is in the center of
the<00:02:37.390> image<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.319> we're<00:02:38.439> going<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.650> take<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.799> look

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the image so we're going to take a look

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.930 
the image so we're going to take a look
at<00:02:39.129> the<00:02:39.750> method<00:02:40.750> set<00:02:41.109> reference<00:02:41.530> point<00:02:41.940> so

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
at the method set reference point so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.089 
at the method set reference point so
let's<00:02:43.480> do<00:02:44.079> new<00:02:44.319> line<00:02:45.090> circle<00:02:46.090> Oh<00:02:46.359> 1<00:02:47.700> colon<00:02:49.019> set

let's do new line circle Oh 1 colon set

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.699 
let's do new line circle Oh 1 colon set

you<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:58.540> see<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.750> sit<00:02:59.170> objectset<00:02:59.829> reference

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
you can see the sit objectset reference

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.009 
you can see the sit objectset reference
point<00:03:00.459> constructor<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.299> these<00:03:01.810> the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
point constructor and these the

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.809 
point constructor and these the
different<00:03:02.319> arguments<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:03.459> what<00:03:03.609> this<00:03:03.760> does

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
different arguments and what this does

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.030 
different arguments and what this does
is<00:03:04.239> set<00:03:04.569> where<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.139> reference<00:03:05.560> point<00:03:05.769> for<00:03:05.859> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
is set where the reference point for the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.830 
is set where the reference point for the
object<00:03:06.400> should<00:03:06.579> be<00:03:06.819> so<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.629> when<00:03:07.750> you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
object should be so that when you

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.770 
object should be so that when you
position<00:03:08.139> at<00:03:08.439> x<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.859> y<00:03:09.359> it'll<00:03:10.359> position

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
position at x and y it'll position

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.140 
position at x and y it'll position
according<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.379> that<00:03:11.560> reference<00:03:12.129> point<00:03:12.400> right

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
according to that reference point right

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.289 
according to that reference point right
now<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.930> default<00:03:14.109> is<00:03:14.470> it's<00:03:14.799> in<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.010> center

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
now the default is it's in the center

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.490 
now the default is it's in the center
we're<00:03:16.299> going<00:03:16.449> to<00:03:16.510> change<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> top<00:03:17.230> left

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
we're going to change it to the top left

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.699 
we're going to change it to the top left
so<00:03:17.799> we'll<00:03:17.949> copy<00:03:18.280> display<00:03:18.970> top<00:03:19.480> left<00:03:19.810> reference

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
so we'll copy display top left reference

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.180 
so we'll copy display top left reference
point<00:03:20.949> and<00:03:21.510> paste<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.810> within<00:03:23.590> the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
point and paste that within the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.050 
point and paste that within the
parenthesis<00:03:24.909> notice<00:03:25.329> this<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.629> not<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> string

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
parenthesis notice this is not a string

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.610 
parenthesis notice this is not a string
save<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.269> if<00:03:28.449> we<00:03:28.720> rendered<00:03:29.049> it<00:03:29.169> nothing<00:03:29.500> would

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
save it if we rendered it nothing would

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.199 
save it if we rendered it nothing would
happen<00:03:29.799> because<00:03:30.159> after<00:03:30.639> we<00:03:30.730> do<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:30.879> we<00:03:31.180> need

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
happen because after we do that we need

equals zero ok let's go to the simulator
and<00:03:48.000> there<00:03:49.000> we<00:03:49.150> go<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.049> reference<00:03:50.379> point

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
and there we go so the reference point

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.420 
and there we go so the reference point
is<00:03:50.739> right<00:03:50.919> here<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.470> if<00:03:53.470> we<00:03:53.620> changed<00:03:54.129> it<00:03:54.250> to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
is right here and if we changed it to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.199 
is right here and if we changed it to
top<00:03:54.729> right<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:58.919> re-rendered<00:03:59.919> it<00:04:00.069> we<00:04:01.030> don't

top right and re-rendered it we don't

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.699 
top right and re-rendered it we don't
see<00:04:01.449> the<00:04:01.599> image<00:04:01.810> but<00:04:01.959> actually<00:04:02.290> it's<00:04:02.440> here

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
see the image but actually it's here

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.399 
see the image but actually it's here
off-screen<00:04:03.250> because<00:04:03.760> now<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.780> image<00:04:05.079> has<00:04:05.260> a

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
off-screen because now the image has a

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.420 
off-screen because now the image has a

top right reference point at 0 0 ok

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.550 
top right reference point at 0 0 ok
let's<00:04:09.669> set<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:09.970> back<00:04:10.449> to<00:04:11.519> left<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:13.560> we're

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
let's set it back to left and we're

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.379 
let's set it back to left and we're
going<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:15.539> look<00:04:16.539> at<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:18.090> content

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
going to look at the content

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.369 
going to look at the content
with<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.289> content<00:04:20.829> height<00:04:21.189> properties<00:04:22.090> of

with and content height properties of

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.790 
with and content height properties of
Corona<00:04:23.379> so<00:04:24.219> let's<00:04:24.759> actually<00:04:25.120> start<00:04:25.800> above

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
Corona so let's actually start above

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.119 
Corona so let's actually start above
circle<00:04:27.249> 01<00:04:27.599> say<00:04:28.599> local<00:04:30.090> underscore<00:04:31.090> H<00:04:31.360> capital

underscore w capital display not content

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:53.670 
underscore w capital display not content
with<00:04:47.699> so<00:04:48.699> this<00:04:49.659> particular<00:04:52.199> method<00:04:53.199> here

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
with so this particular method here

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.659 
with so this particular method here
returns<00:04:54.639> the<00:04:55.599> height<00:04:56.020> of<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.770> stage<00:04:57.039> for<00:04:57.460> the

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
returns the height of the stage for the

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.080 
returns the height of the stage for the
device<00:04:57.969> and<00:04:58.300> this<00:04:58.930> one<00:04:59.110> returns<00:04:59.439> the<00:04:59.650> width

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
device and this one returns the width

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.559 
device and this one returns the width
this<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:01.389> advantageous<00:05:01.990> because<00:05:03.569> unless

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
this is advantageous because unless

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.450 
this is advantageous because unless
you're<00:05:04.750> specifically<00:05:05.469> developing<00:05:06.129> for<00:05:06.400> a

you're specifically developing for a

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.580 
you're specifically developing for a
specific<00:05:07.060> platform<00:05:07.960> this<00:05:08.229> is<00:05:08.349> going<00:05:08.529> to

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
specific platform this is going to

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.249 
specific platform this is going to
change<00:05:08.800> on<00:05:09.129> iphone<00:05:10.029> for<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.719> content<00:05:11.110> width

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
change on iphone for the content width

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.540 
change on iphone for the content width
is<00:05:11.469> 640<00:05:12.189> pixels<00:05:12.580> iphone<00:05:13.509> 3gs<00:05:14.080> it's<00:05:14.500> only<00:05:14.740> 320

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
is 640 pixels iphone 3gs it's only 320

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.749 
is 640 pixels iphone 3gs it's only 320

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
on droid devices it varies greatly so

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.309 
on droid devices it varies greatly so
we'll<00:05:18.969> use<00:05:19.830> this<00:05:20.830> particular<00:05:21.120> property

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
we'll use this particular property

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.709 
we'll use this particular property
because<00:05:23.319> it'll<00:05:23.529> allow<00:05:23.740> us<00:05:23.949> flexible

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:24.719 
because it'll allow us flexible

that<00:05:27.729> we're<00:05:28.029> using<00:05:28.830> thankfully<00:05:29.830> when<00:05:30.099> using

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
that we're using thankfully when using

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.459 
that we're using thankfully when using
iOS<00:05:30.969> devices<00:05:31.539> you're<00:05:31.960> really<00:05:32.139> just<00:05:32.169> looking

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
iOS devices you're really just looking

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:37.350 
iOS devices you're really just looking
at<00:05:33.150> twice<00:05:34.150> as<00:05:35.039> wide<00:05:36.039> or<00:05:36.399> twice<00:05:36.639> as<00:05:36.819> tall<00:05:37.029> so

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
at twice as wide or twice as tall so

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.800 
at twice as wide or twice as tall so
that<00:05:37.629> it's<00:05:37.870> not<00:05:38.110> as<00:05:38.370> funky<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.490> deal<00:05:39.669> with<00:05:39.879> so

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
that it's not as funky to deal with so

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.329 
that it's not as funky to deal with so
here's<00:05:41.050> what<00:05:41.199> we'll<00:05:41.319> do<00:05:41.819> we'll<00:05:42.819> set<00:05:43.229> this<00:05:44.229> to<00:05:44.560> 2

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:45.339 
here's what we'll do we'll set this to 2

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.829 
here's what we'll do we'll set this to 2
bottom<00:05:46.029> left<00:05:47.580> left<00:05:48.580> reference<00:05:49.300> point<00:05:49.599> and

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 
bottom left left reference point and

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:55.110 
bottom left left reference point and
we'll<00:05:50.110> set<00:05:50.379> the<00:05:50.560> y<00:05:51.419> equal<00:05:52.419> to<00:05:53.520> display<00:05:54.520> content

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
we'll set the y equal to display content

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.139 
we'll set the y equal to display content
height<00:05:56.639> okay<00:05:57.899> let's<00:05:58.899> see<00:05:59.050> what<00:05:59.080> happens<00:06:00.149> there

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:01.149 
height okay let's see what happens there

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:05.550 
height okay let's see what happens there
it<00:06:01.330> is<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.870> height<00:06:02.139> of<00:06:02.169> this<00:06:03.419> stage<00:06:04.419> is<00:06:04.689> 960

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
it is the height of this stage is 960

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.100 
it is the height of this stage is 960
pixels<00:06:05.919> and<00:06:06.370> that's<00:06:06.969> really<00:06:07.210> what<00:06:07.629> the<00:06:07.899> h

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
pixels and that's really what the h

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.920 
pixels and that's really what the h
represents<00:06:08.949> but<00:06:09.189> if<00:06:09.279> we<00:06:09.399> were<00:06:09.520> on<00:06:09.699> an<00:06:10.360> iphone

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
represents but if we were on an iphone

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.850 
represents but if we were on an iphone
3g<00:06:11.550> it<00:06:12.550> would<00:06:12.669> only<00:06:12.789> be<00:06:12.909> 480<00:06:13.779> pixels<00:06:14.229> but<00:06:14.500> still

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
3g it would only be 480 pixels but still

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.139 
3g it would only be 480 pixels but still
it<00:06:15.009> would<00:06:15.129> be<00:06:15.159> displayed<00:06:15.669> at<00:06:15.879> the<00:06:15.939> bottom

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:16.149 
it would be displayed at the bottom

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:19.139 
it would be displayed at the bottom
which<00:06:16.599> is<00:06:16.629> really<00:06:16.990> nice<00:06:17.169> this<00:06:18.159> also<00:06:18.399> gives<00:06:18.909> us

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.149 
which is really nice this also gives us

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:22.200 
which is really nice this also gives us
the<00:06:19.300> way<00:06:19.449> to<00:06:19.919> easily<00:06:20.919> Center<00:06:21.550> content<00:06:21.939> in<00:06:22.089> the

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
the way to easily Center content in the

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.139 
the way to easily Center content in the
middle<00:06:22.539> of<00:06:22.750> the<00:06:23.439> screen<00:06:23.699> we'll<00:06:24.699> just<00:06:24.939> put

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:25.149 
middle of the screen we'll just put

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:28.050 
middle of the screen we'll just put
Center<00:06:26.039> reference<00:06:27.039> point<00:06:27.339> I<00:06:27.580> believe<00:06:27.940> that's

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
Center reference point I believe that's

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.750 
Center reference point I believe that's
what<00:06:28.300> it<00:06:28.389> is<00:06:28.539> yep

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
what it is yep

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.540 
what it is yep
and<00:06:30.850> now<00:06:31.500> the<00:06:32.500> way<00:06:32.620> you<00:06:32.650> set<00:06:33.010> or<00:06:33.130> something<00:06:33.430> on

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
and now the way you set or something on

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.820 
and now the way you set or something on
the<00:06:33.640> screen<00:06:33.730> is<00:06:34.150> on<00:06:34.570> the<00:06:34.840> X<00:06:35.050> you<00:06:35.380> take<00:06:35.650> the

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
the screen is on the X you take the

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.390 
the screen is on the X you take the
horizontal<00:06:36.430> so<00:06:36.910> that's<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.300> content<00:06:37.960> width

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
horizontal so that's the content width

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.800 
horizontal so that's the content width
divided<00:06:39.400> by<00:06:39.520> 2<00:06:39.580> and<00:06:40.560> on<00:06:41.560> the<00:06:41.680> y<00:06:41.830> you<00:06:41.860> take<00:06:42.430> the

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
divided by 2 and on the y you take the

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.840 
divided by 2 and on the y you take the
content<00:06:43.810> height<00:06:45.840> /<00:06:46.950> to<00:06:47.950> what<00:06:48.430> looks<00:06:48.580> like<00:06:48.670> I

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
content height / to what looks like I

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.210 
content height / to what looks like I
messed<00:06:49.090> up<00:06:49.300> here<00:06:51.780> save<00:06:52.780> it<00:06:52.810> and<00:06:53.170> let's<00:06:53.950> take<00:06:54.160> a

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
messed up here save it and let's take a

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.610 
messed up here save it and let's take a
look<00:06:56.040> so<00:06:57.040> now<00:06:57.280> the<00:06:57.340> button<00:06:57.940> is<00:06:58.620> perfectly

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
look so now the button is perfectly

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.820 
look so now the button is perfectly
centered<00:06:59.950> and<00:07:00.300> this<00:07:01.300> brute<00:07:01.540> this<00:07:01.810> gives<00:07:02.050> you<00:07:02.290> a

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
centered and this brute this gives you a

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.070 
centered and this brute this gives you a
way<00:07:03.430> to<00:07:03.460> perfectly<00:07:04.060> Center<00:07:04.420> items<00:07:04.780> in<00:07:04.930> any

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
way to perfectly Center items in any

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.170 
way to perfectly Center items in any
display<00:07:05.470> groups<00:07:05.740> to<00:07:06.010> you<00:07:06.250> take<00:07:06.490> the<00:07:06.670> width<00:07:06.970> of

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
display groups to you take the width of

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.230 
display groups to you take the width of
the<00:07:07.360> group<00:07:07.620> /<00:07:08.620> 2<00:07:08.860> that<00:07:09.280> gives<00:07:09.310> you<00:07:09.640> its<00:07:09.880> center

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
the group / 2 that gives you its center

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.970 
the group / 2 that gives you its center
and<00:07:10.860> the<00:07:11.860> height<00:07:12.100> the<00:07:12.520> same<00:07:12.730> thing
