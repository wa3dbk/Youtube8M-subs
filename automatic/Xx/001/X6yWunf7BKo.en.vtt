00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.190
 Come let us return to the area 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.990
 changing rooms would be ramirez with a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.000
 great player who embarks on a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.960
 great match in the center of the field as 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.960
 been jaime rodrÃ­guez 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.619
 Well, we are with one of the 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.390
 men of the game because it is not necessary 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.369
 mark to be one of the men of the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.300
 party that such ham is to look good things 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.920
 what games have you done although today I 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.520
 I felt comfortable 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.829
 we all played an excellent game and 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.480
 good a result 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.329
 I think it was fair because we had a 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.420
 excellent level and we were all at the top 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.059
 you could also recover it has 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.949
 recovered all the pass the attack on 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.969
 defense to all sites 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:00.079
 if I just want to help nothing else if and 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.070
 if you can help playing well if you 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.429
 it can help 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.560
 recovering balls making passes and 

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:12.679
 making goals that I am I could not 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.380
 but but I already like a lot 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.119
 tranquility everything also if it arrives not 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.909
 then we must be quiet I 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.490
 I have to be calm and know that 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.530
 I'm fine but I can do that 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.240
 also clear goals or messages but it's 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.509
 looking up you have some companions 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.560
 that are a show and above if 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.049
 we are good to good back up we can 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.970
 hurt and also we can also 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.710
 make goals like today have a result 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.960
 that is fair and five goals what 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.970
 We were all good if I told you 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.619
 ronaldo Christian that comes to you 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.640
 head is not a is a crack is a big 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.170
 player and it's a pleasure to have you here how 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.670
 you feel you've been with the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.350
 team the truth is that you are all already 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.869
 cross father carries your whole life 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.369
 they also serve a very united group all 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.700
 the day in training in games 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.180
 and outside we are united and I think 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.030
 that that also looks inside and also 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.880
 it is reflected in the results 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.269
 positive that everything also the group 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.430
 have when we play here and when 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.350
 we play also we play outside that we are 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.040
 together you also have the feeling of 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.599
 that today's match has been the best 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.670
 I do not know we had already had good matches 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.159
 only today everything came out then why 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.469
 be like that feeling that it was 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.909
 perfect arrive a few days now of 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.349
 rest not for everyone but 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.290
 only for some but good 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.329
 stops selections for you good 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.689
 I guess with a desire to continue again 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.989
 marking winning yes obvious now is a 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:58.310
 male of 15 days this also triumph da 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.920
 It gives a lot of tranquility and also think 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.329
 in what comes October is a month 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.489
 pretty hard 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.290
 thank you very much is also a good one there 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.000
 that highlight the great game let me have been 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.769
 together with modern cross but we leave it 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.840
 so they steal it and also apart from their 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.310
 quality also allows that is what you 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.470
 is allowing ancelotti to a player 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.989
 that comes from being the top scorer of the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.970
 world but what james is doing 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.200
 the sacrifice that he has made today and the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.830
 behavior that has won the team 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.620
 nobody jose luis is brutal 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.420
 the sacrifice is no longer just today 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.520
 today of course he has made a 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.770
 full party in all facets 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.870
 of the game but that ability that has 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.480
 to struggle to cover spaces for 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.400
 travel miles to at all times 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.470
 be a threat to the defenses that 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.060
 they have to secure the pass because they know 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.040
 that the smallest in a divided ball 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.690
 the Colombian is going to take him and he's going to 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.280
 make that recovery an occasion 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.710
 therefore clear goal certainly 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.320
 we are seeing a player totally 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.390
 acclimated to what you want ancelotti 's 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.370
 but to me what I would like to highlight 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.670
 today from james comes a little to collation 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.380
 with the arbitrary comparisons that 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.750
 have made around him and would encourage 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.790
 that is to say when it was spoken of di maria 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.700
 last season I had some records 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.490
 football very good but also 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.500
 predictable and I think the most 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.049
 Novelty that Jaimes brings is that it is a 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.180
 different player that is very difficult to 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.220
 defend by any defense 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.880
 because we've seen him play on his back 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.160
 give heel balls to the hole 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.020
 get in charging in one against one 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.180
 look for a diagonal of a change of 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.340
 orientation appear as a llegador is 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.230
 say it handles previously a very 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.300
 important very few losses of value 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.830
 not to say none always used the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.540
 value is never always supported by a 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.090
 partner and if I do not go the clear pass is 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.850
 able to drive while waiting for him 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.130
 double more players of your team is 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.870
 say the Colombian offers such variant 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.000
 of records that I think is 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.500
 a very uncomfortable player for all 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.850
 defenders as it has happened to the 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.060
 is regulating the welcome committee 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.380
 is already regulating I do not just say that 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:08.280
 When he came, I mentioned it with 23 years 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.390
 of quotation marks had not done anything big 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.280
 Monaco had made a good World Cup but 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.780
 came the realmadrid players who are 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.000
 World Champions European Champions 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.890
 champions of everything and had to adapt 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.300
 I understand what it costs and more in the 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.740
 position that he plays watching those who 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.930
 I had ahead but it's 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.210
 showing that it is not easy to adapt 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.710
 not adapt to the country adapt to a 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.450
 put when you are a star 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.190
 you have to go down and say no now 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.350
 I am and I have to work and I have 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.700
 work for them but still has 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.710
 a personality as he says 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.810
 I totally agree with him 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.670
 that he gives you all things apart from 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.200
 work as you have worked that is where 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.970
 what you have to do and sure what 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.110
 have to do more and I am first that 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.880
 I have to demand it because it does not go in a 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.610
 year nor two years to get the level 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.140
 after Christian or benzema de bail 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.430
 that has cost you benzema and you 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.950
 you know less badly that you were here 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.270
 supporting james will cost him still 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.430
 a lot but it's true that it has some 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.500
 things that do not give others have that 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.840
 some truth that is that charity that 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.730
 gift that he has but if he adapts to 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.430
 work that we are seeing does not lose 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.430
 that smile as our partner said 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.880
 with players and they tell you that he wants her 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.080
 but he has problems too 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.630
 that already understands 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.670
 reality like that but there are people who come and 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.800
 he says do not care I'm come and I have to 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.840
 to play 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.550
 and he knows where that is why me instead 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.620
 has decided when you get to a site and 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.990
 is that the first worker the first 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.670
 worker is well gone is the 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.070
 even better so there will be from there 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.630
 humility for all the other guys 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.710
 the quality is discussed if on top of it 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.190
 puts that work capacity and 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.190
 sacrifice
