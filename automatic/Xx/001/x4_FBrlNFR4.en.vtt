new triluminos IPS display in these z2

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.400 
new triluminos IPS display in these z2
it's<00:00:40.950> far<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.610> sharper<00:00:42.480> looking<00:00:42.870> better

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it's far more sharper looking better

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.590 
it's far more sharper looking better
colors<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.700> offers<00:00:45.030> also<00:00:45.180> wider

significant improve pound because with
the<00:00:50.520> Z<00:00:50.730> ones<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.420> us<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.570> display<00:00:51.930> we

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the Z ones you want us to display we

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
the Z ones you want us to display we
notice<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.730> washes<00:00:54.180> out

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
notice that it really washes out

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.260 
notice that it really washes out
tremendously<00:00:54.860> compared<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.280> z2<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.879> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
tremendously compared to the z2 here so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.450 
tremendously compared to the z2 here so
here<00:00:57.660> looking<00:00:58.199> straight<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.859> tilted

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
here looking straight on I tilted

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.799 
here looking straight on I tilted
slightly<00:00:59.899> you'll<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.230> how<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.440> z1<00:01:02.129> s<00:01:02.280> display

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
slightly you'll see how the z1 s display

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
slightly you'll see how the z1 s display
kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.960> fades<00:01:04.500> has<00:01:04.830> Moors<00:01:05.129> Distortion

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
kind of fades has Moors Distortion

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.790 

you<00:01:12.790> could<00:01:12.940> see<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.390> it's<00:01:13.630> like<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.930> yellowish

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
you could see that it's like a yellowish

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.300 
you could see that it's like a yellowish
hue<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.610> happens<00:01:16.060> with<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.650> z1s<00:01:17.680> display

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
hue that happens with the z1s display

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.820 
hue that happens with the z1s display
immerses<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.960> disease<00:01:19.960> here<00:01:20.200> does<00:01:20.380> ET<00:01:20.620> just

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
immerses the disease here does ET just

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.070 
immerses the disease here does ET just
maintains<00:01:21.250> its<00:01:21.460> clarity<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:21.970> lot<00:01:22.300> better<00:01:22.660> so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
maintains its clarity a lot better so

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.200 
maintains its clarity a lot better so
let's<00:01:23.320> show<00:01:23.740> this<00:01:23.890> again<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.940> here<00:01:25.090> just
