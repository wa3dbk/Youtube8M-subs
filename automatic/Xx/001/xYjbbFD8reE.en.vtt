I'm going to use my phone and I'm going
to<00:00:36.210> tie<00:00:36.510> myself<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.920> exactly<00:00:38.250> how

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to tie myself so you know exactly how

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.400 
to tie myself so you know exactly how
long<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.270> actually<00:00:39.329> takes<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.379> done

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.229 

let's<00:00:45.039> heat<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.309> up<00:00:45.519> it<00:00:45.730> just<00:00:45.760> shows<00:00:46.210> a

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
let's heat it up it just shows a

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.410 
let's heat it up it just shows a
constant<00:00:46.960> bright<00:00:47.230> red<00:00:47.500> light<00:00:47.769> there<00:00:48.420> you've

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
constant bright red light there you've

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.119 
constant bright red light there you've
got<00:00:49.750> two<00:00:50.379> settings<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.930> terms<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.379> heat<00:00:53.589> just

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
got two settings in terms of heat just

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.189 
got two settings in terms of heat just
one<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.550> two<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.059> then<00:00:55.629> you<00:00:55.839> have<00:00:55.930> a<00:00:56.019> choice

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
one and two and then you have a choice

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.410 
one and two and then you have a choice
of<00:00:56.500> eight<00:00:56.769> ten<00:00:57.309> or<00:00:57.489> twelve<00:00:57.730> seconds<00:00:58.149> of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
of eight ten or twelve seconds of

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.959 
of eight ten or twelve seconds of
putting<00:00:58.690> it<00:00:58.809> under<00:00:59.170> 12<00:00:59.409> seconds<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.760> let's

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
putting it under 12 seconds so let's

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.799 
putting it under 12 seconds so let's
start<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.510> timer<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.370> because<00:01:04.269> it<00:01:04.479> doesn't

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
start the timer so because it doesn't

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.090 
start the timer so because it doesn't
take<00:01:05.049> too<00:01:05.320> much<00:01:05.350> here<00:01:05.799> you<00:01:06.039> have<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.460> be<00:01:08.100> using

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
take too much here you have to be using

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.930 
take too much here you have to be using
about<00:01:09.520> half<00:01:10.030> an<00:01:10.240> inch<00:01:11.280> I'm<00:01:12.280> very<00:01:12.640> good<00:01:12.850> at

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
about half an inch I'm very good at

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.820 
about half an inch I'm very good at
estimating<00:01:13.090> but<00:01:13.810> just<00:01:13.990> give<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.289> go<00:01:14.500> and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
estimating but just give it a go and

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.490 
estimating but just give it a go and
then<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:15.970> says<00:01:16.210> on<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.539> front<00:01:16.600> there<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.319> have

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
then it says on the front there you have

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.279 
then it says on the front there you have
to<00:01:17.619> have<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:17.920> side<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.550> your<00:01:18.729> hip<00:01:18.940> as<00:01:19.929> you<00:01:19.990> put

practicing how to use it one big tip

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.810 
practicing how to use it one big tip
definitely<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.590> can't<00:02:46.830> take<00:02:47.100> more<00:02:47.490> than

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
definitely is it can't take more than

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.290 
definitely is it can't take more than
half<00:02:48.300> an<00:02:48.510> inch<00:02:48.630> strand<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.710> dagger<00:02:50.010> cuz<00:02:50.970> then<00:02:51.120> it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
half an inch strand a dagger cuz then it

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.270 
half an inch strand a dagger cuz then it
then<00:02:51.480> tends<00:02:51.960> just<00:02:52.380> little<00:02:52.590> clock<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.100> bit

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
then tends just little clock it a bit

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.680 
then tends just little clock it a bit
thank<00:02:53.610> gosh<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.030> can't<00:02:54.240> let's<00:02:54.360> check<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
thank gosh you can't let's check the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.570 
thank gosh you can't let's check the
timer<00:02:54.930> now<00:02:58.400> haha

timer now haha
it<00:03:00.150> took<00:03:00.480> 33<00:03:01.050> minutes<00:03:02.870> find<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.110> curls

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
it took 33 minutes find that the curls

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.760 
it took 33 minutes find that the curls
hold<00:03:05.340> really<00:03:06.060> well<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:07.110> they<00:03:07.260> soften<00:03:07.650> up

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
hold really well and they soften up

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
lot better and I actually did those

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.570 
lot better and I actually did those
while<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.080> was<00:03:19.290> watching<00:03:19.500> television<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.340> it's

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
while I was watching television so it's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.830 
while I was watching television so it's
something<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.150> consider<00:03:21.570> doing

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
something that you can consider doing

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.070 
something that you can consider doing
because<00:03:22.710> it<00:03:22.830> takes<00:03:23.040> 33<00:03:23.940> minutes<00:03:24.270> yeah<00:03:24.510> 33

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
because it takes 33 minutes yeah 33

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.220 
because it takes 33 minutes yeah 33
minutes<00:03:25.410> gosh<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:26.040> long<00:03:26.190> time<00:03:26.430> isn't<00:03:26.640> it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
minutes gosh that's a long time isn't it

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.290 
minutes gosh that's a long time isn't it
but<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.590> know<00:03:28.710> I<00:03:28.950> think<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:29.880> still<00:03:30.030> quite

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
but you know I think it's still quite

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.960 
but you know I think it's still quite
nice<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:31.500> more<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> goody<00:03:32.400> locks<00:03:32.700> look

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
nice it's more like a goody locks look

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.050 
nice it's more like a goody locks look
so<00:03:33.450> yeah<00:03:34.380> if<00:03:34.680> that's<00:03:34.860> what<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.280> want<00:03:35.520> but<00:03:35.820> then

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
so yeah if that's what you want but then

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.790
