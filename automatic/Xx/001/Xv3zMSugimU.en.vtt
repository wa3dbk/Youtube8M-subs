ten<00:00:04.910> years<00:00:05.120> of<00:00:05.210> physical<00:00:05.359> conference<00:00:05.990> and<00:00:06.170> uh

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
ten years of physical conference and uh

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.500 
ten years of physical conference and uh
you<00:00:06.620> know<00:00:06.649> many<00:00:07.460> players<00:00:07.639> you<00:00:07.819> know<00:00:08.210> a<00:00:08.240> lot<00:00:08.480> of

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
you know many players you know a lot of

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.270 
you know many players you know a lot of
big<00:00:08.720> man<00:00:08.900> in<00:00:09.110> a<00:00:09.139> lot<00:00:09.469> of<00:00:09.559> different<00:00:09.590> places<00:00:09.860> and

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
big man in a lot of different places and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.409 
big man in a lot of different places and
I<00:00:10.400> think<00:00:10.700> we<00:00:10.759> played<00:00:10.940> everybody<00:00:11.150> you<00:00:11.389> know

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:11.419 
I think we played everybody you know

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.049 
I think we played everybody you know
especially<00:00:11.780> you<00:00:12.230> had<00:00:12.349> that<00:00:12.499> good<00:00:13.160> run<00:00:13.370> NCAA

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.000 
especially you had that good run NCAA
tournament<00:00:14.509> so<00:00:14.690> I<00:00:14.900> think<00:00:15.230> you<00:00:15.410> know<00:00:15.440> that<00:00:15.530> that

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
tournament so I think you know that that

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.440 
tournament so I think you know that that
would<00:00:16.129> really<00:00:16.280> really<00:00:16.850> good<00:00:17.090> for<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:17.270> next

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
would really really good for the next

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.550 
would really really good for the next
level<00:00:18.189> this<00:00:19.189> my<00:00:19.849> fifth<00:00:20.090> try<00:00:20.269> out<00:00:20.449> and<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:21.320> mean

after the early entry list an

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.920 
after the early entry list an
announcement<00:01:27.950> comes<00:01:28.189> on<00:01:28.490> jun<00:01:28.790> 15th<00:01:29.360> is<00:01:29.689> when<00:01:29.900> I

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
announcement comes on jun 15th is when I

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.080 
announcement comes on jun 15th is when I
think<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:30.560> kind<00:01:31.009> of<00:01:31.130> go<00:01:31.250> into<00:01:31.399> lockdown<00:01:31.579> mode

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
think you kind of go into lockdown mode

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.270 
think you kind of go into lockdown mode
and<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:33.049> don't<00:01:33.200> mean<00:01:33.290> you<00:01:33.439> make<00:01:33.590> decisions<00:01:33.770> but

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
and I don't mean you make decisions but

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.969 
and I don't mean you make decisions but
I<00:01:34.610> think<00:01:34.909> that<00:01:35.149> it's<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:35.780> take<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.290> intensity

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
I think that it's you take the intensity

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.130 
I think that it's you take the intensity
up<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.340> whole<00:01:37.640> different<00:01:37.700> level<00:01:38.329> I<00:01:38.659> think

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
up to a whole different level I think

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.520 
up to a whole different level I think
that<00:01:39.320> in<00:01:39.470> our<00:01:39.590> situation<00:01:40.689> I<00:01:41.689> think<00:01:42.409> we<00:01:42.500> all

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
that in our situation I think we all

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.319 
that in our situation I think we all
understand<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.310> team<00:01:43.520> if<00:01:43.670> al<00:01:43.850> hadn't

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
understand that the team if al hadn't

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.539 
understand that the team if al hadn't
gotten<00:01:44.570> hurt<00:01:44.960> would<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:46.009> been<00:01:46.219> a<00:01:46.250> better

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
gotten hurt would have been a better

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.730 
gotten hurt would have been a better
team<00:01:46.909> than<00:01:46.939> a<00:01:47.119> finish<00:01:47.540> but<00:01:47.840> by<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.469> same<00:01:48.680> token

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
team than a finish but by the same token

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.889 
team than a finish but by the same token
I<00:01:49.340> don't<00:01:49.820> think<00:01:49.969> anybody<00:01:50.149> would<00:01:50.390> be<00:01:50.600> saying

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
I don't think anybody would be saying

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.270 
I don't think anybody would be saying
well<00:01:51.110> that's<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.439> kind<00:01:51.649> of<00:01:51.710> team<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:51.950> is

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
well that's the kind of team that is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.700 
well that's the kind of team that is
ready<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.850> compete<00:01:53.270> for<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.509> championship<00:01:53.710> so

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
ready to compete for a championship so

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.819 
ready to compete for a championship so
we<00:01:55.100> need<00:01:55.369> help<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:57.020> every<00:01:57.320> way<00:01:57.439> shape<00:01:57.469> and<00:01:57.680> form

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
we need help in every way shape and form

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.800 
we need help in every way shape and form
and<00:01:58.520> we<00:01:58.700> need<00:01:58.880> length<00:01:59.149> we<00:01:59.390> need<00:01:59.509> perimeter

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
and we need length we need perimeter

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.630 
and we need length we need perimeter
shooting<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:00.350> need<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.799> know<00:02:00.920> guard<00:02:01.340> play

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
shooting we need you know guard play

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.910 
shooting we need you know guard play
there's<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.509> lot<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.780> things<00:02:03.110> that<00:02:03.200> we<00:02:03.409> need<00:02:03.590> and

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
there's a lot of things that we need and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.819 
there's a lot of things that we need and
so<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.880> one<00:02:05.240> level<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:05.869> hope<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.200> comes<00:02:06.680> across

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
so in one level I hope this comes across

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.940 
so in one level I hope this comes across
the<00:02:07.159> right<00:02:07.340> way<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.789> think<00:02:08.539> for<00:02:08.750> us<00:02:08.840> perhaps<00:02:09.619> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
the right way I think for us perhaps the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.440 
the right way I think for us perhaps the
draft<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.430> little<00:02:10.730> bit<00:02:10.820> easier<00:02:11.120> than<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.390> is

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
draft is a little bit easier than it is

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.150 
draft is a little bit easier than it is
for<00:02:11.630> other<00:02:11.750> teams<00:02:12.340> we<00:02:13.340> have<00:02:13.820> some<00:02:14.420> holes

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
for other teams we have some holes

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.730 
for other teams we have some holes
that<00:02:16.550> need<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.940> be<00:02:16.970> filled<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.510> as<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> result

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
that need to be filled and as a result

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.680 
that need to be filled and as a result
you<00:02:19.250> know<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.550> not<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:19.880> if<00:02:19.910> we're<00:02:20.210> trying<00:02:20.480> to

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
you know it's not as if we're trying to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.260 
you know it's not as if we're trying to
you<00:02:21.380> know<00:02:21.440> find<00:02:21.740> one<00:02:22.070> type<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.700> person<00:02:23.240> that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
you know find one type of person that

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.850 
you know find one type of person that
will<00:02:23.510> make<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:23.780> team<00:02:24.020> better<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.410> think<00:02:24.560> that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
will make this team better I think that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.480 
will make this team better I think that
we<00:02:24.950> need<00:02:24.980> several<00:02:25.460> types<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:26.030> persons
