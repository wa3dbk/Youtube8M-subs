really tricky little players nice little
ball<00:05:35.990> over<00:05:36.229> here<00:05:36.349> from<00:05:36.590> Pogba<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:37.400> look<00:05:37.520> at

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
ball over here from Pogba and look at

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.370 
ball over here from Pogba and look at
that<00:05:37.729> from<00:05:38.030> weak<00:05:38.270> foot<00:05:38.509> volley<00:05:38.810> from<00:05:39.020> rubery

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
that from weak foot volley from rubery

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.709 
that from weak foot volley from rubery
that's<00:05:39.590> just<00:05:39.800> tidy<00:05:40.130> I<00:05:40.430> really<00:05:40.849> really<00:05:41.270> like<00:05:41.449> it

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
that's just tidy I really really like it

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.020 
that's just tidy I really really like it
and<00:05:42.469> then<00:05:42.710> right<00:05:42.919> here<00:05:42.949> I<00:05:43.159> believe<00:05:43.310> this<00:05:43.699> may

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
and then right here I believe this may

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.490 
and then right here I believe this may
be<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.419> header<00:05:44.599> that<00:05:44.690> we<00:05:44.900> scored<00:05:45.229> within

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
be the header that we scored within

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.920 
be the header that we scored within
which<00:05:45.710> is<00:05:45.979> a<00:05:46.039> bit<00:05:46.610> weird<00:05:46.639> because<00:05:47.479> that<00:05:47.690> was<00:05:47.810> an

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
which is a bit weird because that was an

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.930 
which is a bit weird because that was an
informant<00:05:48.440> kullu<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.250> he<00:05:49.340> beats<00:05:49.550> in<00:05:49.729> the<00:05:49.820> air

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
informant kullu that he beats in the air

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.969 
informant kullu that he beats in the air
and<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:50.210> don't<00:05:50.419> feel<00:05:50.690> that<00:05:50.930> that's<00:05:51.620> really

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
and I don't feel that that's really

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.040 
and I don't feel that that's really
legit<00:05:52.520> it's<00:05:52.820> also<00:05:53.000> got<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.300> great<00:05:53.509> free<00:05:53.690> kick<00:05:53.900> on

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050
