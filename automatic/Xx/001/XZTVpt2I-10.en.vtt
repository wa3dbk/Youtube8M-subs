minutes<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.200> something<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.629> got

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
minutes or something like that I got

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.920 
minutes or something like that I got
very<00:00:39.690> close<00:00:40.260> once<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.210> your<00:00:42.210> trap<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.690> start

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
very close once but your trap they start

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.540 
very close once but your trap they start
taking<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.410> traps<00:00:43.680> away<00:00:43.950> when<00:00:44.129> you've<00:00:44.280> used

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
taking your traps away when you've used

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.950 
taking your traps away when you've used
them<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:44.879> than<00:00:45.000> once<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.690> pretty

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
them more than once and it is pretty

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.860 
them more than once and it is pretty
difficult<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.670> there's<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:47.789> much<00:00:48.000> replay

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
difficult but there's not much replay

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.950 
difficult but there's not much replay

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
probably asking well I got really far in

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.510 
probably asking well I got really far in
the<00:01:15.150> game<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.350> decided<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the game and then it decided that the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.740 
the game and then it decided that the
battery<00:01:17.790> pack<00:01:18.060> wasn't<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> work

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
battery pack wasn't going to work

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.740 
battery pack wasn't going to work
anymore<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:20.700> never<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> energy<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.540> do

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
anymore and I never got the energy to do

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.570 
anymore and I never got the energy to do
it<00:01:21.869> again<00:01:22.110> although<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.710> tried<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> couple

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it again although I have tried a couple

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
it again although I have tried a couple
times<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> battery<00:01:24.689> pack<00:01:24.869> always<00:01:25.080> dies

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
times but the battery pack always dies

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.359 
times but the battery pack always dies
out<00:01:25.650> very<00:01:25.860> fast<00:01:26.600> it's<00:01:27.600> very<00:01:27.869> discouraging<00:01:28.369> but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
out very fast it's very discouraging but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.679 
out very fast it's very discouraging but
I'll<00:01:29.490> probably<00:01:29.729> play<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.180> an<00:01:30.270> emulator<00:01:30.360> or

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
I'll probably play it on an emulator or

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.600 
I'll probably play it on an emulator or
something<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.229> finish<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
something and finish it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.789 
something and finish it
Megaman<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
Megaman the first one and it's the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.920 
Megaman the first one and it's the
crappy<00:01:35.130> box<00:01:35.340> art<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.909> Megaman<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.420> his<00:01:36.659> gun

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
crappy box art with Megaman and his gun

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.950 
crappy box art with Megaman and his gun
in<00:01:37.290> his<00:01:37.579> yellow<00:01:38.750> suit<00:01:39.750> uh<00:01:40.880> we<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.810> one

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
in his yellow suit uh we like this one

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.719 
in his yellow suit uh we like this one
as<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> other<00:01:43.619> ones<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.070> classic

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
as much as the other ones it's classic

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.139 
as much as the other ones it's classic
but<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:46.310> don't<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.430> can't<00:01:47.729> beat<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> either

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
but I don't know I can't beat it either

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.420 
but I don't know I can't beat it either
maybe<00:01:48.509> that's<00:01:48.750> why<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.619> got<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.100> Wily's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
maybe that's why but I got to Wily's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.359 
maybe that's why but I got to Wily's
fortress<00:01:51.560> numerous<00:01:52.560> times<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.040> that's<00:01:53.220> about

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
fortress numerous times and that's about

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
fortress numerous times and that's about
as<00:01:53.520> far<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.960> game

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
as far as I can get and then it's game

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.450 
as far as I can get and then it's game
over<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.280> me

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
over for me

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
over for me
Megaman<00:01:59.460> 2<00:01:59.759> arguably<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.350> best<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
Megaman 2 arguably the best of the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.590 
Megaman 2 arguably the best of the
series<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:03.360> 2<00:02:03.540> &amp;<00:02:03.719> 3<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:04.439> kind<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.890> equal

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
series I think 2 &amp; 3 are kind of equal

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.719 
series I think 2 &amp; 3 are kind of equal
