everyone was like all right let's do
this<00:00:54.600> could<00:00:54.989> eat<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.379> more<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
this could eat a little more at the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
this could eat a little more at the
pregame<00:00:56.370> meal<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> we're<00:00:56.789> off<00:00:56.910> playing

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
pregame meal and we're off playing

against<00:00:58.020> brazil<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.739> always<00:00:59.309> good<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> i

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
against brazil is always good and i

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.119 
against brazil is always good and i
think<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.559> first<00:01:01.770> half<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.820> speed<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.239> play

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
think the first half the speed of play

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.660 
think the first half the speed of play
was<00:01:05.129> scored<00:01:05.430> two<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.570> goals<00:01:07.310> we<00:01:08.310> look<00:01:08.460> good

seen Brazil and be flashy and our
commitment<00:01:39.689> was<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.079> stay<00:01:40.350> together<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
commitment was to stay together as a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.370 
commitment was to stay together as a
team<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.400> find<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> space<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.930> think<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
team and find the space and I think that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.569 
team and find the space and I think that
that<00:01:43.409> space<00:01:43.770> ended<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.130> being<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.310> front<00:01:44.460> of

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that space ended up being in front of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.980 
that space ended up being in front of
the<00:01:44.640> forwards<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.299> did<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> great<00:01:45.659> job<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the forwards and they did a great job of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.289 
the forwards and they did a great job of
controlling<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.040> ball<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.549> obviously

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
controlling the ball and obviously

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.450 
controlling the ball and obviously
setting<00:01:48.659> play<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.350> first<00:01:49.619> goal<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
setting play the first goal was a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.170 
setting play the first goal was a
beautiful<00:01:51.060> ball<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.479> by<00:01:51.600> Christy<00:01:52.049> uh<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:53.180> don't

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
even know if I hit anything first it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.109 
even know if I hit anything first it
literally<00:01:55.979> kind<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.399> went<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
literally kind of just went in and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.240 
literally kind of just went in and
somehow<00:01:57.630> hit<00:01:58.079> my<00:01:58.229> heel<00:01:58.560> which<00:01:58.710> I'd<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.070> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
somehow hit my heel which I'd like to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
somehow hit my heel which I'd like to
say<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> did<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> he'll<00:02:00.030> pass<00:02:00.240> although<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
say I did a he'll pass although it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260 
say I did a he'll pass although it
wasn't<00:02:01.170> quite<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.530> purpose<00:02:01.799> uh<00:02:01.979> who<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.090> then

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
wasn't quite on purpose uh who and then

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.270 
wasn't quite on purpose uh who and then
yeah<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.750> then<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> think<00:02:04.530> curly<00:02:04.890> finished<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
yeah and then I think curly finished it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.830 
yeah and then I think curly finished it
off<00:02:05.399> we'd<00:02:05.729> been<00:02:05.880> working<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.240> corners<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
off we'd been working on corners and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.449 
off we'd been working on corners and
making<00:02:07.110> sure<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.740> goals<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.099> set<00:02:08.280> plays

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
making sure we get goals on set plays
