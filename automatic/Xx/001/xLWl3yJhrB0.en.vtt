00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.840
 Hello everyone I am planning and if I am 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.670
 Who took your tooth as I was base 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.570
 good in this tutorial I will teach you 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:30.400
 to get the last record of 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.770
 minecraft discs of music is 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.590
 a secret and good disc I'm going to 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.230
 teach how to get him to create good at 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.020
 create it the first thing we have to do 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.670
 it is a wooden peak only that is a 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.320
 aesthetic would be a little special 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.690
 you have to do it in green with two 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.060
 wooden sticks here two rods 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.310
 flaming the flames there 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.750
 in hell we put them here and it gives us 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.030
 a peak that looks like a stone peak no 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.100
 It is normal wood but you give a peak 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.500
 of special wood because good for 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.670
 now let's come here to a pleasant 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.520
 of diamond and we started to chop it 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.000
 well this is a bit absurd but it's the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.800
 trick to get the last disc 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.560
 what are you going to like 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.580
 come on come on come on come on come on now 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.409
 point of breaking and there is the disc what 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.200
 we can pick up 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.140
 is a troll disc is called like that then 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.539
 now we are going to put it here and as 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.670
 you can be listening to only one melody 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.520
 that you had not heard in a center 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.530
 minecraft and well then this city of 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.890
 tutorial I will invite you as the case 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.649
 means maybe the rights of youtube 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.270
 they recognize it or something and well we see each other in 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.270
 the next video goodbye 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.680
 to say is because I just discovered it 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.280
 now is that if so if you leave the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.970
 you will appear this is that you have 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.490
 changed the letters a bit but the smell 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.509
 and well this has a little bit of 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.369
 that when you invoke that disc I change you 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.619
 a little bit of minecraft when you come out of 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.470
 game and good you see this good I say 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.020
