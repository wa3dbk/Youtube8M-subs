00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
think the majority I think the main

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.110 
think the majority I think the main
reason<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.280> just<00:03:54.580> because<00:03:54.790> they're<00:03:54.970> not

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
reason of that just because they're not

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.050 
reason of that just because they're not

pretty sure 2004 if we came out 2004
it's<00:04:06.310> been<00:04:06.430> six<00:04:06.790> years<00:04:06.880> since<00:04:07.390> they've<00:04:07.750> had<00:04:07.990> a

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
it's been six years since they've had a

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.949 
it's been six years since they've had a
change<00:04:08.440> basically<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.280> people<00:04:10.150> have<00:04:10.300> proved

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
change basically and people have proved

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.050 
change basically and people have proved
played<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.410> like<00:04:11.560> myself<00:04:11.770> since<00:04:12.220> 2004<00:04:12.850> when<00:04:12.970> it

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
played it like myself since 2004 when it

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.470 
played it like myself since 2004 when it
came<00:04:13.240> out<00:04:14.459> changing<00:04:15.459> from<00:04:15.850> something<00:04:16.270> that

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
came out changing from something that

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.860 
came out changing from something that
you<00:04:16.780> played<00:04:17.080> for<00:04:17.709> six<00:04:17.830> years<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:19.359> to

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
you played for six years this to

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.900 
you played for six years this to
something<00:04:20.080> like<00:04:20.440> this<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.859> understand<00:04:21.609> how<00:04:21.730> it

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
something like this I understand how it

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.800 
something like this I understand how it
can<00:04:22.000> be<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.390> little<00:04:22.840> bit

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
can be a little bit

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.740 
can be a little bit
a<00:04:24.960> little<00:04:25.680> bit<00:04:25.770> hard<00:04:25.950> or<00:04:26.280> challenging<00:04:26.760> but<00:04:27.389> I

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
a little bit hard or challenging but I

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.970 
a little bit hard or challenging but I
think<00:04:28.290> I<00:04:28.440> think<00:04:28.710> given<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:30.230> week<00:04:31.230> or<00:04:31.500> two<00:04:31.710> maybe

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
think I think given a week or two maybe

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.310 
think I think given a week or two maybe
even<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.220> month<00:04:32.460> for<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.270> lot<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.450> people<00:04:33.570> they'll

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
even a month for a lot of people they'll

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.840 
even a month for a lot of people they'll
grow<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.919> they'll<00:04:35.130> grow<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.060> like<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.360> and

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
grow to it they'll grow to like it and

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.610 
grow to it they'll grow to like it and
and<00:04:38.850> everyone<00:04:39.540> just<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:40.260> be<00:04:40.350> kind<00:04:40.470> of

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
and everyone just just be kind of

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.110 
and everyone just just be kind of
Shriker<00:04:40.770> but<00:04:41.010> it's<00:04:41.250> it's<00:04:41.460> not<00:04:41.760> going<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.000> be<00:04:42.090> a

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
Shriker but it's it's not going to be a

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.030 
Shriker but it's it's not going to be a
problem<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.720> think<00:04:43.290> all<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.440> people<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.800> hate

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
problem I think all the people that hate

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.400 
problem I think all the people that hate
it<00:04:44.190> now<00:04:44.220> or<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.820> think<00:04:45.450> at<00:04:45.570> least<00:04:45.900> eighty<00:04:46.230> five

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
it now or I think at least eighty five

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.200 
it now or I think at least eighty five
percent<00:04:46.470> of<00:04:46.889> them<00:04:47.010> will<00:04:47.250> convert<00:04:47.880> just<00:04:48.120> feel

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
percent of them will convert just feel

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.310 
percent of them will convert just feel
like<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.389> know<00:04:48.450> it's<00:04:48.690> not<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:48.870> bad<00:04:49.110> of<00:04:49.169> a

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
like you know it's not that bad of a

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.550 
like you know it's not that bad of a
game<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:49.680> still<00:04:50.610> very<00:04:50.910> fundamental<00:04:51.540> um<00:04:54.560> yeah

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
game it's still very fundamental um yeah

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.240 
game it's still very fundamental um yeah
so<00:04:55.800> that's<00:04:55.980> that's<00:04:56.280> basically<00:04:56.790> it<00:04:56.940> um<00:04:58.250> what

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
so that's that's basically it um what

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.450 
so that's that's basically it um what
else<00:04:59.400> is<00:04:59.580> there<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.850> say<00:04:59.880> it's<00:05:00.800> um<00:05:01.800> it's<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.280> fun

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
else is there to say it's um it's a fun

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.379 
else is there to say it's um it's a fun
game<00:05:02.490> there's<00:05:02.850> again<00:05:03.060> like<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.360> mentioned
