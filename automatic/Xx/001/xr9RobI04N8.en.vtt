is<00:03:49.360> your<00:03:50.049> calf<00:03:50.320> part<00:03:50.769> because<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.190> does<00:03:51.370> not

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
is your calf part because it does not

is your calf part because it does not
scratch<00:03:52.209> but<00:03:53.170> because<00:03:53.980> it's<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.310> leather<00:03:54.549> boot

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940
