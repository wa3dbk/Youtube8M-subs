 that day nantier that this gift is going to want 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.009
 play the shot thoroughly 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.509
 the Ardennes have only three points 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.700
 delay on nantes the calculation is fast 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.799
 done but obviously this gift is not 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 in vein the proof this poor hood that 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.270
 from the start tricks his own guardian 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.430
 Yes 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.820
 sedan then tries to catch up 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.160
 by making the game a bit more fluid 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.160
 nantaise to a touch of ndieffi ball 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.800

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.800
 this ball equalization lampitt 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.660
 to nantes since then to be respected 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.440
 at the very high 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.830
 sylvain armand launches in depth ziani 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.470
 who in the wake live center tours 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:02.600
 Moldovan once again when he plays 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.600
 as it is noted the are unbeatable 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.480
 and tonight they'll be ten minutes 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.260
 later on this lost ball in the middle 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.710
 ground 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.700
 the class one two monterrubio moldovan 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.640
 monterrubio 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.530
 that's 3 and that's good because of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.550
 his side always lille co leader is in 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.550
 train to win at toulouse 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 and 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.380
 lee 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380
 Oh 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.750
 so the idea when we lead 3 busin is 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.830
 to heal the goal difference we know 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.140
 never it can serve 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.270
 and this lembe water that just entered 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.250
 who will do it alone raid that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.660
 left from the left to end in 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:16.459
 lax and at the bottom of the foot the fourth goal 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.990
 a nice demonstration that allow 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.380
 to the nantes to stay glued to 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.380
 Lille 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.550
 the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.550
 m 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.930
 when we think that a year earlier these 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.580
 young people look well believed to go down in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.420
 d2 it is to understand nothing in 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.440
 sir eric besnard mie cuddly a 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.300
 question I would like to ask you when 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.340
 even last year at the same time you 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.720
 fight to avoid relegation you 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.160
 are saved on the last day 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.260
 it's the same group this year 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.340
 what has changed but already the group 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.380
 is not completely identical 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.670
 since there were four five arrivals there 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.040
 there was sylvain armand there was nicolas 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.540
 the patches mathieu berson who was playing my 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.910
 last year that plays more each 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.650
 print season so we know it's a 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.970
 group that is expanding it's a group that 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.410
 experience also since 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.790
 it's the third or fourth season 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.830
 so we know that maturity 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.300
 Marc's experience is important there 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.880
 had the coach too this is his third 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.590
 season so everything is done so that one 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.160
 succeed well now we never know 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.160
 you're going to go
