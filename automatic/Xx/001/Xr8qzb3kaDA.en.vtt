the shape that I have right now I have
115<00:00:17.000> and<00:00:17.240> originally<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:18.020> had<00:00:18.439> bought<00:00:18.680> 130<00:00:19.250> and

115 and originally I had bought 130 and

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.700 
115 and originally I had bought 130 and
220<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:20.480> see<00:00:20.630> which<00:00:20.779> one<00:00:20.930> would<00:00:21.050> match<00:00:21.259> my<00:00:21.289> skin

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
220 to see which one would match my skin

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.859 
220 to see which one would match my skin
tone<00:00:21.740> better<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.550> it<00:00:23.060> turns<00:00:23.269> out<00:00:23.449> that<00:00:23.630> both

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
tone better and it turns out that both

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.210 
tone better and it turns out that both
of<00:00:23.900> them<00:00:24.199> were<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.380> little<00:00:24.529> bit<00:00:24.740> too<00:00:24.859> dark<00:00:25.160> for

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
of them were a little bit too dark for

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.290 
of them were a little bit too dark for
my<00:00:25.460> liking<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.510> I<00:00:26.539> went<00:00:27.019> back<00:00:27.289> to<00:00:27.619> find<00:00:28.300> 120

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
my liking so I went back to find 120

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.669 
my liking so I went back to find 120
because<00:00:29.630> I<00:00:29.660> feel<00:00:30.050> like<00:00:30.199> that<00:00:30.349> would<00:00:30.470> be<00:00:30.650> a

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
because I feel like that would be a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.850 
because I feel like that would be a
little<00:00:31.039> bit<00:00:31.160> lighter<00:00:31.429> and<00:00:31.820> perfect<00:00:32.720> but<00:00:33.050> they

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
little bit lighter and perfect but they

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.460 
little bit lighter and perfect but they
did<00:00:34.040> not<00:00:34.160> have<00:00:34.339> that<00:00:34.420> so<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.780> next<00:00:35.900> one<00:00:36.170> up<00:00:36.290> was

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
did not have that so the next one up was

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.710 
did not have that so the next one up was
115<00:00:37.100> if<00:00:37.339> I<00:00:37.489> am<00:00:37.640> aware<00:00:37.850> that<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:38.420> one<00:00:38.600> or

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
115 if I am aware that this is one or

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.450 
115 if I am aware that this is one or
two<00:00:38.750> shades<00:00:38.930> lighter<00:00:39.470> than<00:00:39.589> my<00:00:39.739> actual<00:00:40.010> skin

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
two shades lighter than my actual skin

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.280 
two shades lighter than my actual skin
tone<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.150> would<00:00:41.269> be<00:00:41.479> perfect<00:00:41.930> for<00:00:41.960> me<00:00:42.170> in

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
tone and it would be perfect for me in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.049 
tone and it would be perfect for me in
the<00:00:42.379> winter<00:00:42.470> time<00:00:42.860> but<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.610> all<00:00:43.760> they<00:00:43.879> had

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.970 

and<00:01:19.250> start<00:01:19.940> blending<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.420> in<00:01:20.690> really<00:01:21.200> fast

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:32.590 

this<00:01:24.980> actually<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:26.240> very<00:01:26.900> blendable

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.660

you don't have to apply it all at once

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.700 
you don't have to apply it all at once
you<00:01:34.880> can<00:01:35.060> actually<00:01:35.299> just<00:01:35.689> apply<00:01:36.020> at<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.229> certain

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
you can actually just apply at a certain

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.910 
you can actually just apply at a certain
spot<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.670> then<00:01:37.970> blend<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.229> then<00:01:39.350> apply<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:39.680> at

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
spot and then blend and then apply it at

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.200 
spot and then blend and then apply it at
another<00:01:40.009> spot<00:01:42.549> but<00:01:43.549> here's<00:01:43.729> what<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.030> looks

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
another spot but here's what it looks

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.969 
another spot but here's what it looks
like<00:01:44.360> completely<00:01:44.840> applied<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:45.470> blended<00:01:45.860> out

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
like completely applied and blended out

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.160 
like completely applied and blended out
I<00:01:46.250> feel<00:01:46.520> like<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.909> very<00:01:47.270> very<00:01:47.750> light

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
I feel like it is a very very light

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.260 
I feel like it is a very very light
coverage<00:01:48.470> which<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.190> perfect<00:01:49.759> for<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.030> summer

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
coverage which is perfect for the summer

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.020 
coverage which is perfect for the summer
in<00:01:50.570> my<00:01:50.750> opinion<00:01:51.229> after<00:01:51.649> I<00:01:51.680> apply<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.759> feel

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
in my opinion after I apply it I feel

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.420 
in my opinion after I apply it I feel
like<00:01:53.299> my<00:01:53.930> nose<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.530> still<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.799> little<00:01:55.070> bit<00:01:55.250> too

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
like my nose is still a little bit too

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.359 
like my nose is still a little bit too
shiny<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.420> what<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.810> do<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:57.619> actually<00:01:57.830> apply

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
shiny so what I do is I actually apply

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.389 
shiny so what I do is I actually apply
my<00:01:58.580> setting<00:01:58.970> powder<00:01:59.210> on<00:01:59.380> just<00:02:00.380> my<00:02:00.680> nose<00:02:00.920> area

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
my setting powder on just my nose area

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.120 
my setting powder on just my nose area
so<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.390> mattifies<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.440> then<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:03.890> can

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
so that it mattifies it and then I can

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.919 
so that it mattifies it and then I can
go<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.399> with<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.670> rest<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.970> my<00:02:05.149> day<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.600> it

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.749 
go on with the rest of my day and it
holds<00:02:06.200> pretty<00:02:06.409> well<00:02:06.710> I'm<00:02:07.220> really<00:02:07.520> conflicted

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
holds pretty well I'm really conflicted

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.580 
holds pretty well I'm really conflicted
with<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.239> finish<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:08.840> product<00:02:09.229> because

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
with the finish of this product because

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.530 
with the finish of this product because
it<00:02:09.920> does<00:02:10.190> give<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.640> glowy<00:02:10.940> look<00:02:11.120> but

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
it does give you a glowy look but

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.330 
it does give you a glowy look but
sometimes<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.410> feel<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.739> it's<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.069> little<00:02:13.220> bit

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
sometimes I feel like it's a little bit

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.160 
sometimes I feel like it's a little bit
too<00:02:13.580> glowy<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.030> people<00:02:14.660> might<00:02:14.810> think<00:02:14.840> that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
too glowy and people might think that

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.110 
too glowy and people might think that
I'm<00:02:15.440> sweating<00:02:15.980> on<00:02:16.100> my<00:02:16.250> cheeks<00:02:16.550> or<00:02:16.760> something

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
I'm sweating on my cheeks or something

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.030 
I'm sweating on my cheeks or something
but<00:02:17.690> for<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.989> most<00:02:18.200> part<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.650> gives<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.010> a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
but for the most part it gives you a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.920 
but for the most part it gives you a
nice<00:02:19.340> glow<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:20.150> product<00:02:20.569> blends<00:02:20.750> really

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
nice glow this product blends really

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.509 
nice glow this product blends really
easily<00:02:21.319> but<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.620> don't<00:02:21.680> feel<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.250> very

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
easily but I don't feel like it's very

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.940 
easily but I don't feel like it's very
buildable<00:02:22.940> because<00:02:23.420> once<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.959> have<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.500> layer

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
buildable because once you have a layer

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.770 
buildable because once you have a layer
of<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.250> on<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.760> try<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.000> put<00:02:26.330> some<00:02:26.510> more<00:02:26.630> in

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
of it on and you try to put some more in

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.630 
of it on and you try to put some more in
a<00:02:26.840> certain<00:02:27.170> area<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.530> blend<00:02:27.799> it<00:02:28.040> out<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.400> don't

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
a certain area and blend it out I don't

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.770 
a certain area and blend it out I don't
see<00:02:28.730> any<00:02:28.940> difference<00:02:29.390> at<00:02:29.569> all

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
see any difference at all

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.360 
see any difference at all
I<00:02:30.019> feel<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.440> during<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.860> summer<00:02:31.069> when<00:02:31.250> you
