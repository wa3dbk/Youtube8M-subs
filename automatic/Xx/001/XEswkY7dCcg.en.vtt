00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
that's totally a myth and here's why see

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.360 
that's totally a myth and here's why see
we've<00:01:16.330> been<00:01:16.480> told<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:17.020> avoid<00:01:17.320> vegetables<00:01:18.220> like

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
we've been told to avoid vegetables like

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.940 
we've been told to avoid vegetables like
peas<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.730> carrots<00:01:19.440> because<00:01:20.440> they're

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
peas and carrots because they're

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.740 
peas and carrots because they're
supposed<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.370> be<00:01:21.520> higher<00:01:21.790> in<00:01:22.060> sugar<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.510> what

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
supposed to be higher in sugar and what

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.480 
supposed to be higher in sugar and what
this<00:01:22.900> does<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.410> gives<00:01:23.740> them<00:01:23.950> a<00:01:24.160> higher

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
this does is it gives them a higher

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.670 
this does is it gives them a higher
number<00:01:25.450> on<00:01:25.900> what's<00:01:26.290> called<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.590> glycemic

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
number on what's called the glycemic

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.860 
number on what's called the glycemic
index<00:01:27.400> scale<00:01:27.970> now<00:01:28.210> if<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:28.390> don't<00:01:28.570> know<00:01:28.690> what

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
index scale now if you don't know what

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.440 
index scale now if you don't know what
the<00:01:28.900> glycemic<00:01:29.440> index<00:01:29.530> scale<00:01:30.040> is<00:01:30.280> it's<00:01:30.910> simply

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
the glycemic index scale is it's simply

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.430 
the glycemic index scale is it's simply
a<00:01:31.660> chart<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.830> analyzes<00:01:33.820> how<00:01:34.300> much<00:01:35.170> a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
a chart that analyzes how much a

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.130 
a chart that analyzes how much a
particular<00:01:36.060> carbohydrate<00:01:37.060> will<00:01:37.600> raise<00:01:37.840> blood

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
particular carbohydrate will raise blood

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.860 
particular carbohydrate will raise blood
sugar<00:01:38.200> or<00:01:38.710> spike<00:01:39.070> insulin<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:39.880> they<00:01:40.390> attach<00:01:40.690> a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
sugar or spike insulin and they attach a

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.590 
sugar or spike insulin and they attach a
number<00:01:41.230> to<00:01:41.410> each<00:01:41.910> carbohydrate<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.120> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
number to each carbohydrate and the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.720 
number to each carbohydrate and the
higher<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.140> number<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.650> more<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.340> will<00:01:45.490> spike

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
higher the number the more it will spike

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.030 
higher the number the more it will spike
insulin<00:01:45.940> well<00:01:46.420> if<00:01:46.630> that's<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.200> case<00:01:47.320> we<00:01:47.830> know

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
insulin well if that's the case we know

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.550 
insulin well if that's the case we know
that<00:01:48.460> these<00:01:49.030> higher<00:01:49.330> number<00:01:49.780> carbohydrates

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
that these higher number carbohydrates

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.590 
that these higher number carbohydrates
should<00:01:50.830> be<00:01:50.950> avoided<00:01:51.490> because<00:01:51.670> we<00:01:52.210> want<00:01:52.420> to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
should be avoided because we want to

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.450 
should be avoided because we want to
keep<00:01:52.780> blood<00:01:53.230> sugar<00:01:53.260> and<00:01:53.620> insulin<00:01:53.740> stable

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
keep blood sugar and insulin stable

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.790 
keep blood sugar and insulin stable
because<00:01:54.730> every<00:01:55.180> time<00:01:55.210> we<00:01:55.420> spike<00:01:55.840> insulin<00:01:56.110> we

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
because every time we spike insulin we

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.470 
because every time we spike insulin we
take<00:01:57.010> our<00:01:57.040> body<00:01:57.370> out<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.270> fat-burning

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
take our body out of a fat-burning

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.920 
take our body out of a fat-burning
environment<00:01:59.350> so<00:01:59.890> if<00:02:00.190> we<00:02:00.610> know<00:02:00.790> this<00:02:01.090> then<00:02:01.600> all

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
environment so if we know this then all

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.450 
environment so if we know this then all
of<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.110> sudden<00:02:02.350> we<00:02:02.440> think<00:02:02.680> okay<00:02:03.010> we<00:02:03.220> got<00:02:03.340> to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
of a sudden we think okay we got to

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.390 
of a sudden we think okay we got to
avoid<00:02:03.750> nutrient-dense<00:02:05.220> vegetables<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.340> are

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
avoid nutrient-dense vegetables that are

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.520 
avoid nutrient-dense vegetables that are
great<00:02:06.730> for<00:02:06.940> us<00:02:07.000> like<00:02:07.210> peas<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.510> carrots<00:02:07.990> but

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
great for us like peas and carrots but

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.710 
great for us like peas and carrots but

that's<00:02:58.870> why<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.200> always<00:02:59.410> educate<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.400> on

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
that's why I always educate you on

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.979 
that's why I always educate you on
nateon<00:03:00.850> cars<00:03:01.150> by<00:03:01.360> themselves<00:03:01.780> because

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
nateon cars by themselves because

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.900 
nateon cars by themselves because
they'll<00:03:02.680> raise<00:03:02.920> blood<00:03:03.130> sugar<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.610> take<00:03:03.760> your

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
they'll raise blood sugar and take your

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.430 
they'll raise blood sugar and take your
body<00:03:04.030> potentially<00:03:04.750> out<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.230> fat-burning

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.979 
body potentially out of a fat-burning
environment<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:06.430> there's<00:03:06.970> kind<00:03:07.330> of<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.630> couple

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
environment so there's kind of a couple

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.259 
environment so there's kind of a couple
the<00:03:08.200> myths<00:03:08.920> about<00:03:09.190> peas<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.880> carrots<00:03:10.150> now
