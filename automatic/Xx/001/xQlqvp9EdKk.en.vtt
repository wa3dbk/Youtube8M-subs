00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.940
 Good day, it's Elena Terekhova today 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:11.849
 June 24 and a little about strawberries here 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.849
 strawberries started but we have weather 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.369
 terrible this season not only 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.300
 cold so even when it's time to come 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.359
 strawberry really want to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.960
 it was sunny but it is not here, but four 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.769
 it's already raining day 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.610
 but my strawberries are all raised on supports 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.090
 on sticks as I told you and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:43.079
 so this is just salvation for her 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.910
 many strawberries rotting lies on the ground in 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.789
 mud 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:53.789
 the earth is nailed from the rain and the whole berry 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.570
 dirty and in terrible condition of course 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.149
 here and I advise you to look and it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.690
 despite the fact that there is no sun and berries 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.140
 is ripening 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.420
 and the berry is very nice beautiful 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.520
 poured of course she sipped at the expense 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.049
 rains are just a big plus and 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 look at how many berries 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.360
 strawberries are planted very tightly i am you 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.220
 showed from she now generally not even 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.950
 it is seen 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:28.950
 bush by bush which is all but 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.570
 beautiful berries and how i told you i 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.909
 I feed strawberries well 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.100
 and so naturally these are the berries and 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.650
 ordinary here sticks 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.360
 I cut it in advance and then I 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.790
 just doing this kind of lifting berries 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.700
 stuck on one side and on the other 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.229
 all the berries even see the bushes planted 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.799
 tight all raised and beautiful 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.650
 mature if you look here like that yes 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.340
 it's just beauty 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:12.080
 Now that is a bed around me 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:16.130
 made apple tree apple tree how he showed 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.990
 already dying but here and under it planted in 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.230
 such beds strawberry as I used to 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.580
 I told you I plant strawberries not by 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.310
 one usa 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.520
 and 3 things together there is a separate 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.730
 video where told well and here here 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.100
 just want to show yes and here 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.790
 mowed grass was lawn planted 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:47.240
 now it all turned everything on dry 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.420
 despite the rain and here's what it looks like in 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.920
 mostly strawberry 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.959
 asked me to show this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.360
 looks like 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:02.750
 the berries of course saw off just beauty 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.350
 just not enough sun well, nothing 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.410
 even if such a weather keeps up everything 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.510
 equal berries this season very much 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:20.269
 will the power of the good just the mouth of his face 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.660
 and the fact that I acquired the Eldorado variety 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:29.200
 Of course I said this in him 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.200
 disappointed now he will show 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.040
 maybe I got so badly 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.140
 take a look 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.349
 the berries are nothing leaves 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.349
 In general though all feeds fed all 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.590
 same thing and the saddest thing 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.440
 flower stalks 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:55.690
 very gentle and they just break 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.750
 break if you let one and then 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.069
 the rest also just breaks though 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.799
 small berry can say garbage so 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.319
 that with this sort I was not lucky here 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:15.600
 one bush is still more or less 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:19.470
 but all all broken so look 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.690
 what an unsuccessful acquisition 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.889
 everyone will develop our strawberries 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.550
 although I do not know what sort of name 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:35.220
 inherited and all the time 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:38.200
 Of course, too, this sort I choose where 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.820
 I mark the most beautiful bushes with 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.370
 good berries from those bushes I take 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:50.020
 whiskers and if these are already berries 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.770
 appear there are such of course this 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.529
 already a bush here look it will go already 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:03.489
 to destroy 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:07.839
 on throwing out so but here is a little bit 

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:09.779
 I'll show you this already laying blueberries 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:15.219
 garden 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:21.299
 the next video is how it looks up 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:21.299
 bye bye bye to all good harvests
