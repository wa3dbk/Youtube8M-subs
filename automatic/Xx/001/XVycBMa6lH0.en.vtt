00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it you might see a way to fix it or make

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
it you might see a way to fix it or make

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
aspect that I really really like about

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.630 
aspect that I really really like about
this<00:02:00.570> game<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:01.770> only<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.399> progress

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
this game not only that but you progress

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.219 
this game not only that but you progress
through<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.880> linear<00:02:03.329> leveling<00:02:03.750> system<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
through a linear leveling system that

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.230 
through a linear leveling system that
gates<00:02:04.469> enemy<00:02:04.860> castles<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.610> level<00:02:05.850> ranges

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
gates enemy castles in to level ranges

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.850 
gates enemy castles in to level ranges
this<00:02:06.600> means<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.930> when<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.500> castle

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
this means that when as your castle

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.350 
this means that when as your castle
levels<00:02:08.129> up<00:02:08.220> people<00:02:08.489> will<00:02:08.610> begin<00:02:08.819> seeing<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.239> in

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
levels up people will begin seeing it in

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.119 
levels up people will begin seeing it in
the<00:02:09.479> higher<00:02:09.660> level<00:02:10.020> zones<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.770> means<00:02:11.039> that

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
the higher level zones this means that

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.590 
the higher level zones this means that
for<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> most<00:02:11.580> part<00:02:11.700> you'll<00:02:11.940> only<00:02:12.180> be

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
for the most part you'll only be

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.630 
for the most part you'll only be
under<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> radar<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.410> people<00:02:13.920> around<00:02:14.070> your

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
under the radar of people around your

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.010 
under the radar of people around your
level<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.240> can<00:02:15.390> expect<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.900> be

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
level but you can expect there to be

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.240 
level but you can expect there to be
some<00:02:16.230> high-level<00:02:16.440> people<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.100> may

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
beaten them completely before just going

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.390 
beaten them completely before just going
back<00:02:54.840> with<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> different<00:02:55.620> skill<00:02:55.890> set<00:02:56.100> trying

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
back with a different skill set trying

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.410
