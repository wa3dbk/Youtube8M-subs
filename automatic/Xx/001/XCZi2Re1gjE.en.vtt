00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
something much more important than

triumph<00:02:12.280> over<00:02:12.460> death<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:13.570> really<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.410> a

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
triumph over death you really get a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.130 
triumph over death you really get a
sense<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.040> these<00:02:15.940> events<00:02:16.450> were<00:02:16.570> affecting

not just the central characters but
everybody<00:02:21.280> around<00:02:21.520> them<00:02:22.120> was<00:02:22.840> never<00:02:23.110> going<00:02:23.350> to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
everybody around them was never going to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.350

be the same again after this and in the
way<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.200> wonderful<00:02:26.830> microcosm<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.790> what

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
way it's a wonderful microcosm of what

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.410 
way it's a wonderful microcosm of what
happened<00:02:28.990> next<00:02:29.200> because<00:02:29.860> nobody<00:02:30.580> around

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
happened next because nobody around

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.630
