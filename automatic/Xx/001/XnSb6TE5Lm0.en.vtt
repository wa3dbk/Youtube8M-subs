hops all you need is an index card or a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.950 
hops all you need is an index card or a
sheet<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.310> paper<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:18.000> business<00:00:18.449> card<00:00:18.720> that

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
sheet of paper like a business card that

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.099 
sheet of paper like a business card that
looks<00:00:19.080> like<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:20.750> hopefully<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.869> tough

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
looks like this hopefully it's tough

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
looks like this hopefully it's tough
enough<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.859> will<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.430> able<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.730> hop

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
enough so that it will be able to hop

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.439 
enough so that it will be able to hop
around<00:00:24.859> first<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.640> want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.269> edge

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
around first you want to take an edge

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.790 
around first you want to take an edge
and<00:00:28.310> fold<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:30.439> make<00:00:31.439> sure<00:00:31.470> it's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and fold it like this make sure it's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
and fold it like this make sure it's
nice<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:33.530> even<00:00:34.530> comes<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> point<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
nice and even comes to the point on this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.340 
nice and even comes to the point on this
edge<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:37.190> it's<00:00:38.190> straight<00:00:38.520> across<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.350> make

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
edge and it's straight across there make

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.819 
edge and it's straight across there make
a<00:00:40.379> very<00:00:40.710> nice<00:00:40.920> crease<00:00:45.320> make<00:00:46.320> sure<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.590> crease

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
a very nice crease make sure you crease

a very nice crease make sure you crease
it<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.760> well<00:00:48.559> open<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.280> do

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it really well open it back up and do

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.680 
it really well open it back up and do
the<00:00:51.300> same<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> other<00:00:51.930> side<00:00:56.449> see<00:00:57.449> how<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the same to the other side see how I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.819 
the same to the other side see how I
make<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.140> point<00:00:58.590> over<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:58.890> very<00:00:59.789> nice<00:01:00.059> and

make this point over here very nice and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.710 
make this point over here very nice and
pointy<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.369> crease<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.420> side

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
pointy see then you crease this side

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.640 
pointy see then you crease this side
very<00:01:07.229> nicely<00:01:07.500> again<00:01:12.140> see<00:01:13.140> how<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.320> made<00:01:13.619> this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
very nicely again see how I made this

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.920 
very nicely again see how I made this
point<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:16.820> then<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.970> open<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.630> again

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
point and then you open it back up again

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.289 
point and then you open it back up again
and<00:01:19.490> you'll<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.700> an<00:01:20.790> X<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.250> fold<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and you'll see an X and then you fold it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.219 
and you'll see an X and then you fold it
backwards<00:01:24.600> along<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> X<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.939> you'll<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
backwards along the X and you'll see the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
backwards along the X and you'll see the
creases<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> fold<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.329> make<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
creases you want to fold it and make it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.620 
creases you want to fold it and make it
come<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> creases<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.060> you're

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
come to the creases so that you're

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
come to the creases so that you're
folding<00:01:33.960> along<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.619> middle<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> X<00:01:36.650> crease

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
folding along the middle of the X crease

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.800 
folding along the middle of the X crease
it<00:01:37.880> very<00:01:38.880> nice<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.299> again<00:01:40.369> open<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> back<00:01:41.610> up

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it very nice it again open it back up

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.800 
it very nice it again open it back up
you<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.110> sort<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.680> star<00:01:43.950> thing<00:01:44.720> what<00:01:45.720> you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you see sort of a star thing what you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.600 
you see sort of a star thing what you
want<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> push<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.130> each<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.490> these

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
want to do is push in on each of these

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.719 
want to do is push in on each of these
sides<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:50.700> form<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.750> triangle<00:01:52.729> next

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
sides and it will form a triangle next

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
sides and it will form a triangle next
what<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.119> want<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:56.869> fold<00:01:57.869> these<00:01:58.170> two

what you want to do is fold these two

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.630 
what you want to do is fold these two
parts<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.210> like<00:02:00.210> this

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
parts up like this

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.010 
parts up like this
so<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.910> looks<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.480> still<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
so that it looks like this still a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.500 
so that it looks like this still a
triangle<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:05.760> want<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.030> fold<00:02:06.180> each

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
triangle and you want to fold each

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.750 
triangle and you want to fold each
side's<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.550> like<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:10.190> make<00:02:11.190> them<00:02:11.370> straight

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
side's in like this make them straight

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.010 
side's in like this make them straight
down<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:13.050> sort<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:15.030> set<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.810> whole

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
down it's sort of have the set the whole

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.740 
down it's sort of have the set the whole
width<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.060> bunny<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:19.800> see<00:02:20.010> this

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
width of the bunny now you can see this

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.080 
width of the bunny now you can see this
look<00:02:21.750> sort<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.170> house<00:02:22.790> then<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.910> want

look sort of like a house then you want

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.710 
look sort of like a house then you want
to<00:02:24.180> turn<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.540> around<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.510> see

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
to turn it around so that you can see

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.210 
to turn it around so that you can see
this<00:02:27.900> flat<00:02:28.230> part<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.950> see<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
this flat part and you can see the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.640 
this flat part and you can see the
points<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:29.550> triangle<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:31.020> want<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.260> fold<00:02:31.470> it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
points of triangle you want to fold it

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.700 
points of triangle you want to fold it
almost<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.300> top<00:02:34.550> almost<00:02:35.550> not<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> way

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
almost to the top almost not all the way

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.730 
almost to the top almost not all the way
do<00:02:37.710> not<00:02:37.980> crease<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.610> part<00:02:39.000> very<00:02:39.570> well<00:02:39.930> this

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
do not crease this part very well this

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.920 
do not crease this part very well this
one<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.280> want<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> fold<00:02:41.940> nicely<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.780> that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
one you just want to fold nicely so that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.220 
one you just want to fold nicely so that
it<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.200> bend<00:02:43.440> back<00:02:44.510> fold<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.630> all<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.110> way

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
it can bend back fold it all the way
