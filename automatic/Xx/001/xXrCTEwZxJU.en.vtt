for this trap trigger setup is that you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.990 
for this trap trigger setup is that you
either<00:00:33.260> have<00:00:33.650> a<00:00:33.680> couple<00:00:34.130> of<00:00:34.220> trees<00:00:34.460> close<00:00:34.820> to

order to have something to hang your

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.520 
order to have something to hang your
trigger<00:00:40.010> system<00:00:40.520> off<00:00:40.700> of<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.110> first<00:00:42.320> thing

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
trigger system off of so the first thing

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.140 
trigger system off of so the first thing
that<00:00:42.680> I'm<00:00:42.770> going<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:43.010> show<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:43.250> is<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.970> actual

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
that I'm going to show you is the actual

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.420 
that I'm going to show you is the actual
trigger<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.170> bait<00:00:45.350> pen<00:00:45.650> and<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.190> how<00:00:46.400> it

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
trigger and the bait pen and and how it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.340 
trigger and the bait pen and and how it
works<00:00:46.730> all<00:00:47.060> right<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:47.360> this<00:00:47.480> trap<00:00:47.840> trigger<00:00:48.140> is

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
works all right so this trap trigger is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.950 
works all right so this trap trigger is
very<00:00:48.620> simple<00:00:49.130> basically<00:00:49.880> all<00:00:50.180> we've<00:00:50.360> taken<00:00:50.630> is

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
very simple basically all we've taken is

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.630 
very simple basically all we've taken is
kind<00:00:51.290> of<00:00:51.380> a<00:00:51.440> gnarly<00:00:51.830> stick<00:00:52.130> something<00:00:52.430> that's

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
kind of a gnarly stick something that's

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.180 
kind of a gnarly stick something that's
got<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.820> bunch<00:00:53.060> of<00:00:53.500> branches<00:00:54.500> off<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.950> side

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
got a bunch of branches off to the side

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.190 
got a bunch of branches off to the side
of<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:55.790> that<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.150> takes<00:00:56.780> up<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.050> entire

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
of it so that it takes up the entire

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.470 
of it so that it takes up the entire
walkway<00:00:58.190> where<00:00:58.460> either<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:58.850> stakes<00:00:59.120> or<00:00:59.360> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
walkway where either the stakes or the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.870 
walkway where either the stakes or the
trees<00:00:59.750> are<00:00:59.930> at<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:00.350> we<00:01:01.040> take<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.430> simply

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
trees are at and we take and simply

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.910 
trees are at and we take and simply
carve<00:01:02.180> a<00:01:02.300> number<00:01:02.540> seven<00:01:02.750> knotch<00:01:03.110> fairy<00:01:03.500> simple

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
carve a number seven knotch fairy simple

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.710 
carve a number seven knotch fairy simple
just<00:01:04.129> like<00:01:04.189> all<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.640> our<00:01:04.760> other<00:01:04.820> traps<00:01:05.330> it's<00:01:05.630> a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
just like all of our other traps it's a

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.230 
just like all of our other traps it's a
straight<00:01:06.020> cut<00:01:06.260> with<00:01:06.500> a<00:01:06.530> 45<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.060> make<00:01:08.210> a

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
straight cut with a 45 then you make a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.149 
straight cut with a 45 then you make a
little<00:01:08.450> notch<00:01:08.659> up<00:01:08.960> here<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.470> order<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.860> set

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
little notch up here in order to set

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.610 
little notch up here in order to set
your<00:01:10.310> rope<00:01:10.550> then<00:01:11.270> we<00:01:11.390> make<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.630> snare<00:01:11.990> loop<00:01:12.260> and

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
your rope then we make a snare loop and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.170 
your rope then we make a snare loop and
on<00:01:12.710> this<00:01:12.890> particular<00:01:13.070> trap<00:01:13.760> we're<00:01:14.000> going<00:01:14.120> to

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
on this particular trap we're going to

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.930 
on this particular trap we're going to
be<00:01:14.300> using<00:01:14.570> wire<00:01:14.960> which<00:01:15.620> I<00:01:15.830> highly<00:01:16.040> recommend<00:01:16.220> I

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
be using wire which I highly recommend I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.090 
be using wire which I highly recommend I
mean<00:01:17.120> it's<00:01:17.270> super<00:01:17.659> cheap<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:18.140> can<00:01:18.320> almost<00:01:18.770> buy

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
mean it's super cheap you can almost buy

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.770 
mean it's super cheap you can almost buy
it<00:01:19.159> anywhere<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.909> can<00:01:20.090> carry<00:01:20.360> it<00:01:20.510> anywhere

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
it anywhere you can carry it anywhere

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.260 
it anywhere you can carry it anywhere
without<00:01:21.159> really<00:01:22.159> getting<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:22.520> trouble<00:01:22.670> for<00:01:22.909> it

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
without really getting in trouble for it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.080 
without really getting in trouble for it
and<00:01:23.540> it's<00:01:23.870> very<00:01:24.170> useful<00:01:24.620> useful<00:01:25.340> for<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.640> ton<00:01:26.060> of

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
and it's very useful useful for a ton of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.640 
and it's very useful useful for a ton of
different<00:01:26.210> survival<00:01:26.690> uses<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.260> next<00:01:27.500> thing

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
different survival uses the next thing

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.230 
different survival uses the next thing
that<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:27.920> need<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.190> do<00:01:28.370> is<00:01:28.550> take<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> straight

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
that you need to do is take a straight

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.630 
that you need to do is take a straight
stick<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.870> you<00:01:30.200> want<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:30.680> physically<00:01:31.280> carve

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
stick and you want to physically carve

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.840 
stick and you want to physically carve
and<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.540> straight<00:01:32.930> edge<00:01:33.140> on<00:01:33.560> one<00:01:33.830> side<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:34.610> that

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
and a straight edge on one side so that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.130 
and a straight edge on one side so that
your<00:01:35.000> number-7<00:01:35.690> knotch

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
your number-7 knotch

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.680 
your number-7 knotch
can<00:01:36.710> lock<00:01:36.950> into<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.920> that's<00:01:43.070> going<00:01:43.310> to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
can lock into it and that's going to

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.899 
can lock into it and that's going to
hook<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:44.960> just<00:01:45.530> like<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.760> way

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
hook to that just like that and that way

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.270 
hook to that just like that and that way
the<00:01:47.090> animal<00:01:47.479> can't<00:01:47.750> walk<00:01:48.080> into<00:01:48.380> your<00:01:48.740> bait<00:01:48.979> pen

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
the animal can't walk into your bait pen

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.270 
the animal can't walk into your bait pen
without<00:01:50.150> going<00:01:50.619> through<00:01:51.619> your<00:01:51.770> trigger<00:01:51.979> first

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
without going through your trigger first

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.010 
without going through your trigger first
so<00:01:52.549> once<00:01:52.850> you've<00:01:53.000> got<00:01:53.210> your<00:01:53.240> bar<00:01:53.600> attached

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
so once you've got your bar attached

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.130 
so once you've got your bar attached
then<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.799> need<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.280> go<00:01:56.030> ahead<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.450> set<00:01:56.689> it<00:01:56.720> so

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
then you need to go ahead and set it so

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.810 
then you need to go ahead and set it so
that<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.380> can<00:01:57.560> get<00:01:57.710> your<00:01:57.890> snare<00:01:58.130> set<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.790> just

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
that you can get your snare set and just

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.609 
that you can get your snare set and just
like<00:01:59.180> with<00:01:59.390> all<00:01:59.510> snares<00:01:59.900> we've<00:02:00.200> got<00:02:00.380> some

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
like with all snares we've got some

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.030 
like with all snares we've got some
split<00:02:00.920> sticks<00:02:01.220> here<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.590> all<00:02:03.590> I'm<00:02:03.830> going<00:02:03.979> to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
split sticks here and all I'm going to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.350 
split sticks here and all I'm going to
do

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.630 

let's<00:02:09.360> take<00:02:09.630> my<00:02:09.810> wire<00:02:11.270> get<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> formed<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.990> and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
let's take my wire get it formed up and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.949 
let's take my wire get it formed up and
you're<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.790> gauge<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.720> size

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
you're going to gauge this to the size

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:42.460 
you're going to gauge this to the size
of<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> animal<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.800> you're<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.250> after

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.650 

remember<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.460> height<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.940> snare<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.390> very

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
remember the height of the snare is very

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.350 
remember the height of the snare is very
important<00:02:45.460> we<00:02:46.460> don't<00:02:46.580> want<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.910> too<00:02:47.090> low<00:02:47.330> or

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
important we don't want it too low or

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.240 
important we don't want it too low or
you're<00:02:47.720> more<00:02:47.900> likely<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.470> get<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.650> body<00:02:48.920> grip

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
you're more likely to get a body grip

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.920 
you're more likely to get a body grip
versus<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> head<00:02:50.090> grip<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:53.000> then<00:02:53.180> just<00:02:53.450> form<00:02:53.780> it

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
versus a head grip and then just form it

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.530 
versus a head grip and then just form it
into<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.260> spot<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.800> want<00:02:58.330> now<00:02:59.330> your

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
into the spot that you want now your

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.240 
into the spot that you want now your
bait<00:02:59.720> pin<00:03:00.110> could<00:03:00.380> be<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.530> lot<00:03:00.770> of<00:03:00.920> different

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
bait pin could be a lot of different

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.160 
bait pin could be a lot of different
things<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.060> one<00:03:02.210> thing<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.630> needs<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.020> be

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
things but the one thing it needs to be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.990 
things but the one thing it needs to be
is<00:03:03.290> secure<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:04.010> mean<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.370> could<00:03:04.550> make<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.730> little

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
is secure I mean you could make a little

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.090 
is secure I mean you could make a little
a-frame<00:03:05.510> hooch<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:06.320> did<00:03:06.530> on<00:03:06.680> our<00:03:06.710> large

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
a-frame hooch like we did on our large

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.700 
a-frame hooch like we did on our large
split<00:03:07.520> stick<00:03:07.790> figure<00:03:08.150> 4<00:03:08.390> deadfall<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.530> can

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
split stick figure 4 deadfall you can

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.540 
split stick figure 4 deadfall you can
use<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.920> large<00:03:10.520> hollow<00:03:10.850> log<00:03:11.270> or<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.140> can<00:03:12.320> take

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
use a large hollow log or you can take

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.040 
use a large hollow log or you can take
sticks<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.880> secure<00:03:14.360> them<00:03:14.510> into<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.780> ground

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
sticks and secure them into the ground

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.020 
sticks and secure them into the ground
now<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:15.830> you're<00:03:16.010> trying<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.370> go<00:03:16.490> after<00:03:16.670> some

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
now if you're trying to go after some

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.450 
now if you're trying to go after some
such<00:03:17.360> as<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.570> raccoon<00:03:18.080> or<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.560> squirrel

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
such as a raccoon or a squirrel

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.430 
such as a raccoon or a squirrel
something<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.270> can<00:03:20.450> jump<00:03:20.750> or<00:03:21.050> go<00:03:21.290> around

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
something that can jump or go around

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.400 
something that can jump or go around
your<00:03:21.920> barrier<00:03:22.390> something<00:03:23.390> like<00:03:23.570> this<00:03:24.170> would

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
your barrier something like this would

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.040 
your barrier something like this would
be<00:03:24.560> fine<00:03:24.800> for<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:25.160> rabbit<00:03:25.670> but<00:03:26.360> for<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> lot<00:03:27.020> of

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
be fine for a rabbit but for a lot of

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.720 
be fine for a rabbit but for a lot of
different<00:03:27.260> game<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.920> would<00:03:28.220> want<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.580> use

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
different game I would want to use

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.280 
different game I would want to use
something<00:03:28.760> different<00:03:29.540> than<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.080> this<00:03:30.230> is

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
something different than this so this is

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.260 
something different than this so this is
for<00:03:30.440> demonstration<00:03:31.250> purposes<00:03:31.790> but<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.120> will

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
for demonstration purposes but it will

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.840 
for demonstration purposes but it will
work<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.160> depending<00:03:34.160> on<00:03:34.250> what<00:03:34.640> you're<00:03:34.820> going

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
work and depending on what you're going

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.940 
work and depending on what you're going
after<00:03:35.300> obviously<00:03:36.110> your<00:03:36.260> bait<00:03:36.440> source<00:03:36.740> is

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
after obviously your bait source is

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.680 
after obviously your bait source is
important<00:03:37.520> and<00:03:37.850> we<00:03:38.060> talked<00:03:38.270> a<00:03:38.300> lot<00:03:38.540> about

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
important and we talked a lot about

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.270 
important and we talked a lot about
carrying<00:03:39.140> peanut<00:03:39.560> butter<00:03:39.740> in<00:03:39.920> our<00:03:40.040> kit

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
carrying peanut butter in our kit

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.590 
carrying peanut butter in our kit
because<00:03:40.550> not<00:03:40.760> only<00:03:40.790> is<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.210> a<00:03:41.360> fantastic

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
because not only is it a fantastic

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.140 
because not only is it a fantastic
calorie<00:03:42.470> source<00:03:42.770> it's<00:03:43.040> also<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.400> fantastic

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
calorie source it's also a fantastic

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.510 
calorie source it's also a fantastic
bait<00:03:44.630> source<00:03:44.960> and<00:03:45.260> rabbits<00:03:45.920> love<00:03:46.100> peanut

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
bait source and rabbits love peanut

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.150 
bait source and rabbits love peanut
butter<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.390> you're<00:03:48.020> gonna<00:03:48.140> either<00:03:48.590> place<00:03:49.130> a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
butter so you're gonna either place a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.550 
butter so you're gonna either place a
stick<00:03:49.580> in<00:03:49.760> here<00:03:50.120> with<00:03:50.390> some<00:03:50.630> peanut<00:03:50.959> butter<00:03:51.080> or

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
stick in here with some peanut butter or

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.470 
stick in here with some peanut butter or
if<00:03:51.920> you're<00:03:52.100> going<00:03:52.280> maybe<00:03:52.910> you've<00:03:53.090> got<00:03:53.270> some

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
if you're going maybe you've got some

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.030 
if you're going maybe you've got some
fish<00:03:53.690> guts<00:03:53.900> you'll<00:03:54.200> throw<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.560> in<00:03:54.650> here<00:03:54.920> this

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
fish guts you'll throw it in here this

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.640 
fish guts you'll throw it in here this
would<00:03:55.250> be<00:03:55.340> fine<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.820> catch<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.150> possum<00:03:56.390> as<00:03:57.320> is

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
would be fine to catch a possum as is

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.440 
would be fine to catch a possum as is
because<00:03:57.950> they<00:03:58.130> tend<00:03:58.490> to<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:59.060> know<00:03:59.180> take<00:03:59.420> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
because they tend to you know take the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.449 
because they tend to you know take the
lazy<00:03:59.780> route<00:04:00.110> instead<00:04:00.320> of<00:04:00.530> trying<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.920> go<00:04:01.100> over

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
lazy route instead of trying to go over

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.970 
lazy route instead of trying to go over
so<00:04:02.090> just<00:04:02.390> place<00:04:02.630> your<00:04:02.660> bait<00:04:02.990> in<00:04:03.140> here<00:04:03.530> with<00:04:03.950> a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
so just place your bait in here with a

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.590 
so just place your bait in here with a
little<00:04:04.220> bit<00:04:04.430> out<00:04:04.580> in<00:04:04.610> front<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.120> snare<00:04:05.360> as

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
little bit out in front of the snare as

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.990 
little bit out in front of the snare as

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
you could tie a spring Pole to one of

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.890 
you could tie a spring Pole to one of
the<00:04:52.490> things<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:52.970> can<00:04:53.180> do<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.780> know

the things that you can do and you know

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.960 
the things that you can do and you know
obviously<00:04:54.320> we're<00:04:54.530> using<00:04:54.710> PVC<00:04:55.220> out<00:04:55.640> here<00:04:55.880> on

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
obviously we're using PVC out here on

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.140 
obviously we're using PVC out here on
our

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
our

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.970 
our
survival<00:04:56.630> trapping<00:04:57.050> course<00:04:57.290> but<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.830> would

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
survival trapping course but you would

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.420 
survival trapping course but you would
use<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.870> flexible<00:04:59.870> sapling<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.770> some<00:05:01.010> type<00:05:01.280> and

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
use a flexible sapling of some type and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.330 
use a flexible sapling of some type and
you<00:05:01.970> can<00:05:02.120> drive<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.390> larger<00:05:03.110> tree<00:05:03.710> into<00:05:04.250> the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
you can drive a larger tree into the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.310 
you can drive a larger tree into the
ground<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.390> way<00:05:05.510> that<00:05:05.690> we<00:05:05.780> tighten<00:05:06.200> this

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
ground and the way that we tighten this

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.600 
ground and the way that we tighten this
up<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:06.920> I've<00:05:07.820> taken<00:05:08.030> smaller<00:05:08.630> stakes<00:05:09.080> and

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
up is I've taken smaller stakes and

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.040 
up is I've taken smaller stakes and
pounded<00:05:10.610> those<00:05:10.850> into<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.450> ground<00:05:11.480> around

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
pounded those into the ground around

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.840 
pounded those into the ground around
this<00:05:12.320> large<00:05:12.680> stake<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:13.400> that's<00:05:13.580> going<00:05:13.790> to

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
this large stake and that's going to

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.880 
this large stake and that's going to
help<00:05:14.060> secure<00:05:14.270> that<00:05:14.720> especially<00:05:15.590> when<00:05:15.830> a

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
help secure that especially when a

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.610 
help secure that especially when a
fairly<00:05:16.550> large<00:05:16.760> sapling<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.750> being<00:05:18.260> bent<00:05:18.500> over

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
fairly large sapling is being bent over

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.010 
fairly large sapling is being bent over
for<00:05:18.800> longer<00:05:19.340> periods<00:05:19.730> of<00:05:19.850> time<00:05:20.060> so<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:20.840> can

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
for longer periods of time so you can

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.080 
for longer periods of time so you can
set<00:05:21.230> up<00:05:21.260> a<00:05:21.470> spring<00:05:21.740> pole<00:05:22.010> in<00:05:22.280> basically<00:05:22.850> any

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
set up a spring pole in basically any

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.790 
set up a spring pole in basically any
area<00:05:23.570> as<00:05:23.720> long<00:05:23.930> as<00:05:24.110> you've<00:05:24.230> got<00:05:24.260> some<00:05:24.620> decent

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
area as long as you've got some decent

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.920 
area as long as you've got some decent
trees<00:05:25.190> around<00:05:31.270> all<00:05:32.270> right<00:05:32.420> so<00:05:32.570> that's<00:05:32.720> just

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
trees around all right so that's just

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.770 
trees around all right so that's just
another<00:05:33.140> variation<00:05:33.740> of<00:05:34.250> Spring<00:05:35.210> Pole<00:05:35.450> snare

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
another variation of Spring Pole snare

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.380 
another variation of Spring Pole snare
and<00:05:36.080> guys<00:05:36.650> there<00:05:37.430> are<00:05:37.460> so<00:05:37.760> many<00:05:37.970> different

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
trap triggers you have to think of it

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.770 
trap triggers you have to think of it
