00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 i 

00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:09.790
 Y 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:13.330
 the stages of stress and a couple of passes 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.630
 to move to sigma and bust his ass 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.000
 and it's more likely to be the other way around but 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.929
 well that's right here at this level we're going to 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.949
 get the golden armor for which 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.449
 I'll do something I'm not really 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.099
 proud because apart I 'm not either 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.019
 very safe, let's go save 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.050
 little by little we will go forward 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.540
 to the place where the armor is 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.340
 basically because now I do not fuck 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.609
 I remember if we did not have to receive 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.010
 damage on all the level young god who 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.359
 disgusting keeping that fucking armor that 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.550
 It gives me the ability to eat 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.260
 hosts believes of the damned wins 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.239
 but let's go match let's kill two 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.000
 birds with one stone if I do not have to climb 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.420
 this year until you get there it's worth 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.110
 I do not know the route I do not know how many 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.370
 attempts that are very difficult but if 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.339
 It's very strange to me that I'm driving 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.110
 to ax with a command and suddenly have to 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.729
 save in with the keyboard is how do you know 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.680
 with care more than sometimes so it 's 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.560
 dangerous if foolish 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.480
 to see the host we have here the turbo 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.090
 god these enemies are the most for 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.530
 fortified guards by the throwing rays 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.420
 and then from this capacity they have of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.070
 wrap electricity and you want or 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.440
 do not want the rays as one the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.280
 attacks do not affect him 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.520
 here also watching with elba esther 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.170
 could go perfectly could go 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 perfectly with him 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.770
 Now that's the power play and you will see no 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.630
 he is a very difficult boss 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.630
 the greatest ever 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 crazy 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.359
 the fact is that you have to burst as soon as 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.420
 that the pinchos then go down to 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.939
 where are we and make us crash 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.130
 because we are not going to touch the 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.640
 we leave a face the joke does not crash hits 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.640
 against the ground 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.569
 and then apart from the second reason why 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.670
 the one that I do not want 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.499
 I call position to keep equality and not 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.939
 save is basically because when 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:25.400
 we reached the end if I had to 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:25.400
 also take a photo that does not 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.379
 you will not only get in the area 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.989
 I had to fall there is just truth 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.209
 there is just and is that in the end we 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.620
 explains the second reason we go that if I 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.909
 hit a host veten that I have to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.260
 take a squid and I do not leave the 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:54.840
 fuck lose a real squid 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.840
 or as we say silly goals 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:09.390
 does not exist in the world is that today it goes and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.400
 has a twin brother who thinks 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.280
 distinct bieber and there is no god of mine there 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.810
 little by little 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.180
 the fact is that I already want to 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.650
 finish this good is already simply 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.629
 at the tip I already wanted that I would receive 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.090
 hurt there and good with these guys 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.519
 we got the golden armor that 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.459
 basically apart from giving us more defense 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.140
 it gives us regeneration of life and gives us a 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.659
 special weapon that basically us 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.609
 lets shoot the buster good up 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.069
 which ends rod ends 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.579
 gun allows us to fire the buster 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.889
 loaded to the max we're going to blow up the 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.319
 insurgents in an incredible way but 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.719
 let's go still I'll show you a 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.430
 moment that is called and for being alive as 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.169
 You see, we can shoot 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.260
 constantly that if you spend all 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.659
 pill but it's interesting 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.169
 it's worth against sigma to not make a 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.400
 quite efficient weapon thanks to 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.719
 third candle has to be keeping 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.959
 every two seconds 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:09.549
 that yes this map we have a deputy chief 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.290
 It depends on circumstances such as ye 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.169
 done the game well it is possible that you do not 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.609
 come out I already say it in advance to me by 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.099
 misfortune I get less bad that is a 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.320
 boss because knowing his point g is the 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:23.590
 the simplest thing is the world 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.900
 to see if when there are no mavericks to see 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.880
 if it heals 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.060
 not just were these here is 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.710
 that when there are not several enemies in the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.280
 stage suddenly fills up a 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.449
 bar is a limits that this guy what 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.919
 I mean seriously at the top of the 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.650
 golden armor that is otherwise and is 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.500
 as a normal armor of the 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.130
 world visually is the fifth u 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.880
 cock me unless your boss to see the 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.169
 case is here the drill fears if the in 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.910
 cash that is very good drills and 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:58.070
 this boss and I tell you that it will last 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.070
 last less than a fart in the bathtub 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.639
 how we turn them crazy and shoot 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.060
 drills we finished even faster with 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.860
 he that yes the bad thing you have this is 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.020
 that with the drill it is very likely that 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.449
 give that trunk to your trunk 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.639
 rare that you have and if it will break like 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.129
 I just did myself right now and now 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.020
 suddenly been on stage and that 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.270
 not only want this is the most fucking thing that 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.759
 can you do in the bastard a part of 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.360
 grab you to have that little hand of 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.360
 what throws you there 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.120
 we're removing that pretty simple 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.290
 'the the drill is simply the key 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.290
 the drill is the key 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.820
 oh my god considering what 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.170
 we have later better than what 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.420
 let's see everything with humor because more 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.490
 forward it will bring you the desire to rent 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.490
 the table to the wall and something more 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.100
 and that's the worst thing that can touch you a 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.210
 enemy by culero so graficÃ³ is short 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.950
 here I hope you liked it and if it is 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.780
 so you know how to comment their leathers and those 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.820
 things about everything more important thank you 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.030
 for following me goodbye and being happy very 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.030
 goodbye
