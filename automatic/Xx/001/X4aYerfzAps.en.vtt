00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
because that just wouldn't be good not

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.700 
because that just wouldn't be good not
that<00:03:33.340> it's<00:03:33.520> really<00:03:33.850> really<00:03:34.090> bad<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:37.710> would

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
that it's really really bad I would

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:56.790

recommend<00:03:39.130> not<00:03:39.190> doing<00:03:39.760> it

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
put it with the other section in the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.280 
put it with the other section in the
clip<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.190> when<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.240> hair<00:04:10.420> gets<00:04:10.660> too<00:04:10.870> big<00:04:11.080> for

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
clip and when the hair gets too big for

clip and when the hair gets too big for
the<00:04:11.830> clip<00:04:12.960> just<00:04:13.960> use<00:04:14.200> another<00:04:14.530> hair<00:04:15.160> tie<00:04:15.370> like
