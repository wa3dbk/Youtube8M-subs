(upbeat music)

00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:09.142
- Hi, I'm Jerry James
Stone, and you're watching

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:10.444
Cooking Stoned.

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:12.112
And on today's episode, I'm going to make

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.747
a savory sangria.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.616
Well, it's going to be cucumber and thyme.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.585
It's still going to be
sweet, don't get me wrong,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.721
it's going to have that
same sweetness that

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.689
you're used to with a white sangria,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.922
but it's going to have these
savory tones from the thyme

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.296
and some pink peppercorn.

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:30.297
It's extremely flavorful,
really refreshing,

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:31.932
and I think you're going to like it.

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.768
So we're making our simple syrup here.

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:37.004
Once the sugar and the water has combined

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.007
and the liquid begins to heat up,

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.076
mind you, I added the
peppercorns from the beginning

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:46.279
because I really wanted to
infuse the simple syrup.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.884
But once it just starts to kind of

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:49.015
look like it's about to boil,

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.350
you don't want it to actually boil,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.420
I'm going to turn off
the heat and then add in

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.926
our fresh thyme.

00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:58.893
Thyme tends to lose its potency
as it's exposed to heat,

00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:02.195
so it's always best to
add it at the very end

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.325
so you can get the maximum flavor.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.837
You don't want to overcook it.

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:09.242
So the first thing we're
going to do is gonna

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:11.972
cube our fresh jicama.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:12.973
I love jicama.

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:14.776
I don't know if you, if
you're not familiar with it,

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:17.744
it's just, it kind of has
the same texture as a turnip.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.246
Now that it's peeled I'm just going to

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.549
go ahead and cut this into cubes.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.043
It cuts just like a
potato, no trick to it.

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:31.003
Except for you probably don't
want potato in your sangria.

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:32.259
Or maybe you do. I don't know.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.397
Now, we want this to be
savory but not bitter, so

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:39.634
I'm going to go ahead and remove
the peel from the cucumber,

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:43.989
because that's not going to
add the flavor that I want.

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:45.472
You can leave a little
bit on, like, you know,

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.570
these little streaks right here.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.277
But you really don't want
the bulk of this peel

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:50.443
to be on there.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.171
It will bitter the sangria.

00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.949
So removing as much of it as possible.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:59.687
Now let's go ahead and
slice these fairly thin.

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:03.375
I'm going to use the bulk of
them in the sangria and then,

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:04.992
well, I guess I'm going to use
all of them in the sangria,

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:08.396
but I'm going to set aside
some of them for garnish.

00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:12.366
So the first thing we're
going to is add a cup of

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:16.003
our jicama here.

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.205
Then we're going to add
in our cucumber slices.

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:19.210
Remember, not all of them.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.974
We're going to use some
of them for garnish.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:25.489
Now we're going to add in the Riesling.

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.955
Just going to let that steep

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:36.723
and kind of get that cucumber flavor.

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.328
And while that happens I'm
going to go chop up my apple.

00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:43.396
The reason I'm letting
this steep, or not steep,

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.398
but the reason I'm letting
the cucumber soak in the wine

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.167
is I want to infuse the wine

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.569
with that jicama and that cucumber flavor,

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.405
and when you chop up
your apple it oxidizes,

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.774
so I kind of save that for
the last step so that way,

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:56.509
when I add it to the sangria,

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.945
it's not going to be brown.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.385
Which no one wants that.

00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:03.950
Now I'm going to go and
add in the cubed apple.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.192
Let's add the remaining wine.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.928
Just give that a stir.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.929
Mixing up the jicama and
the apple and the cucumber.

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.669
How lovely does that look?

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.891
It looks pretty damn tasty to me.

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.493
Now I'm going to add just
a little bit of lime juice.

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.310
Now I'm going to add in our thyme and

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.213
pink peppercorn simple syrup.

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:37.918
And just chill this thing
and serve it over some ice,

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:41.288
garnish it with some fresh
cucumbers and a sprig of thyme,

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:42.188
and you're set.

00:03:42.464 --> 00:03:46.092
(upbeat music)
