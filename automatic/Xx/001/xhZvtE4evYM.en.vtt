00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
moment and that would be a basically it

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.300 
moment and that would be a basically it
okay<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> first<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
okay so the first one is the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.990 
okay so the first one is the
radioactives<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> since<00:01:11.280> they've<00:01:11.490> been<00:01:11.520> in

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
radioactives so since they've been in

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.950 
radioactives so since they've been in
and<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> couple<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.310> days<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.700> really

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
and it's a couple of days to really

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
and it's a couple of days to really
start<00:01:15.960> coloring<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.180> opening<00:01:18.180> fully<00:01:18.479> but

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
start coloring up and opening fully but

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.499 
start coloring up and opening fully but
i<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:21.330> good

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
i think as you can see now go good

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.700 
i think as you can see now go good
closer<00:01:23.840> they've<00:01:24.840> settled<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.860> nice

closer they've settled in really nice

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.749 
closer they've settled in really nice

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
hopefully they'll start spreading over

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.940 
hopefully they'll start spreading over

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.020 
sure on the ID and they've started to
come<00:01:37.680> down<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.040> bottom<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> plug<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:38.850> well

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
come down the bottom of the plug as well

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.800

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
hasn't opened up and looks like I've

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.530 
hasn't opened up and looks like I've
lost<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.049> other<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.390> come

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
lost the other one and I think it's come

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.969 
lost the other one and I think it's come
loose<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:48.990> start<00:01:49.259> flooding<00:01:49.530> around<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
loose and just start flooding around the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.210 
loose and just start flooding around the
tank<00:01:50.729> which<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> shame<00:01:51.409> hopefully<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.590> might

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
tank which was a shame hopefully I might

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.300 
tank which was a shame hopefully I might
get<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> couple<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.759> them<00:01:54.950> down<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
get a couple of them down here the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
get a couple of them down here the
Pink's<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:58.520> fully<00:01:59.520> opened<00:02:00.000> yeah<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.500> still

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
Pink's not fully opened yeah and still

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
Pink's not fully opened yeah and still
in<00:02:02.490> use<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.000> tank<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.390> guess<00:02:03.600> they're<00:02:03.840> not

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
in use of the tank I guess they're not

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.810 
in use of the tank I guess they're not
in<00:02:04.079> high<00:02:04.290> flow<00:02:04.649> water<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
in high flow water so I was going to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.210 
in high flow water so I was going to
give<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.090> time<00:02:06.710> then<00:02:07.710> you've<00:02:07.860> got<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> brown

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
give them time then you've got the brown

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.619
