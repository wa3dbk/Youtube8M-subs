00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 it was then at 11 o'clock this morning 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.700
 finally so far the start of it 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.020
 2009 racing season 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 the tension can be read from it 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.130
 face of dominique meurmans from now on 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.269
 it's all about the points and just like last 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.590
 season starts with one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.109
 rolling start 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.310
 psv starts the spot 14 and a podium place 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.320
 is far away 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.449
 which is very important with this format 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 this expanding every race every 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.900
 driver gets points and in one 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.980
 car racing can be the weirdest things 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.170
 to happen 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.000
 per failed overtaking maneuvers or one 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.080
 you can place a moderate pit stop immediately 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.850
 cost 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.290
 Muermans repels a brave and try 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.489
 to get into the slipstream of his 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.899
 colleagues 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.180
 he still lacks some experience but book 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.040
 good progression the color is therefore 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.489
 not dissatisfied to his first full 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.410
 race entered reasonable center and old 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.559
 a little much understeer and he shoots 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.969
 intestinal flora can be a bit broken 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 we come to correct are just through 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.620
 keep driving so come stay with it and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.809
 expected that the pit stop after that went well 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.579
 what better an the what a little too much 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.750
 tires it works on a little traction 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.010
 issues 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.710
 consider sma we finished it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.390
 so our most important this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.000
 yes you have to be an amateur in the end 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.350
 god says and every place you 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.480
 [Music] 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.479
 yes it is a bit satisfying it is 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.070
 not not what I had hoped for but there 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.990
 are included 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.520
 this afternoon my second race has something 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.369
 now you can progression in the meantime 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.900
 books to also end up higher 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.490
 yes i have this first part too or you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.290
 learned a lot from the other one 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.790
 drivers what a form there is a person you 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.800
 so that there forms 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.479
 nevertheless sorry some other lines what 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.130
 others at intersections of corps and such 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.479
 learned something from it and also with 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.790
 putting the car for the second race 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.810
 also improved a lot 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.810
 what do you expect from that second race 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.890
 I would not know but the first one 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.759
 of course it is just expanding and 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.720
 secondly 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.700
 fermo viewers come forward 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.150
 a bit of a fight with everyone again 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.150
 enter into 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.260
 dominique still hear trace sound behind 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.630
 ours is exactly that good here 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.380
 exactly what happened yes me 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.060
 awake 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.650
 Leonie came something with the boat is right 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.900
 the post pencil to catch up 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.330
 and he knew the same point normally 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.489
 only good brakes water again 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.490
 cancer temporarily good where it would 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.800
 must be able to 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.560
 apparently not rm and blocking 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.690
 here in the pits she says it already is 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.310
 yes they are not that hot but hot 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.050
 carmen always bring the real ones 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.790
 be warm to get the best out of it 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.850
 I just thought they were there 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.430
 apparently that is not a piece 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.350
 risk taking in such a match yes 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.760
 this was a risk 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.650
 the racing car actually has something 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.270
 sustained damage though there are no vital ones 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.040
 parts killed 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.020
 then saying that race team has is still something 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.640
 to tinker the upcoming weeks 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.050
 it was very bad for dominique muermans 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 educational weekend 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.320
 this weekend just have a lot 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.310
 learned from the championship also from the 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.170
 qualifying 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.120
 so what I follow you have not done either 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.830
 yes let's learned a lot i didn't know 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.630
 and now just look ahead 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.560
 for the race that about a small 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.450
 tailored to a Thai queer care can 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.640
 to have 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.180
 good but wounds look at iran 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.260
 she said I also have a good time here 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.970
 behind 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.340
 he is extra special for you then 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.490
 it is in so there will be a lot of psv audience 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.040
 but I find that extra special for you 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.959
 Yeah right I is not so much more 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.270
 far before me and will serve 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.560
 we are family yes it is true me 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.780

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.340
 between joy home race of psv on it

 circuit of attic in belgium with the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.390
 presence of the large part of 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.340
 the psv selection 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.340
