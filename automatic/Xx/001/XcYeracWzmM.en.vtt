 brand and went after all kinds of 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.690
 equipment so that this car could 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.690
 proportional to the highest speed 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.479
 You can not leave the machine here.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.110
 those looking to customize 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.420
 exaggerate engines that are already powerful 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.939
 by nature this proves that soon the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.979
 A fifth year we're doing here is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.750

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.500
 being made a test of a 1,600 mile 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.299
 meters and they leave standing with the cars 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.549
 and has these 1,600 meters reaching the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.729
 maximum speed in those cases who do not 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.380

 this car does not play in the engine 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.840
 was opened forged stronger has a

 horses 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.660
 The only thing we did in that 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.280
 car to improve the money I went 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.560
 take the rearview mirrors on time 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.480
 pull and do in a way that the 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.150
 suspension was lower so as not to enter 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.790
 under the car original aspect so much 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.860
 physical preparation and of 500 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.130
 second place in our ranking 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:21.079
 the car reached 324 kilometers per 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.419
 hour at the end of the line and first place 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.520
 in the automatic drive ranking so much that 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.210
 became known the German model 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.150
 cut 993 this here was prepared with 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.700
 two groups of action of nitrous oxide 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.410
 the result was the mark of 350 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.370
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.590
 look at 350 for now it's the same thing that walks 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.330
 200 without understanding more or less the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.440
 difference resulting in an example is the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.700
 same thing 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:54.130
 the only difference is that to brake 350 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.130
