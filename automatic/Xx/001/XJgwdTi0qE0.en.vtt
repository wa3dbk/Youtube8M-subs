play<00:01:14.520> normally<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:16.140> would<00:01:16.259> play<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.830> land<00:01:17.670> in

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
play normally you would play you land in

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
play normally you would play you land in
the<00:01:17.939> middle<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.560> draw<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:19.979> card

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the middle so that you draw your card

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.410 
the middle so that you draw your card
for<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.400> turn<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:21.060> land<00:01:21.240> would<00:01:21.360> be

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
for the turn and then your land would be

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
for the turn and then your land would be
on<00:01:21.570> top<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.020> could<00:01:22.200> play<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.619> free<00:01:22.830> off

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
on top so you could play it for free off

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.679

now<00:02:11.500> it's<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.770> double<00:02:12.070> cobra<00:02:12.400> turn<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:18.400> mess

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
now it's a double cobra turn and I mess

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.180 
now it's a double cobra turn and I mess
up<00:02:18.820> here<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:20.580> pay<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.880> blue<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.720> green<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:24.160> the

Explorer whereas if i just paid to green
then<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:26.980> could<00:02:27.130> play<00:02:27.250> time<00:02:27.700> warp<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.090> ponder

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
then I could play time warp and ponder

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.720 
then I could play time warp and ponder
but<00:02:29.530> i<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:30.790> clicked<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.120> blue<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.080> green

else I can do which I I don't want to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.050 
else I can do which I I don't want to
play<00:03:23.680> Cobra<00:03:24.400> there<00:03:25.350> because<00:03:26.350> if<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.790> rats

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
play Cobra there because if you rats

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.600 
play Cobra there because if you rats
then<00:03:28.390> is<00:03:28.510> Elspeth<00:03:28.870> lives<00:03:29.340> whereas<00:03:30.340> if<00:03:30.519> he

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
then is Elspeth lives whereas if he

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.280 
then is Elspeth lives whereas if he
wrecks<00:03:30.850> then<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.239> can<00:03:31.420> play<00:03:31.780> Cobra<00:03:32.200> and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
wrecks then I can play Cobra and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.440 
wrecks then I can play Cobra and
immediately<00:03:32.620> threaten<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.100> again<00:03:34.560> but<00:03:36.360> then<00:03:37.360> I

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
immediately threaten it again but then I

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.100 
immediately threaten it again but then I
end<00:03:37.600> up<00:03:37.660> drawing<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:38.050> fetch<00:03:38.260> land<00:03:38.500> off<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.860> it

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.310 

so<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.490> get<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.760> ponder<00:03:46.240> and<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.690> hit<00:03:46.900> time<00:03:47.080> warp

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
so I get to ponder and I hit time warp

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.960 
so I get to ponder and I hit time warp
which<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:49.120> I'm<00:03:50.370> just<00:03:51.370> going<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:51.580> take<00:03:51.730> another

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
which now I'm just going to take another

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:04.290 
which now I'm just going to take another
turn<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.330> kill<00:03:52.480> Elspeth<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.760> that's<00:04:04.120> what<00:04:04.240> I

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
turn and kill Elspeth so that's what I

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.480 
turn and kill Elspeth so that's what I
do<00:04:06.420> here<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.600> end<00:04:08.080> up<00:04:08.230> sending<00:04:08.500> two<00:04:08.950> of<00:04:09.310> the

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
do here I end up sending two of the

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.390 
do here I end up sending two of the
Cobras<00:04:09.970> at<00:04:10.360> Elspeth<00:04:11.260> it's<00:04:11.860> pretty<00:04:12.040> obvious

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
Cobras at Elspeth it's pretty obvious

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.600 
Cobras at Elspeth it's pretty obvious
that<00:04:12.430> he<00:04:13.740> would<00:04:14.740> not<00:04:14.770> have<00:04:15.040> passed<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.580> know

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610

so the only way I'm going to lose is if

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.430 
so the only way I'm going to lose is if
that<00:04:28.180> else<00:04:28.360> with<00:04:28.540> kids<00:04:28.720> out<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.840> control<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.380> I

to be allowed to do my Jase is too

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:59.280 
to be allowed to do my Jase is too
important<00:04:51.669> especially<00:04:51.970> with<00:04:52.330> Oracle<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:58.290> could

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
important especially with Oracle I could

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.010 
important especially with Oracle I could
play<00:04:59.520> garden<00:05:00.520> here<00:05:00.850> garden<00:05:01.270> an<00:05:01.360> Avenger<00:05:01.810> but

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
play garden here garden an Avenger but

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.719 
play garden here garden an Avenger but
obviously<00:05:02.470> that<00:05:02.890> would<00:05:03.010> just<00:05:03.160> be<00:05:03.220> throwing

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
obviously that would just be throwing

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.969 
obviously that would just be throwing

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:13.409 
all my guys away to Iraq instead what I
do<00:05:06.070> is<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:11.100> tectonic<00:05:12.100> edge<00:05:12.310> his<00:05:12.700> celestial

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
do is I tectonic edge his celestial

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.040 
do is I tectonic edge his celestial
colonnade<00:05:13.690> retaining<00:05:14.470> priority<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.190> then<00:05:16.000> I

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
colonnade retaining priority and then I

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.370 
colonnade retaining priority and then I
used<00:05:17.050> my<00:05:17.290> other<00:05:17.590> tectonic<00:05:18.250> edge<00:05:18.400> on<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:20.229> other

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
used my other tectonic edge on the other

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.080 
used my other tectonic edge on the other
colonnade<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.040> even<00:05:21.280> though<00:05:21.370> he<00:05:21.550> only<00:05:21.760> has

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
colonnade so even though he only has

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.870 
colonnade so even though he only has
four<00:05:22.419> lands<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:22.930> got<00:05:23.140> to<00:05:23.229> activate<00:05:23.590> both<00:05:23.880> by

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
four lands I got to activate both by

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.640 
four lands I got to activate both by
retaining<00:05:25.270> priority<00:05:25.870> which<00:05:26.320> is<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.500> pretty

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
retaining priority which is a pretty

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.490 
retaining priority which is a pretty
neat<00:05:26.890> play<00:05:27.130> case<00:05:27.790> you<00:05:27.940> haven't<00:05:28.180> heard<00:05:28.500> that

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
neat play case you haven't heard that

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.300 
neat play case you haven't heard that
one<00:05:29.710> before

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.560 

yeah<00:05:37.310> that's<00:05:37.850> how<00:05:37.940> you<00:05:38.000> make<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.300> window

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
yeah that's how you make the window

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:47.379 
yeah that's how you make the window
smaller<00:05:43.360> just<00:05:44.360> turn<00:05:46.060> I'm<00:05:47.060> just<00:05:47.150> going<00:05:47.300> to

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
smaller just turn I'm just going to

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.159 
smaller just turn I'm just going to
explore<00:05:48.050> into<00:05:48.620> Cobra<00:05:48.980> and<00:05:49.070> play<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.870> no<00:05:50.870> reason

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
explore into Cobra and play it no reason

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.040 
explore into Cobra and play it no reason
to<00:05:51.320> run<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.650> venture<00:05:52.010> into<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.310> raft<00:05:52.810> but<00:05:53.810> i<00:05:53.990> do

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
to run a venture into a raft but i do

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.970 
to run a venture into a raft but i do
want<00:05:54.650> to<00:05:54.919> represent<00:05:55.520> lethal<00:05:56.090> next<00:05:56.360> time<00:05:56.950> so<00:05:57.950> I

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
want to represent lethal next time so I

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.800 
want to represent lethal next time so I
play<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.520> Cobra<00:06:00.970> how<00:06:01.970> many<00:06:02.090> r<00:06:02.150> depth<00:06:02.360> shows<00:06:02.600> me

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
play the Cobra how many r depth shows me

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.920 
play the Cobra how many r depth shows me
another<00:06:03.230> Avenger<00:06:03.919> so<00:06:04.480> now<00:06:05.480> he<00:06:05.540> basically

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
another Avenger so now he basically

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:24.390 
another Avenger so now he basically
needs<00:06:06.050> three<00:06:06.470> rats<00:06:17.470> of<00:06:18.470> living<00:06:19.220> rings<00:06:19.430> Oracle

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.350 

and<00:06:25.990> I<00:06:27.910> don't<00:06:28.910> need<00:06:29.030> to<00:06:29.090> worry<00:06:29.270> about

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
and I don't need to worry about

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.159 
and I don't need to worry about
baneslayer<00:06:29.840> because<00:06:31.419> the<00:06:32.419> turn<00:06:32.630> earlier<00:06:32.990> he

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
baneslayer because the turn earlier he

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:34.690 
baneslayer because the turn earlier he
would<00:06:33.290> have<00:06:33.410> to<00:06:33.530> wrap<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:34.010> next<00:06:34.250> turn<00:06:34.370> anyway

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
would have to wrap the next turn anyway

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.150 
would have to wrap the next turn anyway
and<00:06:34.970> this<00:06:35.600> turn<00:06:35.930> even<00:06:36.770> if<00:06:36.860> he<00:06:36.919> plays

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
and this turn even if he plays

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.370 
and this turn even if he plays
baneslayer<00:06:37.610> I<00:06:37.940> just<00:06:38.120> play<00:06:38.330> Avenger<00:06:38.750> and<00:06:38.900> a

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
baneslayer I just play Avenger and a

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.080 
baneslayer I just play Avenger and a
land<00:06:39.620> and<00:06:39.830> it<00:06:39.919> pumps<00:06:40.130> my<00:06:40.370> token<00:06:40.700> already<00:06:41.000> in

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
land and it pumps my token already in

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.390 
land and it pumps my token already in
play<00:06:41.270> from<00:06:41.510> my<00:06:41.630> first<00:06:41.870> Colin<00:06:42.229> garden<00:06:42.530> and<00:06:42.680> gets

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
play from my first Colin garden and gets

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.150 
play from my first Colin garden and gets
them<00:06:43.610> for<00:06:43.850> exact<00:06:44.150> he's<00:06:44.330> through<00:06:44.750> baseline<00:06:45.200> so

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 
them for exact he's through baseline so

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.540 
them for exact he's through baseline so
yeah<00:06:46.520> that's<00:06:46.640> how<00:06:46.790> I<00:06:46.820> won<00:06:47.030> my<00:06:47.150> first<00:06:47.300> game
