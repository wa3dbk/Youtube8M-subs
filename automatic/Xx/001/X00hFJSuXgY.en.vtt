00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.140
 varieties 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.300
 any of them does not need much 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.969
 time nor need to soak and wash 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.760
 for this I need for this this video 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.199

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.390

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.230
 little oregano black pepper onion 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.420

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.479
 portion with the hand and each portion 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.150
 will mean a person but before the 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.880
 I will wash and I will have the pot with water 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.940
 boiling to make his first boil 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.310
 change the water and keep a 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.860
 less amount of water for later 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.670
 add the dressing where I will explain 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.220
 onion 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.869
 together with the garlic I will put it to brown 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.229
 add the natural tomato so that it releases 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:32.140
 its juice has the fried tomato salt 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.560
 pepper and here I have is the amount that 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.970
 you have selected this is also this 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.970
 legume called lentil 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.770
 and here I have the safe water and use 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.770
 nothing 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.460
 and foam and the water feels a bit 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.340
 I'll change it in the ship 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.909
 and we will put them normally when 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.859
 take that the water has voted this foam 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.530
 the lentil exhausted this foam and water 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.289
 It has changed dark 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.670
 I just locus the lakes with 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.060
 hot water and I return them 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.340
 but with less water 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.099
 less water 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.980
 here we have the menestra or legumes 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.560
 lentils 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.120
 in a clean water washed with water 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.940
 hot and put back with water 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.049
 hot in the same pan water 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.819
 hot because we do not share that way 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.760
 cooking process by pouring cold water 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.629
 me here if I'm going to throw oregano because 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.750
 oregano spice because apart from the 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:47.740
 Oregano helps us not to have flatulence 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.110
 do not create gas and here if I add salt 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.200
 the lentils that we cook fast in 10 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.910
 minutes and we 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.830
 and what we want is to show how 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.780
 we do it 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.420
 in other places in other places in 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.810

 Butifarra ham closing the storyteller 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.520
 like I do it like hair 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.900
 that you do not need to put as many 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.459
 things and it's more natural 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.250
 we let this grass in while 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.030
 looking for a pan or pot longarela and 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.640

 [Applause] 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.110
 also with pepper is a seasoning 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:58.639
 ideal for everything and gives a taste 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.639
 nice up 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.990
 salt to taste remember that lentil 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.900
 after changing the water has 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.080
 added 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.400
 a little salt and tasted in the taste of 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.620
 advantage as such 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.720
 [Applause] 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.770
 to see what that has for me the greatest 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.630
 taste also necessary 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.440
 that cooks well 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.240
 we hope to move from this pot 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 someone who no longer needs water is 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.849
 Calm 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.529

 this is written 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.950
 for do 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:54.810
 and now our lentil will get 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.810
 a flavor that has not needed 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.160

 and that contains a little more but slow 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.490
 as we prepare our the 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.680
 lentils or how we use them or how 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.880
