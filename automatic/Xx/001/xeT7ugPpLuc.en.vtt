00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.529
 hey the guys from youtube let's equip the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 plus the video on the channel 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.140
 this time talking about a shazam show at 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.090
 news and left yesterday as soon as I 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 I finished recording a video that I had 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.780
 Yesterday I had yesterday's video 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.640
 recorded the same day recorded edited 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.890
 same day busy 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.989
 then to a news that the rock 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.269
 it will be the black adam in the background shazam 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.180
 Face to me that was great news. 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.369
 only that the gingham had 26 already 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 brought her to change for you have brought 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:01.199
 My opinion yesterday was one more end. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.150
 make this video that is now quickly 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.790
 to make an opinion about a rock 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.939
 As a good black Adam I found the choice 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.070
 perfect if the expensive paper because in 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.650
 market so I would not think the actor 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.080
 better to play this role of the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.159
 that the rock face guy that there is apparently 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 dude he is the character daniel adam 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.920
 black guy he's very like Adam 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.550
 black old and it will be a great 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.800
 villain in the universe of dc and in the cinema 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.050
 I hope damn it and hopes that the fund 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.150
 shazam is very good because it is the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.670
 first time we 'll see 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.970
 so it was not modern shazam anyway 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 because you already have the shazam background 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.580
 but it was not so good , I think 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.830
 nobody has watched but has to 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.820
 close and deserves an expensive shazam movie 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.470
 deserve 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.390
 I went with all those effects 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.120
 specials that we like until 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.210
 a movie all right everything right and 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.250
 deserves to have a good child even if 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.790
 have a good box office that does not have everything 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.299
 success as a batman superman but the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.730
 shazam deserves a movie i am great 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.040
 character, I know it's your love, it 's 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.440
 shazam know that he also knows 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.950
 It's black Adam but if many do not know 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.769
 it's just a ltd one of the comics gives a shazam 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.480
 read and get to know the character 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.060
 since the time of their former 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.640
 he was captain Marvel still and that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.010
 now in 9 52 and moved to shazam and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.560
 will be called shazam in the movie because 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.050
 if it is called a captain marvel in the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.460
 movie and ends up creating a mess 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.570
 we end up thinking he's from 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.480
 marvel and get there hoping to see the stone 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.060
 in the movie appear expect your parents cred 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.560
 headquartered in england but finally guys 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.320

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.150
