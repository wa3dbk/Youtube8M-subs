00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
a lot of highway a lot around town I've

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.249 
a lot of highway a lot around town I've
been<00:01:25.020> averaging<00:01:25.790> 22<00:01:26.790> 7<00:01:27.659> let's<00:01:28.080> be

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
been averaging 22 7 let's be

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.899 
been averaging 22 7 let's be
conservative<00:01:28.530> 22<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> half<00:01:29.340> miles<00:01:29.700> per

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
steering is quick and direct I've

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.410 
steering is quick and direct I've
already<00:04:47.980> talked<00:04:48.190> about<00:04:48.310> how<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.700> engine<00:04:49.270> is

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
already talked about how the engine is

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.790 
already talked about how the engine is
pretty<00:04:49.690> darn<00:04:49.840> powerful<00:04:50.320> and<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.530> have<00:04:50.650> that

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
pretty darn powerful and you have that

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.590 
pretty darn powerful and you have that
immediate<00:04:51.100> well<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.000> feels<00:04:52.210> like<00:04:52.360> it's<00:04:52.510> an

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
immediate well it feels like it's an

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.320 
immediate well it feels like it's an
immediate<00:04:53.280> torque<00:04:54.280> factor<00:04:54.730> with<00:04:54.880> that<00:04:55.000> almost

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
immediate torque factor with that almost

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.600 
immediate torque factor with that almost
300<00:04:55.900> pound<00:04:56.140> feet<00:04:56.320> of<00:04:56.350> torque<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:57.220> does<00:04:57.400> get

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
300 pound feet of torque so it does get

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.070 
300 pound feet of torque so it does get
up<00:04:57.700> off<00:04:57.850> of<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.150> line<00:04:58.300> pretty<00:04:58.600> quickly<00:04:58.840> as

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
up off of the line pretty quickly as

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.390 
up off of the line pretty quickly as
I'll<00:04:59.260> show<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.440> right<00:04:59.680> now

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.540 

front-wheel-drive<00:05:03.450> I<00:05:04.190> guess<00:05:05.190> there<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.520> a

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
front-wheel-drive I guess there is a

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.760 
front-wheel-drive I guess there is a
little<00:05:05.910> bit<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.300> turbo<00:05:06.810> lag<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.350> I've<00:05:07.500> heard

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
little bit of a turbo lag and I've heard

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.500 
little bit of a turbo lag and I've heard
other<00:05:07.950> people<00:05:08.040> talk<00:05:08.310> about<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:08.910> as<00:05:09.030> well

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
other people talk about that as well

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.240 
other people talk about that as well
I<00:05:09.540> don't<00:05:10.050> think<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:10.380> it's<00:05:10.650> that<00:05:10.740> big<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.190> a

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
I don't think that it's that big of a

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.890 
I don't think that it's that big of a
deal<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.700> think<00:05:11.880> it's<00:05:12.120> still<00:05:12.270> fine

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
deal I think it's still fine

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.930 
deal I think it's still fine

was telling my buddy the other day that

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.210 
was telling my buddy the other day that
I<00:05:27.360> was<00:05:27.419> test<00:05:27.720> driving<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.230> Buick<00:05:28.470> Regal<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.160> he

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
I was test driving a Buick Regal and he

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.370 
I was test driving a Buick Regal and he
said<00:05:29.460> my<00:05:30.000> dad<00:05:30.300> had<00:05:30.600> a<00:05:30.630> Buick<00:05:31.020> and<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.169> said

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
said my dad had a Buick and I said

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.530 
said my dad had a Buick and I said
everyone's<00:05:32.010> dad<00:05:32.340> had<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.639> Buick<00:05:33.000> but<00:05:33.150> today's

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
everyone's dad had a Buick but today's

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.740 
everyone's dad had a Buick but today's
Buick<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.230> think<00:05:34.830> caters<00:05:35.250> to<00:05:35.280> a<00:05:35.430> wider<00:05:36.270> age

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
Buick I think caters to a wider age

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.810 
Buick I think caters to a wider age
group<00:05:37.050> demographic<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:38.070> it<00:05:38.310> makes<00:05:38.550> a<00:05:38.640> lot<00:05:38.760> of

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
group demographic and it makes a lot of

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.000 
group demographic and it makes a lot of
