00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
that out onto a plate sometimes it helps

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.449 
that out onto a plate sometimes it helps
if<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.329> run<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.870> fork<00:04:17.169> around<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:18.010> outside

if you run the fork around the outside

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.890 
if you run the fork around the outside
of<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:18.729> and<00:04:18.910> it'll<00:04:19.060> come<00:04:19.329> loose<00:04:19.540> a<00:04:19.660> little<00:04:19.780> bit

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
of it and it'll come loose a little bit

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.420 
of it and it'll come loose a little bit
easier<00:04:20.109> but<00:04:20.799> something<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.160> know<00:04:21.250> usually

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
easier but something you know usually
