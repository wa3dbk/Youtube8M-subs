00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.430
 Here we have the environment salary in one tone 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:23.330
 but also just on subscriptions 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.660

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.519
 to stem 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.920
 and fall off bulbs 8 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:45.600
 when the bulbs are ripe all the nibs 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.089
 therefore it is necessary data about death 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.089
