there's anything else we get inside we

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.020 
there's anything else we get inside we
get<00:03:23.200> some<00:03:25.560> instructions<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.739> looks<00:03:26.890> like<00:03:27.129> this

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
instructions so that's included in there

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.350 
instructions so that's included in there
pretty<00:03:33.280> straightforward<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.060> would<00:03:34.150> imagine

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
pretty straightforward I would imagine

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.449 
pretty straightforward I would imagine
nothing<00:03:34.690> as<00:03:35.379> complex<00:03:35.829> as<00:03:36.040> some<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.340> other

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
nothing as complex as some of the other

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.860 
nothing as complex as some of the other
bands<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.849> are<00:03:36.879> out<00:03:37.060> there<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.450> that's<00:03:37.629> one

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
bands that are out there so that's one

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.280 
bands that are out there so that's one
in<00:03:38.019> there<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.349> then<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.519> get<00:03:39.760> extra<00:03:40.510> clips<00:03:40.810> if

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
in there and then you get extra clips if

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.670 
in there and then you get extra clips if
you've<00:03:41.470> got<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.730> larger<00:03:42.730> wrist<00:03:43.290> our<00:03:44.290> minds<00:03:44.590> are

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
you've got a larger wrist our minds are

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.050 
you've got a larger wrist our minds are
pretty<00:03:44.890> standard<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.489> shouldn't<00:03:45.849> have<00:03:45.940> that

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
pretty standard so I shouldn't have that

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.940 
pretty standard so I shouldn't have that
problem<00:03:46.120> but<00:03:46.569> way<00:03:46.720> we'll<00:03:47.019> see<00:03:47.200> that's<00:03:47.709> in

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
problem but way we'll see that's in

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.289 
problem but way we'll see that's in
there<00:03:48.099> as<00:03:48.190> well<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:48.579> there's<00:03:48.730> nothing<00:03:48.879> else<00:03:49.120> in

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
there as well so there's nothing else in

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.440 
there as well so there's nothing else in
