that to be on your level combined with
the<00:02:36.850> crab<00:02:37.090> guys<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.440> not<00:02:38.470> an<00:02:38.770> easy<00:02:38.860> feat

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.810 

gave<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.360> one<00:02:43.570> more<00:02:43.780> time<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.260> shine

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
gave this one more time to shine

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.250 
gave this one more time to shine
basically<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:45.940> will<00:02:46.120> suck<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.510> in<00:02:46.690> when<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
basically it will suck you in when the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.020 
basically it will suck you in when the
mines<00:02:47.500> come<00:02:47.830> down<00:02:48.040> which<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.370> totally<00:02:48.850> not<00:02:49.000> a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
mines come down which is totally not a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.330 
mines come down which is totally not a
problem<00:02:49.480> otherwise<00:02:50.350> them<00:02:50.800> those<00:02:51.010> nearly

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
problem otherwise them those nearly

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.280 
problem otherwise them those nearly
unavoidable<00:02:51.910> torpedoes<00:02:52.480> where<00:02:54.960> now<00:02:55.960> what<00:02:56.140> is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
unavoidable torpedoes where now what is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.170 
unavoidable torpedoes where now what is
this<00:02:56.530> except<00:02:57.040> for<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.310> really<00:02:57.910> slowly

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
this except for a really slowly

this except for a really slowly
scrolling<00:02:59.110> down<00:02:59.260> what<00:02:59.680> section<00:03:00.130> which<00:03:00.280> is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
scrolling down what section which is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.220 
scrolling down what section which is
actually<00:03:00.610> kind<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.120> nice<00:03:01.300> because<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.900> can<00:03:02.020> see

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
actually kind of nice because it can see

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.950 
actually kind of nice because it can see
what's<00:03:02.500> coming

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
what's coming

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.860 
what's coming
okay<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:05.490> bottom<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.090> ocean<00:03:06.450> holds<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
okay the bottom of the ocean holds a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.500 
okay the bottom of the ocean holds a
secret<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.410> think<00:03:10.040> Plus<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.210> secret

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
secret I think Plus this is the secret

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.400 
secret I think Plus this is the secret
we'll<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.900> delving<00:03:13.080> into<00:03:13.440> later<00:03:13.740> though<00:03:15.410> for

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
we'll be delving into later though for

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.970 
we'll be delving into later though for
now<00:03:16.610> go<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.670> replay<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> short<00:03:18.390> section<00:03:18.980> doesn't

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
now go to replay a short section doesn't

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.060 
now go to replay a short section doesn't
matter<00:03:20.160> too<00:03:20.400> much<00:03:20.930> but<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.650> remember

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
matter too much but if you remember

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.770 
matter too much but if you remember
correctly<00:03:23.250> we<00:03:23.790> picked<00:03:24.000> up<00:03:24.150> something<00:03:24.420> last

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
correctly we picked up something last

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.050 
correctly we picked up something last
time<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:28.310> think<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.460> should<00:03:29.490> put<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.030> good

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
time I think we should put it to good

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.560 
time I think we should put it to good
use<00:03:30.270> soon<00:03:31.220> because<00:03:32.220> those<00:03:32.520> mentors<00:03:33.030> ago<00:03:33.330> em

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
use soon because those mentors ago em

use soon because those mentors ago em
are<00:03:33.870> starting<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.290> annoy<00:03:34.590> me

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
are starting to annoy me

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.369 
are starting to annoy me
exactly<00:03:37.730> now<00:03:38.450> that<00:03:38.629> we've<00:03:38.780> actually<00:03:38.989> got<00:03:39.349> a

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
exactly now that we've actually got a

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.490 
exactly now that we've actually got a
proper<00:03:39.739> water<00:03:39.950> level<00:03:41.049> rush<00:03:42.049> marine<00:03:42.379> is

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
proper water level rush marine is

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.050 
proper water level rush marine is
useless<00:03:42.920> anymore<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.400> can<00:03:43.549> also<00:03:43.700> fly

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
useless anymore it can also fly

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.170 
useless anymore it can also fly
apprently

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
apprently

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.790 
apprently
it<00:03:47.180> also<00:03:47.300> puts<00:03:47.540> in<00:03:47.720> perfect<00:03:48.080> position<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.470> spam

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
it also puts in perfect position to spam

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.630 
it also puts in perfect position to spam
the<00:03:48.980> way<00:03:49.100> into<00:03:49.340> submission<00:03:49.870> like<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.580> it's<00:03:52.580> a

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
the way into submission like that it's a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.980 
the way into submission like that it's a
really<00:03:52.850> good<00:03:52.940> tool

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
really good tool

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.470 
really good tool
interestingly<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:56.280> cannot<00:03:56.610> go<00:03:56.820> down<00:03:57.090> with<00:03:57.330> it

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
interestingly you cannot go down with it

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.750 
interestingly you cannot go down with it
the<00:03:57.780> tute<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.590> cannot<00:03:59.010> actually<00:03:59.250> choose

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
the tute so you cannot actually choose

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.800 
the tute so you cannot actually choose
the<00:04:00.060> spike<00:04:00.810> section<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.760> for<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.450> following

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
the spike section and for the following

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.630 
the spike section and for the following
part<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.410> actually<00:04:04.890> kind<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.400> useless

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
part it is actually kind of useless

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.970 
part it is actually kind of useless
because<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.420> far<00:04:06.630> bigger<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.140> just

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
because it is far bigger and just

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.820 
because it is far bigger and just
champing<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:09.150> easier<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.600> my<00:04:09.660> opinion<00:04:09.810> the

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.530 

way<00:04:13.830> how<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.130> minds<00:04:14.550> move<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.000> also<00:04:15.300> something

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
way how the minds move is also something

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.540 
way how the minds move is also something
I<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:15.930> about<00:04:15.960> this<00:04:16.260> level<00:04:16.739> because<00:04:17.040> careful

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
I like about this level because careful

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.150 
I like about this level because careful
here<00:04:17.760> our<00:04:17.970> Silver's<00:04:18.450> get<00:04:18.750> into<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.410> spikes<00:04:19.650> at

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
here our Silver's get into the spikes at

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.670 
here our Silver's get into the spikes at
the<00:04:20.370> top<00:04:20.580> not<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.360> I<00:04:21.420> did<00:04:21.720> or<00:04:21.900> anything<00:04:22.410> back

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
the top not that I did or anything back

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.790 
the top not that I did or anything back
then<00:04:22.890> not<00:04:23.370> at<00:04:23.520> all<00:04:23.690> well<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:25.260> don't<00:04:25.560> have<00:04:25.650> to

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
then not at all well you don't have to

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.770 
then not at all well you don't have to
outweigh<00:04:26.430> their<00:04:26.640> explosion<00:04:27.210> because<00:04:27.540> in

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
outweigh their explosion because in

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.510 
outweigh their explosion because in
their<00:04:28.020> floating<00:04:28.350> upwards<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:29.040> can<00:04:29.220> easily

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
their floating upwards you can easily

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.140 
their floating upwards you can easily
slide<00:04:29.730> under<00:04:30.060> them<00:04:30.240> which<00:04:30.720> is<00:04:30.870> good<00:04:31.880> now<00:04:32.880> three

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
slide under them which is good now three

if<00:05:31.200> you<00:05:31.500> know<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:31.860> trick<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.340> is<00:05:32.460> just

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
if you know the trick that is just

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.660 
if you know the trick that is just
spamming<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.630> buster<00:05:34.050> then<00:05:34.950> he's<00:05:35.400> actually

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
spamming the buster then he's actually

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.660 
spamming the buster then he's actually
not<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.120> hard<00:05:36.570> but<00:05:37.440> again<00:05:38.010> this<00:05:38.190> is<00:05:38.250> a

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
not that hard but again this is a

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.550 
not that hard but again this is a
perfect<00:05:39.120> example<00:05:39.180> for<00:05:39.630> what<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.020> do<00:05:40.170> not<00:05:40.350> like

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
perfect example for what I do not like

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.770 
perfect example for what I do not like
about<00:05:40.620> mega<00:05:41.100> man<00:05:41.280> for<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:41.820> did<00:05:42.270> not<00:05:42.300> know<00:05:42.630> about

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
about mega man for I did not know about

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.420 
about mega man for I did not know about
this<00:05:43.110> trick<00:05:43.380> so<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.590> had<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.920> greatest<00:05:44.220> of

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
this trick so I had the greatest of

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.600 
this trick so I had the greatest of
painting<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.240> this<00:05:45.420> gun<00:05:46.100> now<00:05:47.100> that<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.340> know<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
painting of this gun now that I know the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.420 
painting of this gun now that I know the
trick<00:05:48.000> he's<00:05:48.210> actually<00:05:48.420> relatively<00:05:49.020> easy<00:05:49.470> if<00:05:50.190> I

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
trick he's actually relatively easy if I

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.800 
trick he's actually relatively easy if I
do<00:05:50.490> not<00:05:50.670> lose<00:05:50.850> concentration<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.600> could<00:05:51.750> hit

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
do not lose concentration I could hit

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.120 
do not lose concentration I could hit
the<00:05:51.930> first<00:05:52.170> time<00:05:52.410> but<00:05:52.500> I<00:05:52.560> had<00:05:52.710> to<00:05:52.830> leave<00:05:52.980> this

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
the first time but I had to leave this

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.210 
the first time but I had to leave this

weapon<00:06:06.510> it's<00:06:07.290> not<00:06:08.010> that<00:06:08.310> good<00:06:09.210> because<00:06:09.390> it

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
weapon it's not that good because it

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.600 
weapon it's not that good because it
