 it seemed good to click on it so that 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.180
 subscribe to my channel let's start 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.340
 good girls guys the first thing that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.370
 we need is to put a first our 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.289
 eyelids ok you are going to know many 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.289
 videos with me somewhere else 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.030
 a first is a creampie that will help 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.129
 so that its form lasts all day all 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.620
 the day a lot of time and that you do not know 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.780
 do the foot like that because it accumulates with the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.510
 fat and what the pp does is to put 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.220
 one capita a wall to your eyelid for 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.900
 that we pass the grass is 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.040
 I'm really not using one 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.320
 of palladium brand 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.460
 it dries up if you do not have a first you can 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.000
 put makeup on your face here 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.670
 well my second step 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.480
 I'm going to use a brush and I'm 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.520
 using the chic galaxy 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.090
 this is the baked shadows and this 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.800
 bring like a wine with azulito if you do not 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.180
 you have these two portals that you have 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.220
 at home with the color you want 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.800
 practice in the technique or what is the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.450
 teacher's technique I do not know if you would say yes 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.620
 but it's good that I practice after 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.620
 make information 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.460
 This is like with blue and I'm going to put 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.260
 here in taps on the mobile eyelid 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.270
 but I will not exaggerate girls and boys 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.430
 we are not going to exaggerate anything else here 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.050
 is where I would like 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.050
 as our base 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.920
 like others too 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.810
 is still blurred now let's grab 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.700
 a colour 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.160
 I like that I like that I love 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.690
 what fascinates me 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.080
 and will use this that is like 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.800
 I need you to bring what's also called 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.739

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.420
 gray with a coffee so you have in 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.360
 house what we need is one more color 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.790
 clear to clean that speck truth 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.190
 You can not see it because you put nothing else 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.200
 so be more streamlined and as you 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.519
 you threw really want and also what 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.110
 will help us so if you have not 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.940
 finished you let superman have 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.350
 tachas in hotel has taken days today in 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.209
 the little things that are starting to come out 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.930
 because that really cool because like they are 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.620
 present vicente tito 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.819
 they do not notice that something is coming out 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.150
 surprising because the game that follows 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.150
 is 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.400
 red intense red red this color is 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.349
 beautiful with carmine this from the brand of 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.970
 vice of fear that I'm going to put this in 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.260
 White 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.879

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.620
 I do not want it to go I do not think it's me 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.590
 clear bruise that we are going to apply 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.440
 well do not touch nice but if we go to 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.270
 drink 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.270
 my mom is singing in the yard 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.629
 are pigments so powerful because yes 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.210
 you grab something that is very loose 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.600
 see 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.350
 you apply and it goes everywhere without 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.640
 embargo 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.330
 I put and ok 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:56.490
 now with a stronger brush I put and 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:59.510
 because it is very accurate 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.510
 and we are going to apply 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.260
 down here 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.210
 not only makeup will be more focused 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.210

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.360

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.280

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.229
 and fade 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.000
 well I know it looks a little weird 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.300
 because balloon is already finished and the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.180
 another is not going the process so let's continue 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:58.060
 I go back to take the carmine that I love 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.520
 and careful pegadito his eyelashes 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.810
 they want they can pull like that because it's not going to 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:08.220
 be the mega mega mega high there is only 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.220
 between the tabs we apply 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.559
 I'm going to take a brush again but this 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.039
 no longer for the carmine is clean 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:19.039
 to blur 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.100
 I'm going to grab this one again with the blue 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.560
 and the one that we use as a base 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.660
 I will spend a little over a little 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.160
 of the carmine 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.480
 what I have put 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.480
 since it is camouflage 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.630
 someone of you is writing to me 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.759

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.889
 This house is lost because I know how 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.350
 metallic then what are we going to do 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:57.100
 is to apply at the beginning here lying 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.400
 see that blue fascinates me and slowly what 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.400
 we're going to lose up to half 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.129
 I'll take a little more and here a 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.529

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.040

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.750

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.450
 eyes of black 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.450

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.669
 a difficult one and I do not know how to be 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.410
