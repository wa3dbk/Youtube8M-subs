00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 beautiful all guys here orgasms that they are 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.590
 here to bring you the second episode of the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.599
 schools 2015 2016 of say yes fifa 16v 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.429
 brings today the inter that was one of the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.560
 more demanded teams then of course 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.029
 subsequently I will bring you the Milan 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.010
 juve rome and all the other teams 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.539
 that you asked me also ask me 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.250
 foreign teams because in my opinion it can 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 also be fun to talk about 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.570
 teams maybe of premier league or 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 bundesliga or di liga but also the most 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.410
 common like that I know barcelona real 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.520
 madrid bayern monaco everything manchester 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.230
 just what you want me to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.790
 written in the comments I'm glad that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.190
 the last episode about Naples 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.809
 has received many comments with 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.450
 tips etc. etc. 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.989
 so today just as you have noticed vi 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.809
 I bring the inter with this form 4 3 3 in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.480
 reality could inter play with 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.550
 this form or with a 4 3 1 2 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.379
 it then depends on the actual players 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.600
 which will have at the end of the market 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.120
 roberto mancini to build the team 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.870
 however I have hypothesized this 4 3 3 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.460
 with two possible purchases of the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.830
 let's say end of the market 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.780
 so let's start immediately with the goalkeeper 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.760
 as usual obviously handanovic who doesn't 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.170
 I wanted to scream nor from a shouting ha 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.210
 made a great season for how long 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.580
 regards the rigors made so many wallpaper 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.659
 rescue has saved several points 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.700
 the inter did however also 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.659
 several crap handanovic and during 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.450
 the year 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.549
 so I think this card anyway 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 be fair enough then I don't know me 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.909
 know you if you are or you are not 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.490
 agree with the various statistics of the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.009
 players and also of course write me 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.770
 why I think this is one anyway 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.869
 decent handanovic card then we go 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.509
 with the montoya defense that practically 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.369
 it does not change them even increased some 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.049
 statistic because in any case playing little 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.909
 last year with barcelona anyway 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.649
 collected if I'm not mistaken 3 assists o 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.509
 something like that and then it could 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.219
 staying also an increase in passing is 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.659
 however some in the rest of the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.310
 statistics 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.759
 then we miranda also comes from 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.590
 great season with the athletic madrid 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.649
 it is precisely to him I have not 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.690
 increased or decreased I think statistics 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.009
 now I don't remember precisely maybe 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.200
 some down grade ii and tested in 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.020
 some statistics 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.000
 unfortunately I don't remember why I don't have 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.980
 the two cards in comparison however is a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.170
 great buy for the inter and could 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.170
 do very well paired with mourinho 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.650
 that I wanted to scream of one and make it 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.349
 a rare gold card for me would be 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.660
 better a rare silver card serves 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.890
 much more fascinating as a card e 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.680
 would certainly have excellent ones 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.870
 here mourinho statistics from 75 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.090
 I don't know how it could be 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.040
 however, it is fascinating as a card 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.980
 a good buy for the inter did 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.630
 a good one has played good races in the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.750
 cup america so I think yes 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.190
 may deserve at least one of which is the 75 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.630
 last year playing the grenade that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.370
 it was a team that suffered so many 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.470
 goal then having a little difficult 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.810
 however put the statistics in 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.670
 mourinho then we complete the defense with 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.190
 criscito that I had already treated in a 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.290
 potential transfer could arrive 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.660
 believe as a left-back 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.940
 inter and I say may not now 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.280
 sa growth or otherwise disputed a 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.950
 excellent season this year with the zenith 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.139
 and so I have I increased the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.910
 rating of two because there is and also of 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.590
 very statistics because I am a mac 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.170
 he deserves it because he is this year's criscito 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.690
 I repeat, he made a good season 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.970
 felipe melo midfield is one of the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.609
 purchases that the inter could lead to 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.859
 term actually the negotiation in 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.720
 this quite firm moment pro 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.989
 felipe melo could be for how long 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.489
 regards its physicality in the midst of 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.639
 iii boss be a good buy for 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.989
 the inter he also low down shouted of 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.400
 one seems to me because he didn't do one 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.260
 exceptional season has it anyway 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.930
 received an iv version if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.739
 but nothing that anyway from 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.970
 statistics 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.940
 he is still a great midfielder 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.739
 for the series to how the rest could 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.620
 be a good midfielder with dog of 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.950
 know that I wanted to increase they know I'm wrong 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.930
 more overall, however, they did not 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.359
 rare though perhaps with a statistic 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.400
 how the physical 85 could make it a 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.190
 rare player to this I do not know 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.650
 However 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.570
 I have increased some statistics because 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.739
 commenting on more 3d overall you have to 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.060
 increase some statistics 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.260
 made a great season with the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.280
 monaco also made a goal in 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.390
 champions league what we have 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.940
 seen 1200 times this year on the various 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.350
 Sky and Mediaset networks, anyway 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.000
 could be a good, certain card 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.590
 he is not a very fast player and does not have 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.540
 not even a great pass even one 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.870
 great dribbling however defensively it is 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.410
 increased physical defense that is then 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.000
 kovacic here kovacic I did not know if 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.700
 increase or decrease at the end I have 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.890
 decided to increase 1 and in any case 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.440
 make it a rare gold player 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.570
 because he made several goals this year 8 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.370
 goal if I'm not mistaken and therefore as there 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.960
 could have upgraded to this 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.360
 player even if he hasn't always played 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.560
 very well to tell the truth anyway 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.330
 it would really be a card 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.460
 interesting because of its simplicity 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.800
 of his dribbling on discreet shooting a 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.390
 what is seen and the excellent passage 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.860
 so it could really be a card 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.110
 interesting for the series in the year 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.020
 next then we go with the attack 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.910
 we find jovetic that should do 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.310
 let's say the second tip that plays a 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.700
 right and back on the left or something 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.500
 of the kind I can't manage to comprehend 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.990
 of the fact that this player in January 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.669
 have received an upgrade which i think it is 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.870
 totally in deserved also because not 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.530
 he played so much he played 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.870
 relatively little in the manchester city 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.310
 hence this downgrade is derived from 1 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.110
 compared to its upgrade version of 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.870
 this year, however, in those statistics 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.880
 more or less remained unchanged e 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.640
 however, it is a discreet card 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.200
 obviously that shift to from 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.360
 right will make a little more effort seen 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.480
 that this player is not super fast 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.760
 then we have the thistles that upgrade it more 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.350
 great of this year's why 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.990
 has played a season 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.630
 wonderful with 27 goals to his credit if 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.000
 I'm not mistaken in season and so yes 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.550
 deserves a more 5 among other things it seems to me of 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.590
 ie the statistics of much increased 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.990
 especially the shot also plus 5 if 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.490
 I'm not mistaken, it's the rest of the ssis that 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.490
 he also did several assists this year 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.310
 it derives precisely the most perhaps four 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.990
 in the passage between I don't remember 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.480
 however icardi did an excellent job 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.370
 season this year and must be repeated 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.720
 next year so this would be 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.150
 a really interesting card me 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.880
 remember a little let's say a 20 that of the 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.620
 bpl with less physical but obviously the 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.360
 paper a little like us 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.740
 and to complete we have perisic that 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.900
 player who practically since when 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.240
 now otherwise or almost always been 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.830
 a card not rare and so I think that 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.180
 also next year it will be if 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.460
 will come to the interior even if the 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.140
 negotiation seems very complicated but ne 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.940
 we talked if I'm not mistaken 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.700
 in the last potential transfer a little 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.970
 perisic however statistics that more or 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.440
 fewer or fewer because it is not 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.360
 it was his best season that 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.960
 alfons even this year compared to those 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.640
 previous 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.400
 maybe also because he played a lot less 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.720
 compared to previous seasons 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.150
 having regard to the competition in attack of the 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.210
 force blue is actually not needed 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.620
 a left wing but an exterior that 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.390
 the trequartista can also do so 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.730
 it will then be necessary to see how it will be used 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.560
 left-handed anyway this is mine 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.680
 team is my team the team 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.570
 which he suggested in midfield I put 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.070
 kovacic because there was no bromwich but 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.110
 he could play too or even
