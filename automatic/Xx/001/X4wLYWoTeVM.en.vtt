using<00:00:34.230> six<00:00:34.620> by<00:00:34.800> six<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.090> may<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
using six by six then you may want to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.560 
using six by six then you may want to
use<00:00:36.630> an<00:00:36.780> 18<00:00:37.110> inch<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.410> diameter<00:00:37.590> hole<00:00:38.540> but<00:00:39.540> that

use an 18 inch in diameter hole but that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.209 
use an 18 inch in diameter hole but that
allows<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> move<00:00:40.379> your<00:00:40.530> post<00:00:40.770> around<00:00:41.070> a

allows you to move your post around a
little<00:00:41.430> bit<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> make<00:00:41.879> adjustments<00:00:42.090> as

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
little bit and make adjustments as

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
little bit and make adjustments as
you're<00:00:43.079> actually<00:00:43.260> setting<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.950> post<00:00:44.219> plumb

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
you're actually setting your post plumb

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.900 
you're actually setting your post plumb
now<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> good<00:00:45.870> technique<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> have

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
now a good technique to have is to have

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.080 
now a good technique to have is to have
one<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> these<00:00:48.800> two-sided<00:00:49.800> levels<00:00:50.190> these

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
one of these two-sided levels these

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.420 
one of these two-sided levels these
strap<00:00:51.480> onto<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.079> post<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.340> allow

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
strap onto your post and what they allow

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
strap onto your post and what they allow
to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> set<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.510> your<00:00:54.539> post<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.079> has<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to do is you set in your post it has a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
to do is you set in your post it has a
bubble<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.100> side<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> post<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
bubble on this side of the post and a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.020 
bubble on this side of the post and a
bubble<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.600> side<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> post<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
bubble on this side of the post so you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
bubble on this side of the post so you
can<00:01:00.120> take<00:01:00.270> your<00:01:00.420> batter<00:01:00.629> boards<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
can take your batter boards here and you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
can take your batter boards here and you
can<00:01:02.300> at<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.539> same<00:01:03.809> time<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.339> plumb<00:01:05.930> both

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
can at the same time you can plumb both

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
can at the same time you can plumb both
sides<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.680> your<00:01:07.979> posts<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.850> make<00:01:08.880> sure<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
sides of your posts to make sure that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
sides of your posts to make sure that
you're<00:01:09.570> straight<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.200> down<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you're straight up and down and that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.950 
you're straight up and down and that
works<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.520> little<00:01:11.640> bit<00:01:11.820> better<00:01:12.060> than<00:01:12.360> having<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
works a little bit better than having to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.380 
works a little bit better than having to
set<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.860> side<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.610> come<00:01:14.850> around<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
set one side and then come around and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.359 
set one side and then come around and
set<00:01:16.020> another<00:01:16.259> side<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> standard

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
set another side just using a standard

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.440 
set another side just using a standard

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
level the next thing we're going to do

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.620 
level the next thing we're going to do
is<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.080> want<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.500> sure<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:24.420> have

something to secure our fencing to so

tall fence two runners will be

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
tall fence two runners will be

foot if you go over that six foot you
may<00:02:17.610> want<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.880> add<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> third<00:02:18.420> runner<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
may want to add a third runner and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.070 
may want to add a third runner and
actually<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.440> middle<00:02:19.770> runner<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:21.480> a

couple<00:02:22.470> ways<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:23.070> secure<00:02:23.370> your<00:02:23.580> fencing

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
couple ways you can secure your fencing

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.160 
couple ways you can secure your fencing
is<00:02:24.210> either<00:02:24.840> using<00:02:25.320> screws<00:02:25.710> or<00:02:26.040> using<00:02:26.610> nails<00:02:27.170> if

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
is either using screws or using nails if

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.730 
is either using screws or using nails if
you<00:02:28.470> are<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:30.050> environment<00:02:31.050> where<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.560> have

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
you are in a environment where you have

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.190 
you are in a environment where you have
a<00:02:31.770> lot<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.070> temperature<00:02:32.970> extremes<00:02:33.420> may<00:02:34.020> be<00:02:34.080> a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
a lot of temperature extremes may be a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.940 
a lot of temperature extremes may be a
good<00:02:34.410> idea<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.240> use<00:02:36.240> screws<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.500> allow<00:02:37.740> your

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
good idea to use screws that allow your

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.550 
good idea to use screws that allow your
fence<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.400> last<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.790> little<00:02:38.940> bit<00:02:39.030> longer<00:02:39.560> than

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
fence to last a little bit longer than

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.220 
fence to last a little bit longer than
just<00:02:41.490> nailing<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:42.000> together<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:43.020> Tim
