you begin by folding asked where you
start<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.489> square<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.689> fold<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.020> corner<00:00:25.349> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
start with square you fold it corner to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.909 
start with square you fold it corner to
corner<00:00:25.680> unfold<00:00:26.300> it<00:00:27.320> fold<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> corner<00:00:28.800> to

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
corner unfold it fold it corner to

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:35.450 
corner unfold it fold it corner to
corner<00:00:29.099> unfold<00:00:29.509> it<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.890> opposing

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
corner unfold it you take the opposing

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.079 
corner unfold it you take the opposing
sides<00:00:35.789> and<00:00:36.179> squish<00:00:36.929> them<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:39.410> okay<00:00:41.000> flatten<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
sides and squish them in okay flatten it

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.450 
sides and squish them in okay flatten it
and<00:00:43.070> lay<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.100> down<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:46.070> squish<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
going to have the long side towards you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.819 
going to have the long side towards you
and<00:00:59.159> the<00:00:59.489> point<00:00:59.730> up<00:01:05.090> fold<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.270> from<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.590> top

and the point up fold it from the top

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.880 
and the point up fold it from the top
down<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:09.570> fold<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:11.960> one<00:01:12.960> layer<00:01:13.259> a<00:01:13.290> favor

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
down you fold one one layer a favor

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.889 
down you fold one one layer a favor
right<00:01:14.610> down<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:15.000> center<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.659> straight

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
right down the center so it's straight

little swing and fold it back back the
other<00:01:27.390> way<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> edge<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.969> that<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:31.530> piece

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
other way to the edge of that that piece

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.550 
other way to the edge of that that piece
of<00:01:31.770> paper<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.610> edge<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> itself<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> you're

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
of paper the edge of itself so you're

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.389 
of paper the edge of itself so you're
going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:36.740> do<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> same<00:01:38.070> thing<00:01:38.280> on

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
going to have this do the same thing on

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.490 
going to have this do the same thing on
the<00:01:38.490> other<00:01:38.520> side<00:01:39.560> take<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.710> paper<00:01:42.320> end<00:01:43.320> it

other half sway a half and take this
part<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.190> tip<00:02:13.010> crease<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.160> down

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
part and go up to the tip crease it down

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.190 
part and go up to the tip crease it down
do<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> same<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.390> both<00:02:15.540> sides<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.050> have

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
do the same on both sides so you have

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.560 
do the same on both sides so you have
this<00:02:24.740> now<00:02:25.740> take<00:02:26.010> these<00:02:26.220> corner<00:02:26.910> edges<00:02:27.090> here

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
this now take these corner edges here

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.980 
this now take these corner edges here
and<00:02:27.750> fold<00:02:28.050> them<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.950> center<00:02:29.220> line<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.990> am

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and fold them to the center line I am

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.140 
and fold them to the center line I am
like<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.850> Shh<00:02:32.850> why<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.690> center<00:02:34.080> line<00:02:34.290> and

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
like you Shh why is the center line and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.920 
like you Shh why is the center line and
fold<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:41.420> then<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> same<00:02:42.900> thing

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
fold it in and then you the same thing

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.730 
fold it in and then you the same thing
to<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.320> other<00:02:43.350> side<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:46.050> i'm<00:02:46.200> using<00:02:46.500> card

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
to the other side and i'm using card

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.220 
to the other side and i'm using card
stock<00:02:47.040> because<00:02:47.370> they<00:02:47.730> hop<00:02:47.940> better<00:02:48.210> these<00:02:49.080> are

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
stock because they hop better these are

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.740 
stock because they hop better these are
they<00:02:49.470> actually<00:02:50.010> will<00:02:50.130> help<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.390> makes<00:02:51.600> it

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
they actually will help but it makes it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.260 
they actually will help but it makes it
harder<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.050> make<00:02:52.320> them<00:02:52.470> too<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.580> now<00:02:54.060> you're

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
harder to make them too and now you're

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.440 
harder to make them too and now you're
gonna<00:02:54.390> have<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:56.040> little<00:02:56.489> frog<00:02:56.880> thing<00:02:59.450> now

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
gonna have this little frog thing now

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.910 
gonna have this little frog thing now
you're<00:03:00.630> going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.870> take<00:03:01.110> from<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:02.040> bottom<00:03:02.489> of
