00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.380 
but downside about blast burn you have

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
to recharge so i have to recharge

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.620 
to recharge so i have to recharge
because<00:01:30.390> i<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.570> only<00:01:31.110> had<00:01:31.409> um<00:01:31.619> uh<00:01:32.420> was<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
because i think only had um uh was it a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.590 
because i think only had um uh was it a
focus<00:01:34.170> blast<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.890> hyper<00:01:35.880> beam<00:01:36.180> but

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
focus blast and hyper beam but

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
focus blast and hyper beam but

surprisingly i live on one cuz of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.609 
surprisingly i live on one cuz of
leftovers<00:01:39.630> damaging<00:01:40.079> i<00:01:40.170> guess<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
leftovers damaging i guess because of

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.990 
leftovers damaging i guess because of

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
gonna come again or I should have

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.930 
gonna come again or I should have
thought<00:03:49.620> sky<00:03:49.919> uppercut<00:03:50.160> was<00:03:50.430> coming<00:03:50.700> again

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.460 
thought sky uppercut was coming again
but<00:03:51.419> I<00:03:51.450> didn't<00:03:51.690> think<00:03:51.720> he'd<00:03:51.959> go<00:03:52.139> that<00:03:52.169> looks

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
but I didn't think he'd go that looks

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.620 
but I didn't think he'd go that looks
like<00:03:52.650> go<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.190> drifblim<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.180> go<00:03:54.450> into

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
like go in the drifblim so I go into

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.629 
like go in the drifblim so I go into
murkrow<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.440> try<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:55.919> like<00:03:56.040> tape<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.459> sky

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
I got choice banded murkrow what you

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.750 
I got choice banded murkrow what you
know<00:04:31.200> about<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.500> but<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:32.370> comes<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.730> little

bunny so I'm thinking maybe I could take
a<00:04:34.770> sky<00:04:35.040> uppercut<00:04:35.310> but<00:04:35.550> then<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.760> forget<00:04:36.060> return

I'm<00:05:33.870> gonna<00:05:33.990> go<00:05:34.080> ahead<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.320> just<00:05:34.470> go<00:05:34.590> for<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.770> I

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
I'm gonna go ahead and just go for the I

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.860 
I'm gonna go ahead and just go for the I
short<00:05:35.100> just<00:05:35.280> cuz<00:05:35.430> priority<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.150> take<00:05:36.690> out<00:05:36.840> the

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
short just cuz priority and take out the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.850 
short just cuz priority and take out the
take<00:05:37.710> out<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.920> oh<00:05:38.420> yeah<00:05:39.420> glaceon<00:05:40.050> so<00:05:40.380> now<00:05:40.770> he

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
take out the oh yeah glaceon so now he

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.320 
take out the oh yeah glaceon so now he
brings<00:05:41.040> in<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.430> thing<00:05:41.640> and<00:05:41.790> I'm<00:05:41.970> not<00:05:42.150> really

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
brings in this thing and I'm not really

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.700 
brings in this thing and I'm not really
sure<00:05:42.450> I'm<00:05:42.750> thinking<00:05:43.080> he's<00:05:43.170> probably<00:05:43.380> gonna<00:05:43.560> go

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
sure I'm thinking he's probably gonna go

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.140 
sure I'm thinking he's probably gonna go
for<00:05:43.920> his<00:05:44.010> fourth<00:05:44.310> move<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.610> don't<00:05:44.790> know<00:05:44.880> what<00:05:45.060> it

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
for his fourth move I don't know what it

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.640 
for his fourth move I don't know what it
is<00:05:45.240> so<00:05:45.390> I'm<00:05:45.480> just<00:05:45.570> gonna<00:05:45.720> stay<00:05:45.930> in<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:46.290> chardon

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
is so I'm just gonna stay in I chardon

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.070 
is so I'm just gonna stay in I chardon
he<00:05:47.430> /<00:05:47.670> predicts<00:05:48.000> or<00:05:48.180> something<00:05:48.540> and<00:05:48.750> goes<00:05:49.050> for

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
he / predicts or something and goes for

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.840 
he / predicts or something and goes for
a<00:05:49.410> different<00:05:49.860> move<00:05:49.980> but<00:05:50.220> then<00:05:50.340> he<00:05:50.430> tells<00:05:50.640> me<00:05:50.790> he

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
a different move but then he tells me he

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.910 
a different move but then he tells me he
had<00:05:50.970> fire<00:05:51.210> punch<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:51.900> it<00:05:52.380> probably<00:05:52.650> didn't

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
had fire punch so it probably didn't

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.050 
had fire punch so it probably didn't
really<00:05:53.130> matter<00:05:53.280> what<00:05:53.550> he<00:05:53.670> would<00:05:53.790> have<00:05:53.820> went

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
really matter what he would have went

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.910 
really matter what he would have went
for<00:05:54.300> well<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:54.780> sky<00:05:54.960> uppercut<00:05:55.200> okay<00:05:55.680> I<00:05:55.710> could

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
for well the sky uppercut okay I could

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.960 
for well the sky uppercut okay I could
have<00:05:56.010> brought<00:05:56.130> in<00:05:56.340> drift<00:05:56.550> flume<00:05:56.730> but<00:05:56.880> he

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
have brought in drift flume but he

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.640 
have brought in drift flume but he
probably<00:05:57.210> would<00:05:57.450> have<00:05:57.510> out<00:05:57.810> sped<00:05:58.230> me<00:05:58.410> and<00:05:58.530> just
