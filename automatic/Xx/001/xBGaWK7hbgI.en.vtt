speed as any racing kart it's going to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.720 
speed as any racing kart it's going to
be<00:00:51.059> low<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.379> 11<00:00:53.250> PHP<00:00:54.149> or<00:00:54.410> 62<00:00:55.410> point<00:00:55.980> 9<00:00:56.219> mph

for<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.870> kart<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:58.590> that's<00:00:58.739> fine<00:00:59.010> really

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
for go kart I think that's fine really

for go kart I think that's fine really
and<00:00:59.730> yeah<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.930> salvation<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and yeah so this salvation it's a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219 
and yeah so this salvation it's a
go-kart<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.789> has<00:01:02.910> no<00:01:03.120> gears<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
go-kart it has no gears so it's going to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.780 
go-kart it has no gears so it's going to
be<00:01:04.290> slow<00:01:04.680> nought<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> 60<00:01:06.210> MPH<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.790> thirteen

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
be slow nought to 60 MPH is thirteen

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.750 
be slow nought to 60 MPH is thirteen
point<00:01:09.770> 91<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:14.040> car<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.520> think

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
point 91 so it's it's for go car I think

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
point 91 so it's it's for go car I think
I<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.420> okay<00:01:15.720> really<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.560> weight

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I think that it's okay really the weight

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
I think that it's okay really the weight
is<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.610> loucks<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:18.630> small

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740 
is going to be loucks it's a very small
car<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.560> racing<00:01:20.159> kart<00:01:20.450> it's<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> be

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
car it's racing kart it's going to be

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.640 
car it's racing kart it's going to be
slow<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.950> 85<00:01:23.790> kilograms<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
slow and it's 85 kilograms so it's it's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.080 
slow and it's 85 kilograms so it's it's
very<00:01:26.159> light<00:01:27.439> p-p-performance<00:01:28.439> point<00:01:29.280> it's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
very light p-p-performance point it's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.690 
very light p-p-performance point it's
going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.570> low<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.340> okay

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
going to be low but I think it's okay
