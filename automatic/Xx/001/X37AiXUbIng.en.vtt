because<00:03:48.879> of<00:03:48.970> Iowa<00:03:50.250> yes<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.729> pretty<00:03:52.419> nice

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
because of Iowa yes this is pretty nice

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.539 
because of Iowa yes this is pretty nice
to<00:03:52.780> get<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.900> good<00:03:53.079> experience<00:03:53.379> it<00:03:53.949> has<00:03:54.099> an<00:03:54.189> AMD

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
to get a good experience it has an AMD

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.809 
to get a good experience it has an AMD
a6<00:03:55.329> processor<00:03:55.629> so<00:03:56.470> it's<00:03:56.620> not<00:03:56.739> incredibly<00:03:57.519> fast

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
a6 processor so it's not incredibly fast

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.749 
a6 processor so it's not incredibly fast
like<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.180> said<00:03:58.389> but<00:03:58.659> it<00:03:58.780> still<00:03:59.049> can<00:03:59.229> handle<00:03:59.759> most

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:00.759 
like I said but it still can handle most

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.259 
like I said but it still can handle most
tasks<00:04:01.509> with<00:04:01.959> relative<00:04:02.620> ease<00:04:02.859> so<00:04:03.819> that's

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
tasks with relative ease so that's

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.129 
tasks with relative ease so that's
that's<00:04:04.750> pretty<00:04:04.959> nice<00:04:06.479> if<00:04:07.479> you're<00:04:07.659> looking<00:04:07.930> for

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
well something you can do with this is

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.679 
well something you can do with this is
this<00:06:59.969> bends<00:07:00.300> back<00:07:01.219> really<00:07:02.219> far<00:07:02.759> not<00:07:03.089> all<00:07:03.479> the

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:05.909 
way around but you know it's not a

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.790 
way around but you know it's not a
convertible<00:07:06.509> but<00:07:06.899> it<00:07:07.169> still<00:07:07.409> bends<00:07:07.589> back
