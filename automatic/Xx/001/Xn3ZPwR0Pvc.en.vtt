 well folks this is how you should perform a basic driving test in 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.049
 a car

 this currently the basic torada driving can only be done in cars 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.400
 that are in manual gear before it can be more automatic but this with 

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:19.619
 the new transit law has changed 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.560

 a car with manual gears 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.229
 first but not to put the belt and check that everything is in place 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.569
 then the driver after having fastened his belt 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:38.849
 to check their mirrors to perform the correct maneuvers of success of the 

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:42.429
 mission is correct and if we fail all the views of the automobile

 to be in the other we put the key in the car instructor 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 it turns on 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.930
 To make the departure it is very important to take into account that the train 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.940
 loved to be in position before making any movement 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 be exhorted slowly with the handbrake 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.930
 it was once or the cto 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.080
 the pri has to have the brake 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.440
 then expressed being while in the background 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.560
 with the left leg 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.109
 the driver must put in first gear that usually discounted the knee 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.409
 to perform a basic output 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.650
 and satisfactory 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.580
 they must leave first 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.990
 clinically celebrating and releasing and flowers 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.500
 paola actively 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.300
 in a way little by little a game about this commented first to the accelerator and it's 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.190
 that is coming out slowly 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.900
 the car before advanced at an average speed of 5 to 10 kilometers per hour 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.560
 after that speed 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.060
 if you have athlete alarms 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.909
 and after that it does not get marched second gear 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.909
 defend in beade and moving to second 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:20.429
 Always remember to maintain the proper speed before changing each archer 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.439
 specific 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.959
 the car always keeps if it is true 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.799
 an indicator that is called a tachometer 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.989
 the tachometer indicates how much speed you have to make a change stain 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.989
 and west to which the engine requests it 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.499
 each time the speed is also reduced, the driver must perform 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.499
 a change getting sent to you that this fund 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.569
 operators as best you know it and making the change of gear 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.950
 already on the road if a driver wants to make a turn it is necessary to put 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:55.849
 divisional to where it will open 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.789
 in this case the right 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:01.319
 it is pulled that everything is correct and makes the oit see if the turn 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.870
 the driver must press with the characteristics of the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.870

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.840
 from here on the street from both directions in most cases and there 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.549
 that keep right by you find a car in the sense coupon 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.869
 contrary 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.619
 always remember also that when braking 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.579
 stop using the first option brake 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.579
 and then put the drunk slowly 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.339
 If you want to pass, get in first, brake 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:42.819
 and then the drunk to achieve correct restraint without the engine 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:43.689
 turn off 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.689
 our mentor we have how it is done 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.799
 the estate we want to show you how it would be a bad exit by car 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.519
 remembering that the right step by letting him see that slowly and sticking 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.399
 throttle 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.909
 in this case we are going to see 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.010
 the dna of the mode just now do it and the way in which car drives the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.010
 do it the wrong way 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.089
 driver will put gear first 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:16.089
 and the Inca heat in some cases until it fades 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.939
 driver to undertake new automobile 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.049
 put marching first 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 and try not 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.800
 in that way but noted the exit was a bit fast since the driver 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.750
 accelerated more than what issa kort them in a very quick way 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.009
 it is not known why he will do with the arsenal of the otsc to park 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.949
 and slowly approaches the inner edge of the sidewalk 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.870
 until you stop the car 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.870
 for its entirety 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.849
 He concluded that he hopes to achieve a successful peace unity
