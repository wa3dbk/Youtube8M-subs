00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.940
 one day you wake up and understand what 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.539

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.400
 forever you realize it's too late 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.130

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.050

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.539

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.800

 scientists have discovered a way to change the weather 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.240

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.230

 heaven on earth 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.090

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.449
