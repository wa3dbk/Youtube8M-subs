percent white at one hundred percent
this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> custom<00:01:30.180> setting<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:32.090> have

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
this is custom setting so we can have

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.560 
this is custom setting so we can have
the<00:01:33.270> lights

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.780 

change<00:01:36.290> intensity<00:01:36.920> every<00:01:37.190> half<00:01:37.400> hour<00:01:37.610> every

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.280 
from one percent to one hunter there's
also<00:01:43.850> sunny<00:01:44.330> cloudy<00:01:44.840> moon<00:01:45.380> mode<00:01:47.050> which<00:01:48.050> is

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
also sunny cloudy moon mode which is

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.469 
also sunny cloudy moon mode which is
kind<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.590> just<00:01:48.650> a<00:01:48.890> default<00:01:49.340> if<00:01:49.940> you<00:01:50.150> just<00:01:50.330> want

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
kind of just a default if you just want

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.280 
kind of just a default if you just want
to<00:01:50.570> quickly<00:01:50.750> turn<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.100> preset

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
to quickly turn it on to a preset

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.320 
to quickly turn it on to a preset
setting<00:01:54.290> but<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.009> main<00:01:55.220> where<00:01:55.580> we<00:01:55.729> do

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
setting but this is the main where we do

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.999 
setting but this is the main where we do
our<00:01:56.360> programming<00:01:57.050> so<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.380> can<00:01:57.560> see<00:01:57.740> we<00:01:57.890> can

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
our programming so you can see we can

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.690 
our programming so you can see we can
drop<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:59.200> color<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:01.009> can<00:02:01.160> drop<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.520> percentage

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.070 

in<00:02:04.899> 1%<00:02:05.899> increments

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.200 

there<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:10.890> also<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.250> preview<00:02:11.640> function<00:02:11.820> there

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
there is also a preview function there

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.340 
there is also a preview function there
which<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.510> nice<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.840> I'm<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.110> kind<00:02:13.260> of

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
which is nice so I'm going to kind of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.610 
which is nice so I'm going to kind of
pan<00:02:13.920> back<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.550> we'll<00:02:14.640> see<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.880> color<00:02:15.120> change

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:30.200 

as<00:02:20.709> we<00:02:21.430> go<00:02:21.670> here

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.760 

getting<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.080> more<00:02:31.350> bluer<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.490> nice

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
getting a little more bluer to a nice

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.270 
getting a little more bluer to a nice
deep<00:02:34.770> 20k<00:02:35.430> blue<00:02:35.730> maybe<00:02:36.120> 25<00:02:36.720> k

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.750 

and<00:02:41.430> we're<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.180> adjusting<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> quickly<00:02:43.760> for

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
and we're just adjusting it quickly for

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.090 
and we're just adjusting it quickly for
the<00:02:44.790> video<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.600> kind<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.870> show<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:46.470> you

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the video to kind of show you but you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.400 
the video to kind of show you but you
can<00:02:47.280> adjust<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:47.910> subtly<00:02:48.630> at<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.930> percent

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
can adjust it so subtly at one percent

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.850 
can adjust it so subtly at one percent
every<00:02:49.530> half<00:02:49.800> hour<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:51.390> couple<00:02:52.140> percent<00:02:52.650> five

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
every half hour a couple percent five

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.640 
every half hour a couple percent five
percent<00:02:53.310> every<00:02:53.370> hour<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.140> be<00:02:55.260> seemly

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
percent every hour and it just be seemly

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.920 
percent every hour and it just be seemly
she<00:02:55.830> won't<00:02:56.010> even<00:02:56.130> realize<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.580> each<00:02:57.510> the

she won't even realize that each the

she won't even realize that each the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
blues mostly the blues on the rest of

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.940 
blues mostly the blues on the rest of
the<00:03:08.910> time<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.720> good<00:03:09.930> shot<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.830> can

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
the time it's a good shot here you can

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.010 
the time it's a good shot here you can
kind<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.160> see<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.489> colors<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.480> there<00:03:12.810> it's

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
kind of see the colors in there it's

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.780 
kind of see the colors in there it's
easy<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.470> look<00:03:13.650> at<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.830> reflection<00:03:13.950> right

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
easy if I look at the reflection right

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.210 
easy if I look at the reflection right
here<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.019> see<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> Reds<00:03:16.530> there's<00:03:16.950> three

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
here you can see the Reds there's three

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.390 
here you can see the Reds there's three
Reds<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.880> three<00:03:18.120> greens<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:19.130> those<00:03:20.130> are<00:03:20.310> on

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
Reds and three greens and those are on

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.070 
Reds and three greens and those are on
the<00:03:20.519> white<00:03:20.670> circuit<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.360> then<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.660> can<00:03:21.810> see

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
the white circuit and then you can see

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.460 
the white circuit and then you can see
all<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.830> rows<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.430> blue<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:25.019> it's

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
all the rows of blue so it's it's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.740 
all the rows of blue so it's it's
heavier<00:03:25.800> in<00:03:26.010> blue<00:03:26.190> than<00:03:26.430> white<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.420> can

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
heavier in blue than white so you can

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.809 
heavier in blue than white so you can
generally<00:03:28.200> run<00:03:28.410> your<00:03:28.560> blues<00:03:28.800> turned<00:03:29.610> all<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
generally run your blues turned all the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.729 
generally run your blues turned all the
way<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.269> hundred<00:03:30.360> percent<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.080> then<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
way up to a hundred percent and then the

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.180 
way up to a hundred percent and then the
whites<00:03:31.980> we<00:03:32.310> usually<00:03:32.670> run<00:03:32.880> say<00:03:34.100> anywheres<00:03:35.100> from

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
whites we usually run say anywheres from

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.030 
whites we usually run say anywheres from
10<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:36.000> maybe<00:03:36.510> fifty<00:03:36.780> sixty<00:03:37.410> percent<00:03:37.620> just

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
10 to maybe fifty sixty percent just

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.880 
10 to maybe fifty sixty percent just
depending<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:39.600> look<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.050> want<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.560> so

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
depending on the look you want and so

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.650 
depending on the look you want and so
the<00:03:41.010> Reds<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.550> Greens<00:03:41.819> they<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.330> dim<00:03:42.510> at

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
the Reds and the Greens they just dim at

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.870 
the Reds and the Greens they just dim at
the<00:03:42.780> same<00:03:43.019> rate<00:03:43.050> as<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.440> whites<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.640> don't

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
the same rate as the whites so you don't

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.910 
the same rate as the whites so you don't
have<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.209> mess<00:03:45.900> around<00:03:46.079> with<00:03:46.410> four<00:03:46.650> or<00:03:46.769> five

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
have to mess around with four or five

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.520 
have to mess around with four or five
different<00:03:47.130> channels<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.320> two

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
different channels it's just the two

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.790 
different channels it's just the two
channels

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
channels

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.450 
channels
and<00:03:52.310> then<00:03:52.700> we<00:03:52.820> also<00:03:53.950> have<00:03:54.950> our<00:03:54.980> moonlight

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
and then we also have our moonlight

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.350 
and then we also have our moonlight
function<00:03:57.130> which<00:03:58.130> is<00:04:00.760> there<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.880> a<00:04:01.910> manual

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
function which is there is a manual

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.390 
function which is there is a manual
setting<00:04:02.960> you<00:04:03.080> can<00:04:03.110> go<00:04:03.410> right<00:04:03.590> up<00:04:03.710> to<00:04:03.740> moon<00:04:04.070> and

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
setting you can go right up to moon and

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.140 
setting you can go right up to moon and
turn<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.270> on<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.780> what<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.470> does<00:04:06.650> is<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
turn it on and what it does is it and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.810 
turn it on and what it does is it and
you<00:04:08.810> can<00:04:09.110> kind<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.380> see<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.710> just<00:04:09.950> turns<00:04:10.160> on<00:04:10.370> two

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
you can kind of see it just turns on two

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.720 
you can kind of see it just turns on two
of<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:11.000> blue<00:04:11.270> LEDs<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.650> anything<00:04:13.070> on<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.520> blue

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
of the blue LEDs so anything on the blue

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.000 
of the blue LEDs so anything on the blue
that's<00:04:14.060> less<00:04:14.600> than<00:04:14.630> ten<00:04:15.050> percent<00:04:15.500> it'll<00:04:15.860> turn

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
that's less than ten percent it'll turn

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.640 
that's less than ten percent it'll turn
those<00:04:16.280> on<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.790> you<00:04:17.330> can<00:04:17.510> turn<00:04:17.720> those<00:04:17.959> they<00:04:18.440> can

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
those on and you can turn those they can

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.350 
those on and you can turn those they can
be<00:04:18.739> adjusted<00:04:18.830> up<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.459> down<00:04:19.610> a<00:04:19.640> little<00:04:19.940> bit<00:04:20.150> and

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
be adjusted up and down a little bit and

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.350 
be adjusted up and down a little bit and
then<00:04:20.920> once<00:04:21.920> it<00:04:22.100> passes<00:04:22.250> ten<00:04:22.700> percent<00:04:23.090> then<00:04:23.240> all

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
then once it passes ten percent then all

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.470 
then once it passes ten percent then all
the<00:04:23.510> blues<00:04:23.690> come<00:04:23.930> on<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:26.680> yeah<00:04:28.300> other<00:04:29.300> than

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
the blues come on and yeah other than

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.410 
the blues come on and yeah other than
