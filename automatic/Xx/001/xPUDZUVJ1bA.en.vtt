 Of course you can buy and such 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.640
 Here is the option of the skin already finished but 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.860
 accordingly and lay out the money you 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.820
 will have for her too much more 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:33.050
 I will show you today how to stick as 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:37.470
 make emery for trading boards 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.379
 from the usual light skins 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.449
 what we need to do we need 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.610
 of course sample and sport today we 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.880
 We will consider everything on the example of a penny 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.430
 and we also need the usual scripting 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.190
 pelt that you can purchase and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.629
 for about 3 4 dollars in any 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.739
 specialized store we need 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:04.940
 stationery knife files or any 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.869
 hard thing you can 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:13.350
 smooth over the edges well and preferably scissors and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.080
 so we take the skin and roughly pretends 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 lope along the length we need it so 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 how is my pony origin Original 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.640
 22 inches we go first we cut by 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.429
 length here we look here with us 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.649
 ends with tail respectively 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:36.899
 this piece we just cut as we 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:46.250
 will then take the uncomfortable glue 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:46.250
 scissors and something like this 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.900
 be careful as paper is like this 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.659
 see me as I can easily 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:10.270
 tear off gradually 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:13.560
 no bubbles in the air like this 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 here we tear off gradually 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.940
 does not stick 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.690
 everything 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:35.740
 the skin we pasted 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:37.810
 smooth it out a bit and now we need 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.930
 trim the excess here to us and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.480
 Need a file to draw 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:49.350
 edges we take straight like this we go by 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.850
 rules in the team on the skin to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.850
 dashed si tamped edges 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.989
 now take a knife take a knife and 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.930
 starting to trim 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.290
 so here we go on the edge and cut off the excess 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.780
 Of course you can already ride , but so yourself 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.840
 You know, it doesn't look quite beautiful. 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.150
 You see, I have this here. 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.730
 the column on which he is bad 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.310
 glued here see here like this 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.319
 there is a rim and we need to cut here 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.170
 straight on this rim so that he looked 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.530
 as original for this, we too 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.300
 should be here 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.300
 tamp to set the border 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:13.090
 Now we take a knife and neat 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.930
 we cut off here very important 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.139
 moment listen 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.840
 here we have emery plastic and 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.669
 You can not push hard on the knife if you will 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.370
 push the knife hard then you will 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.509
 unpleasant knife marks then on 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:33.000
 plastic is therefore light 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:33.000
 not zealous prune 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.910
 that's all now agree 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.990
 everything looks so much better to us 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.820
 need to cut a circle is the most difficult 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.660
 we need about 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.660
 to find 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:17.560
 a file and means of defense probably 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:19.330
 better find a circle here it is here and so 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.889
 do not make a mistake with the contour must first 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.240
 make a cut a little bit more 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:30.330
 accent and then trim more 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.330
 the first cut is not exactly straight 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:54.770
 That's about how we got it 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.189
 cut here a little uneven but 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:02.580
 We believe to do better to get 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:06.379
 quite to yourself, see a picture of this 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:11.129
 same as at from the penny itself 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:13.259
 can see that for three dollars we 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:17.159
 we get about the same as you 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:22.349
 can get for a for 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:23.550
 somewhere around 10 euros more if 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.519
 neatly do everything then you 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.679
 surely everything will work out and what else I want 

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:31.199
 add what you can find 

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:33.830
 ordinary sandpaper is much much better 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:38.009
 quality than ponies do 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:41.339
 accordingly, it will give you good too 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.229
 advantage well and emery of course 

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:46.919
 done not just for beauty ride 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:48.659
 he is much more comfortable with your feet 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.769
 will not slip on big 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:53.099
 speed you will feel yourself 

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:56.999
 much more stable and indeed you will be 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:07:00.139
 more comfortable to ride on this if 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:04.800
 You thought about purchasing 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:07.110
 the original need for cancellation 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.389
 quite a good option which you 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.480
 can do it yourself and save 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.640
 some money 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.010
