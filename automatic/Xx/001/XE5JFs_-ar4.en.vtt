turns<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> disable<00:01:45.540> some<00:01:45.960> of

turns on so you can disable some of
these<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> will<00:01:47.550> make<00:01:47.580> your

these and then that will make your

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.390 
these and then that will make your
compute<00:01:48.150> startup<00:01:48.570> faster<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.740> example<00:01:50.250> when

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
I turn on my computer I might not want

I turn on my computer I might not want
to<00:01:52.320> Skype<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.770> immediately<00:01:53.250> turn<00:01:53.580> on<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.390> can

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to Skype to immediately turn on so I can

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.990 
to Skype to immediately turn on so I can
uncheck<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.290> then<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.430> disabled

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
uncheck it and then now it's disabled

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
one last tip I have is a disk

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.729 
one last tip I have is a disk
Defragmenter<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.750> access<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.650> to

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
Defragmenter to access it you have to

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.440 
Defragmenter to access it you have to
hit<00:02:19.890> start<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.489> then<00:02:20.790> search<00:02:21.000> for<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.270> disk

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
