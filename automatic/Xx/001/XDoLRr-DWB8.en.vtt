been a really great experience the
exciting<00:02:05.210> aspect<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.929> powerful

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
exciting aspect I think of this powerful

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.790 
exciting aspect I think of this powerful
piece<00:02:08.270> in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> 21st<00:02:09.840> century<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.649> it's

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
piece in the 21st century is that it's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
piece in the 21st century is that it's
performed<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.310> men<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.610> women<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.360> was

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
performed with men and women it was

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.320 
performed with men and women it was
originally<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.200> 1935<00:02:13.980> performed<00:02:14.640> by<00:02:15.060> all

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.300 
originally in 1935 performed by all
women<00:02:15.950> no<00:02:16.950> men<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.490> think<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.660> real

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
women no men I think there's a real

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.510 
women no men I think there's a real
honest<00:02:20.310> feminist<00:02:21.090> movement<00:02:22.280> behind<00:02:23.280> this

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
honest feminist movement behind this

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.460

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.070 
we don't know what Marthe intended but
it<00:02:27.840> has<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.620> think<00:02:28.710> now<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.870> they're

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
it has that I think now that they're

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.960 
it has that I think now that they're
starting<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.470> reconstruct<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.520> allowing

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
starting to reconstruct it and allowing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.199 
starting to reconstruct it and allowing
men<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.300> do<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.450> as<00:02:33.660> well<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.590> makes<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.980> nice

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
men to do it as well it makes a nice

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.670 
men to do it as well it makes a nice
equality<00:02:36.209> where<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.720> think<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.319> know<00:02:37.440> it's

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
equality where I think you know it's

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.490 
equality where I think you know it's
socially<00:02:38.160> we've<00:02:38.310> arrived<00:02:38.730> hopefully<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:40.319> an

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
socially we've arrived hopefully to an

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.020 
socially we've arrived hopefully to an
equality<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.819> think<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.450> piece<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:43.140> be<00:02:44.030> given

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
equality I think this piece can be given

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.210 
equality I think this piece can be given
some<00:02:45.209> credit<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.780> being<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.709> kind<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.130> a
