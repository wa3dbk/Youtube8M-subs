student atmosphere sometimes can be
pretty<00:01:29.520> chaotic<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.840> all

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pretty chaotic because it's it's all

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.590 
pretty chaotic because it's it's all
open<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.250> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.970> nice<00:01:33.150> part<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
open but that's kind of the nice part of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.270 
open but that's kind of the nice part of
being<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.990> bursar<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> fact<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.009> like

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
being in bursar and the fact that like

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.399 
being in bursar and the fact that like
we're<00:01:35.759> next<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> ID<00:01:36.509> kids<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.290> we're

we're next to all the ID kids and we're

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
we're next to all the ID kids and we're
next<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.799> thesis<00:01:38.549> students<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.630> mean

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
next to thesis students it's like I mean

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
next to thesis students it's like I mean
you<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.229> hear<00:01:40.439> conversations<00:01:41.189> everywhere

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you can hear conversations everywhere

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.039 
you can hear conversations everywhere
but<00:01:41.790> that's<00:01:41.909> kind<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> where<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:42.899> all

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
but that's kind of where you get all

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
but that's kind of where you get all
your<00:01:43.079> inspiration<00:01:43.829> from<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
your inspiration from like all the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.999 
your inspiration from like all the
creative<00:01:45.450> energy<00:01:45.869> around<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.470> think<00:01:46.829> that's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
creative energy around I think that's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.530 
creative energy around I think that's
like<00:01:47.189> something<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.700> Virginia<00:01:48.119> Tech<00:01:48.180> really

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
like something like Virginia Tech really

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.460 
like something like Virginia Tech really
advocates<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:50.009> their<00:01:50.159> Studios<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
advocates with their Studios like the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.300 
advocates with their Studios like the
difference

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
difference

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.010 
difference
all<00:01:53.700> mixing<00:01:54.119> together<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.690> like<00:01:54.810> learning

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
all mixing together and like learning

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.930 
all mixing together and like learning
from<00:01:55.320> each<00:01:55.409> other<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.950> thesis<00:01:56.580> students

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
from each other like thesis students

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.330 
from each other like thesis students
teach<00:01:57.119> us<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.750> teach<00:01:57.900> them<00:01:58.140> well<00:01:59.010> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
teach us and we can teach them well I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.969 
teach us and we can teach them well I
really<00:01:59.760> like<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.330> color<00:02:00.540> red<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.680> mean

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
really like the color red and I mean

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.200 
really like the color red and I mean
originally<00:02:02.490> they<00:02:02.580> were<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:02.940> plain

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
originally they were just like plain

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.760 
originally they were just like plain
cinder<00:02:03.570> blocks<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.049> guess<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.530> gives<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
cinder blocks but I guess it gives a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
cinder blocks but I guess it gives a
little<00:02:04.890> bit<00:02:05.040> more<00:02:05.100> attitude

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
little bit more attitude

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270 
little bit more attitude
yeah<00:02:06.509> mostly<00:02:07.170> close<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.560> crunch<00:02:07.799> time<00:02:07.920> there's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
yeah mostly close to crunch time there's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.440 
yeah mostly close to crunch time there's
usually<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.789> don't<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:09.300> much

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
usually like you don't have that much

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.870 
usually like you don't have that much
time<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:10.050> sit<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:10.410> home<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.220> eat<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
time to like sit at home and just eat so

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.370 
time to like sit at home and just eat so
you<00:02:12.120> might<00:02:12.270> as<00:02:12.360> well<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:12.660> bring<00:02:12.989> your<00:02:13.020> food
