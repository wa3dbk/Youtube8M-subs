00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello my name is Stefan and I want to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.960
 show you my first video today 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.900
 small repairs in the household 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.269
 Today it is about the repair of a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.580
 damaged speaker membrane me 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.619
 have here my center speaker of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.990
 Company Canton B 455 I believe and there is 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.939
 as you can see here the membrane 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.849
 wonderfully dented by the tweeter 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.740
 How did I get that? Well, I have one 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.480
 little son who is almost eight years old 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.740
 and I think I was also one at that time 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.450
 a bit curious and have already 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.219
 on a membrane with the fingers around 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.219
 he played that too today 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.450
 stupidly tried the membrane 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.850
 not come out again 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.739
 I was not so happy he did 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.210
 pretty bad conscience and have 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.739
 I looked what can I do except 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.930
 equal to a completely new tweeter too 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.930
 buy and have a hifi magazine 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.539
 A tip where you supposedly with 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.360
 normal commercial adhesive tape 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.750
 possibly save this membrane again 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.850
 can 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.280
 we will see if that with the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.290
 Adhesive tape works as an alternative 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 I have a little bit of tape left 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.890
 that is perhaps the harder one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.330
 Solution let's see if that is necessary 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.430
 I'll get my luck first 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 I'll try with the tape 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.760
 The camera is a bit better 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.000
 align that you can see her what 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.490
 I do the calotte and pushes me 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.830
 the thumbs because in the magazine you stood 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.990
 Some tape would need a quiet 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.090
 hand and good luck 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.229
 So I'll be here right now 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.119
 align and then you can 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.680
 see if that works and if you 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.460
 maybe you have a damaged membrane 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.460
 save as well 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.630
 I hope you can the membrane is here 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:52.280
 see very well 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.869
 Here we have the delle 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.289
 I'll get some tape now 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.289
 to take 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.049
 I think the brand is it should be 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.299
 do not live then see if that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:17.760
 does we work a finger they said 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:20.340
 very carefully since come across the first 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.900
 problem is tape is not sticky 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.180
 enough i try it when i enter 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.620
 bit sharper in there 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.620
 bring in the bulge 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.030
 You see, I run it dangerous that me 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.150
 who still wants a dell and that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.980
 I'm not good, of course 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.650
 Let's try some of that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.540
 know that as a panzer band I am 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.870
 musicians and therefore know that as a danger 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.459
 tape or just better it is 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.340
 a pretty nasty stuff if that 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.650
 sticks on it, then it holds 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.650
 just be torn off 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.470
 because I already had problems there 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.560
 to get in if I have that now 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.700
 try a bit sharp 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.150
 to tie together that I have such a front 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.730
 small tip with which I can work 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.190
 so marci her offspring that that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.850
 Result brings what I want 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.260
 would 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:23.989
 Who does not need a new calotte 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:32.060
 sticks much better 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:32.060
 Let's see she comes out slowly 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:38.280
 wonderfully blocked out like 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.419
 you see I do not currently see any 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.579
 Damage to it you are not 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.330
 dellen more 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.130
 I hope that the 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.030
 cool behind that also survived 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.510
 and yes, I have to say thumb 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.570
 high 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.670
 that's why if you do this 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.540
 video is good then I could do that 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.980
 maybe tell 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.270
 and I'll take a look what I'm into 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.910
 next time maybe this way 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.080
 small videos adjust where it is around 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.600
 everyday repairs go like this 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.160
 Everyday things where you might go for 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.740
 such a red and calotte lot of money 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.150
 would have to spend or for other things 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.280
 and with little tricks and 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.750
 can try the repair instructions 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.160
 somehow to get everything under control 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.830
 I wish you a nice day 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.690
 my name is stefan and maybe you have 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.850
 a lot of videos coming soon 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.120
 make life easier in everyday life 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.120
 Thank you
