00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:06.339
 now we will start the second parameter 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.570
 sound duration 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.869
 I understand that you will have 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.750
 questions that you can not be 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:19.550
 immediately and articulate but dial 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.700
 patience and since notes are recorded by 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.470
 duration start with almost the most 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.710
 here is such a big one 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.940
 the uncolored oval is called the whole 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.050
 let's say it will sound 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.770
 8 seconds I say let's say everything in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.030
 life is relatively whole can sound 5 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.220
 seconds 4 seconds is quite long 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.790
 note 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:58.930
 imagine a circle if we divide it 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.930
 exactly in half then we have two halves 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.600
 half the duration is called 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.700
 it's the same oval 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.030
 unpainted and right up 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.540
 vertical stick this stick 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.360
 Calm Calm 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.530
 can be recorded on the right side 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:29.840
 up and eat can be recorded 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:33.050
 left down it depends on which 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.420
 the line of the music staff is a note 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.729
 up to 30 lines calmly written up 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.590
 starting with a third or nicknames calm and spelled 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:48.950
 down it is purely visual only 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 so that these steeples do not stick with sticks 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.259
 lamppost would be in all directions time 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.619
 sound half four seconds 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:08.709
 continue the division further in the same way 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:15.220
 divide in half the following duration 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:18.200
 quarter painted oval and calm calm 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.470
 and also like half 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:28.540
 can be written up with the right 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.540
 sides and down the left side 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:48.100
 playing time 2 seconds in one whole 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:50.340
 four quarters in one half two 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:03:03.030
 quarters 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:09.880
 divide further 8 oval shaded calm and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:12.420
 ponytail sounding time one second more 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:19.950
 once oval 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:21.130
 calm and tail if calm is written down 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:29.709
 that 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:33.130
 the tail is written like this if necessary 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.370
 write a few eighths in a row then 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:44.480
 so that the tails do not interfere they 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:49.640
 are tied up on top and that's it 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:57.909
 wand called rib let's 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:04:13.750
 we fix a little bit in one quarter two 8 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:13.750
 in one half 4 8 in 1 whole 8 8 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.610
 you can imagine such 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:29.120
 funny creatures are small 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:33.260
 a quarter she has two eighth legs this here 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:40.490
 the fattest half she runs on 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:41.539
 four legs and this here is a whole 8 legs 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:48.160
 literally 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:48.160
 8 feet on 8 feet 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.690
 just like recording node height 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.360
 all at once rhythms and duration 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.960
 will not restrict ourselves to 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.940
 beginnings 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:11.790
 by quarters and 8 of 8 which will be two 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.820
 Eighth, I 'll play you together now 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:21.160
 recorded notes in terms of 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:26.470
 quarter lengths they are longer than 2 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:37.320
 8 shorter so this first one 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:37.320
 example one more time 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.090
 but 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.090
 second example and 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:22.890
 The third example with you was the author and 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.890
 leading Olga overgrown ago
