00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.410
 to 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.950
 Y 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.950
 and you 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.099
 hello am amparo cabanillas combien o 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.949
 tutor of the technical course of the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.829
 Written communication of the senati program 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.170
 virtual today I have prepared for you a 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.780
 class in which I'll explain the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.879
 way how to improve your writing for 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.550
 do not have problems when it comes to 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.530
 write your writings 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.350
 many times when we write 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.930
 we repeat unnecessarily some 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.220
 words and this makes the text be 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.440
 confused to this mistake we call 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.070
 redundancy to avoid this redundancy 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.320
 What should we do? 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.600
 these words that we are repeating 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.880
 for others that have the same 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.280
 meaning but do not alter the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 Sense of prayer to this mechanism 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.640
 of cohesion we call reference let's see 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.429
 let's read the following text the Aztecs 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.890
 they owned a vast empire 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.259
 the Aztecs formed an important 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.380
 urban society and they settled in the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.229
 mexico valley in the mexico valley is 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.869
 they organized politically as a state 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.840
 Theocratic and the government of the Aztecs 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.289
 was in the hands of kings priests with 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.289
 absolute power 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.660
 we observe that the text is redundant 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.170
 because there are words that are repeated 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:55.360
 Aztec Aztecs 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.340
 valley of mexico valley of mexico government 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.880
 of the Aztecs that had already been 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.159
 mentioned earlier in this new 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.030
 text we observe that they have been removed 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.250
 the redundancies and we can read the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.850
 Aztecs owned a vast 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.520
 empire they made an important 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.930
 urban society and they settled in the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.330
 mexico valley there they organized 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.640
 politically as a theocratic state 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.850
 and his government was in the hands of kings 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.240
 priests with absolute power 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:35.020
 we see that the word aztecs has been 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.810
 replaced by the pronoun them that 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.190
 the valley of mexico has been replaced 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.890
 for the adverb of the place there and that its 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.500
 is a possessive adjective that indicates 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.010
 belonging to your government from whom of 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.010
 the Aztecs 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.470
 in short the pronoun they replace 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.280
 to the Aztecs 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.370
 the adverb there replaces the valley of 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.909
 Mexico 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.239
 the adjective su is in place of the 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.239
 Aztecs 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.120
 what is the reference then is the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.090
 function that some words fulfill 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.620
 to replace others in a text and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.230
 avoid redundancy 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.930
 which words fulfill this function of 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.319
 reference 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.629
 the reference elements that meet 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.510
 this function would be the 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:39.250
 pronouns pronouns pronouns 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.469
 personal relative numerals and so on 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.319
 we also have adverbs the 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:49.310
 adverbs of place and time 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:52.459
 also the possessive adjectives these 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.709
 three grammatical categories widely 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.709
 developed you can find it in the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.799
 page 26 of the technical module of the 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.780
 written communication another element of 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.090
 reference would come to be the synonyms 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.760
 which are the words that have 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.530
 meaning equal or similar and that 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.740
 avoid redundancy in a text 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.410
 the omission is also another mechanism of 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.440
 reference in which we are no longer going to 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.470
 substituting one word for another but 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.200
 we are going to do without that word because 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.720
 it is understood the meaning of 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.470
 prayer let's see some examples 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.780
 demonstrative the pronoun as a 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.480
 reference element let's see the 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.669
 next example juan carlos managed 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.419
 good grades in the cycle 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:46.410
 previous he got 18 in the presentation 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.110
 of evidences in tc that we observe that 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.810
 Juan Carlos has been replaced by the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.700
 pronoun he 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.000
 the demonstrative pronoun 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.400
 in the next example we have the judge 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.850
 advanced opinion on guilt 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.060
 of the processed the processed 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.300
 they smiled pleased we are seeing that 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.700
 here the defendants are repeated 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.960
 processed and that's a mistake of 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.670
 redundancy to avoid this we should 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.640
 use a demonstrative pronoun and 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.430
 would be as follows the judge 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.030
 advanced opinion on guilt 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.160
 of the defendants they smiled 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.760
 pleased 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.460
 with the use of the adverb the murderer 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.280
 took the police officers to a 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.450
 place open in that place open 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.470
 he had buried his victim repeats 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.810
 place open place open field 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.650
 using the proper adverb we would say 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.930
 as follows 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.500
 the murderer took the troops 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:02.830
 police to an open place there 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:06.880
 he had buried his victim 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.830
 the adjective possessive felipe waited 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.310
 impatiently at the door of the 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.940
 hospital the mother of felipe was delayed 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.880
 in leaving there is a repetition of the name 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.880
 felipe felipe 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.240
 in the following text we observe the use 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.130
 of the adjective possessivo felipe waited 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.310
 impatiently at the door of the 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:34.430
 hospital his mother was slow to leave 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.430
 its the mother of who of felippe 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.479
 the most used reference is the 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:44.510
 synonymous one example of it we have the 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:47.810
 writer mario vargas llosa received the 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:50.990
 Nobel prize for literature in 2010 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:54.580
 writer is still publishing works of 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:58.060
 general interest writer and writer 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.210
 let's see the following text 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.210
 the writer mario vargas llosa received 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.690
 the Nobel prize for literature in 2010 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:11.169
 the novelist is still publishing works 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:13.330
 of general interest we have replaced the 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:16.300
 word writer by the word 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.030
 novelist who mean the same thing and 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.039
 improves the wording 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:25.150
 finally the reference mechanism 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:28.909
 that does not use substitution is the omission 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:31.370
 what is it that we instead of 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:34.400
 replace the words that are repeated 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.759
 we can omit it and it does not change the sense 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.710
 of the message so we have 

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:43.159
 we take virtual courses 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:47.000
 they take virtual courses there is a 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:49.580
 unnecessary repetition would be better than the 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.819
 next way we carry 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.770
 virtual courses they also the 

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:58.440
 message is understood 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:01.139
 I hope I have contributed with this class 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.389
 in improving your writing now you 

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:05.129
 it's time to apply what you 've learned in the 

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:07.759
 writing your evidences 

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:07.759
 you can
