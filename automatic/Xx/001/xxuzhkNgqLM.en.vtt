00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
up there sometimes that does happen

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.690 
up there sometimes that does happen
where<00:01:59.850> nobody<00:02:00.180> comes<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
where nobody comes in and the the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580 
where nobody comes in and the the
quarterback<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.960> take<00:02:04.170> off<00:02:04.350> with

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
quarterback you know can take off with

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.150 
quarterback you know can take off with
it<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:05.250> very<00:02:05.520> rarely<00:02:05.909> does<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.960> happen<00:02:07.160> as

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it but very rarely does that happen as

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.330 
it but very rarely does that happen as
you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.149> right<00:02:09.179> there<00:02:09.950> he's<00:02:10.950> under

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you can see right there he's under

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.559 
you can see right there he's under
duress

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
duress

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.489 
duress
almost<00:02:13.730> immediately<00:02:15.049> I've<00:02:16.049> been<00:02:16.290> running

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:16.499 
almost immediately I've been running

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.589 
almost immediately I've been running
this<00:02:16.650> play<00:02:16.859> religiously<00:02:17.609> like<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:17.999> said<00:02:18.299> and

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
this play religiously like I said and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.449 
this play religiously like I said and
you<00:02:19.560> know<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.889> doesn't<00:02:20.129> give<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
you know it doesn't give the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.879 
you know it doesn't give the
quarterbacks<00:02:20.879> very<00:02:21.299> much<00:02:21.569> throw<00:02:22.049> or<00:02:22.290> very

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
quarterbacks very much throw or very

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.470 
quarterbacks very much throw or very
much<00:02:22.980> throat<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:23.609> as<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.150> see<00:02:24.299> their

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
much throat I'm as you can see their

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.979 
much throat I'm as you can see their
number<00:02:25.230> 71<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.829> 77<00:02:26.459> does<00:02:26.700> end<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.480> picking<00:02:27.749> up

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
number 71 and 77 does end up picking up

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.580 
number 71 and 77 does end up picking up
the<00:02:28.489> outside<00:02:29.489> lineman<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.269> myself<00:02:30.780> which

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the outside lineman and myself which

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.220 
the outside lineman and myself which
frees<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.099> number<00:02:32.670> 94<00:02:33.299> which<00:02:33.510> only<00:02:33.840> gives<00:02:34.019> him

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
frees up number 94 which only gives him

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.410 
frees up number 94 which only gives him
a<00:02:34.319> little<00:02:34.439> bit<00:02:34.680> time<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.040> throw<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.609> that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
a little bit time to throw it and that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.649 
a little bit time to throw it and that
play<00:02:36.659> is<00:02:37.189> basically<00:02:38.189> almost<00:02:38.849> picked<00:02:39.419> off<00:02:39.599> on

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
play is basically almost picked off on

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.539 
play is basically almost picked off on
that<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.500> play<00:02:41.340> looks<00:02:41.579> like<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:43.370> what's<00:02:44.370> good

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
that so play looks like that what's good

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.390 
that so play looks like that what's good
about<00:02:44.639> it<00:02:44.760> there<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.180> again<00:02:45.950> he's<00:02:46.950> got<00:02:47.159> almost

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
about it there is again he's got almost

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.740 
about it there is again he's got almost
nowhere<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.000> go<00:02:48.120> i'm<00:02:48.269> gonna<00:02:48.329> show<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.540> that

nowhere to go i'm gonna show you that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.920 
nowhere to go i'm gonna show you that
one<00:02:49.530> more<00:02:49.590> time<00:02:49.859> again<00:02:50.430> its<00:02:50.579> baseline<00:02:50.969> crash

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
one more time again its baseline crash

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.959 
one more time again its baseline crash
middle<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:52.739> reblog<00:02:53.639> I<00:02:53.760> there<00:02:55.969> that's

coming down and move him out you know a
little<00:02:59.430> bit<00:02:59.669> farther<00:03:00.150> down<00:03:00.769> doesn't<00:03:01.769> matter

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
little bit farther down doesn't matter

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.339 
little bit farther down doesn't matter
how<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.099> set<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.519> up<00:03:02.639> as<00:03:02.790> long<00:03:02.969> as<00:03:03.109> you<00:03:04.109> get<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:33.509 
at the same time though if you're not on

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.089 
at the same time though if you're not on
the<00:03:33.599> edge<00:03:33.720> shoulder<00:03:34.169> like<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:34.379> you<00:03:34.680> will<00:03:34.889> run

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
the edge shoulder like that you will run

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.550 
the edge shoulder like that you will run
into<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.489> wide<00:03:35.669> receiver<00:03:36.090> which<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.139> bad<00:03:37.349> but

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
into the wide receiver which is bad but

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.629 
into the wide receiver which is bad but
it<00:03:37.680> does<00:03:37.859> end<00:03:38.069> up<00:03:39.500> making<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.919> where<00:03:41.129> you

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
it does end up making it so where you

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.159 
it does end up making it so where you
know<00:03:41.729> they<00:03:41.879> have<00:03:42.060> no<00:03:42.359> time<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.599> throw<00:03:42.900> there

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
know they have no time to throw there

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.860 
know they have no time to throw there
again<00:03:43.409> could<00:03:44.189> have<00:03:44.280> been<00:03:44.400> picked<00:03:44.669> off<00:03:44.849> so<00:03:45.689> then

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
again could have been picked off so then

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.300 
again could have been picked off so then
I'm<00:03:45.989> just<00:03:46.109> going<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.349> show<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.650> one<00:03:47.009> last

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
I'm just going to show you that one last

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.390 
I'm just going to show you that one last
time<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.879> then<00:03:48.319> that<00:03:49.319> ends<00:03:49.590> up<00:03:49.680> making<00:03:49.889> it<00:03:50.189> so

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
time and then that ends up making it so

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.629 
time and then that ends up making it so
where<00:03:50.579> he<00:03:50.849> gets<00:03:51.090> sacked<00:03:52.159> again<00:03:53.159> it's<00:03:53.489> been

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
where he gets sacked again it's been

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.979 
where he gets sacked again it's been
really<00:03:53.819> effective<00:03:54.000> for<00:03:54.599> me<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.930> said<00:03:56.989> it's

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
really effective for me like I said it's

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.259 
really effective for me like I said it's
a<00:03:58.019> really<00:03:58.229> good<00:03:58.469> play<00:03:58.680> but<00:03:59.250> I'm<00:03:59.519> going<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.120> tell
