predicament<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> moment<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.039> not

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
predicament at the moment and it's not

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.970 
predicament at the moment and it's not
necessarily<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.760> bad<00:00:23.970> predicament<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.980> it's

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
necessarily a bad predicament but it's

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.589 
necessarily a bad predicament but it's
going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> while<00:00:26.730> before<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.510> next

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
going to be a while before the next

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.269 
going to be a while before the next
year's<00:00:27.960> game<00:00:28.140> comes<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.010> could

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
year's game comes out so it could

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.890 
year's game comes out so it could
potentially<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:30.000> two<00:00:30.210> years<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:30.750> what

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
potentially be two years and that's what

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.950 
potentially be two years and that's what
I<00:00:30.929> think<00:00:31.170> will<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.710> will<00:00:31.769> probably<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.160> like

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
I think will be it will probably be like

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.780 
I think will be it will probably be like

Gears of War YouTube content creator and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.109 
Gears of War YouTube content creator and
what<00:01:22.500> I'd<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> guys<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:23.970> not

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
what I'd like you guys to do and I'm not

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.520 
what I'd like you guys to do and I'm not
telling<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:24.750> forcing<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.409> this

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
telling you or forcing you to do this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
but what I recommend doing is expanding

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
but what I recommend doing is expanding
out<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.560> other<00:01:28.740> games<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.400> some<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.939> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
out to do other games now some of you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
out to do other games now some of you
may<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.110> me<00:01:31.290> posting

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
may be going but that's not me posting

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.020 
may be going but that's not me posting
gears<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.159> war<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.460> that's<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.820> me

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
gears of war and that's not me

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.810 
gears of war and that's not me
supporting<00:01:33.570> gears<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.020> war<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.920> essentially

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
supporting gears of war but essentially

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.670 
supporting gears of war but essentially
it<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.030> what<00:01:36.659> you're<00:01:36.780> doing<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.409> long<00:01:37.530> as

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it is what you're doing is as long as

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.990 
it is what you're doing is as long as
you<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:37.950> abandon<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.520> game<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:38.970> i

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you don't abandon the game is what i

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.160 
you don't abandon the game is what i
mean<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.390> essentially<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:39.930> you'll<00:01:40.079> be

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
mean but essentially what you'll be

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.560 
mean but essentially what you'll be
doing<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.710> say<00:01:41.159> destiny<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.090> coming<00:01:42.450> out

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
doing is just say destiny is coming out

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899 
doing is just say destiny is coming out
tomorrow<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.439> today<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:44.520> those<00:01:44.640> videos

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
tomorrow or today as when those videos

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.440 
tomorrow or today as when those videos
coming<00:01:45.299> up<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> you'll<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.000> posting
