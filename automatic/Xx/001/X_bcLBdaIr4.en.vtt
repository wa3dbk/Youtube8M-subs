anteriors and all bicuspids and i'm

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.620 
anteriors and all bicuspids and i'm
going<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.369> show<00:01:49.580> you<00:01:49.640> how<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:49.820> modify<00:01:50.420> that

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
going to show you how to modify that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.510 
going to show you how to modify that
clamp<00:01:50.960> right<00:01:51.229> now<00:01:51.440> so<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.070> can<00:01:52.220> put<00:01:52.430> it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
clamp right now so that you can put it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.120 
clamp right now so that you can put it
on<00:01:52.610> molars<00:01:53.270> as<00:01:53.450> well<00:01:53.660> so<00:01:54.259> technically<00:01:54.830> you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
on molars as well so technically you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.160 
on molars as well so technically you
might<00:01:55.310> only<00:01:55.490> need<00:01:55.610> one<00:01:55.940> clamp<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.840> let's<00:01:57.020> take

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
might only need one clamp so let's take

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.219 
might only need one clamp so let's take
a<00:01:57.200> closer<00:01:57.500> look<00:01:57.649> at<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.100> number<00:01:58.490> 90<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.020> T

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
a closer look at the number 90 the T

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.710 
a closer look at the number 90 the T
stands<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:00.740> tiger<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
stands for tiger and this is the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.540 
stands for tiger and this is the
modification<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.649> have<00:02:03.860> started<00:02:04.369> using

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
modification that I have started using

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.760 
modification that I have started using
just<00:02:04.970> recently<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.599> particular<00:02:05.990> picture<00:02:06.470> is

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
just recently this particular picture is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.680 
just recently this particular picture is
not<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.459> tiger<00:02:07.789> clamp<00:02:08.119> because<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.509> don't

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
not the tiger clamp because you don't

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.050 
not the tiger clamp because you don't
see<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.020> serrated<00:02:09.410> jaws<00:02:09.800> but<00:02:10.640> when<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:10.880> buy

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
see the serrated jaws but when you buy

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.330 
see the serrated jaws but when you buy
either<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.750> tiger<00:02:12.230> number<00:02:12.470> nine<00:02:12.650> or<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> regular

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
either a tiger number nine or a regular

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.520 
either a tiger number nine or a regular
number<00:02:13.520> nine<00:02:13.760> clamp<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.660> jaws<00:02:14.930> don't<00:02:15.260> line<00:02:15.500> up

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
number nine clamp the jaws don't line up

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.949 
number nine clamp the jaws don't line up
you'll<00:02:16.430> have<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.730> take<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:16.910> couple<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.480> pair<00:02:17.720> of

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
you'll have to take a couple of pair of

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.320 
you'll have to take a couple of pair of
pliers<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.620> bend<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.160> jaws<00:02:19.430> until<00:02:20.180> they

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
pliers and bend the jaws until they

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.540 
pliers and bend the jaws until they
align<00:02:20.660> up<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.020> approximate<00:02:21.590> each<00:02:21.709> other<00:02:21.950> when

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
align up and approximate each other when

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.670 
align up and approximate each other when
you<00:02:22.580> do<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:23.120> not<00:02:23.690> only<00:02:24.020> will<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.230> work<00:02:24.410> better

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
you do that not only will it work better

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.559 
you do that not only will it work better
for<00:02:24.890> interiors<00:02:25.520> but<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.880> can<00:02:26.030> also<00:02:26.180> place

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
for interiors but you can also place

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.120 
for interiors but you can also place
that<00:02:26.810> clamp<00:02:27.080> on<00:02:27.290> any<00:02:27.560> tooth<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.099> mouth

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
that clamp on any tooth in the mouth

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.030 
that clamp on any tooth in the mouth
because<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:29.180> not<00:02:29.360> offset<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.709> clamp

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
because it's not offset if the clamp

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.010 
because it's not offset if the clamp
jaws<00:02:31.370> are<00:02:31.580> offset<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.239> will<00:02:32.360> slip<00:02:32.630> over<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.900> the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
jaws are offset it will slip over to the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.600 
jaws are offset it will slip over to the
side<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.709> you'll<00:02:33.980> have<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> very<00:02:34.340> difficult

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
side and you'll have a very difficult

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.970 
side and you'll have a very difficult
time<00:02:34.940> getting<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.450> off<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:36.500> other<00:02:36.650> thing<00:02:36.860> I

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
time getting it off the other thing I

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.220 
time getting it off the other thing I
learned<00:02:37.250> quite<00:02:38.000> by<00:02:38.180> accident<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:38.930> it's<00:02:39.080> very

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
learned quite by accident but it's very

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.050 
learned quite by accident but it's very
important<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.700> will<00:02:40.849> have<00:02:40.880> to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
important is that you will have to

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.570 
important is that you will have to
modify<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.959> number<00:02:42.319> nine<00:02:42.530> clamp<00:02:43.010> by

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
modify that number nine clamp by

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.210 
modify that number nine clamp by
enlarging<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.510> hole<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.590> lingual<00:02:46.010> side

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
enlarging the hole on the lingual side

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.240 
enlarging the hole on the lingual side
the<00:02:47.150> lingual<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.840> jaw<00:02:48.170> right<00:02:48.800> over<00:02:49.069> here

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
the lingual is this jaw right over here

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.640 
the lingual is this jaw right over here
the<00:02:49.400> large<00:02:49.670> wings<00:02:50.030> go<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.480> lingual<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.080> if

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the large wings go to the lingual and if

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.260 
the large wings go to the lingual and if
you<00:02:51.770> don't<00:02:52.069> enlarge<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.700> hole<00:02:52.910> what<00:02:53.150> will

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
you don't enlarge that hole what will

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.750 
you don't enlarge that hole what will
happen<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:53.840> you'll<00:02:54.380> find<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.890> cannot<00:02:55.340> get

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
happen is you'll find you cannot get

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.820 
happen is you'll find you cannot get
this<00:02:56.150> clamp<00:02:56.540> back<00:02:56.810> off<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.319> molar<00:02:57.560> or<00:02:57.800> a

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
this clamp back off of a molar or a

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.190 
this clamp back off of a molar or a
bicuspid<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.150> be<00:02:59.330> sure<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.569> make<00:02:59.870> that<00:02:59.989> little

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
bicuspid so be sure and make that little

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.860 
bicuspid so be sure and make that little
hole<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.470> little<00:03:00.680> bit<00:03:00.890> larger<00:03:01.660> modify<00:03:02.660> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
hole a little bit larger modify that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.330 
hole a little bit larger modify that
hole<00:03:03.080> make<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.410> larger<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:03.920> you'll<00:03:04.010> have<00:03:04.160> no

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
hole make it larger and you'll have no

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.059 
hole make it larger and you'll have no
trouble<00:03:04.400> going<00:03:04.940> from<00:03:05.090> clamp<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.569> clamp<00:03:06.069> the

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
trouble going from clamp to clamp the

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.730 
trouble going from clamp to clamp the
number<00:03:07.340> nine<00:03:07.520> retainer<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.480> placed<00:03:09.200> on<00:03:09.470> the

tooth with a number nine retainer holder

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.660 
tooth with a number nine retainer holder
by<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.710> way<00:03:12.890> you'll<00:03:13.070> notice<00:03:13.130> I'm

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
by the way you'll notice I'm

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.540 
by the way you'll notice I'm
calling<00:03:14.150> these<00:03:14.270> rubber<00:03:14.930> dam<00:03:15.260> clamps<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.010> dam

calling these rubber dam clamps and dam

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.820 
calling these rubber dam clamps and dam
clamp<00:03:16.880> holders<00:03:17.390> that's<00:03:17.930> not<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> wick<00:03:18.470> good<00:03:18.680> way

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
clamp holders that's not a wick good way

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.740 
clamp holders that's not a wick good way
to<00:03:18.890> discuss<00:03:19.580> these<00:03:19.790> things<00:03:19.849> we<00:03:20.209> talk<00:03:20.420> about<00:03:20.599> a

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
to discuss these things we talk about a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.420 
to discuss these things we talk about a
retainer<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.349> hold<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> rubber<00:03:21.800> dam<00:03:21.980> in<00:03:22.190> place

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
retainer to hold the rubber dam in place

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.640 
retainer to hold the rubber dam in place
and<00:03:22.700> we<00:03:23.180> talked<00:03:23.360> about<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.810> retainer<00:03:24.170> holder

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
and we talked about the retainer holder

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.830 
and we talked about the retainer holder
now<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.220> retainer<00:03:25.610> holder<00:03:26.120> if<00:03:26.569> you're<00:03:26.750> going

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
now the retainer holder if you're going

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.620 
now the retainer holder if you're going
to<00:03:26.930> use<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.319> on<00:03:27.580> posterior<00:03:28.580> teeth<00:03:28.819> you<00:03:29.480> will

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
to use this on posterior teeth you will

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.750 
to use this on posterior teeth you will
have<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.930> squeeze<00:03:30.380> those<00:03:30.800> jaws<00:03:31.220> till<00:03:31.640> they

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
have to squeeze those jaws till they

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.240 
have to squeeze those jaws till they
actually<00:03:32.270> overlap<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:33.110> order<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.830> get<00:03:34.010> that

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
actually overlap in order to get that

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.430 
actually overlap in order to get that
wide<00:03:34.970> enough<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.360> where<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.780> will<00:03:35.900> slip<00:03:36.140> over<00:03:36.290> a

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
wide enough to where it will slip over a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.850 
wide enough to where it will slip over a
molar<00:03:36.739> tooth<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.989> once<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.380> modify<00:03:39.830> that

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
molar tooth so once you modify that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.360 
molar tooth so once you modify that
number<00:03:40.430> 9<00:03:40.640> or<00:03:40.940> number<00:03:41.360> 90<00:03:41.870> clamp<00:03:42.319> by<00:03:42.830> enlarging

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
number 9 or number 90 clamp by enlarging

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.550 
number 9 or number 90 clamp by enlarging
the<00:03:43.580> hole<00:03:43.790> on<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.300> lingual<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:45.260> make<00:03:45.410> it

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
the hole on the lingual to make it
