00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.760
 The official site of the project was transferred by e. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.760
 conquer chrome os 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.910
 hello to everyone on the release of the pot 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.960
 send much more than 5 today we turn 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.220
 to such an unusual disassemble protection on 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.160
 throughout the debriefing map benyuk we will 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.500
 consider how to view 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.980
 only one fighter 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.820
 such own marketing ideas 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.579
 attack to work and analyze a few 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.430
 principles of viewing this position 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.970
 honestly say mccarthy benyuk 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.800
 a bit pragmatic tactical build 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.820
 action defenders and graphics just great 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.720
 complexity is built on quick understanding 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.520
 the region is an important topic which teams 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.360
 captain 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.390
 in isolation position can understand 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 how many of these 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.720
 action by your football players 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.380
 information of the cap itself 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.980
 so the captain on this map is like 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 never important reading articles 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.900
 protection we will analyze in the following 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.650
 releases what to hand over to come 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.050
 parse points fm 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.070
 there appears in principle the most important 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.510
 on Kola selling ramp defense players 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.330
 forced to rebuild 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.180
 scoops to secure yourself 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.300
 marked wounds 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.820
 so let's see how you can 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.020
 occupy this point yes there were failures 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.220
 if you don't know how wright facts are weak 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.940
 imagine what r the players 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.970
 attacks then you should do just that you 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.900
 draw your back then browse and 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.640
 jump out on the radio or borrow and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.680
 positionally boxes sings can 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.260
 stay nahlupin usually so 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.910
 going on options hear and by your 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.430
 information can throw a grenade 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.140
 which is before attempting to attack 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.140
 ramp exit 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.720
 but one more so to speak 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.330
 viewing shelf landing on 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.040
 the design is nothing complicated in 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.880
 years maklisat what then laid on 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.180
 royal action trader who 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.430
 it is considered local as all when such 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.430
 table in this point viewer 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.719
 Now the moment of viewing when the three 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.729
 preload Rada and planted on the fan 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.359
 single player this is actually very 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.449
 A good option if the attack is sometimes missing 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:47.509
 out of mind the radio then you will never be 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.469
 convenient to make such a spout 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.449
 The advantage is very big. 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:52.699
 going on neutral and plus 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.339
 fit the words of the poet without comments 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:57.339
 cartoons foreheads provided 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.699
 And finally, let's look at 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.149
 multiple positions for taking exit if 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:34.799
 you no longer have time brought up with 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.799
 yourself at this very well training 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.259
