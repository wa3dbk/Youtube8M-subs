00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
of my mob spawner show off as you can

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.099 
of my mob spawner show off as you can
see<00:00:05.640> I've<00:00:05.759> made<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.150> look<00:00:06.299> prettier<00:00:06.660> really

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
see I've made it look prettier really

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.140 
see I've made it look prettier really
that's<00:00:07.319> about<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.589> but<00:00:08.069> yeah<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.550> also<00:00:08.700> added<00:00:08.940> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
that's about it but yeah I also added a

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.030 
that's about it but yeah I also added a
minecart<00:00:09.510> system<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:10.139> get<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.469> Exide<00:00:10.830> enough

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
minecart system to get the Exide enough

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.120 
minecart system to get the Exide enough
of<00:00:11.219> swimming<00:00:11.490> it's<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.840> door<00:00:13.410> cut<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.920> would

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
of swimming it's just a door cut I would

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.799 
of swimming it's just a door cut I would
teach<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.429> guys<00:00:14.549> how<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.790> make<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.599> most

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
teach you guys how to make that but most

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.740 
teach you guys how to make that but most
people<00:00:16.260> know<00:00:16.560> or<00:00:17.090> don't<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.390> need<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
people know or don't really need it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.210 
people know or don't really need it
anymore<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.260> notch<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.800> apparently

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
anymore because notch is apparently

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.060 
anymore because notch is apparently
adding<00:00:20.580> automatic<00:00:21.270> cuts<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:22.500> automatic

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
adding automatic cuts like automatic

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250 
adding automatic cuts like automatic
boosters<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.000> yeah<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.630> don't<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:24.930> need<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
boosters so yeah we don't really need to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.720 
boosters so yeah we don't really need to
worry<00:00:25.289> about<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.859> now<00:00:26.039> need<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> turn<00:00:26.699> down

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
worry about that now need to turn down

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.790 
worry about that now need to turn down
my<00:00:27.029> render<00:00:27.390> distance<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:27.990> i'm<00:00:28.140> lagging

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.490 

so<00:00:31.800> since<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> last<00:00:32.579> episode<00:00:33.420> or<00:00:34.050> little

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
so since the last episode or little

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.130 
so since the last episode or little
show-off<00:00:34.920> update<00:00:35.520> thingy<00:00:35.850> I've<00:00:36.149> basically

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
show-off update thingy I've basically

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440 
show-off update thingy I've basically
made<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> water<00:00:38.040> streams<00:00:38.489> better<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.120> added

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
made the water streams better and added

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.630 
made the water streams better and added
this<00:00:39.570> fire<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:40.440> reason<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:41.460> looks

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
this fire for some reason just looks

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.930 
this fire for some reason just looks
pretty<00:00:41.850> also<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.020> gets<00:00:43.410> me<00:00:43.590> dogs<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.520> wolves

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
pretty also it gets me dogs or wolves

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.170 
pretty also it gets me dogs or wolves
whatever<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.730> side<00:00:47.940> bits

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
whatever so as you can see the side bits

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
whatever so as you can see the side bits
where<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> water<00:00:48.750> drops<00:00:49.110> down<00:00:49.350> are<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:50.340> lot

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
where the water drops down are a lot

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
where the water drops down are a lot
smaller<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.600> they're<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.680> effective<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
smaller and they're more effective so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.430 
smaller and they're more effective so
yeah<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.719> why<00:00:54.870> I've<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.289> been

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
yeah this is why I've really been

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.200 
yeah this is why I've really been
putting<00:00:55.860> off<00:00:55.949> making<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.610> mob<00:00:56.789> spawner

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
putting off making the mob spawner

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.029 
putting off making the mob spawner
tutorial<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.870> guys<00:00:57.960> because<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.620> figure

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
tutorial for you guys because I figure

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.590 
tutorial for you guys because I figure
if<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.250> perfect<00:00:59.670> mine<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.390> teach<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
if I perfect mine then I can teach you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.330 
if I perfect mine then I can teach you
guys<00:01:00.870> how<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> most<00:01:01.649> perfect<00:01:02.160> one

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
guys how to make the most perfect one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.450 
guys how to make the most perfect one
for<00:01:02.370> yourself<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.409> also<00:01:04.409> made<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.799> animal

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
for yourself I also made the animal

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.580 
for yourself I also made the animal
killer<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:06.000> cactus<00:01:06.540> instead<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
killer one cactus instead of two and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.649 
killer one cactus instead of two and
it's<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.979> lot<00:01:08.130> more<00:01:08.159> effective<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.450> also

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's a lot more effective it also

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.859 
it's a lot more effective it also
doesn't<00:01:09.960> let<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> animals<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.189> much<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
doesn't let the animals down as much and

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.750 
doesn't let the animals down as much and
yeah<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.200> we'll<00:01:13.560> turn<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.490> how<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
yeah so we'll turn it on and see how it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.170 
yeah so we'll turn it on and see how it
goes<00:01:15.680> because<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.979> still<00:01:17.520> around<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.970> same

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
goes because it's still around the same

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
goes because it's still around the same
speed<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.810> actually<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.100> faster

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
speed I actually think it's a bit faster

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.310 
speed I actually think it's a bit faster
because<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.790> filled<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.600> caves<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
because I filled up some more caves and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.770 
because I filled up some more caves and
stuff<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> background<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.659> also<00:01:24.979> made<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
stuff in the background I also made a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.050 
stuff in the background I also made a
ladder<00:01:27.780> system<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.070> hot<00:01:29.400> system<00:01:29.909> just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
ladder system up here on hot system just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
ladder system up here on hot system just
ladders<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.280> that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
ladders to get up there because that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
ladders to get up there because that
zigzag<00:01:32.820> staircase<00:01:33.360> looked<00:01:33.659> ugly<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.200> was

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
zigzag staircase looked ugly and it was

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.280 
zigzag staircase looked ugly and it was
only<00:01:34.500> temporary<00:01:35.329> rule<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.170> how

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
only temporary rule or I don't know how

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.770 
only temporary rule or I don't know how
to<00:01:37.350> say<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.799> word<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.400> we'll<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.540> past

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to say that word so we'll just get past

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.660 
to say that word so we'll just get past
that<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.890> also<00:01:41.750> added<00:01:42.750> lights<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.680> top<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that I also added lights on top of the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.569 
that I also added lights on top of the
like<00:01:45.540> freaking<00:01:46.079> switches<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
like freaking switches I was going to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.039 
like freaking switches I was going to
put<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> mic<00:01:48.000> somewhere<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> front

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
put the mic somewhere up here in front

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.230 
put the mic somewhere up here in front
of<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.979> there's<00:01:50.640> no<00:01:50.759> need<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.030> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
of you but like there's no need for that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.960 
of you but like there's no need for that
really<00:01:51.770> when<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> figure<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.549> how<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> make

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
really when I figure out how to make

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.330 
really when I figure out how to make
well<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:54.840> options<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.130> might

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
well what more options I want I might

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.830 
well what more options I want I might
put<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.759> switches<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> corner<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
put like the switches in the corner and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.200 
put like the switches in the corner and
have<00:01:57.960> signs<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.680> stuff<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.430> turn<00:02:00.030> on

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
have signs and stuff so you can turn on

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.609 
have signs and stuff so you can turn on
like<00:02:00.360> six<00:02:00.630> switches<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.229> looks<00:02:01.409> pretty

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
like six switches so it looks pretty

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.580 
like six switches so it looks pretty
cool<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> they<00:02:03.329> need<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.170> no

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
cool but for now and they need to so no

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.069 
cool but for now and they need to so no
need<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> add<00:02:05.189> another<00:02:05.670> fifty<00:02:05.939> switches<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
need to add another fifty switches and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
need to add another fifty switches and
there's<00:02:07.799> no<00:02:07.979> reason<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.429> was<00:02:08.580> also<00:02:08.849> working<00:02:09.090> on

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
there's no reason I was also working on

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600 
there's no reason I was also working on
a<00:02:09.420> spider<00:02:10.170> extractor<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.160> takes<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
a spider extractor that takes out the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.100 
a spider extractor that takes out the
spiders<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.209> kills<00:02:12.420> them<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.780> different

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
spiders and kills them in a different

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670 
spiders and kills them in a different
area<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
area so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.050 
area so
that<00:02:13.859> you<00:02:13.950> get<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> hundred<00:02:14.310> percent<00:02:14.489> spider

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
that you get a hundred percent spider

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.569 
that you get a hundred percent spider
loot<00:02:15.329> but<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.439> couldn't<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:17.129> one<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.400> worked

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
loot but I couldn't get one that worked

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.339 
loot but I couldn't get one that worked
effective<00:02:18.120> enough<00:02:18.359> so<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:18.659> was<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:18.989> screw<00:02:19.319> it

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
effective enough so I was like screw it

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.789 
effective enough so I was like screw it
and<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.709> put<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.189> back<00:02:21.170> be<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.650> see

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
and just put it back be as you can see

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.349 
and just put it back be as you can see
it's<00:02:22.920> pretty<00:02:23.040> fast<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:23.969> want<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> turn

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
it's pretty fast and if I want to turn

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.830 
it's pretty fast and if I want to turn
the<00:02:24.480> items<00:02:24.780> off<00:02:24.930> i<00:02:25.079> can<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.469> that<00:02:25.650> switch<00:02:26.840> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the items off i can with that switch I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.589 
the items off i can with that switch I
