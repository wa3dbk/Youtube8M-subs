00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:47.200
 The screen here is also a screen to sleep laptop pc or pc screen 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.530
 theorem 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.470

 It is to connect xperia and a PC 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.220

 It is the end radio It is the same as the name hdmi cable but it is connected like this 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.940
 The curve is different. 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:42.050
 This hdmi cable eh little bit of introduction system this time 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.320

 I 'm using a professional professional Panasonic to connect a PC 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.970
 I think I understand if you see this, but both are the same 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.930
 Both of these connectors 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.650

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.950
