00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
leak parts you could see the video and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.200 
leak parts you could see the video and
even<00:01:51.689> though<00:01:51.899> those<00:01:52.350> cuts<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> antennas

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
even though those cuts for the antennas

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.780 
even though those cuts for the antennas
are<00:01:54.360> probably<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:54.869> final<00:01:55.439> oh<00:01:55.619> my<00:01:56.310> god<00:01:56.520> that

a<00:02:06.360> couple<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.659> movies<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.399> reports<00:02:08.399> claim

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
a couple of movies as a reports claim

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.729 
a couple of movies as a reports claim
that<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> product<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.690> far<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.440> bringing

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that the product is far from bringing

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.309 
that the product is far from bringing
ready<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.520> seems<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> company<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.510> still

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
ready it seems that the company is still

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.229 
ready it seems that the company is still
working<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.680> its<00:02:13.890> manufacturing<00:02:14.579> stages<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
working on its manufacturing stages and

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.250 
working on its manufacturing stages and
apparently<00:02:15.599> at<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.749> stage<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:15.989> it's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
apparently at the stage that it's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500 
apparently at the stage that it's
currently<00:02:16.620> at<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:17.579> can<00:02:17.730> still<00:02:17.939> change<00:02:17.969> things

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
currently at you can still change things

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750 
currently at you can still change things
so<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.930> product<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.469> not<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.920> final<00:02:20.400> then

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
so the product is not really final then

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.429 
so the product is not really final then
it<00:02:20.879> has<00:02:20.999> to<00:02:21.030> enter<00:02:21.450> production<00:02:21.629> stages<00:02:22.139> and

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
it has to enter production stages and

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.379 
it has to enter production stages and
then<00:02:22.560> mass<00:02:22.799> production<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.760> apparently<00:02:24.030> we

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
then mass production so apparently we

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.690 
then mass production so apparently we
won't<00:02:24.659> be<00:02:24.840> seeing<00:02:25.109> a<00:02:25.230> product<00:02:25.650> until<00:02:26.159> early

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
won't be seeing a product until early

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.660 
won't be seeing a product until early
2015<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.560> really<00:02:28.739> hard<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.099> predict<00:02:29.489> if

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
2015 so it's really hard to predict if

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.129 
2015 so it's really hard to predict if
we<00:02:29.819> will<00:02:30.090> get<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.389> announcement<00:02:30.959> on

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
we will get the announcement on

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.530 
we will get the announcement on
September<00:02:31.769> ninth<00:02:32.159> but<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:32.819> again<00:02:33.030> because

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
September ninth but then again because

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.059 
September ninth but then again because
some<00:02:33.659> credible<00:02:33.989> sources<00:02:34.319> claim<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> will

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
some credible sources claim that will

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.369 
some credible sources claim that will
happen<00:02:35.280> we're<00:02:35.969> kind<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.209> mixed<00:02:36.480> here<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.959> if

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
happen we're kind of mixed here and if

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.569 
happen we're kind of mixed here and if
you're<00:02:37.500> asking<00:02:37.739> yourself<00:02:37.859> where<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.459> the

and for the hot views of the day if you
look<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.829> licks<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.219> description

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
look at the licks of the description

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.220 
look at the licks of the description
you'll<00:02:50.790> notice<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.150> there<00:02:51.359> are<00:02:51.389> some<00:02:51.810> sample

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
you'll notice that there are some sample

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.589 
you'll notice that there are some sample
photos<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:52.949> these<00:02:53.519> are<00:02:53.669> not<00:02:53.819> necessarily<00:02:54.299> of

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
photos but these are not necessarily of

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.420 
photos but these are not necessarily of
the<00:02:54.810> galaxy<00:02:55.199> note<00:02:55.230> 4<00:02:55.560> these<00:02:55.739> are<00:02:55.799> actually<00:02:56.310> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the galaxy note 4 these are actually of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.300 
the galaxy note 4 these are actually of
the<00:02:56.549> lenovo<00:02:56.939> vibe<00:02:56.969> z2<00:02:57.449> and<00:02:57.949> the<00:02:58.949> reason<00:02:59.219> why

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the lenovo vibe z2 and the reason why

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.649 
the lenovo vibe z2 and the reason why
they're<00:02:59.489> hot<00:02:59.669> is<00:02:59.790> because<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.329> phone

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
they're hot is because the phone

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.599 
they're hot is because the phone
actually<00:03:00.959> uses<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> same<00:03:01.799> sensor<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.549> is

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
actually uses the same sensor that is

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.580 
actually uses the same sensor that is
