and that's how the game ended it was a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.220 
and that's how the game ended it was a
rare<00:01:55.770> oh<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.580> goodness<00:01:56.820> man<00:01:57.180> imagine<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.720> James

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
rare oh my goodness man imagine if James

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.960 
rare oh my goodness man imagine if James
Harden<00:01:58.590> shot<00:01:58.620> shot<00:01:59.250> something<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.790> he

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
Harden shot shot something there he

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.370 
Harden shot shot something there he
should<00:02:00.120> have<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.870> could<00:02:01.050> have<00:02:01.140> called

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
should have just they could have called

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.630 
should have just they could have called
time<00:02:01.590> about<00:02:01.800> I<00:02:01.830> think<00:02:02.190> they<00:02:02.250> would<00:02:02.370> have<00:02:02.460> done

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
time about I think they would have done

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
time about I think they would have done
better<00:02:02.820> their<00:02:03.180> chances<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.600> winning<00:02:03.720> was<00:02:03.990> much

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
better their chances of winning was much

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.980 
better their chances of winning was much
better<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.740> they<00:02:04.860> called<00:02:05.070> timeout<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.990> shut

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
better if they called timeout and shut

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
better if they called timeout and shut
something<00:02:07.260> but<00:02:08.099> for<00:02:08.610> some<00:02:08.879> reason<00:02:09.179> they

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
something but for some reason they

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300 
something but for some reason they
decided<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:11.039> James

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
decided to just go with what James

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.979 
decided to just go with what James
Harden<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.180> can't<00:02:12.239> really<00:02:12.450> blame<00:02:12.629> James

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
Harden but I can't really blame James

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.570 
Harden but I can't really blame James
Harden<00:02:13.379> for<00:02:13.530> running<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.920> because<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.430> on
