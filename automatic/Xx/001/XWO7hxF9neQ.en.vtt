00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.549
 Good people, we have a poll for 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.310
 know what music you would like 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.710
 to know more details of doubts and 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.300
 calves get shot by us 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.279
 Let's look at more other groups 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.840
 muscles to do to try to help 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.759
 a little each of you 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.160
 in the case of the calf simplify 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.960
 I usually do three times a week 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.430
 every other day, not alternating with 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.890
 abdominals precisely which are two 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.200
 musicians of very dense fibers and then 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.950
 they depend more on handle than go 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.989
 be animated 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.030
 they respond better with more 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.980
 ease for the vast majority 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.080
 if you train more often in the week but 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.240
 it also has a lot a difference 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.590
 great among some trainings of an athlete 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.890
 professional to another 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.230
 the james de mello made 6 60 the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.170
 futuristic from the eighties and three times 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.630
 per week and 6 61 absurd of pain and 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.199
 devastated by the musician the dollar and the yen in 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.920
 Compensation makes two series per 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.689
 machine two machines the maximum always there 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.659
 It's intense between you and me. 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.450
 jrt and it goes to exhaustion with few 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.400
 repetitions had weight sometimes makes a 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.100
 drop 7 something of the genre 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.600
 and he does it only once a week and 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.610
 then means are two differences 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.990
 very large in two athletes while 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.630
 exceptional islands 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.600
 just like I did integer also makes two 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.150
 times per week and three sets of 8 in the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.250
 maximum 10 repetitions so times are 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.500
 different things than athletes 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.210
 experienced by studying and 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.820
 were applying what else worked for 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.770
 as they work like the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.320
 experiment for them and for 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.610
 You, too, for me, I prefer three 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.630
 times a week than the calf 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.600
 improves not only the volume but also the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.990
 her muscle definition is 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.990
 that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.120
 in this first movement of elevation 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.400
 plantar flexion plant is rising 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920
 machine heels 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.010
 we usually put strength in the part 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.370
 of the feet and this is wrong 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.280
 in the applied mechanical part explains that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.290
 You have to squeeze the bone of the big toe. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.140
 knees have to stay in rounds to 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.630
 within a medial rotation of the knee 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.269
 practically extended knees and the 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.569
 heel rising to the point of making 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.160
 pressure upon the big toe bone the bone 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.080
 of the big toe controls the movement of 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.860
 gastronomes mainly gastone 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.470
 that he does not work alone without 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.870
 the side but the greater emphasis of this 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.580
 movement has to be put to the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.980
 within and not for outside 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.590
 you may notice that the heels 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.900
 are high but all the weight of the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.900
 movement over the big toe bone 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.510
 in this second movement the elevation of the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.060
 heels is with knees reflected 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.090
 the greater emphasis the movement will put the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.859
 eyes and you and not the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.390
 gastronomic that all the movements 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.000
 with knees extended works 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.609
 music as a primary musician now 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.540
 on the knee flexed with these solid feet 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.150
 from you real 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.579
 eyes only this part of the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.420
 lateral gourmets on these friezes 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.640
 sides 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.410
 this movement also has to be done 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.569
 to exhaustion always remembering that the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.940
 are musicians who have both 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.829
 fiber as white fiber does not 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.480
 has a difference from one to the other but 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.100
 are muscles of dense fibers of 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.920
 existence then needs to be worked out 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.310
 plus this third exercise 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.150
 called a little donkey or the little horse or 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.280
 want 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.100
 this time to organize in the 70's 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.540
 bru at night but denies that he liked 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.329
 doing this is very 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.530
 interesting for having the body 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.299
 the center of gravity of your body 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.370
 diverted forward making a 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.470
 water movement and a person ascending 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.139
 in its lombarda overload on top of the 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.660
 onemi gas does not earn two spaces of 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.180
 angulation that is different from the machine 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.060
 reflection and asks for a new extended 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.140
 and the weight exerted 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.390
 on the toes of the bone in the big toe 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.350
 internal bone and always up to the 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.110
 exhaustion 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.420
 in this fourth movement done in the leg 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.370
 45 degrees of inclination is 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.670
 basically equal to all movements 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.060
 with extended knees using force 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.640
 in the medial part of the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.640
 and tightening it with the knees 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.280
 practically fully extended this 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.170
 movement has nothing specific is just 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.570
 pro med neither medial will 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.910
 working eyes and had ice and 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.250
 usually want to re-emphasize some 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.430
 athletes use twitter three times for 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.740
 week as I like to do union 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.050
 Iran needs more handle than the others. 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.540
 musicians as well as abdomen because 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.730
 we are of dense fibers and very 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.710
 resistant gift ie the cd still 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.710
 enough catch in it 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.210
 to the above-mentioned development. 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.040
 renders complete by definition 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.220
 in the calf even though you 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.810
 did not wait for the end her much staying 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.270
 defined because showing the work 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.680
 muscular will give a visual aspect 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.540
 very cool 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.130
 three times a week is a 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.130
 maximum application for me
