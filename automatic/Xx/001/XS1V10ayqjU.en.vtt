00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.760
 I have brought you to one of the many 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.619
 vintage stores that are in Dublin because 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.750
 here there are no flea markets but that yes 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.430
 vintage stores there are a lot so 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.800
 I was very clear that one of the looks that 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.720
 I wanted to teach you had to be 100% 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.520
 vintage in fact this store is my 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.949
 favorite because they have fur coats 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.019
 very cute and I want to make a 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.699
 look that contains one of your coats what 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.680
 other you have to look for how good is one of 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.300
 Good or bad things depending on how you look 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.980
 of the goal stores but for same 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.379
 terrific thing because what to look for 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.760
 between pants dresses and boots me 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 love it so come on let's go to the mess 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.290
 good good good I think I found 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.060
 just what I was looking for a fur coat 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.980
 black but with a touch of 'animal 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.050
 print ' that will give you the daring point 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.550
 to the look I think this is going to be the jewel 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.680
 of the look and now I'm going to try 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.630
 find a little more neutral clothes 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.580
 so you do not want too aggressive 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.290
 but you know how vintage stores 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.810
 this of the sizes is a bit lottery 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.990
 we are going to search and search and see what 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.990
 we find 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.420
 this is what I'm passionate about 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.950
 vintage stores that you find garments 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.840
 that are super trendy but with that 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.850
 authentic touch of vintage clothes 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.920
 like for example these leather shorts 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.229
 that are super trendy but here 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.530
 we found them with a touch something more 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.330
 original as for example this from before 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.130
 or these that I think are the ones that are going to 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.110
 go better with the coat you chose 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.570
 because with the tones of the leopard print 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.430
 of the stole to look great and 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.440
 like this that is how I saw juno as 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.300
 worn out you know I think it's the touch 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.450
 that I personally want to give to my 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.450
 look 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.060
 let's find the top part of the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.680
 set I want it to be another color like that 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.290
 as neutral but that sticks with me 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.400
 shelter like for example this seems to me 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.409
 which is great because it is not 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.970
 too ornate but that has that 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.860
 vintage touch that is what I want 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.300
 find at the end in the look that I'm going to 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.130
 do in this store and I also think that 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.270
 for the colors and this neckline so 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.270
 box is going to go great 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.069
 in these places the footwear is a little 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.500
 more difficult so in the face of doubt we are going to 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.349
 the classic and I'm sure in this case 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.599
 for some black patent leather lounge shoes 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.000
 to give it its dot and with this insurance 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.500
 that we hit here is when I 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.959
 I lose with the bags because it's that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.090
 passionate and in particular I've got the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.680
 attention this here because I love 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.019
 the snake touch but then thought 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 that is a little overloaded with 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.260
 the coat of choosing to fill yes that I 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.000
 has said to myself verÃ³nica daughter catches 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.950
 something a little more neutral as for example 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.410
 this is like that mustard color but that 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.780
 still has snake skin and I think 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.099
 that will be great for me that does not 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.319
 I have no doubt with what I'm going to 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.440
 put on your head here in Dublin with the 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.120
 cold that makes a hat like this the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.120
 same color as the coat will keep me 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.400
 that is, and of many complements but 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.810
 the amber I am passionate about and if it is in the form of 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.810
 maxi ring better than better 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.640
 and now comes the difficult but also what 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.260
 more fun to try it on and that everything 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.070
 look good let's see if there is luck 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.070
 cross fingers
