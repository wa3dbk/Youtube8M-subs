in today's episode I'm going to be doing
a<00:00:07.170> stunt<00:00:07.500> using<00:00:08.130> only<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:08.820> hand<00:00:08.849> on<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
a stunt using only one hand on the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.180 
a stunt using only one hand on the
controller<00:00:09.870> now<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.769> challenge<00:00:11.130> that

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
controller now this is a challenge that

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.370 
controller now this is a challenge that
I<00:00:11.370> did<00:00:11.550> quite<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.030> while<00:00:12.300> back<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:12.990> series

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
I did quite a while back in this series

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.749 
I did quite a while back in this series
but<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.679> thought<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.009> was<00:00:14.099> pretty<00:00:14.250> funny<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.730> I

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
but I thought it was pretty funny so I

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.430 
but I thought it was pretty funny so I
thought<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> would<00:00:15.269> do<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.509> one<00:00:16.049> more<00:00:16.230> time

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
thought that I would do it one more time

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.170 
thought that I would do it one more time
for<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.770> guys<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.190> basically<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.820> stunt

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
for you guys and basically this stunt

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.370 
for you guys and basically this stunt

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
that we are going to be doing with one

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.529 
that we are going to be doing with one
hand<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.550> jump<00:00:20.789> off<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.240> little

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
hand is to jump off this little

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
hand is to jump off this little
staircase<00:00:21.840> right<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:23.340> bump<00:00:23.640> into<00:00:23.910> this

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
staircase right here then bump into this

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029 
staircase right here then bump into this
cube<00:00:24.449> right<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.869> front<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.260> me<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.619> then<00:00:25.800> fly

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
cube right in front of me and then fly

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.800 
cube right in front of me and then fly
all<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> way<00:00:26.460> over<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.910> land<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.390> top<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> that

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
all the way over and land on top of that

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.570 
all the way over and land on top of that
building<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.410> over<00:00:28.590> there<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.220> let's<00:00:29.250> go<00:00:29.429> in

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
building right over there so let's go in

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.070 
building right over there so let's go in
and<00:00:29.699> spawn<00:00:29.849> back<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.210> give<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.779> try

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and spawn back and give it a first try

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.479 
and spawn back and give it a first try
okay<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> way<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> hold

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
okay so the way that I'm going to hold

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.620 
okay so the way that I'm going to hold
the<00:00:32.550> controller<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.480> pretty

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the controller it's going to be pretty

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.910 
the controller it's going to be pretty
weird<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.110> basically<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.590> put<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
weird I basically just put the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740 
weird I basically just put the
controller<00:00:35.280> towards<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:35.820> body<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
controller towards my body like this and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
controller towards my body like this and
then<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.140> control<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> gas<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:38.040> my<00:00:38.129> index

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
then I control the gas with my index

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.010 
then I control the gas with my index
finger<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.360> steer<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.870> my

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
finger and then I just steer with my

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.690 
finger and then I just steer with my
thumb<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.410> over<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.550> sure<00:00:41.610> if

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
thumb but over here so I'm not sure if

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
thumb but over here so I'm not sure if
it's<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.239> hard<00:00:42.450> I'm<00:00:42.660> activating<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's going to be hard I'm activating a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.100 
it's going to be hard I'm activating a
booster<00:00:43.920> driving<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.600> yeah<00:00:45.930> we're

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
booster driving like this so yeah we're

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
booster driving like this so yeah we're
gonna<00:00:46.200> see<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.590> goes<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.670> guess<00:00:47.850> let's

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
gonna see how it goes and I guess let's

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.119 
gonna see how it goes and I guess let's
go<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> give<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.870> try<00:00:49.260> okay<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:49.829> we

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
go and give it a first try okay so we

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
go and give it a first try okay so we
managed<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> activate<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> booster<00:00:51.360> see<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.110> we

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
managed to activate a booster see if we

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
managed to activate a booster see if we
can<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.590> wheelies<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.670> think<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
can do some wheelies and I think this is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
can do some wheelies and I think this is
going<00:00:54.390> pretty<00:00:54.600> well<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.079> dough<00:00:55.620> nice

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
going pretty well it's dough nice

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
going pretty well it's dough nice
wheelie<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.789> well<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.539> least<00:00:57.870> with

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
wheelie over here and well at least with

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
wheelie over here and well at least with
this<00:00:58.230> there<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.770> always<00:00:58.890> good<00:00:59.160> now<00:00:59.520> we

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
but we pretty much already landed this

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.130 
but we pretty much already landed this

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.990 
stunt but we of course had to slam our
brakes<00:04:51.380> because<00:04:51.979> we<00:04:52.220> just<00:04:52.370> fell<00:04:52.550> off<00:04:52.700> straight

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
brakes because we just fell off straight

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.210 
brakes because we just fell off straight
after<00:04:53.450> button<00:04:53.690> waist<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.050> it<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.680> hit<00:04:54.830> B<00:04:55.010> for

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
after button waist and it just hit B for

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.670 
after button waist and it just hit B for
some<00:04:55.370> reason<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.000> then<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.390> just<00:04:56.750> slam<00:04:57.200> myself
