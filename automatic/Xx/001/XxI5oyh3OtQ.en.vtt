00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.660
 I'm from the minecraft server 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.430
 dawn of the octopus where I exercised the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 role of organizer of events and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.449

 comment you can find on my 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.250
 chain of adventures minecraft to two or 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.100

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.899
 a completely different project that games 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.340
 independent for those who do not know 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.110
 these are these games developed by 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.360
 small, unprofessional teams or 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.520
 almost and that are very experimental 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.100
 they are often not paying and even 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.750
 sometimes free on the side of the chain 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.310
 is a series in four episodes where 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.770

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.539
 completely barred based on 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.789
 the exploration of a paradoxical labyrinth 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.240
 lets you imagine that it's not 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.580
 possible 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.590

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.459
 videos at the moment but also 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.780
 two big projects this in a very future 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.099
 close 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.020

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.650

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.360
 platforms 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.370
 the second project is a new one 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.759
 concept the blind gaming or game to 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.950
 the blinded imagine a novice player 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.010
 on a game that must succeed in finishing 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.600
 as fast as possible this game guided by 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.100
 a much more experienced player 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.830
 he knows almost by heart but 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.940
 who can not see the game screen and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.800
