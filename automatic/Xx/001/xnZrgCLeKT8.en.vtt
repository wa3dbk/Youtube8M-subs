00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.829 

hello<00:00:04.790> he's<00:00:05.790> been<00:00:06.029> here<00:00:06.299> we're<00:00:06.480> talking<00:00:06.720> about

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
hello he's been here we're talking about

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.140 
hello he's been here we're talking about
bending<00:00:07.259> strings<00:00:07.980> okay<00:00:08.429> now<00:00:08.580> bending<00:00:09.000> is

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
bending strings okay now bending is

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.060 
bending strings okay now bending is
another<00:00:09.450> technique<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.260> we<00:00:10.349> can<00:00:10.530> use<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
another technique that we can use to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.580 
another technique that we can use to
change<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.759> pitch<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:13.290> we're<00:00:13.440> on

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
change the pitch on that we're on

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.790 
change the pitch on that we're on
without<00:00:13.889> picking<00:00:14.730> again<00:00:15.210> all<00:00:15.540> right<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.710> we

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
without picking again all right so we

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.070 
without picking again all right so we
can<00:00:16.920> pick<00:00:17.130> once<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:20.029> get<00:00:21.029> multiple<00:00:21.630> notes<00:00:21.840> out

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
can pick once and get multiple notes out

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.529 
can pick once and get multiple notes out
of<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.289> all<00:00:22.680> right<00:00:22.859> another<00:00:23.250> kind<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.939> great

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
of it all right another kind of great

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
of it all right another kind of great
thing<00:00:24.750> about<00:00:24.840> bending<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.529> mimics<00:00:26.310> more

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
thing about bending is it mimics more

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.019 
thing about bending is it mimics more
closely<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:28.080> sound<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.560> voice<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.640> know<00:00:29.760> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
closely the sound of a voice you know so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.870 
closely the sound of a voice you know so
in<00:00:30.480> trying<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.080> any<00:00:31.980> instrument<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.640> sound

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
in trying to get any instrument to sound

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.580 
in trying to get any instrument to sound
more<00:00:33.090> human<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:35.010> animalistic<00:00:36.590> we're

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
more human or more animalistic we're

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.889 
more human or more animalistic we're
going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.010> bend<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> strings<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.629> hear

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
going to bend the strings you can hear

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.350 
going to bend the strings you can hear
the<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.230> howl<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.579> has<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> all

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the kind of howl that it has to it all

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.819 
the kind of howl that it has to it all
right<00:00:42.480> we're<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> talk<00:00:43.320> about<00:00:43.469> two

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
right we're going to talk about two

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
right we're going to talk about two
different<00:00:44.100> kinds<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.550> bends<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.120> whole<00:00:46.020> step

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
different kinds of bends one whole step

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.720 
different kinds of bends one whole step
bends<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> other<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.520> half

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
bends and the other is going to be half

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.959 
bends and the other is going to be half
step<00:00:48.030> bin<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.450> we're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> use<00:00:49.520> these<00:00:50.520> two

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
step bin so we're going to use these two

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
step bin so we're going to use these two
notes<00:00:51.539> right<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:51.870> okay<00:00:52.770> now<00:00:53.070> usually<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
notes right here okay now usually I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.080 
notes right here okay now usually I
could<00:00:54.920> just<00:00:55.920> pick<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.610> them<00:00:56.760> pick<00:00:56.940> them

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
could just pick up to them pick them

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.240 
could just pick up to them pick them
each<00:00:57.210> individually<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> practice<00:00:59.100> my

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
each individually but now to practice my

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
each individually but now to practice my
whole<00:00:59.520> step<00:00:59.820> Bend<00:01:01.820> I'm<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> bend<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
whole step Bend I'm going to bend and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.410 
whole step Bend I'm going to bend and
then<00:01:04.530> play<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> note<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> check<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.939> tuning

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
then play this note to check my tuning

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.310 
then play this note to check my tuning
all<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> bend<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:09.320> until

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
all right I'm going to bend it up until

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.370 
all right I'm going to bend it up until
it<00:01:10.500> matches

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
it matches

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.370 
it matches
the<00:01:12.890> tuning<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:14.119> fifth<00:01:14.840> fret<00:01:15.170> on<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
the tuning of this fifth fret on the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350 
the tuning of this fifth fret on the
cuse<00:01:15.920> me<00:01:15.950> fifth<00:01:16.250> fret<00:01:16.549> on<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.820> second<00:01:17.180> string

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
cuse me fifth fret on the second string

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.990 
cuse me fifth fret on the second string
all<00:01:17.630> right<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.049> have<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:19.399> seventh<00:01:19.820> fret

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
all right so you have the seventh fret

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.880 
all right so you have the seventh fret
with<00:01:20.299> your<00:01:20.329> third<00:01:20.630> string<00:01:21.049> excuse<00:01:21.560> me<00:01:21.680> a<00:01:21.710> third

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
with your third string excuse me a third

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.770 
with your third string excuse me a third
finger<00:01:22.280> seventh<00:01:23.030> fret<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.360> 3rd<00:01:23.630> string

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
finger seventh fret of the 3rd string

third finger and your first finger is

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.870 
third finger and your first finger is
going<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.770> be<00:01:27.860> on<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.159> fifth<00:01:28.399> fret<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
going to be on the fifth fret of the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.850 
going to be on the fifth fret of the
second<00:01:29.299> string<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:29.899> we're<00:01:30.049> going<00:01:30.259> to<00:01:32.860> bend

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
second string and we're going to bend

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.030 
second string and we're going to bend
that<00:01:34.130> third<00:01:34.640> string<00:01:35.179> up<00:01:35.390> until<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.289> matches

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.240 

it<00:01:42.040> matches<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:43.530> note<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:44.830> what<00:01:45.100> we've

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
it matches that note and that what we've

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.510 
it matches that note and that what we've
done<00:01:45.400> now<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.640> Bend<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.300> note<00:01:46.600> up<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:47.520> whole

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
done now is Bend this note up a whole

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.010 
done now is Bend this note up a whole
step<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:51.220> pitch<00:01:51.850> accuracy<00:01:52.450> is<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.600> great<00:01:52.810> thing

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
step now pitch accuracy is a great thing

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.370 
step now pitch accuracy is a great thing
and<00:01:53.229> that's<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.860> definitely<00:01:54.250> worth

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and that's this is definitely worth

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.840 
and that's this is definitely worth
practicing<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.920> listening<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.700> really

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
practicing and listening to and really

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.570 
practicing and listening to and really
listening<00:01:58.330> for<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.570> match<00:01:59.130> the<00:02:00.130> other<00:02:00.280> thing

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
listening for the match the other thing

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.460 
listening for the match the other thing
we're<00:02:01.150> going<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.300> talk<00:02:01.390> about<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.840> half<00:02:02.140> step

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
we're going to talk about is a half step

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.290 
we're going to talk about is a half step
Bend<00:02:02.770> right<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:03.460> instead<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.759> going<00:02:03.940> from<00:02:04.119> this

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
Bend right so instead of going from this

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.840 
Bend right so instead of going from this
note<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:06.100> note<00:02:06.310> we're<00:02:06.460> going<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.640> go<00:02:06.729> from

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
note to that note we're going to go from

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.050 
note to that note we're going to go from
this<00:02:06.970> note<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:09.039> note<00:02:09.310> all<00:02:09.640> right<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:09.940> this

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
this note to that note all right so this

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.040 
this note to that note all right so this
is<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.240> more<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:11.580> little<00:02:12.580> more<00:02:12.670> imperceptible<00:02:13.630> of

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
is a more a little more imperceptible of
