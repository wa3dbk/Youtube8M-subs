I will walk you through them first step
is<00:01:12.390> assembling<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.020> handle<00:01:13.380> take<00:01:14.160> one<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
is assembling the handle take one of the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.660 
is assembling the handle take one of the
galvanized<00:01:15.120> steel<00:01:15.410> pipes<00:01:16.410> and<00:01:16.860> attach<00:01:17.160> it<00:01:17.190> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
galvanized steel pipes and attach it to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.910 
galvanized steel pipes and attach it to
the<00:01:17.940> T<00:01:23.270> now<00:01:24.270> attach<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.810> other<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the T now attach the other two in the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:36.789 
the T now attach the other two in the
same<00:01:26.160> fashion

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.700 

okay<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.280> makes<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.180> tea<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.750> we'll<00:01:40.590> be

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
okay and this makes the tea and we'll be

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
okay and this makes the tea and we'll be
using<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.070> later<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.820> set<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.090> next

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
using it later so just set it down next

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.749 
using it later so just set it down next
we're<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.530> making<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.159> base<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
we're going to be making the base and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.460 
we're going to be making the base and
for<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.210> you'll<00:01:45.420> need<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.750> hex<00:01:45.930> bushings

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
for this you'll need the hex bushings

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.760 
for this you'll need the hex bushings
and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.280> floor<00:01:47.520> flange<00:01:47.990> all<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> do

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and the floor flange all you have to do

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.990 
and the floor flange all you have to do
is<00:01:50.039> assemble<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:52.049> hex<00:01:52.710> bushings<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is assemble the hex bushings on to the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480 
is assemble the hex bushings on to the
floor<00:01:54.149> flange<00:01:54.710> putting<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> biggest<00:01:56.220> on<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
floor flange putting the biggest on the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
floor flange putting the biggest on the
bottom<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.000> sometimes<00:01:57.360> these<00:01:57.539> are<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.720> little

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
bottom and sometimes these are a little

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.059 
bottom and sometimes these are a little
hard<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.470> there<00:01:58.679> and<00:02:03.770> making<00:02:04.770> sure

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
hard to get in there and making sure

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.150 
hard to get in there and making sure
that<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.880> smallest<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.049> top<00:02:07.289> once<00:02:08.069> you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
that the smallest is on the top once you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.729 
that the smallest is on the top once you
get<00:02:08.280> done<00:02:08.459> i'll<00:02:08.670> make<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> pyramid<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:10.190> so

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
get done i'll make a pyramid like so

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.059 
get done i'll make a pyramid like so
alright<00:02:13.739> step<00:02:14.190> three<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:14.910> attaching<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> base

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
alright step three is attaching the base

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.370 
alright step three is attaching the base
to<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.099> handle<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.730> you'll<00:02:18.420> want<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.780> put<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
to the handle and you'll want to put the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.110 
to the handle and you'll want to put the
longest<00:02:20.190> part<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.580> t<00:02:21.590> onto<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> base<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
longest part of the t onto the base and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.610 
longest part of the t onto the base and
watch<00:02:24.390> out<00:02:24.690> make<00:02:24.900> sure<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.110> doesn't<00:02:25.260> hit<00:02:25.500> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
watch out make sure it doesn't hit you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.070 
watch out make sure it doesn't hit you
in<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.769> head<00:02:25.860> or<00:02:26.010> anything<00:02:27.019> alright<00:02:30.080> alright

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
in the head or anything alright alright

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.309 
in the head or anything alright alright
next<00:02:31.440> what<00:02:31.830> we're<00:02:31.980> going<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.220> do<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:33.080> make<00:02:34.080> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
next what we're going to do is make the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.800 
next what we're going to do is make the
camera<00:02:34.709> mount<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.760> all<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.570> have
