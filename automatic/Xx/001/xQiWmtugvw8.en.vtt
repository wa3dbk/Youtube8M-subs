will be able to play the majority of the
Xbox<00:01:36.119> 360<00:01:36.960> library<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.579> you'll<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.759> able

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
Xbox 360 library and that you'll be able

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.090 
Xbox 360 library and that you'll be able
to<00:01:39.000> transfer<00:01:39.240> over<00:01:39.600> your<00:01:40.049> game<00:01:40.320> saves<00:01:40.710> from

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to transfer over your game saves from

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.620 
to transfer over your game saves from
the<00:01:41.220> Xbox<00:01:41.610> 360<00:01:42.210> over<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> 720<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> my

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the Xbox 360 over to the 720 this is my

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
the Xbox 360 over to the 720 this is my
guess<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.130> hope<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.909> key

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
guess and this is my hope on this key

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
guess and this is my hope on this key
I'm<00:01:48.299> an<00:01:48.450> optimistic<00:01:48.840> person<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.740> try<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> be

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
I'm an optimistic person and I try to be

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.830 
I'm an optimistic person and I try to be
but<00:01:51.890> it'd<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.280> interesting<00:01:53.939> hopefully

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
but it'd be really interesting hopefully

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.319 
but it'd be really interesting hopefully
hopefully<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:57.060> build<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
hopefully all that will build the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.179 
hopefully all that will build the
