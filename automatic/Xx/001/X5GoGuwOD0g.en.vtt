want to go on it hip jumps can also be
tough<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.810> learn<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> change<00:00:20.100> in

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
tough to learn because of the change in

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.500 
tough to learn because of the change in
angle<00:00:20.490> between<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.850> takeoff<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.420> the

angle between the takeoff and the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.800 
angle between the takeoff and the
landing<00:00:25.730> I'll<00:00:26.730> break<00:00:27.000> down<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.300> hip<00:00:27.449> jump<00:00:27.660> so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
landing I'll break down the hip jump so
