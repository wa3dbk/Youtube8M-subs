this car I've heard from a bunch of
people<00:02:22.830> telling<00:02:23.190> me<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:24.120> car<00:02:24.390> has

gotten a ton of buffs to the speed and
handling<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.350> we're<00:02:28.709> about<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.010> put<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430

the<00:02:29.459> test<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:30.060> think<00:02:30.870> I'm<00:02:31.080> gonna<00:02:31.170> color<00:02:31.410> at<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the test I think I'm gonna color at the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.699 
the test I think I'm gonna color at the
exact<00:02:32.010> same<00:02:32.190> as<00:02:32.370> my<00:02:32.489> old<00:02:32.549> one<00:02:32.790> too<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.709> that

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
exact same as my old one too and that

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.220 
exact same as my old one too and that
would<00:02:34.950> be<00:02:35.130> where<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.970> midnight<00:02:36.480> blue<00:02:37.610> and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
would be where is it midnight blue and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.500

right there there's no GT lettering or
anything<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.620> will<00:02:55.769> color<00:02:55.950> match<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
