00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
mentioned a few times the new graphics

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.320 
mentioned a few times the new graphics

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.270 
engine long draw distances high detailed
road<00:02:09.479> textures<00:02:09.960> let's<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:10.800> start<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
road textures let's actually start the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:32.700 
road textures let's actually start the
race<00:02:11.400> turn<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.390> up<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.720> little<00:02:12.810> bit

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:43.140 

at<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.130> other<00:02:33.250> end<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.790> line

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.790 

so<00:02:43.780> as<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.959> mentioned<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.409> have<00:02:44.530> over<00:02:44.680> four

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
so as I mentioned we have over four

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.280 
so as I mentioned we have over four
100<00:02:47.070> cockpits<00:02:47.550> as<00:02:47.670> well<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.840> course<00:02:49.140> this

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
100 cockpits as well of course this

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.990 
100 cockpits as well of course this
being<00:02:49.440> ports<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.920> motorsport<00:02:50.370> every<00:02:50.670> part<00:02:50.910> is

damaged and now Newton or tomorrow at

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.980 
damaged and now Newton or tomorrow at
three<00:02:54.090> every<00:02:54.420> part<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.780> be<00:02:54.810> rolled<00:02:55.110> over

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
three every part can be rolled over

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.720 
three every part can be rolled over
this<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.710> key<00:02:56.890> part<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.220> making<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.580> very

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
this is a key part of making a very

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.970 
this is a key part of making a very
simulator<00:02:58.240> rollovers<00:02:58.930> happen<00:02:59.320> now<00:02:59.740> I'll<00:02:59.860> tell

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
simulator rollovers happen now I'll tell

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.380 
simulator rollovers happen now I'll tell
you<00:03:00.100> they're<00:03:00.250> hard<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.490> happen<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:00.970> now<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.240> p

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
you they're hard to happen and now on p

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.730 
you they're hard to happen and now on p
car<00:03:01.630> like<00:03:01.780> this<00:03:01.990> they<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.290> such<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.560> low

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
car like this they have such a low

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.010 
car like this they have such a low
center<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.130> mass<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:04.330> likelihood<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.810> we're

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
center of mass the likelihood that we're

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.330 
center of mass the likelihood that we're
going<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.200> see<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.380> rollover<00:03:05.620> during<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.130> scale

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
going to see a rollover during the scale

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.560 
going to see a rollover during the scale
is<00:03:06.520> very<00:03:06.730> well<00:03:07.320> probably<00:03:08.320> non-existent

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
is very well probably non-existent

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.140 
is very well probably non-existent
taking<00:03:10.570> other<00:03:10.720> cars<00:03:10.960> on<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.320> would<00:03:11.470> see<00:03:11.680> him

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
taking other cars on you would see him

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.270 
taking other cars on you would see him
let's<00:03:13.150> take<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.330> better<00:03:13.570> look<00:03:13.630> at<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:13.930> car

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.850 

this<00:03:17.850> again<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.480> high<00:03:18.990> level<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.500> detail

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
this again is that high level of detail

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:29.640 
this again is that high level of detail
car

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.610 

around<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.770> portion

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.260 

the<00:03:36.860> grass

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.569 

this<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:39.990> not<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.380> type<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.590> traffic

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.920 

and<00:03:46.579> here's<00:03:46.790> where<00:03:46.939> gameplay<00:03:47.359> rewind<00:03:47.689> comes

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
and here's where gameplay rewind comes

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.559 
and here's where gameplay rewind comes
in

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.380 

I<00:03:51.659> don't<00:03:52.290> like<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.560> way<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.709> took<00:03:53.239> don't<00:03:54.239> think

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
I don't like the way I took don't think

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:10.280 
I don't like the way I took don't think
I<00:03:54.450> did<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.629> very<00:03:54.810> good<00:03:54.900> job<00:03:55.049> let's<00:03:55.620> try<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:55.889> again

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.050 

this<00:04:11.290> allows<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.740> to<00:04:11.830> truly<00:04:12.010> perfect<00:04:12.370> corners

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
this allows you to truly perfect corners

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.820 
this allows you to truly perfect corners
but<00:04:13.270> more<00:04:13.420> than<00:04:13.510> anything<00:04:13.630> allows<00:04:14.170> any<00:04:14.470> player

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
but more than anything allows any player

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:39.460 
but more than anything allows any player
begin<00:04:15.190> in<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.490> have<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.640> great<00:04:15.970> time

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.470 

so<00:04:40.040> one<00:04:40.370> thing<00:04:40.550> you're<00:04:40.670> also<00:04:40.820> seeing<00:04:41.150> here<00:04:41.450> is

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
so one thing you're also seeing here is

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.510 
so one thing you're also seeing here is
that<00:04:41.720> green<00:04:41.990> line<00:04:42.020> this<00:04:42.920> is<00:04:43.070> proved<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.400> be

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
that green line this is proved to be

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.400 
that green line this is proved to be
very<00:04:43.550> helpful<00:04:43.970> for<00:04:44.300> most<00:04:44.510> players<00:04:44.660> the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
very helpful for most players the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.080 
very helpful for most players the
ability<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:46.070> just<00:04:46.250> follow<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.670> green<00:04:47.060> line

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
ability to just follow that green line

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.440 
ability to just follow that green line
all<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.540> way<00:04:47.630> around<00:04:49.000> but<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.030> want<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.300> show

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450

all the way around but I want to show
you<00:04:50.540> this<00:04:50.660> cool<00:04:50.720> track<00:04:51.230> because<00:04:51.530> I<00:04:51.650> just<00:04:51.770> think

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010

it's<00:04:52.100> beautiful

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.550 

you<00:05:09.060> can<00:05:09.180> see<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.479> bumps<00:05:09.810> in<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.020> cars<00:05:10.289> it's

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
you can see the bumps in the cars it's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.020
