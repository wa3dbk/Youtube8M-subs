00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.529
 to the new day and today we are going to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.389
 customize a coat myself so I did 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.380
 priori it will be very complicated and the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.120
 true that it can not be something else 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.889
 simple sometimes shared as 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.120
 you are on the blog my stage designer 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.190
 because I had a small brand of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.920
 accessories that then evolved a bit 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.500
 more to t-shirts and coats then 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.570
 I wanted to count on once I found some 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.710
 Super nice friends in Tokyo walking 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 down the street like I do not want 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.369
 get but all right michelle are 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 nice to customize good after 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.989
 a few coats is from Tokyo to the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.920

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.270
 in a market of these that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.059
 I participated to sell my 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.680
 accessories and my little clothes I picked 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 fast intense custom because it makes me 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.789
 he made seven friends hears and they were sold 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.410
 but but in five minutes remaining 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.239
 terrible where there are things that I stayed 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.980
 with a man who sees that because this 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.600
 my mother has nothing to Think 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.879
 touch but to teach it one is one 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 friend just mass but it is super nice 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.199
 I put this on, I put some pizzas 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.149
 colors of changing buttons 24 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.649
 things and create some superfluous coats and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.649
 spinetta introduction let's start 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.299
 we are going to need a coat and a strip 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.799
 embroidered with stones it turns out that yesterday I 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.570
 I went through the first wish I was wearing 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.520
 until the very expert I really passed 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.470
 by to find basic I need 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 me to do mare and obviously 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.369
 tend to look for cheap sites 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.840
 then when here with this coat that 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.030
 they had in various colors they had blue 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.159
 marine had a color like an orange tree 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.930
 clarito precious a green as a medium 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.610
 milk that I did not like so much but 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.080
 good my walk I liked more curtain 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.640
 down but I decided to take the navy blue 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.590
 because I think it's going to give a lot more game 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.750
 only now customize a tee 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.700
 super simple fame I have around here you are 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.710
 the decorative ribbon that I bought in a 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.929
 site in the canton los angeles 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.640
 fun in down to madrid from 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.319
 now downtown when they get to walk in 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.360
 the center of madrid is worth it because I get 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.679
 say that because I was going to dance of the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.600
 angels to buy materials for my 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.209
 good stuff - rolls I'm getting in today 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.530
 the own found this embroidered strip 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.540
 there will be this decorative city that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.250
 it's crazy what I'm going to decorate the coat 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.420
 with what I'm going to do basically good 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.340
 Well, I thought I do not want it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.020
 recharge but I want it to be up 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.229
 so be a little more special 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.760
 I 'm going to add this decorative strip 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.620
 simply as a detail the accessory 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.270
 here in the neck you see 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.560
 I think you can observe a little what 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.390
 that is going to make the idea that I'm going to make 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.310
 in the sleeves I'm going to do three quarters 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.110
 of the same thing is to say I'm going to fuck in the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.540
 decorative strip and I'll add it as 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.130
 an additional detail here the manga watched 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.470
 How pretty is the sleeve and with 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.090
 this well these are very silly details 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.310
 it really has no mystery what 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.080
 that has mystery is one to find a 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.269
 cool coat a coat that is like a 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.680
 special and open enzo to be able to create 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.510
 and do what I give you the good wins with 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.340
 you are one of them and the other is 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.769
 find a strip of pretty stones 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.180
 for those that do not abound because there 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.470
 new and I tell you the truth I was in 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.390
 three stores until you find ones that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.500
 I really like it and it seems 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.570
 good 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.190
 dear friend seen holy is in 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.780
 concrete what is super beautiful what 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.280
 first thing I'm going to do is calculate 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.230
 how much in this guy obviously obviously 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.600
 to fill all the surfaces what 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.300
 I'm going to put a little bit around 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.460
 of the neck as p as you see that to see 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.819
 how much will I have to cut then 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.099
 I'm going to cut here where it's going to end 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.139
 is what I need this I'm going to save it 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.999
 for the sleeves here you can see how 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.170
 the strip remains on the collar of the coat and 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.389
 Now I'm going to do exactly the same 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.829
 operation in the sleeves I will measure 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.049
 what the circumferences of the sleeves 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.239
 and I'm going to cut the strip in proportion and 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.189
 well I've just bought exact for what 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.989
 what I wanted to do is amazing and 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.069
 ability to adjust the grace here only 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.599
 I had a meter because he did not want me 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.090
 spend more because the ones that these tapes 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.560
 of cheap do not have a hair this is what 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.090
 what has left me that you think that 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.010
 we can do with this hanging flight 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.870
 look what monkey is good we'll see 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.370
 let's continue the next thing I'm going to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.829
 do and you are including well and 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.599
 expect it with glue the truth that what 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.209
 more professional would be to know the 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.159
 truth this east of this strip of go 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.349
 grabbing the neck and sleeves of 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.389
 coat but you know we play 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.010
 always with the time factor and pÃ©rez and 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.989
 already then also to much pÃ©rez and already 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.669
 go knowing this and part I do not have 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.949
 time to do it but what do you have 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:05.620
 long time or you love sewing example 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.969
 there on the couch, you get dressed and crazy 6 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.799
 but I'll stick because in addition to 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.569
 I am less afraid than ever because it is 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.909
 chubby coat is not as fine as 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.360
 so that the glue is transferred to 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:19.100
 another side anyway I'm going 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.260
 and the skin and watched the video and the video in 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.940
 the one that made a neck like lace 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.760
 you remember we cut a bib neck 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.290
 in a good long-sleeved shirt 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.300
 because this neck I want you to know that 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.460
 I put in the washing machine and it has not been 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.950
 taken off to ensure that yes to stick it 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.750
 well with glue but that is already two or 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.160
 three washing machine I put it a lot 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.470
 because danger that guides them just as 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.270
 I'm getting better and I do not know 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.130
 take off I'm going to put under the coat 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.870
 yes, just in case and to do it 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.520
 as clean as possible I will put this 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.710
 cut that out there a subtraction 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.870
 that I had here hotels and style and 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.700
 I had for canceled that they have 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.200
 precious sites to pass the end of 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.680
 week but with the help of a toothpick and 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.410
 a special glue for fabric 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.770
 we are going to stick this invention then 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.480
 I'm going to do a little bit of glue like that 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.230
 and I'm going to apply it in the back 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.780
 from the strip and I'm applying quite 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.430
 glue because I do not want to have any 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.870
 disgust in fact I could even go 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.240
 applying directly the glue 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.130
 You see, I'm going to change the course of the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.100
 day and I'll apply it directly the 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.720
 glue on the strip and I'm going to 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.450
 extend that yes well so that when 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.770
 hit do not scare me 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.170
 once I have a first part of 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.330
 glue applied on the strip I'm going 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.390
 to catch and I'm going to stick on the coat 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.490
 be very careful not to mess up the truth 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.320
 of not doing something weird in this 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.940
 I am already that what is the neck of the 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.920
 shelter and I hope you can be 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.170
 seeing you see, I think I think 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.990
 really beautiful this is the word 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.790
 precious concluded that it elaborates but that 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.080
 It has been very good very dignified I like it 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.030
 how it has been and now what is going to be 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.530
 the combination is to do the same in the 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.910
 We have arrived at the end of the day and 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.290
 Huaynos gone teaching another process 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.300
 because I really did not find it either 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.280
 of more interest than simply as 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.630
 I told you to go hit the treatment 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.920
 about the strip in the truth that I do not 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.720
 found any kind of difficulty 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.550
 habitual in my truth that I usually conclude 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.050
 possible difficulties later they can 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.310
 happen that they do not have any kind of 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.820
 difficulty takes a little bit of time 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.520
 neither 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.800
 exaggerate relatively fast and good 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.870
 look for now this is the fear 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.610
 that I had to put myself in logic as 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.110
 I have not finished drying because here 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.910
 I risked putting it on to teach you 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.080
 I totally will take it away now 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.550
 because still for example this is 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.050
 the last thing you hit gets hits or 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.700
 still without sticking in everything good these 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.490
 things have to be left dry for a while 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.680
 possible preferably you want to go with 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.510
 weight above so that it sits well 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.070
 the glue and the piece but good not 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.260
 I want to teach these months how to never 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.370
 all the time the glue wet but 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.340
 good for you to see how this was 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.750
 It has been pretty neck ahead 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.050
 and from behind but you can appreciate it 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.280
 well and how nice is to wear the coat 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.860
 that's good too as I wear a sweater 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.300
 very fat, because here the same brands do not 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.130
 you see me all right but good I 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.690
 I'm sure you can see it is a 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.010
 coat while super cute and I 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.200
 which also has some pockets but 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.030
 it is not unstitched but good has here 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.100
 some pockets that are then given in 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.300
 when you find a second and nothing 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.680
 I hope you liked the idea for 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.750
 see how you could do more 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.400
 very simple but it costs 35 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.960
 euros once and is a little bit more 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.169
 Special obviously this is not a coat 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.699
 for here right now 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.650
 because he knows that it's cold freezing 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.930
 but hey it's a friend for example a 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.520
 kind of coat to wear beneath 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.229
 your coat and what I'm going to do 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.639
 nothing more to add I hope that I have 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.210
 liked and see you in the video end 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.210
 until next time
