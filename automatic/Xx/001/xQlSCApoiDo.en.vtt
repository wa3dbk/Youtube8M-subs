00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
this weekend with the bullet and to put

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.150 
this weekend with the bullet and to put
in<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> display<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.230> other<00:00:28.380> interesting

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
in a display with other interesting

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.290 
in a display with other interesting
vehicles<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.230> an<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> ride<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.850> this

vehicles and an out for a ride this this

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
vehicles and an out for a ride this this
last<00:00:33.510> weekend<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.170> chug-chug-chug<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
last weekend and chug-chug-chug and it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.119 
last weekend and chug-chug-chug and it
just<00:00:35.250> stopped<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.700> me<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.649> very<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:37.860> similar

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
just stopped on me and very very similar

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.340 
just stopped on me and very very similar
to<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.820> sort<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.629> died<00:00:39.809> before<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
to how it sort of died before when I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.760 
to how it sort of died before when I
first<00:00:40.410> got<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.540> my<00:00:42.540> initial<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:45.289> checks<00:00:46.289> by

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
first got it and my initial as checks by

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.709 
first got it and my initial as checks by
the<00:00:46.829> roadside<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> top<00:00:47.850> end<00:00:48.030> looked<00:00:48.510> fine

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the roadside at the top end looked fine

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.080 
the roadside at the top end looked fine
and<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.070> expecting<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> same<00:00:50.700> problem

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and so I was expecting the same problem

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.850 
and so I was expecting the same problem
as<00:00:51.210> before<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> piston<00:00:52.379> rings<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
as before with the piston rings and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
as before with the piston rings and
however<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> checked<00:00:54.059> its<00:00:54.390> considerably

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
however one I checked its considerably

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
however one I checked its considerably
worse<00:00:55.199> than<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:56.460> it's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
worse than that and I think it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.060 
worse than that and I think it's
actually<00:00:56.760> jus<00:00:57.059> toil<00:00:57.360> starvation<00:00:58.170> somewhere

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
actually jus toil starvation somewhere

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.439 
actually jus toil starvation somewhere
along<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> way<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> seems<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.090> use<00:01:00.210> quite

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
along the way it seems to have use quite

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
along the way it seems to have use quite
a<00:01:00.480> bit<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.750> oil<00:01:01.160> where<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.340> how<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.609> not

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
a bit of oil where and how I'm not

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.549 
a bit of oil where and how I'm not
entirely<00:01:03.059> sure<00:01:03.239> where<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.930> burning<00:01:04.260> its<00:01:04.379> what

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
entirely sure where in burning its what

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
entirely sure where in burning its what
I'd<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.769> although<00:01:04.890> there's<00:01:05.189> no<00:01:05.339> evidence<00:01:05.970> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I'd be although there's no evidence on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
I'd be although there's no evidence on
the<00:01:06.210> plug<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:08.270> what's<00:01:09.270> happened<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.610> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the plug and and what's happened is the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.460 
the plug and and what's happened is the
back<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> piston<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.110> badly<00:01:14.010> scored<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
back of the piston is badly scored and

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.010 
back of the piston is badly scored and
the<00:01:16.610> upper<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:17.820> piston<00:01:18.299> rings<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.689> actually

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the upper two piston rings are actually

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
the upper two piston rings are actually
actually<00:01:19.380> welded<00:01:19.799> themselves<00:01:20.340> into<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
actually welded themselves into the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.719 
actually welded themselves into the
piston<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.009> barrel<00:01:23.280> itself<00:01:23.520> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
piston and and the barrel itself is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.120 
piston and and the barrel itself is
badly<00:01:23.939> scored<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.869> imagine<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:26.070> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
badly scored as you can imagine and as I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
badly scored as you can imagine and as I
say<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> due<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.150> starvation<00:01:27.630> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
say I think this is due to starvation so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.160 
say I think this is due to starvation so
that's<00:01:28.939> fortunately<00:01:29.939> looking<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.930> there

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that's fortunately looking at that there

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440 
that's fortunately looking at that there
and<00:01:31.439> having<00:01:32.189> drained<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> sump<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.060> well<00:01:33.210> just

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and having drained the sump as well just

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
and having drained the sump as well just
to<00:01:33.540> make<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.040> wasn't<00:01:35.430> getting<00:01:35.670> some

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to make sure that I wasn't getting some

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.319 
to make sure that I wasn't getting some
kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.500> top-end<00:01:37.500> oil<00:01:38.369> failure<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
kind of top-end oil failure and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
kind of top-end oil failure and
everything<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:39.990> collecting<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> sump

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
everything was collecting in the sump

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560 
everything was collecting in the sump
and<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.340> scavenge<00:01:41.670> pool<00:01:41.880> wasn't<00:01:42.180> picking<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and the scavenge pool wasn't picking it

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
and the scavenge pool wasn't picking it
all<00:01:42.720> i<00:01:42.960> drained<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> sun<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.189> that

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
all i drained the sun to see and that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.120 
all i drained the sun to see and that
was<00:01:44.460> okay<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.259> hand<00:01:46.560> I've<00:01:46.890> become

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
was okay on the one hand I've become

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.850 
was okay on the one hand I've become
quite<00:01:47.310> good<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.670> getting<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:49.350> top<00:01:49.680> end

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
just lifted away quite nicely and easily

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.819 
just lifted away quite nicely and easily
and<00:02:02.610> all<00:02:03.180> looked<00:02:03.450> fine<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.469> least<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.799> know

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
and all looked fine so at least I know

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.560 
and all looked fine so at least I know
for<00:02:05.219> future<00:02:05.670> reference<00:02:05.880> when<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> gets

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
for future reference when it gets

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.309 
for future reference when it gets
rebuilt<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.690> procedure<00:02:10.080> is

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
rebuilt and that that that procedure is

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.260 
rebuilt and that that that procedure is
all<00:02:10.470> fine

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
all fine

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.000 
all fine
everything<00:02:11.960> looks<00:02:12.140> quite<00:02:12.380> good<00:02:12.410> down<00:02:12.770> in<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
everything looks quite good down in the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.560 
everything looks quite good down in the
crankcase<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:15.730> actually<00:02:16.730> drained<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
crankcase and I actually drained the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.690 
crankcase and I actually drained the
crankcase<00:02:17.870> before<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.380> stripped<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:19.010> just

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
crankcase before I stripped it just

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.980 
crankcase before I stripped it just
thinking<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.390> there<00:02:20.570> might<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.840> problem

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
thinking that there might be a problem

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.720 
thinking that there might be a problem
with<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.350> scavenge<00:02:21.740> pump<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.190> gain<00:02:22.370> oil<00:02:22.580> to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
with the scavenge pump not gain oil to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.990 
with the scavenge pump not gain oil to
the<00:02:22.850> top-end<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.830> there<00:02:25.490> was<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> little

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
the top-end and and there was a little

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.480 
the top-end and and there was a little
oil<00:02:26.150> as<00:02:26.300> you'd<00:02:26.420> expect<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:28.040> not<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> lot

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
oil as you'd expect but but not a lot

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
oil as you'd expect but but not a lot
and<00:02:28.700> then<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.850> checked<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.090> food<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and then I checked the food to the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.630 
and then I checked the food to the
top-end<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.709> was<00:02:30.860> chugging<00:02:31.100> away<00:02:31.310> quite

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
top-end and it was chugging away quite

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.940 
top-end and it was chugging away quite
nicely<00:02:31.880> into<00:02:32.360> there<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:33.560> valves<00:02:33.860> were

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
nicely into there the valves were

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.410 
nicely into there the valves were
sealing<00:02:34.280> everything<00:02:34.370> else<00:02:34.760> was<00:02:34.910> fine<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.390> I

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
sealing everything else was fine so I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.940 
sealing everything else was fine so I
knew<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.720> had<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.870> be<00:02:35.990> something<00:02:36.260> further<00:02:36.620> down

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
knew it had to be something further down

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.000 
knew it had to be something further down
and<00:02:37.250> then<00:02:37.700> as<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.880> sail<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.150> stripping<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:39.010> it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
and then as a sail on stripping it it

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.150 
and then as a sail on stripping it it
was<00:02:40.220> quite<00:02:41.470> disappointing<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.590> find<00:02:42.830> out<00:02:42.980> what

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
was quite disappointing to find out what

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.680 
was quite disappointing to find out what
it<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.370> cuz<00:02:43.580> I'm<00:02:43.730> I'm<00:02:44.120> now<00:02:44.360> going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.630> be

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
it is cuz I'm I'm now going to be

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.199 
it is cuz I'm I'm now going to be
looking<00:02:44.900> at<00:02:45.350> either<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.830> new<00:02:46.760> piston<00:02:47.120> and

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
looking at either a new piston and

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.250 
looking at either a new piston and
barrel<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.690> rings<00:02:48.110> or<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:49.670> reborn<00:02:50.450> oversized

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
barrel and rings or a reborn oversized

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.620 
barrel and rings or a reborn oversized
piston<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:51.980> rings<00:02:52.220> I'm<00:02:52.520> just<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:53.239> sure<00:02:53.270> which

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
piston and rings I'm just not sure which

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.240 
piston and rings I'm just not sure which
the<00:02:53.959> best<00:02:54.290> course<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.590> action<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.890> going<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.160> be

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
the best course of action is going to be

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.270 
the best course of action is going to be
at<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.430> point<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.000> I'll<00:02:56.600> just<00:02:57.010> I'll<00:02:58.010> stop

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
at this point so I'll just I'll stop

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.949 
at this point so I'll just I'll stop

can see some light scoring in there

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.900 
can see some light scoring in there
which<00:03:39.799> was<00:03:39.980> ever<00:03:40.130> done<00:03:40.280> want<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.519> strip<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.760> the

which was ever done want to strip to the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.670 
which was ever done want to strip to the
first<00:03:41.120> time<00:03:41.299> around<00:03:41.450> but<00:03:41.600> it's<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.380> not

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
first time around but it's it's not

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.199 
first time around but it's it's not
actually<00:03:43.160> as<00:03:43.280> bad<00:03:43.430> as<00:03:43.579> it<00:03:43.700> looks<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.060> there

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
actually as bad as it looks and there

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.370 
actually as bad as it looks and there
you<00:03:44.269> can't<00:03:44.450> actually<00:03:44.660> feel<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:44.959> if<00:03:45.170> you<00:03:45.200> run

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
you can't actually feel that if you run

you can't actually feel that if you run
your<00:03:45.530> fingernail<00:03:45.920> over<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.459> it's<00:03:47.420> just<00:03:47.630> very

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
your fingernail over it it's just very

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.780 
your fingernail over it it's just very
light<00:03:48.079> scuff<00:03:48.410> marks<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:48.980> same<00:03:49.130> on<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.340> piston

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
light scuff marks and same on the piston

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.150 
light scuff marks and same on the piston
so<00:03:50.269> having<00:03:50.720> given<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.230> quick<00:03:51.590> check<00:03:51.829> over

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
so having given that a quick check over

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.780 
so having given that a quick check over
up<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.400> reassemble<00:03:53.030> doubt<00:03:53.209> however<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.440> back

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
up a reassemble doubt however the back

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.330 
up a reassemble doubt however the back
if<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.150> get<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.329> light<00:03:56.570> on<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.010> as<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.070> can

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
if I can get a light on that as you can

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.789 
if I can get a light on that as you can
see<00:03:58.640> there<00:03:58.910> looks<00:03:59.900> like<00:04:00.110> it's<00:04:00.290> been<00:04:00.470> through<00:04:00.709> a

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
see there looks like it's been through a

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.090 
see there looks like it's been through a
war<00:04:01.040> zone<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.510> it's<00:04:02.840> scuffed<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.530> pieces<00:04:03.950> and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
war zone and it's scuffed to pieces and

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.280 
war zone and it's scuffed to pieces and
it's<00:04:04.610> very<00:04:04.970> very<00:04:05.209> rough<00:04:05.480> as<00:04:05.660> well<00:04:05.840> if<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.110> run

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
it's very very rough as well if you run

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.660 
it's very very rough as well if you run
your<00:04:06.380> finger<00:04:06.739> over<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:07.160> you<00:04:07.250> can<00:04:07.430> really

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
your finger over that you can really

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.350 
your finger over that you can really
feel<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:09.350> piston<00:04:10.690> now<00:04:12.910> let's<00:04:13.910> try<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.269> get

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
feel it the piston now let's try and get

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.349 
feel it the piston now let's try and get
that<00:04:14.480> sort<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.840> lights<00:04:15.019> not<00:04:15.320> glaring<00:04:15.709> on<00:04:16.130> it

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
that sort of lights not glaring on it

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.460 
that sort of lights not glaring on it
but<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:18.140> is<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.440> offending<00:04:19.039> side<00:04:19.400> and

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
but this is the offending side and

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.650 
but this is the offending side and
as<00:04:21.829> you<00:04:21.950> can<00:04:22.100> see<00:04:22.280> it's<00:04:22.430> absolutely<00:04:22.660> scored

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
as you can see it's absolutely scored

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.130 
as you can see it's absolutely scored
two<00:04:23.870> pieces<00:04:24.640> no<00:04:25.640> good<00:04:25.820> whatsoever<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.570> the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
two pieces no good whatsoever and the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.980 
two pieces no good whatsoever and the
top<00:04:27.350> two<00:04:27.620> rings<00:04:27.950> have<00:04:28.610> welded<00:04:29.150> themselves

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
top two rings have welded themselves

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.790 
top two rings have welded themselves
into<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.320> grooves<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:32.480> one<00:04:32.660> thing<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.290> did

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
into the grooves and the one thing I did

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.130 
into the grooves and the one thing I did
notice<00:04:33.980> however<00:04:34.750> possibly<00:04:35.750> due<00:04:35.870> to<00:04:36.050> the

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
notice however possibly due to the

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.950 
notice however possibly due to the
welding<00:04:36.500> here<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.310> there<00:04:37.880> is<00:04:37.970> kind<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.690> moot

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
welding here and there is kind of a moot

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.110 
welding here and there is kind of a moot
point<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.500> pretty<00:04:39.680> irrelevant<00:04:39.920> now<00:04:40.370> but<00:04:40.610> they

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
point and pretty irrelevant now but they

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.000 
point and pretty irrelevant now but they
haven't<00:04:41.450> actually<00:04:41.900> rotated<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.620> realigned

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
haven't actually rotated and realigned

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.390 
haven't actually rotated and realigned
themselves<00:04:43.550> but<00:04:43.760> but<00:04:44.450> obviously<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:45.710> the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
themselves but but obviously the the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.760 
themselves but but obviously the the
welding<00:04:46.790> themselves<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.540> to<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.170> piston

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
welding themselves to the to the piston

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.810 
welding themselves to the to the piston
ring<00:04:48.920> grooves<00:04:49.130> is<00:04:49.310> not<00:04:49.490> going<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.670> help

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
ring grooves is not going to help

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.420 
ring grooves is not going to help
matters<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.810> that's<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.320> front<00:04:51.530> with<00:04:52.400> a

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
matters so that's the front with a

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.520 
matters so that's the front with a
little<00:04:52.730> more<00:04:52.880> scoring<00:04:53.240> than<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.570> had<00:04:53.780> when<00:04:54.470> I

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
little more scoring than it had when I

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.950 
little more scoring than it had when I
initially<00:04:54.950> put<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.370> back<00:04:55.520> together<00:04:55.960> although

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
initially put it back together although

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.980 
initially put it back together although
still<00:04:57.470> not<00:04:58.240> nothing<00:04:59.240> like<00:04:59.420> as<00:04:59.600> bad<00:04:59.720> as<00:04:59.870> the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
still not nothing like as bad as the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.940 
still not nothing like as bad as the
back<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:03.230> crown<00:05:03.500> there<00:05:03.770> with<00:05:03.920> a

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
back and and the crown there with a

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.770 
back and and the crown there with a
little<00:05:04.490> buildup<00:05:04.760> of<00:05:04.850> carbon<00:05:05.060> but<00:05:05.510> you<00:05:05.690> know

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
little buildup of carbon but you know

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.320 
little buildup of carbon but you know
nothing<00:05:06.500> too<00:05:06.710> bad<00:05:06.920> but<00:05:07.640> yeah<00:05:07.820> as<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.090> said

see close up of the nastiness there you
go<00:05:22.190> look<00:05:22.400> at<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.910> yeah<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.020> only
