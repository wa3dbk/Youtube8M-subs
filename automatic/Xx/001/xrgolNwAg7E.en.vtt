00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
also known as the VIN IAM is an element

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.569 
also known as the VIN IAM is an element
found<00:00:44.540> in<00:00:44.750> space<00:00:45.230> rock<00:00:45.530> on<00:00:45.739> both<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.129> map<00:00:46.280> shi

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
found in space rock on both the map shi

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.580 
found in space rock on both the map shi
no<00:00:46.699> numa<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.360> opening<00:00:47.809> sequence<00:00:48.020> of<00:00:48.410> the

no numa and the opening sequence of the
map<00:00:48.739> origin<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:49.520> essentially<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.089> properties

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
map origin so essentially the properties

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.140 
map origin so essentially the properties
of<00:00:50.510> element<00:00:50.870> 115<00:00:51.250> regenerate<00:00:52.250> dead<00:00:52.519> cell<00:00:52.879> with

of element 115 regenerate dead cell with

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.880 
of element 115 regenerate dead cell with
that<00:00:53.269> being<00:00:53.390> said<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.900> Nazis<00:00:54.290> tried<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.710> use

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
that being said the Nazis tried to use

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.770 
that being said the Nazis tried to use
this<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.280> their<00:00:55.370> advantage<00:00:55.489> in<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.269> war<00:00:56.480> so

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
this to their advantage in the war so

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.149 
this to their advantage in the war so
they<00:00:56.809> had<00:00:57.019> super<00:00:57.409> soldier<00:00:57.739> zombies<00:00:58.040> that

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
they had super soldier zombies that

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.680 
they had super soldier zombies that
could<00:00:58.280> take<00:00:58.370> tons<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.879> tons<00:00:59.000> of<00:00:59.150> bullets<00:00:59.480> and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
could take tons and tons of bullets and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.030 
could take tons and tons of bullets and
then<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.110> zombies<00:01:00.440> were<00:01:00.559> kind<00:01:00.769> of<00:01:00.890> the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
then the zombies were kind of the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.130 
then the zombies were kind of the
element<00:01:01.519> X<00:01:01.730> sleep<00:01:02.030> side<00:01:02.360> effect<00:01:02.690> if<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:02.960> will

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
element X sleep side effect if you will

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.960 
element X sleep side effect if you will
and<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.589> Nazis<00:01:03.920> were<00:01:04.070> unable<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.640> control

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
and so the Nazis were unable to control

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.910 
and so the Nazis were unable to control
this<00:01:05.119> life-changing<00:01:05.449> element<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.380> they<00:01:06.680> turn

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
this life-changing element and they turn

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.830 
this life-changing element and they turn
into<00:01:07.190> zombies<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.850> addition<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.570> element

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
into zombies in addition to that element

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.620 
into zombies in addition to that element
115<00:01:09.410> is<00:01:09.860> also<00:01:10.250> what<00:01:10.430> powers<00:01:10.820> all<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.420> perk

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
115 is also what powers all of the perk

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.510 
115 is also what powers all of the perk
machines<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.110> guys<00:01:12.229> see<00:01:12.440> in<00:01:12.560> zombies<00:01:12.979> alien

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
machines you guys see in zombies alien

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.730 
machines you guys see in zombies alien
wonder<00:01:13.910> weapons<00:01:14.270> like<00:01:14.660> wonder<00:01:15.080> waffle<00:01:15.259> the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
wonder weapons like wonder waffle the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.859 
wonder weapons like wonder waffle the
ray<00:01:15.920> gun<00:01:16.160> as<00:01:16.340> well<00:01:16.700> as<00:01:16.789> teleporting<00:01:17.509> systems

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
ray gun as well as teleporting systems

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.990 
ray gun as well as teleporting systems
and<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:18.289> it's<00:01:18.440> super<00:01:18.740> Opie<00:01:19.039> and<00:01:19.250> Richthofen<00:01:19.820> is

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
and so it's super Opie and Richthofen is

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.880 
and so it's super Opie and Richthofen is
trying<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.479> take<00:01:20.660> over<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.020> world<00:01:21.200> using<00:01:21.679> this

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
trying to take over the world using this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.529 
trying to take over the world using this
element<00:01:22.250> but<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:23.000> gets<00:01:23.240> me<00:01:23.360> super

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
element but this just gets me super

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:24.910 
element but this just gets me super
height<00:01:23.810> because<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.229> want<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.619> see<00:01:24.770> where

about zombies along with this code we
were<00:01:34.190> also<00:01:34.429> able<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.910> decipher<00:01:35.330> this<00:01:35.630> code

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
were also able to decipher this code

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.359 
were also able to decipher this code
right<00:01:35.899> over<00:01:36.350> here<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:36.830> this<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.100> actually

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
right over here and this is actually

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.609 
right over here and this is actually
despite<00:01:37.939> how<00:01:38.060> random<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.509> looks<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.960> specific

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
despite how random it looks a specific

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.920 
despite how random it looks a specific
coordinate<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.189> latitude<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.030> longitude<00:01:41.810> of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
Cairo Egypt so if we go to google maps

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.340 
Cairo Egypt so if we go to google maps
and<00:01:44.299> look<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.720> up<00:01:44.810> on<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.049> satellite

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
and look it up on a satellite
