00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
Rabbit is quite often on stage I thought

that<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.260> would<00:02:38.410> be<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.620> good<00:02:38.830> thing<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.340> do<00:02:39.490> so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
that that would be a good thing to do so

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.190 
that that would be a good thing to do so
