00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:18.020
 I will cook salted straw 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.650
 fresh zucchini young zucchini 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:26.090

 twigs here such currants dill 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:39.210
 Well, or fuck, I still have here 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:42.899
 for starters, I'll cut the zucchini then you can 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.030
 cut in half and take advantage of here 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:51.200
 such a float which basically you have 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.200
 I think everyone has 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.830
 it is desirable to prepare the preparation of zucchini 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.830
 without seeds 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:11.410
 now i will take the can 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.710
 Today such a liter jar I them 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:21.010
 15 minutes pre- styled lay out 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:25.510
 there all your herbs and spices are in order 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:29.500
 to make our flavors delicious 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.490
 zucchini garlic notice I do not clean it 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.490
 just snip 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:42.460
 dill can now add zucchini if 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:49.460
 would my pickle it could be cut 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.960
 here is such a straw but we would not then 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.910
 laid out here the greens we would have her 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.570
 placed in marinade supported there 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.810
 deleted 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.330
 and then it would be poured into a jar but since we 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.740
 Today we are making salted straw 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:07.750
 then it should be the largest so that later 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.750
 it was more convenient for you to get it out of the jar 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.870
 I spread everything in a jar 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:39.800
 now what i did i will add a half 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:43.540
 lemon juice if you fall there 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.790
 bone is absolutely okay 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.920
 you can even put so here a couple 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.050
 pieces for color for flavor so everything 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:01.420
 now I add some more garlic 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.420
 and other herbs 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.330
 now black pepper peas 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.350
 so how do we make salted we 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.420
 fill with cool brine so 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.410
 I can add more peppers somewhere 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:28.320
 about 15 pips from such a bowl I 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:32.020
 scout salt on such a jar she liter 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:37.060
 if we want to have something tomorrow 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.870
 add two tablespoons of salt hot 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.870
 water to stir 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:56.070
 Thatâ€™s absolutely nothing wrong 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.290
 if the salt is not dissolved it is literally 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:04.050
 after an hour and a half dissolve itself in 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.610
 jar add ordinary cold water 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.010
 if we leave him now with someone 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.680
 the temperature is literally for 2-3 hours 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.660
 just faces will be ready but if you 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.350
 take your time do you want to eat tomorrow or 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.390
 day after tomorrow 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:21.000
 then immediately refrigerate 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.000
 such zucchini are kept for up to 2 weeks
