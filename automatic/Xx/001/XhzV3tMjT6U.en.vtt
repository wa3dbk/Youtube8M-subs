00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
GMO foods is that there's still so much

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.909 
GMO foods is that there's still so much
unknown<00:00:05.100> since<00:00:05.490> it's<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.819> relatively<00:00:06.330> new

some<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.500> research<00:00:10.800> did<00:00:11.790> mention<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.240> we

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
some of the research did mention that we

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.610 
some of the research did mention that we
don't<00:00:12.570> really<00:00:12.780> we're<00:00:13.110> almost<00:00:13.320> playing

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
don't really we're almost playing

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.970 
don't really we're almost playing
Russian<00:00:14.099> roulette<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.820> our<00:00:15.480> own<00:00:15.719> bodies<00:00:16.560> if

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
Russian roulette with our own bodies if

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890 
Russian roulette with our own bodies if
you<00:00:17.220> see<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.670> think<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> key<00:00:18.750> out<00:00:18.869> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
you see I think this is the key out of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.080 
you see I think this is the key out of
all<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.289> it

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
all of it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.480 
all of it
genetically<00:00:21.090> engineered<00:00:21.210> seeds<00:00:22.490> cannot

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
genetically engineered seeds cannot

genetically engineered seeds cannot
replicate<00:00:23.789> themselves<00:00:24.470> that's<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> key<00:00:25.890> if

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
replicate themselves that's the key if

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.310 
replicate themselves that's the key if
they<00:00:26.609> could<00:00:26.820> replicate<00:00:27.060> themselves<00:00:27.539> Lord

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
they could replicate themselves Lord

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.310 
they could replicate themselves Lord

just a genetically modified wheat the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
just a genetically modified wheat the
wheat<00:01:02.219> today<00:01:02.340> has<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> lot<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.969> gluten<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
wheat today has a lot of gluten in it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.580 
wheat today has a lot of gluten in it
gluten<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.949> protein<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.610> found<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.030> wheat

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
gluten is the protein is found in wheat

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
gluten is the protein is found in wheat
that<00:01:07.590> gluten<00:01:08.430> has<00:01:08.610> two<00:01:08.880> things<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.299> can

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that gluten has two things that can

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.780 
that gluten has two things that can
cause<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> challenge<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.439> gluten<00:01:11.369> will<00:01:11.520> plug

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
cause a challenge with gluten will plug

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.630 
cause a challenge with gluten will plug
the<00:01:12.030> villi<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> intestines<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.369> little

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the villi in the intestines the little

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.210 
the villi in the intestines the little
villi<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.180> shaped<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.799> your

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
villi are shaped like this so your your

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.609 
villi are shaped like this so your your
intestines<00:01:17.790> cannot<00:01:18.060> absorb<00:01:18.420> minerals<00:01:19.409> for

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
intestines cannot absorb minerals for

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.550 
intestines cannot absorb minerals for
example<00:01:19.650> iron<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:21.180> gluten<00:01:21.810> also<00:01:22.200> being<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
example iron that gluten also being a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.810 
example iron that gluten also being a
protein<00:01:23.540> can<00:01:24.590> cause<00:01:25.590> reaction<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> body<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
protein can cause reaction the body and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.270 
protein can cause reaction the body and
someone<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.420> loose<00:01:27.750> stools<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:29.009> let's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
someone could have loose stools so let's

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770 
someone could have loose stools so let's
talk<00:01:29.369> about<00:01:29.430> celiac<00:01:29.970> disease<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> minute

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
so ice up a balloon with a digestive

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.250 
so ice up a balloon with a digestive
enzyme<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.650> whole<00:04:08.580> food<00:04:08.880> iron<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.990> liquid

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
reason I talk about the torpedo of death

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.110 
reason I talk about the torpedo of death
it<00:05:05.720> kills<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.200> liver<00:05:06.669> because<00:05:07.669> it<00:05:07.820> affects

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
the liver and the gallbladder so that is

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:19.810 
the liver and the gallbladder so that is
just<00:05:11.240> one<00:05:11.360> instance
