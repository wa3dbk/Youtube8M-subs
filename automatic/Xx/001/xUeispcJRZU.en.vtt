ever be a stylist in those times because

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.800 
ever be a stylist in those times because
you<00:02:43.820> kind<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.060> have<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.239> think<00:02:44.330> about<00:02:44.540> every

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
you kind of have to think about every

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.059 
you kind of have to think about every
single<00:02:45.050> aspect<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.590> I'm<00:02:45.650> not<00:02:45.769> very<00:02:45.830> good

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
single aspect so I'm not very good

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.190 
single aspect so I'm not very good
accessorizing<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.880> example<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:47.840> have

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
accessorizing for example I do have

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.559 
accessorizing for example I do have
quite<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:50.019> bit<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:52.370> really<00:02:52.670> straightforward<00:02:53.000> way

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
quite a bit a really straightforward way

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.690 
quite a bit a really straightforward way
of<00:02:53.690> thinking<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.920> like<00:02:55.100> very<00:02:55.340> kind<00:02:55.640> of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
of thinking and I like very kind of

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.960 
of thinking and I like very kind of
simple<00:02:56.950> silhouettes<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.280> nines<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.819> things

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
simple silhouettes and nines and things

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.540 
simple silhouettes and nines and things
of<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.569> think<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.930> more<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.620> get<00:03:01.250> older

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
of that and I think the more I get older

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.100 
of that and I think the more I get older
the<00:03:01.640> more<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.910> can<00:03:02.209> spend<00:03:02.450> time<00:03:02.690> thinking<00:03:02.720> about

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
the more I can spend time thinking about

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.930 
the more I can spend time thinking about
what<00:03:03.380> does<00:03:03.890> take<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.160> lot<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.370> time<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.610> mean<00:03:04.850> you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
what does take a lot of time I mean you

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.850 
what does take a lot of time I mean you
can't<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.360> same<00:03:05.420> thing<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.870> do<00:03:06.049> in<00:03:06.410> 25

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
can't do the same thing you do in 25

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.540 
can't do the same thing you do in 25
minutes<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.579> do<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.760> buy<00:03:07.940> minutes<00:03:08.269> try
