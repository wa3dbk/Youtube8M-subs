make sure that you add very little by
little<00:01:29.539> water<00:01:29.920> because<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.399> dough<00:01:31.640> has<00:01:31.939> to

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
little water because this dough has to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.149 
little water because this dough has to
be<00:01:32.270> semi<00:01:32.509> soft<00:01:32.840> otherwise<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.500> kachoris<00:01:33.799> will

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
be semi soft otherwise the kachoris will

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.109 
be semi soft otherwise the kachoris will
not<00:01:34.340> turn<00:01:34.549> out<00:01:34.700> well

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
not turn out well

and also the other thing is that the
kotori's<00:04:53.680> will<00:04:53.830> not<00:04:54.009> fluff<00:04:54.340> up<00:04:54.550> roll<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.479> into

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
kotori's will not fluff up roll it into

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.490 
kotori's will not fluff up roll it into
a<00:04:55.840> two<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.229> half<00:04:56.409> inch<00:04:56.740> sized<00:04:57.280> kachori<00:04:58.060> and

a two and a half inch sized kachori and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.439 
a two and a half inch sized kachori and
now<00:04:59.500> we<00:04:59.889> will<00:04:59.979> slightly<00:05:00.280> just<00:05:00.819> hold<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.270> and

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
now we will slightly just hold it and

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.379 
now we will slightly just hold it and
give<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.930> small<00:05:02.560> press<00:05:02.919> in<00:05:03.099> the<00:05:03.250> center<00:05:03.389> now

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
give it a small press in the center now

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.909 
give it a small press in the center now
we<00:05:04.449> will<00:05:04.569> keep<00:05:04.690> this<00:05:04.870> aside<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.470> in<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.680> same

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
we will keep this aside and in the same

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.920 
we will keep this aside and in the same
way<00:05:06.159> we'll<00:05:06.400> make<00:05:06.520> two<00:05:06.819> more<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:07.240> we'll<00:05:07.720> fry

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
way we'll make two more and we'll fry

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.379 
way we'll make two more and we'll fry
three<00:05:08.229> together<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:09.460> our<00:05:09.580> three<00:05:09.789> kotori's<00:05:10.240> are

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
three together so our three kotori's are

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.330 
three together so our three kotori's are
rolled<00:05:10.599> out<00:05:10.719> now<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.229> we<00:05:11.740> will<00:05:11.830> start<00:05:12.069> frying

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
rolled out now and we will start frying

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.459 
rolled out now and we will start frying
