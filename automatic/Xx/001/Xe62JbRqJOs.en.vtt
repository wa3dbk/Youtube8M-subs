00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
stabilization and on paper that seems

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.010 
stabilization and on paper that seems
really<00:02:47.340> great<00:02:47.490> but<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.240> practice<00:02:48.600> i<00:02:48.750> found

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
really great but in practice i found

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.720 
really great but in practice i found
this<00:02:49.140> camera<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.860> most<00:02:49.980> disappointing

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
this camera to be the most disappointing

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.160 
this camera to be the most disappointing
thing<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.270> phone<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.930> really

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
thing about this phone and it's really

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.990 
thing about this phone and it's really
the<00:02:52.290> most<00:02:52.440> disappointing<00:02:52.980> camera<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.700> all<00:02:53.850> of

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
the most disappointing camera of all of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.750 
the most disappointing camera of all of
2013<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.050> i've<00:02:55.200> used<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.890> camera<00:02:56.190> itself<00:02:56.280> is

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
2013 that i've used the camera itself is

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.370 
2013 that i've used the camera itself is
capable<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.300> taking<00:02:57.540> some<00:02:57.900> pretty<00:02:58.170> decent

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
capable of taking some pretty decent

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.230 
capable of taking some pretty decent
shots<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> problem<00:02:59.670> comes<00:02:59.850> when<00:03:00.060> you

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
shots but the problem comes when you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.730 
shots but the problem comes when you
actually<00:03:00.390> try<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.750> get<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.170> shot<00:03:01.410> there

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
actually try to get the shot there

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.290 
actually try to get the shot there
really<00:03:01.980> seems<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.460> something<00:03:02.850> wrong<00:03:03.060> with

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
really seems to be something wrong with

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.970 
really seems to be something wrong with
the<00:03:03.420> software<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.080> takes<00:03:04.290> way<00:03:04.530> too<00:03:04.560> long<00:03:04.770> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
the software it takes way too long to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.890 
the software it takes way too long to
get<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.370> focus<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.940> grab<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.240> shot<00:03:06.540> when<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
get in focus and grab a shot when you

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.270 
get in focus and grab a shot when you
pull<00:03:07.110> out<00:03:07.140> your<00:03:07.320> phone<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.620> take<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.800> shot<00:03:08.040> it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
pull out your phone to take a shot it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.980 
pull out your phone to take a shot it
just<00:03:08.460> doesn't<00:03:08.790> work<00:03:08.910> as<00:03:09.090> fast<00:03:09.360> as<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.720> should

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
just doesn't work as fast as it should

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.420 
just doesn't work as fast as it should
and<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.230> lot<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.440> times<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.830> missed<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.220> moment

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and a lot of times you missed the moment

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.190 
and a lot of times you missed the moment
even<00:03:12.000> after<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.240> thought<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.570> had<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> shot<00:03:12.930> in

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
even after I thought I had a shot in

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.660 
even after I thought I had a shot in
focus<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.770> would<00:03:13.860> take<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.130> shot<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.550> would

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
focus and would take the shot it would

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.670 
focus and would take the shot it would
not<00:03:14.850> be<00:03:14.910> in<00:03:15.300> focus<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.870> there<00:03:16.050> was<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.440> ton

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
not be in focus and there was just a ton

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.710 
not be in focus and there was just a ton
of<00:03:16.710> issues<00:03:17.160> with<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.430> software<00:03:17.820> overall<00:03:18.510> like

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
of issues with the software overall like

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.060 
of issues with the software overall like
I<00:03:18.810> said<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.110> still<00:03:19.380> camera<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.800> really

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
I said the still camera is really

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.710 
I said the still camera is really
disappointing<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> software<00:03:21.570> is

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
disappointing and that software is

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.330 
disappointing and that software is
really<00:03:22.170> what's<00:03:22.350> killing<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.800> right<00:03:22.830> now<00:03:22.980> on

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
really what's killing it right now on

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.770 
really what's killing it right now on
the<00:03:23.459> video<00:03:23.700> side<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.030> things<00:03:24.180> however<00:03:24.420> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the video side of things however the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.030 
the video side of things however the
camera<00:03:25.050> does<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.380> optical<00:03:25.739> image

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
camera does have optical image

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.740 
camera does have optical image

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
the video looked pretty good there was

the video looked pretty good there was
nothing<00:03:30.000> really<00:03:30.120> wrong<00:03:30.270> with<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.900> colors

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170

nothing really wrong with it the colors
were<00:03:31.380> okay<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.310> was<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.550> an<00:03:32.670> average

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
were okay and it was just an average

were okay and it was just an average
camera<00:03:33.450> but<00:03:33.840> one<00:03:33.989> thing<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.200> really<00:03:34.470> stood

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
camera but one thing that really stood

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.620 
camera but one thing that really stood
out<00:03:34.860> about<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.310> camera<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.060> microphones

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
out about this camera is the microphones

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.360 
out about this camera is the microphones
the<00:03:36.870> microphones<00:03:37.320> were<00:03:37.470> incredibly<00:03:38.130> good

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
the microphones were incredibly good

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.860 
the microphones were incredibly good
very<00:03:38.760> sharp<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.300> really<00:03:39.420> high<00:03:39.660> fidelity

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
very sharp and really high fidelity

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.750 
very sharp and really high fidelity
though<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.800> camera<00:03:41.190> software<00:03:41.400> was

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
though the camera software was

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.130 
though the camera software was
disappointing<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.570> doesn't<00:03:42.900> mean<00:03:43.020> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
disappointing that doesn't mean the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.260 
disappointing that doesn't mean the
entire<00:03:43.290> software<00:03:43.800> suite<00:03:44.310> was<00:03:44.520> disappointing

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
entire software suite was disappointing

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.780 
entire software suite was disappointing
this<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.630> running<00:03:45.900> Android<00:03:46.170> 4.4<00:03:46.830> KitKat<00:03:47.010> which

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
iteration and I have to say it is the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.120 
iteration and I have to say it is the
best<00:03:51.330> version<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.900> Android<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.380> date<00:03:52.560> no<00:03:52.890> doubt

best version of Android to date no doubt

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.979 
best version of Android to date no doubt
really<00:03:53.610> what<00:03:53.730> Google<00:03:53.970> did<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.300> just<00:03:54.480> refine

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
really what Google did was just refine

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.900 
really what Google did was just refine
the<00:03:55.170> OS<00:03:55.470> even<00:03:55.860> more<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.250> update<00:03:56.580> some<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.820> the
