going to be a little different length

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.020 
going to be a little different length
because<00:06:45.300> it's<00:06:45.510> hard<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:46.400> leave<00:06:47.400> the<00:06:47.790> same

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
because it's hard to leave the same

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.990 
because it's hard to leave the same
amount<00:06:48.420> each<00:06:48.630> time<00:06:48.690> so<00:06:49.440> if<00:06:50.100> you<00:06:50.250> want<00:06:50.460> all<00:06:50.790> your
