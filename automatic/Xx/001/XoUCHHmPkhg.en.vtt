until<00:04:18.790> what<00:04:19.790> from<00:04:20.000> just<00:04:20.450> doing<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.810> eye<00:04:20.840> back

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
until what from just doing the eye back

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.190 
until what from just doing the eye back
up<00:04:21.919> or<00:04:22.280> what<00:04:22.550> from<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:23.570> end<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.840> dubbing

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
up or what from the end of the dubbing

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.650 
up or what from the end of the dubbing
bark<00:04:24.470> down<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.669> create<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:25.970> tipper<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.419> I

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
bark down so you create a tipper and I

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.270 
bark down so you create a tipper and I
basically<00:04:30.850> that's<00:04:31.850> it

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
basically that's it

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.970 
basically that's it
ridiculously<00:04:34.270> basic<00:04:34.840> will<00:04:35.410> do<00:04:35.560> is<00:04:35.650> ride<00:04:35.860> all

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
ridiculously basic will do is ride all
