00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
I look I think I don't think it was

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
think it was clear when the kindle was

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.099 
think it was clear when the kindle was
lower<00:00:29.880> when<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> window<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> ipad<00:00:30.840> slot

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
was going to the apple ii reader so what

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920 
was going to the apple ii reader so what
this<00:00:35.160> watch<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.510> its<00:00:36.660> ultimate

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
this watch will be and what its ultimate

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.139 
this watch will be and what its ultimate
uses<00:00:37.469> will<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.219> our<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.610> reasonable

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
uses will be I think our it's reasonable

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.970 
uses will be I think our it's reasonable
to<00:00:39.180> question<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.559> think<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:40.860> we

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to question that and I think when we

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
to question that and I think when we
look<00:00:41.010> back<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.270> happened<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.989> those

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
look back at what happened with those

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.660 
look back at what happened with those
earlier<00:00:43.530> launches<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.280> start<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> see

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
earlier launches we can start to see

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
earlier launches we can start to see
that<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.480> at<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.809> happened<00:00:46.289> when

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that if you look at what happened when

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
that if you look at what happened when
the<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.219> iPhone<00:00:47.850> came<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.660> initial

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the first iPhone came out the initial

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.700 
the first iPhone came out the initial
sales<00:00:49.320> were<00:00:49.940> robust<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.020> drop<00:00:52.559> in

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
sales were robust but you know a drop in

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.889 
sales were robust but you know a drop in
the<00:00:52.739> bucket<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.280> what<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.520> were<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the bucket of what we were to see in the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.369 
the bucket of what we were to see in the
later<00:00:55.110> years<00:00:55.730> similarly<00:00:56.840> once<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.050> business

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
later years similarly once the business

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
later years similarly once the business
had<00:00:58.530> been<00:00:58.559> built<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.280> around<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.090> ipod<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
had been built up around the ipod and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
had been built up around the ipod and
the<00:01:01.350> iphone<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:02.579> didn't<00:01:03.000> seem<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.270> even

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the iphone it didn't seem like even

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.600 
the iphone it didn't seem like even
after<00:01:04.049> its<00:01:04.290> first<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> second<00:01:05.159> year<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
after its first and second year that the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
after its first and second year that the
ipad<00:01:05.790> numbers<00:01:06.780> were<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> big

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
ipad numbers were going to be that big

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.490 
ipad numbers were going to be that big
that<00:01:08.130> took<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> few<00:01:08.790> years<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.140> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
that took a few years as well so I I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
that took a few years as well so I I
don't<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> first<00:01:11.760> year<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.330> telling

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
don't think the first year is telling

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.359 
don't think the first year is telling
really<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> matter<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.830> lot<00:01:14.100> when<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
really is going to matter a lot when it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.450 
really is going to matter a lot when it
bites<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> Apple<00:01:15.479> watch<00:01:15.990> Cory<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.220> this

closet so I you know I think the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.190 
closet so I you know I think the
question<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.180> functionality<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.080> this

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
question is functionality and this

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.450 
question is functionality and this
really<00:02:26.380> gets<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.710> what<00:02:26.860> Tim<00:02:27.040> Cook<00:02:27.220> talked

they don't really know what people are
going<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.410> do<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.500> they<00:02:32.770> have<00:02:32.920> their<00:02:33.130> sessions

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
going to do is they have their sessions

there will be a challenge for them to
keep<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.250> functionality<00:02:57.730> i<00:02:57.880> think<00:02:58.060> that's

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
keep this a functionality i think that's

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.270 
keep this a functionality i think that's
