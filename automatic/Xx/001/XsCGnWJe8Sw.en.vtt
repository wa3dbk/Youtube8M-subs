00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.129
 obviously things 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.150
 let's go and double small is a sweater 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.980
 much thicker 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.810
 we reach the end you see 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.910
 here the ropes come out so it's really 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 evident the system from the blind e 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.910
 durable and the ropes on the surface 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.870
 when via vetera however it takes on a 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.840
 vertical position you see things there 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.120
 below how they attacked then wants to 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.550
 say that a rope sees the stockings in the sea 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.540
 the other obviously being free one is 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.940
 riser 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.460
 I don't know if the gentlemen are here will open 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.440
 right side and very true look at the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.070
 source left side a moment of 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.699
 patience 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.589
 look at the water as the rebel one of the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.390
 32 underground rivers one of the 32 c 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.540
 tricolor of the sea closed 6 meters of 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.000
 more mouth depth with a we are at 12 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.160
 imagine how there was a night downstairs 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.729
 fountain that like a force 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.490
 awesome flips upwards 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.390
 the icy water that dissolves the sea 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.940
 boiling red gera recycles citro galeso 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.310
 which has nothing to do with the river 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.920
 galeso that is there under the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.840
 overpass in a river so mentioned by 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.690
 these ancient as raids as of the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.360
 lily so you get areas to guarantee 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.840
 to find inspiration from proximity 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.899
 of the river this site sees sousse e 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.259
 I repeat, these are two things totally 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.790
 separated 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.190
 imagine yourself in 32 very kind 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 give the spaces for the first to the second 0 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.290
 closed sea know that these 32 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.940
 are those surveyed and poured into 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.340
 more cubic meters of fresh water 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.130
 we know exactly where the come from 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.930
 precise source there are many others that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.280
 they are not active throughout the year of quintones 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.280
 have been registered
