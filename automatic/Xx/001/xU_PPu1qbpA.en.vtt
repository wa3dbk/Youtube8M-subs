egg<00:00:04.490> okay<00:00:05.490> few<00:00:05.730> lines<00:00:06.029> but<00:00:06.330> long<00:00:06.569> line<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:07.170> we

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
egg okay few lines but long line so we

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.400 
egg okay few lines but long line so we
have<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.649> win<00:00:07.830> today<00:00:08.099> from<00:00:08.490> over<00:00:08.730> there<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.410> we

have to win today from over there and we
will<00:00:10.590> fly<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.509> compensating<00:00:12.509> your

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
will fly with some compensating your

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.129 
will fly with some compensating your
angle<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.620> blade<00:00:13.920> will<00:00:14.130> not<00:00:14.280> fly<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.580> way

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
angle so the blade will not fly this way

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
angle so the blade will not fly this way
flight<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.470> way<00:00:16.680> now<00:00:17.220> sis<00:00:17.460> counting<00:00:17.850> Leon

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
normal to do all the rudder test to make

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.840 
normal to do all the rudder test to make
sure<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.530> working<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.340> also<00:02:56.520> we<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:56.820> a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
sure it's working and also we do a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.010 
sure it's working and also we do a
camera<00:02:57.210> test<00:02:57.540> before<00:02:58.460> we<00:02:59.460> turn<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.450> plane<00:03:00.690> now

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
camera test before we turn the plane now

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.710 
camera test before we turn the plane now
it's<00:03:01.740> taking<00:03:02.100> pictures<00:03:02.880> from<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.300> lot<00:03:03.510> but

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
it's taking pictures from you a lot but

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.290 
it's taking pictures from you a lot but
unsharp<00:03:04.290> you're<00:03:04.500> too<00:03:04.770> close<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.090> camera

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
unsharp you're too close to the camera

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.800 
unsharp you're too close to the camera
and<00:03:06.950> why<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.250> take<00:03:08.460> off<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:09.480> good<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and why do the take off it's good to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.200 
and why do the take off it's good to
take<00:03:10.530> off<00:03:10.740> against<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.310> wind<00:03:11.490> direction<00:03:11.640> and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
take off against the wind direction and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:22.760 
take off against the wind direction and
then<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.570> can<00:03:12.750> see<00:03:12.960> how<00:03:13.230> fast<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.550> climbs<00:03:21.770> now

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
then you can see how fast it climbs now

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.750 
then you can see how fast it climbs now
I'm<00:03:22.980> switched<00:03:23.430> already<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.210> autopilot<00:03:24.780> and
