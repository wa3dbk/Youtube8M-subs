 laical store 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.949

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.949
 because the vale 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.760
 we will start with your skills your 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.010
 passive called an acquired taste 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.720
 an accumulation can also be applied 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.250
 of a taste acquired to all 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.680
 enemies that hits with their attacks 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.419
 basic or damage abilities after 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.930
 3 accumulations can apply different 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.360
 effects on the rest of his abilities 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.949
 we continue with his tongue that also 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.989
 immobilize for a short time while 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.339
 we give a lick tongue 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.309
 stop once you reach your goal 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.470
 damaging and slowing down if it is thrown 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.329
 lick with the three accumulations of 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.059
 the passive on an enemy champion what 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.610
 will study instead of slowing down your 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.989
 w called to devour samkange swallows 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.969
 briefly to your goal 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.760
 the enemies suffer a percentage of their 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.859
 maximum life as magical damage as they can 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.649
 to be seeing can swallow so many 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.140
 Allied subjects and enemy champions 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.330
 when tank ntx devours a subject 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.680
 with our enemy can reactivate the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.050
 ability to discover them in the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.670
 direction of a target including damage 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.860
 in whatever it is that impacts 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.899
 when ntx tank devours a champion 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.549
 ally makes it immune to damage and good 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.460
 additional movement speed when 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.369
 they go 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.140
 enemy champions both tanks as his 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.150
 edible ally can decide the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.770
 moment in which the devoured can 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.289
 abandon tanks 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.810
 when it devours enemy champions only 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.390
 You can do it when you have three 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.159
 accumulations of the passive when this 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.960
 pass your movement speed you see 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.009
 drastically reduced when the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.509
 enemy champions are in your belly 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.759
 these will suffer a great reduction of 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.000
 vision something similar to the smoke bomb 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.250
 of creeps we continue with your hard skin 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.959
 has a passive and an active the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.149
 passive so all the damage received 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.399
 is turned into gray life in 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.140
 ending the fight the gray life decays 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.509
 to heal it a percentage of the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.269
 amount of gray life that has won and the 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.040
 active also makes your 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.099
 gray life in a shield that falling 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.590
 quickly we finish with his last 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.720
 visual journey we also have a passive 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.950
 and a passive entity makes all of its 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.220
 hurt 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.230
 scale according to your maximum life and active 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.150
 It will also be an ally and it is very 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.849
 lonely can move an area of 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.400
 map along with your ally something akin to 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.250
 the ultimate of twisted page but with the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.330
 utility that you can move an ally 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.610
 as summoner spells we will take 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.599
 exhausted and flash to make sure of the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.610
 late game 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.950
 if we want to win the line we will take 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.069
 night and flash tank ntx is truly a 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.030
 character with hard skin so you have to 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.610
 carry life marks 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.670
 in armor seals glyphs of 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.770
 magic resistance and the 5 essences of 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.230
 life in master's degrees we will take a dye 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.720
 921 prioritizing the recovery tree 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.150
 to have that extra life we ​​will begin 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.819
 prioritizing the cv followed by the wy 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.310
 finally the obviously maximizing us 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.620
 the erreka that is available 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.360
 we'll start with the relic shield 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.920
 potions and the trinquet the shield and 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.620
 relics will become face of the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.230
 mountain followed by the boots of 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.300
 mobility and the obvious stone that 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.910
 will become the ruby of vision after 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.519
 of this we will continue for what is already just 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.950
 and from now on the items will be 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.540
 they become very situational we can choose 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:39.300
 for a randín the reliquary of the solari 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.160
 of iron and spiritual appearance there 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.459
 many other items 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.950
 that we can by which we can choose 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.519
 to build us for example the uar 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.610
 mod 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.590
 or the spine mail is really this 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.560
 of the items is quite situational 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.390
 It depends a lot on the game and what it is 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.459
 what our team needs in that 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.160
 moment we are going to focus on the role 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.290
 tompkins main the support what 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.870
 which also makes a great support is 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.269
 unparalleled ability to save their 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.190
 shooters his main role consists of 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.019
 stay stuck to your lane mate 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.630
 to keep him safe if the enemy 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.090
 manages to slow down or stun your ally 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.739
 he simply devours it before jumping 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.750
 to a safe place 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.940
 This effect lasts longer than most 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.010
 the mass control skills well 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.500
 that even if the enemy gets 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.930
 catch your shooter in a perfect way 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.900
 it will also have positioned it outside of 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.340
 danger not only if it came to 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.160
 end in the middle of the attacks 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.480
 enemies during your escape the passive of 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.670
 the e 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.770
 it offers a lot of life regeneration 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.750
 Lastly even if the enemy team 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.090
 opt for the exchange in the lane 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.640
 you can also direct your attention to 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.830
 enemy with more punch to tear 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.800
 those with their passive before devouring them and 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.680
 create a though temporary 2 scene 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.780
 against 1 in its incredible versatility 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.870
 it also shines brightly in the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.370
 ambushes in addition to being able to offer their 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.060
 allied a protection in the ambushes 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.680
 enemy also means that it follows 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.020
 being very useful in the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.300
 ambushes of your allies is also 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.410
 You can use your definitive with your jungle 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.790
 to make a very effective ambush 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.100
 tactics like this one can also be 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.650
 applied on neutral objectives to 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.620
 use your definitive in the company of the clergy 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.740
 ally tank ntx can relocate with 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.620
 enormous speed to take the baron or 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.780
 even the dragon and do in fights 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.090
 of equipment really is very simple when 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.010
 the fight starts to unfold 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.680
 observe carefully how they are going 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.520
 decreasing the life bars for 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.680
 encourage them 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.960
 with a lot of damage that should be approaching 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.509
 quick lick base or for 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.490
 stun them and that's also been 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.259
 busy using his auto attacks the 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.710
 positioning is the key in these 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.659
 cases really if you can place yourself between 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.400
 the enemies you will find in the place 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:05.250
 perfect to disperse rivals 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.500
 more powerful to use hard skin as a shield 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.870
 to absorb the damage will keep the tank 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.759
 Enzo with enough life to complete 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.830
 the accumulations of the passive to 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.990
 set aside a powerful enemy from a fight 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.610
 even if he manages to do it for a few 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.889
 how many seconds can influence the 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.479
 course of the battle by allowing their 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.270
 allies end up with the enemy team 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.580
 shortly before you can throw up your 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.919
 rival 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.169
 up to here the video today I hope you 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.120
 I liked it very much and if it was not 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.460

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.759
