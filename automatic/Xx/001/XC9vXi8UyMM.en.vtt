00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.370
 hello friends we shop again 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.250
 bike rider and share with you today 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.440
 very important information many ask 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.410
 questions how to choose a bike 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.780
 growth there are two measurement systems 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.520
 cloud sizes and any for example you 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.710
 can see the table you see 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.530
 on screen if you want to study more 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.950
 You can follow the link in detail. 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.170
 video 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.860
 this table can help you choose 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.750
 bicycle 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.030
 if you buy it online 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.839
 the store but if you come to the store 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.820
 I personally will reveal the secret of how to choose 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.760
 bike on the spot most 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.460
 proven way to measure it 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.429
 the bike is already here for you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.069
 bike and if the bike suits you 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.199
 in terms of growth, then between the general should 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:57.420
 stay five centimeters somehow 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.579
 very easy to check three four fingers 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.039
 palm is just the right distance 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.090
 here may not even check as I 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.650
 almost sitting on the frame lets me go 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.320
 episcopate let's look at another 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.540
 catch a great bike for example 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.049
 German company gum repeat the procedure 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.079
 then my leg 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.829
 stored on the frame and check the distance 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.539
 that's fine just 45 centimeters between 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.840
 my wounds 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.250
 there is here and therefore we have chosen correctly 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.640
 bike by height and by case 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.740
 extreme braking 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.300
 suddenly you have to face sepeda you're not 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.320
 take your time and stay 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.110
 Skrynnik and well worth adjust the height 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.530
 the seats are very easy for this omit 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.780
 this pedal 10 mg per seat is necessary 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.090
 deal in giving the toe are not pirates 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.950
 his example of such a position in this 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.970
 case of seeing my leg is pretty 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.390
 strongly 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.340
 it is well to be drawn here 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.950
 attention to position 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.680
 bending colleagues this case with flexibly 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.509
 free strong is wrong but if 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.789
 would we have a leg almost straight 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.789
 this would also be wrong because in 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.790
 such position and sliska to tighten muscles 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.130
 aha leg bent pretty strong 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.380
 tension and you get tired of them quickly 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.730
 correct position when the leg is slightly 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.530
 bent at the knee 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.440
 in this position the muscles work 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.840
 the full cycle goes right and you 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.459
 feel comfortable throughout 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.800
 all your white walks 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.390
 at this bike rather whether the family 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.030
 disk 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.130
 when raising I want to draw your attention 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.310
 what is awesome there 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.650
 so almost horizontally if too 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.140
 the way up then the teddy is comfortable and you 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.540
 may be injured if the seat 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.030
 dropped down that time of year you can 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.600
 slide with a seat professionals 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.420
 say that about 6 degrees 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.220
 tilt forward like that at all 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.230
 clear so choose 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.410
 bikes we don't know come in 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.930
 shop, and we will help you choose for yourself 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.880
 personally for you, this we ourselves 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.620
 I already picked up with you 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.620
 melting in May
