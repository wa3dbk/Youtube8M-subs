all<00:01:57.350> right<00:01:57.770> spot<00:01:58.340> let's<00:01:58.700> do<00:01:59.000> a<00:02:01.630> 1<00:02:03.100> plus<00:02:04.100> 2<00:02:04.490> I

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
all right spot let's do a 1 plus 2 I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:23.410 
all right spot let's do a 1 plus 2 I
spot<00:02:05.780> spot<00:02:06.290> 1<00:02:07.220> &amp;<00:02:07.370> 2

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.970 

what's<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.569> square<00:02:24.840> root<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.319> 20<00:02:27.800> plus<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
what's the square root of 20 plus the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.949 
what's the square root of 20 plus the
square<00:02:29.099> root<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.489> 20<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.090> think<00:02:30.269> he's<00:02:30.629> trying<00:02:30.870> to

square root of 20 I think he's trying to

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.670 
square root of 20 I think he's trying to
fool<00:02:31.230> us<00:02:31.260> what's<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.769> square<00:02:32.010> root<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.580> 20<00:02:33.030> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
fool us what's the square root of 20 I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.630 
fool us what's the square root of 20 I
don't<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.769> think<00:02:34.860> he's<00:02:35.069> trying<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.430> fool
