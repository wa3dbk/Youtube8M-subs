one<00:01:51.450> technique<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.049> use<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.439> called<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> flying

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
one technique I use is called the flying

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.639 
one technique I use is called the flying
come<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.340> go<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:54.060> front<00:01:54.329> knee<00:01:54.649> you're

can rest down like this
I<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.820> balance<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:06.470> second<00:02:07.470> strategy<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.220> may

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
I can balance a second strategy you may
