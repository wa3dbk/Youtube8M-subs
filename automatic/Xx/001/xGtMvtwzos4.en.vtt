00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.109
 pfs 105 is flexible and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.470
 mobile system with electronic 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.750
 air volume adjustment 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.650
 due to the low weight of the sprayer you 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.200
 can perform 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.880
 overhead spray is much longer and 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.730
 simpler 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.050
 air hose over 3 meters long 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.930
 provides exceptional freedom 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.890
 movement and comfort when doing work 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.890
 in different positions 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.730

 you can install the sprayer on 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.740
 base tool cover 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.170
 pull out and connect the cable 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.120
 the tool can be easy and convenient 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.120
 move to the right place of work 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.410
 you have completed the preparatory work 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 according to menu item 2, runoff speed 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 sprayed material complies 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.440
 pre-set paint 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.890
 diluted adjustment is performed 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.500
 paint consumption and nozzle position now 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.780
 can get to work turn on 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.450
 uniform application tool 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.820
 paint sprayer should be kept 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.150
 perpendicular and on the same 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.770
 distance of 5 15 centimeters by about 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.290
 palm width from the selected object 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.650
 try to drive the tool evenly 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.930
 from left to right or top to bottom cycling 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.800
 and not the wrists as a whole 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.360
 forearm 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.940
 start and end the process 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.030
 spraying outside the application surface 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.700
 note applied layers should 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.250
 overlap by about 45 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.950
 centimeters when spraying 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.460
 do not interrupt or allow deviations 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.460
 tool 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 electronic adjustment of air volume 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.870
 allows you to regulate the resulting 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.430
 when spraying colorful mist when 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.100
 spraying liquid flowing materials 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.740
 set the switch to the lower stage 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.360
 each time with a step increase 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.870
 paint application will occur 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.870
 faster 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.180
 ink control system 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.180
 4-speed 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.489
 in the case of short 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.220
 work interruptions you can set 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.220
 pfs 105 e parking position 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.150
 You can use a spray bottle with 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.400
 larger capacities for this 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.740
 replace her short feed tube with 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.700
 long and fit practical 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.620
 support extension 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.360
 so that the sprayer can 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.450
 install with large volume 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.450
 containers 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.380
 thanks to the convenient store system 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.960
 simple winding is provided and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.960
