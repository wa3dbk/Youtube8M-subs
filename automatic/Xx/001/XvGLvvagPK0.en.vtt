00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
and could not find one anywhere so I

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.080 
and could not find one anywhere so I
decided<00:02:08.740> we're<00:02:08.979> just<00:02:09.100> going<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.250> improvise<00:02:09.729> a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
decided we're just going to improvise a

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.520 
decided we're just going to improvise a
new<00:02:10.479> version<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:12.070> with<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.610> combined<00:02:13.530> fact

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
new version so with the combined fact

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.080 
new version so with the combined fact
that<00:02:14.740> we're<00:02:14.860> not<00:02:14.980> using<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.400> st.<00:02:15.610> workbench

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
that we're not using the st. workbench

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.230 
that we're not using the st. workbench
and<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:17.380> drawer<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:18.070> came<00:02:18.610> up<00:02:18.940> with<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.120> pretty

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
and the drawer I came up with a pretty

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.390 
and the drawer I came up with a pretty
different<00:02:19.570> way<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.810> doing<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:20.530> few<00:02:21.070> different

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
different way of doing a few different

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.770 
different way of doing a few different
things<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.390> major<00:02:22.710> thrust<00:02:23.710> of<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.070> is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
things and the major thrust of this is

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.870 
things and the major thrust of this is
that<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.020> don't<00:02:26.950> want<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.160> damage<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.790> any

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
that I don't want to damage this in any

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.970 
that I don't want to damage this in any
way<00:02:28.000> because<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:30.870> want<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.930> return<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.410> however

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
way because I want to return it however

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.860 
way because I want to return it however
I<00:02:33.130> still<00:02:33.370> want<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.640> use<00:02:34.030> this<00:02:34.180> project<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.840> I

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
I still want to use this project and I

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.570 
I still want to use this project and I
thought<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:35.709> why<00:02:35.800> not<00:02:35.950> come<00:02:36.130> up<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.430> way

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
thought but why not come up with a way

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.730 
thought but why not come up with a way
that<00:02:37.330> we<00:02:37.510> can<00:02:37.720> put<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.200> project<00:02:38.470> together

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
that we can put this project together

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.570 
that we can put this project together
