real too many teachers dads the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.710 
real too many teachers dads the
animatronics<00:03:27.090> used<00:03:27.210> to<00:03:27.270> get<00:03:27.420> more<00:03:27.570> aggressive

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
animatronics used to get more aggressive

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.980 
animatronics used to get more aggressive
as<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.650> week<00:03:28.800> progressed<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.600> may<00:03:30.810> want

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
as the week progressed so you may want

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.480 
as the week progressed so you may want

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
to keep a close eye on those cameras

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.090 
to keep a close eye on those cameras
also<00:03:33.240> you<00:03:33.570> said<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:34.230> was<00:03:34.320> only<00:03:34.410> one<00:03:34.740> image

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
also you said there was only one image

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.520 
also you said there was only one image
on<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.340> class<00:03:35.580> night<00:03:35.820> right<00:03:36.090> well<00:03:36.840> Peters<00:03:37.350> dad

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.840 
on a class night right well Peters dad
said<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:37.860> they<00:03:38.070> only<00:03:38.190> kept<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.610> few

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
said that they only kept a few

animatronics<00:03:39.600> toy<00:03:39.990> Freddy<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.890> one<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.190> saw

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
animatronics toy Freddy the one you saw

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.690 
animatronics toy Freddy the one you saw
the<00:03:42.030> marionette<00:03:42.600> golden<00:03:43.290> Bonnie<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.860> balloon

the marionette golden Bonnie and balloon

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.870 
the marionette golden Bonnie and balloon
boy<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:46.350> they<00:03:46.380> should<00:03:46.650> still<00:03:46.980> be<00:03:47.190> there<00:03:47.520> before

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
boy so they should still be there before

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.630 
boy so they should still be there before
II<00:03:48.240> sense<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.690> true<00:03:49.080> then<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.010> few<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.520> those

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
II sense it's true then a few of those

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.750 
II sense it's true then a few of those
guys<00:03:50.850> should<00:03:50.970> become<00:03:51.270> active<00:03:51.810> tonight

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
guys should become active tonight

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.920 
guys should become active tonight
apparently<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.880> puppet<00:03:54.209> was<00:03:54.330> never<00:03:54.540> finished

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
apparently the puppet was never finished

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.960 
apparently the puppet was never finished
therefore<00:03:55.890> unlike<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.310> other<00:03:56.580> animatronics

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
therefore unlike the other animatronics

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.930 
therefore unlike the other animatronics
he<00:03:57.959> doesn't<00:03:58.290> have<00:03:58.410> any<00:03:58.560> endoskeleton<00:03:59.280> eyes<00:03:59.430> so

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
he doesn't have any endoskeleton eyes so

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.680 
he doesn't have any endoskeleton eyes so
he<00:03:59.970> can't<00:04:00.420> see<00:04:01.080> like<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.220> others<00:04:02.490> do<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.330> don't

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
he can't see like the others do so don't

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.900 
he can't see like the others do so don't
put<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.080> masks<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.500> see<00:04:04.770> him<00:04:04.890> my<00:04:05.550> theory

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
put on the masks you see him my theory

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.729 
put on the masks you see him my theory
is<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.090> he<00:04:06.870> has<00:04:07.019> sound<00:04:07.320> detecting

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
is that he has sound detecting

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.640 
is that he has sound detecting
technology<00:04:08.400> but<00:04:09.030> since<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:09.810> can't<00:04:10.080> see<00:04:10.380> he

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
technology but since you can't see he

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.830 
technology but since you can't see he
relies<00:04:10.920> on<00:04:10.950> hearing<00:04:11.400> if<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:12.269> put<00:04:12.450> on<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> mask

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
relies on hearing if you put on the mask

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.810 
relies on hearing if you put on the mask
your<00:04:13.050> heavy<00:04:13.200> breathing<00:04:13.500> will<00:04:13.739> attract<00:04:14.100> him<00:04:14.280> so

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
your heavy breathing will attract him so

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.449 
your heavy breathing will attract him so
just<00:04:14.850> keep<00:04:15.300> absolutely<00:04:15.540> still<00:04:16.350> don't<00:04:17.310> do

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
just keep absolutely still don't do

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.330 
just keep absolutely still don't do
anything<00:04:17.820> until<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.269> goes<00:04:18.419> away<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:19.340> you're

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
anything until it goes away and you're

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.180 
anything until it goes away and you're
not<00:04:20.640> gonna<00:04:21.239> like<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.560> last<00:04:22.950> head

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
not gonna like this the last head

not gonna like this the last head
security<00:04:23.700> guard<00:04:23.880> Chloe<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.720> think<00:04:25.440> her<00:04:25.560> name

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
security guard Chloe I think her name

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.580 
security guard Chloe I think her name
was<00:04:25.850> she<00:04:26.850> died<00:04:27.060> there<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:28.110> don't<00:04:28.229> believe<00:04:28.470> in

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
was she died there you don't believe in

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.800 
was she died there you don't believe in
ghosts<00:04:28.830> Steve<00:04:29.419> um<00:04:30.419> it<00:04:31.320> is<00:04:31.500> said<00:04:31.710> her<00:04:31.830> spirit

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
ghosts Steve um it is said her spirit

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.230 
ghosts Steve um it is said her spirit
haunts<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.960> pizzeria<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:35.669> got<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.030> mask

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
haunts the pizzeria and I got the mask

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.120 
haunts the pizzeria and I got the mask
will<00:04:36.390> fool<00:04:36.419> her<00:04:36.750> since<00:04:37.050> spirits<00:04:37.440> are<00:04:37.590> pretty

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
will fool her since spirits are pretty

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.400 
will fool her since spirits are pretty
smart<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.210> came<00:04:39.419> up<00:04:39.570> with<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.870> theory<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.200> if

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
smart so I came up with a theory that if

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.680 
smart so I came up with a theory that if
you<00:04:40.530> play<00:04:40.740> dead<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.520> know<00:04:41.640> stay<00:04:42.210> absolutely

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
you play dead you know stay absolutely

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.230 
you play dead you know stay absolutely
still<00:04:43.080> she'll<00:04:44.010> go<00:04:44.160> away<00:04:44.250> don't<00:04:44.940> look<00:04:45.090> around

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
still she'll go away don't look around

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.700 
still she'll go away don't look around
when<00:04:45.510> she's<00:04:45.690> in<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.900> office<00:04:46.050> she'll<00:04:46.470> be<00:04:46.560> able

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
when she's in the office she'll be able

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.430 
when she's in the office she'll be able
to<00:04:46.800> tell<00:04:46.950> you're<00:04:47.070> alive<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.340> potentially
