the reviews so if that makes the system

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:16.380 
the reviews so if that makes the system
performance<00:01:13.170> getting<00:01:14.170> better<00:01:15.119> ok<00:01:16.119> on<00:01:16.240> the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
performance getting better ok on the

so<00:01:26.079> it<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.499> makes<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.310> system<00:01:27.759> main<00:01:28.090> board

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
so it can makes the system main board

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.800 
so it can makes the system main board
longer<00:01:28.810> lifetime<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.850> for<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.149> VGA<00:01:31.389> output

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
longer lifetime and for the VGA output

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.819 
longer lifetime and for the VGA output
it<00:01:32.109> can<00:01:32.380> also<00:01:32.799> support<00:01:33.009> HDMI<00:01:33.939> and<00:01:34.649> through<00:01:35.649> the
