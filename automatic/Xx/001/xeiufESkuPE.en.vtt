going<00:00:14.930> to<00:00:14.990> showcase<00:00:15.199> how<00:00:15.650> I<00:00:15.680> get<00:00:15.830> all<00:00:15.980> my

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
going to showcase how I get all my

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.330 
going to showcase how I get all my
zombies<00:00:16.970> at<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:17.480> arena<00:00:17.690> armored<00:00:18.380> up<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:19.100> this

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
zombies at the arena armored up so this

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.529 
zombies at the arena armored up so this
is<00:00:19.490> a<00:00:19.520> automatic<00:00:20.980> zombie<00:00:21.980> armored<00:00:22.539> armored

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
is a automatic zombie armored armored

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.200 
is a automatic zombie armored armored
zombie<00:00:23.929> sorted<00:00:24.320> rather<00:00:24.699> so<00:00:25.699> basically<00:00:25.999> it

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
zombie sorted rather so basically it

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.720 
zombie sorted rather so basically it
takes<00:00:26.449> any<00:00:27.320> zombies<00:00:27.740> that<00:00:27.829> can<00:00:28.009> pick<00:00:28.279> up<00:00:28.310> armor

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
takes any zombies that can pick up armor

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.089 
takes any zombies that can pick up armor
and/or<00:00:29.060> weapons<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:29.810> puts<00:00:30.140> them<00:00:30.320> into<00:00:30.529> one

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
and/or weapons and puts them into one

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.580 
and/or weapons and puts them into one
specific<00:00:31.550> slot<00:00:31.820> namely<00:00:32.509> this<00:00:32.689> slot<00:00:32.990> down<00:00:33.230> here

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
specific slot namely this slot down here

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.440 
specific slot namely this slot down here
this<00:00:34.489> is<00:00:34.640> similar<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.970> what<00:00:35.090> I<00:00:35.150> have<00:00:35.329> at<00:00:35.420> the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
this is similar to what I have at the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.660 
this is similar to what I have at the
arena<00:00:35.720> not<00:00:35.870> exactly<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.500> same<00:00:36.739> I<00:00:37.070> actually

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
arena not exactly the same I actually

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.340 
arena not exactly the same I actually
automated<00:00:38.120> this<00:00:38.420> part<00:00:38.720> down<00:00:38.870> here<00:00:39.080> where<00:00:39.230> they

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
automated this part down here where they

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.470 
automated this part down here where they
get<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.590> armor<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.040> weapons<00:00:40.460> as<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.360> can

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
get the armor in the weapons as you can

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.760 
get the armor in the weapons as you can
see<00:00:41.600> there's<00:00:41.750> armor<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:42.200> weapons<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.710> these

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
see there's armor and weapons and these

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.790 
see there's armor and weapons and these
dispensers<00:00:43.370> down<00:00:43.610> here<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.290> let<00:00:45.410> me<00:00:45.470> sort

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
dispensers down here and so let me sort

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.440 
dispensers down here and so let me sort
of<00:00:45.920> walk<00:00:46.040> you<00:00:46.160> through<00:00:46.220> how<00:00:46.400> it<00:00:46.550> works<00:00:46.850> because

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
of walk you through how it works because

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.290 
of walk you through how it works because
I<00:00:47.660> do<00:00:47.720> get<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.960> lot<00:00:48.080> of<00:00:48.200> questions<00:00:48.350> about<00:00:48.890> this

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
I do get a lot of questions about this

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.930 
I do get a lot of questions about this
so<00:00:50.300> first<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.660> all<00:00:50.720> you<00:00:51.350> put<00:00:51.830> either<00:00:52.130> a<00:00:52.370> weapon

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
so first of all you put either a weapon

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.940 
so first of all you put either a weapon
or<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.240> piece<00:00:53.540> of<00:00:53.690> armor<00:00:53.840> in<00:00:54.140> this<00:00:54.320> dropper<00:00:54.680> here

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
or a piece of armor in this dropper here

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.810 
or a piece of armor in this dropper here
and<00:00:55.130> then<00:00:55.790> throw<00:00:56.980> another<00:00:57.980> piece<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.310> armor<00:00:58.580> or

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
and then throw another piece of armor or

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.570 
and then throw another piece of armor or
a<00:00:59.090> weapon<00:00:59.510> on<00:00:59.720> the<00:01:00.110> pressure<00:01:00.350> plate<00:01:00.470> there<00:01:00.860> you

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
a weapon on the pressure plate there you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.390 
a weapon on the pressure plate there you
see<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.270> Pistons<00:01:03.020> with<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.470> red<00:01:03.830> wool

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
see that the Pistons with the red wool

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.490 
see that the Pistons with the red wool
blocks<00:01:04.670> in<00:01:04.850> front<00:01:04.879> them<00:01:05.150> retract<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.869> the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
blocks in front them retract and the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.320 
blocks in front them retract and the
Pistons<00:01:06.860> with<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.220> lime<00:01:07.610> green<00:01:07.909> in<00:01:08.060> front<00:01:08.270> of

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
Pistons with the lime green in front of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.499 
Pistons with the lime green in front of
them<00:01:08.450> extend<00:01:09.170> that's<00:01:10.159> because<00:01:10.579> we<00:01:10.880> have<00:01:11.149> a

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
them extend that's because we have a

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.249 
them extend that's because we have a
torch<00:01:11.899> back<00:01:12.200> here<00:01:12.759> this<00:01:13.759> torch<00:01:14.259> yeah

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
torch back here this torch yeah

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.950 
torch back here this torch yeah
basically<00:01:15.469> deep<00:01:16.310> powers<00:01:16.700> these<00:01:17.060> Pistons<00:01:17.659> here

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
basically deep powers these Pistons here

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.109 
basically deep powers these Pistons here
this<00:01:18.109> one<00:01:18.259> in<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:18.439> one<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:18.859> then<00:01:18.999> since<00:01:19.999> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
this one in this one and then since the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.469 
this one in this one and then since the
pressure<00:01:20.299> plate<00:01:20.569> is<00:01:20.780> depressed<00:01:21.319> by<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.619> item

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
pressure plate is depressed by the item

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.260 
pressure plate is depressed by the item
this<00:01:23.479> line<00:01:23.749> yeah<00:01:24.469> it<00:01:24.560> lights<00:01:24.770> up<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.850> powered

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
this line yeah it lights up it's powered

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.679 
this line yeah it lights up it's powered
and<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:27.140> powers<00:01:27.259> these<00:01:27.619> Pistons<00:01:28.069> right<00:01:28.249> here

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
and it powers these Pistons right here

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.130 
and it powers these Pistons right here
so<00:01:29.689> now<00:01:30.020> what<00:01:30.499> we<00:01:30.619> do<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:31.159> we<00:01:31.700> take<00:01:31.909> our<00:01:32.270> zombies

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
so now what we do is we take our zombies

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.840 
so now what we do is we take our zombies
so<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:33.770> will<00:01:33.889> be<00:01:33.979> like<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.159> zombie<00:01:34.579> spawner

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
so this will be like a zombie spawner

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.249 
so this will be like a zombie spawner
for<00:01:35.270> example<00:01:35.600> my<00:01:35.689> let's<00:01:35.899> play<00:01:36.079> I<00:01:36.109> have<00:01:36.229> a

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
for example my let's play I have a

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.919 
for example my let's play I have a
zombie<00:01:36.469> spawner<00:01:36.829> here<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:38.479> make<00:01:38.719> sure

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
zombie spawner here and we make sure

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.300 
zombie spawner here and we make sure
we're<00:01:39.079> on<00:01:39.109> Hard<00:01:39.530> difficulty<00:01:41.859> drop<00:01:42.859> a<00:01:42.889> zombie

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
we're on Hard difficulty drop a zombie

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.590 
we're on Hard difficulty drop a zombie
in<00:01:43.399> here<00:01:43.639> and<00:01:43.759> now<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:43.999> zombie<00:01:44.329> will<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:44.569> a

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
in here and now this zombie will have a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.989 
in here and now this zombie will have a
chance<00:01:44.929> to<00:01:45.229> pick<00:01:45.409> up<00:01:45.619> this<00:01:45.740> helmet<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.729> see<00:01:46.880> he

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
chance to pick up this helmet you see he

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.449 
chance to pick up this helmet you see he
chose<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.600> write<00:01:47.810> their<00:01:48.079> new<00:01:48.889> helmet<00:01:49.280> was

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
chose to write their new helmet was

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.849 
chose to write their new helmet was
dispensed<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.179> by<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.389> way<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.840> now<00:01:51.770> he

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
dispensed there by the way and now he

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.919 
dispensed there by the way and now he
comes<00:01:52.100> over<00:01:52.369> here<00:01:52.729> he'll<00:01:53.179> cross<00:01:53.539> over<00:01:53.810> the

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
comes over here he'll cross over the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.499 
comes over here he'll cross over the
tripwire<00:01:54.380> here<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.579> there<00:01:55.880> he<00:01:55.969> goes

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
tripwire here and there he goes

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.959 
tripwire here and there he goes
got<00:01:57.020> all<00:01:57.170> his<00:01:57.319> armor<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.740> we<00:01:58.429> have<00:01:58.549> an<00:01:58.670> armored

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
got all his armor and we have an armored

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.879 
got all his armor and we have an armored
zombie<00:01:59.299> now<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.689> then<00:02:00.139> we<00:02:00.289> can<00:02:00.439> presumably

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
zombie now and then we can presumably

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:02.529 
zombie now and then we can presumably
you<00:02:01.009> know<00:02:01.039> whisk<00:02:01.340> him<00:02:01.520> off<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.939> like<00:02:02.090> an<00:02:02.209> arena

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
you know whisk him off to like an arena

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.080 
you know whisk him off to like an arena
or<00:02:02.569> something<00:02:03.310> like<00:02:04.310> we<00:02:04.459> did<00:02:04.579> in<00:02:04.670> let's<00:02:04.909> play

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
or something like we did in let's play

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.599 
or something like we did in let's play
or<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.689> could<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.170> know<00:02:06.259> just<00:02:06.369> yeah<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.399> guess

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
or you could you know just yeah I guess

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.639 
or you could you know just yeah I guess
elect<00:02:08.090> armored<00:02:08.600> zombies<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.140> some<00:02:09.259> reason<00:02:09.560> I

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
elect armored zombies for some reason I

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.530 
elect armored zombies for some reason I
don't<00:02:09.800> know<00:02:09.890> why<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.069> do<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:10.729> yeah<00:02:11.480> you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
don't know why you do that but yeah you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.530 
don't know why you do that but yeah you
could<00:02:11.750> do<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:11.900> as<00:02:12.170> well<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.350> guess<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:14.360> yeah

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
could do that as well I guess so yeah

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.300 
could do that as well I guess so yeah
that's<00:02:15.319> pretty<00:02:15.470> cool<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:15.950> system<00:02:16.220> is

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that's pretty cool and the system is

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.009 
that's pretty cool and the system is
ready<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.519> go<00:02:16.700> again<00:02:17.030> -<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.629> we<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.870> put

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
ready to go again - so we can put

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:18.750 
ready to go again - so we can put
another<00:02:18.200> zombie

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
another zombie

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.270 
another zombie
here<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.390> he<00:02:20.290> has<00:02:20.379> a<00:02:20.409> chance<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.799> pick<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.069> up

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
here and he has a chance to pick it up

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.740 
here and he has a chance to pick it up
if<00:02:21.430> he<00:02:21.519> doesn't<00:02:21.790> pick<00:02:21.939> it<00:02:22.060> up<00:02:22.180> he'll<00:02:22.360> be<00:02:22.390> burned

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
if he doesn't pick it up he'll be burned

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.170 
if he doesn't pick it up he'll be burned
in<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.049> lava<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:24.579> got<00:02:24.730> picked<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.090> up

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
in the lava if you just got picked it up

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.949 
in the lava if you just got picked it up
again<00:02:25.510> as<00:02:25.659> well<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.370> yeah<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.329> works<00:02:28.540> fairly

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
again as well and yeah it works fairly

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.530 
again as well and yeah it works fairly
consistently<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.060> what<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.209> use<00:02:31.510> to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
consistently so that is what I use to

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.199 
consistently so that is what I use to
basically<00:02:32.230> get<00:02:32.500> all<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.860> evil<00:02:33.280> all<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
basically get all the evil all the

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.430 
basically get all the evil all the
zombies<00:02:34.569> aren't<00:02:34.750> written<00:02:34.900> yeah<00:02:35.049> you<00:02:35.110> see<00:02:35.319> he

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
zombies aren't written yeah you see he

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.930 
zombies aren't written yeah you see he
picked<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.829> everything<00:02:36.159> there<00:02:36.310> as<00:02:36.459> well<00:02:36.700> so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
picked up everything there as well so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.880 
picked up everything there as well so
that's<00:02:37.420> pretty<00:02:37.629> cool<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> pretty<00:02:38.709> neat

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that's pretty cool it's a pretty neat

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.220 
that's pretty cool it's a pretty neat
little<00:02:38.920> system<00:02:39.519> works<00:02:40.360> fairly<00:02:40.629> well<00:02:40.930> for<00:02:41.079> me

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
little system works fairly well for me

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.059 
little system works fairly well for me
and<00:02:42.190> what<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.340> do<00:02:42.459> at<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.879> arena<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.920> yeah<00:02:44.920> it's

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
and what I do at the arena so yeah it's

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.080 
and what I do at the arena so yeah it's
pretty<00:02:45.220> straightforward<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.909> only

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
pretty straightforward the only

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.000 
pretty straightforward the only
difference<00:02:46.359> I<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:47.260> this

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
difference I think is that I have this

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.099 
difference I think is that I have this
part<00:02:48.370> more<00:02:48.670> manual<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.420> have<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.599> button<00:02:49.930> to

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
part more manual so I have a button to

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.960 
part more manual so I have a button to
hit<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:50.799> totally<00:02:51.010> customize<00:02:51.700> what

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
hit so I can totally customize what

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.479 
hit so I can totally customize what
they're<00:02:52.120> wearing<00:02:52.739> there's<00:02:53.739> also<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:54.010> second

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
they're wearing there's also a second

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.780 
they're wearing there's also a second
way<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.640> can<00:02:54.909> sort<00:02:55.209> zombies<00:02:56.010> via<00:02:57.010> their<00:02:57.280> armor

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
way you can sort zombies via their armor

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.059 
way you can sort zombies via their armor
and<00:02:57.940> there's<00:02:58.269> probably<00:02:58.599> more<00:02:58.799> but<00:02:59.799> this<00:02:59.889> was

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
and there's probably more but this was

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.410 
and there's probably more but this was
developed<00:03:00.220> by<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.549> guy<00:03:00.730> called<00:03:00.760> Morty's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
developed by a guy called Morty's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.729 
developed by a guy called Morty's
Minecraft<00:03:01.959> they'll<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.349> link<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
Minecraft they'll be a link in the

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.099 
Minecraft they'll be a link in the
description<00:03:02.829> for<00:03:03.459> his<00:03:03.670> channel<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.870> he<00:03:04.959> does

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
description for his channel but he does

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.259 
description for his channel but he does
essentially<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.650> same<00:03:05.829> thing<00:03:06.190> but<00:03:06.639> he<00:03:07.000> uses

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
essentially the same thing but he uses

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.180 
essentially the same thing but he uses
redstone<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.900> detect<00:03:08.260> it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
redstone to detect it

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.490 
redstone to detect it
so<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.849> one<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.150> requires<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.810> manual<00:03:11.170> input

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
so this one is requires a manual input

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.899 
so this one is requires a manual input
although<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.799> could<00:03:12.099> switch<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.549> fully

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
although you could switch it to fully

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.160 
although you could switch it to fully
automatic<00:03:13.269> I'm<00:03:13.540> guessing<00:03:13.900> with<00:03:14.019> like

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
automatic I'm guessing with like

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.550 
automatic I'm guessing with like
tripwire<00:03:14.849> but<00:03:15.849> what<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.090> does<00:03:16.329> is<00:03:16.599> it<00:03:16.750> has<00:03:17.049> some

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
tripwire but what it does is it has some

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.030 
tripwire but what it does is it has some
golden<00:03:18.400> helmets<00:03:18.730> in<00:03:18.849> here<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.989> spits<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:20.889> out

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
golden helmets in here it spits it out

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.589 
golden helmets in here it spits it out
and<00:03:21.639> yeah<00:03:22.060> basically<00:03:24.030> yeah<00:03:25.030> spits<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.359> out<00:03:25.419> on

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
and yeah basically yeah spits it out on

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.879 
and yeah basically yeah spits it out on
to<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.840> zombie<00:03:26.139> if<00:03:26.260> there's<00:03:26.410> only<00:03:26.530> picks<00:03:26.769> it

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
to the zombie if there's only picks it

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.909 
to the zombie if there's only picks it
up<00:03:26.980> then<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:28.209> timer<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.379> activate<00:03:29.739> by

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
up then a timer that you activate by

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.809 
up then a timer that you activate by
hitting<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.370> button<00:03:31.590> basically<00:03:32.819> activates

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
hitting the button basically activates

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.479 
hitting the button basically activates
and<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.199> green<00:03:35.470> piston<00:03:35.919> will<00:03:36.040> push<00:03:36.220> if

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
and it this green piston will push if

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.759 
and it this green piston will push if
not<00:03:37.209> then<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.599> red<00:03:37.750> piston<00:03:38.139> will<00:03:38.230> push<00:03:38.440> and

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
not then the red piston will push and

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.920 
not then the red piston will push and
again<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.489> zombie<00:03:39.760> falls<00:03:40.000> into<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.419> lava<00:03:40.660> pit

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
again the zombie falls into a lava pit

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.689 
again the zombie falls into a lava pit
so<00:03:41.620> let's<00:03:41.769> just<00:03:41.949> see<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.310> action<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.669> few

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
so let's just see this in action a few

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.039 
so let's just see this in action a few
times<00:03:43.060> here<00:03:43.359> so<00:03:43.750> he<00:03:44.560> took<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.010> Hat<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.569> yeah

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
times here so he took the Hat and yeah

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.240 
times here so he took the Hat and yeah
the<00:03:47.169> same<00:03:47.349> thing<00:03:47.530> happened<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:47.859> him<00:03:47.949> he<00:03:48.129> got

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
the same thing happened to him he got

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.360 
the same thing happened to him he got
armored<00:03:48.699> right<00:03:48.879> there<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.889> let's<00:03:51.160> see<00:03:51.250> if<00:03:51.310> we

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
armored right there and let's see if we

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.330 
armored right there and let's see if we
can<00:03:51.459> get<00:03:51.579> one<00:03:51.699> that<00:03:51.849> doesn't<00:03:52.120> say<00:03:52.449> any<00:03:52.660> armor

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
can get one that doesn't say any armor

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.680 
can get one that doesn't say any armor
maybe<00:03:54.930> let's<00:03:55.930> see<00:03:56.199> yeah<00:03:57.069> so<00:03:57.220> he<00:03:57.370> didn't<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:58.510> so

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
maybe let's see yeah so he didn't and so

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.740 
maybe let's see yeah so he didn't and so
he<00:03:58.810> gets<00:03:58.959> burned<00:04:00.269> so<00:04:01.269> everything<00:04:01.599> happens

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
he gets burned so everything happens

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.659 
he gets burned so everything happens
very<00:04:02.019> very<00:04:02.199> quickly<00:04:02.620> but<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.430> one<00:04:03.579> is<00:04:03.639> a

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
very very quickly but this one is a

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.099 
very very quickly but this one is a
little<00:04:03.790> bit<00:04:03.940> more<00:04:04.090> compact<00:04:04.599> than<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.930> one<00:04:05.079> I

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
little bit more compact than the one I

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.439 
little bit more compact than the one I
use<00:04:05.470> however<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.549> one<00:04:06.730> does<00:04:06.909> not

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
use however this one does not

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.559 
use however this one does not
sort<00:04:08.230> babies<00:04:08.650> zombies<00:04:09.120> at<00:04:10.120> least<00:04:10.329> it<00:04:10.419> doesn't

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
sort babies zombies at least it doesn't

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.890 
sort babies zombies at least it doesn't
do<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.870> as<00:04:11.019> well<00:04:11.319> as<00:04:12.190> as<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.329> one<00:04:13.449> I<00:04:13.480> have<00:04:13.690> over

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
do it as well as as the one I have over

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.620 
do it as well as as the one I have over
here<00:04:14.049> does<00:04:14.260> but<00:04:15.250> still<00:04:15.879> both<00:04:16.090> designs<00:04:16.479> are

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
here does but still both designs are

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.759 
here does but still both designs are

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
pretty good and there they have their

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.699 
pretty good and there they have their
advantages<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.609> disadvantages<00:04:19.209> as<00:04:19.709> any

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
advantages and disadvantages as any

advantages and disadvantages as any
