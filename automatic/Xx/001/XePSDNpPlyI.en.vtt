 urania astronomy and astronautics newsletter edited by the institute 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.020
 national astrophysicist 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.180
 well found by elena lazzaretto and luca nobili and with this are 5 will have 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.039
 exclaimed the American astronomers who keep an eye on 55 cancels the star 41 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.080
 light years from us 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.160
 we already knew that there are four planets butbiting around 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.529
 recently the group of astronomers discovered a fifth five planets for me 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.950
 a record is the largest planetary system so far identified 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.090
 solar system excluded obviously to make the discovery even more 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.870
 interesting you did that the planet is in the so-called band of 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.690
 habitability that is neither too close to me is too far from its own 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.129
 star the dispersed planet is completely in spital given that it is a 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.780
 gas giant similar to Saturn 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.790
 if, however, just like Saturn, he had dunes on one of them 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.990
 present water here you would find yourself in an ideal situation 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.760
 the habitable zone in fact the water eventually present in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.350
 surface the breeder makes I would like just because you find the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.460
 right distance from the star 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.560
 tailor in the case in question there are many six that can be done at the moment 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.500
 only hypotheses the tools currently available are not sufficiently 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.150
 accurate to allow us to detect any natural satellites in orbit 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.200
 around the planet however making the comparison with the gas giants of the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.210
 solar system we see that everyone is surrounded by the reasonable brunette 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 to expect that there will also be in the case of the fifth planet 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.990
 what happens the matter that is swallowed by a black hole based on 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.300
 mature alternative to the more widespread one 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.450
 British astronomy held two possible answers could finish i'm 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.430
 at universe or it could be trapped in a tunnel that carries a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.310
 another black hole consulted by my magazine is an expert on track 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.020
 who did not want to make his name public on these reservations 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.330
 results as smokers are based on everything to prove and bring new ones 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.520
 theoretical problems to be solved 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.090
 shuttle discovery mission concluded with the Italian paolo on board 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.950
 medlar 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.420
 many tasks performed to expand and restore the space station 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.860
 international one among which to have brought and attached the unitary unit form 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.519
 repaired some damaged solar panels 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.069
 is about to start the second edition of astronauts with like shan of astronauts and 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.019
 space scientists to be held in montecatini on 17 November 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.489
