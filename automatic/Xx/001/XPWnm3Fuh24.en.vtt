00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.410
 So today I wanted the q3 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.910
 imagine 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.620
 this is a new model 2014 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:42.010
 the good one can fly like that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.820
 ltv 9 11 I think the same 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.430
 technology in it 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.830
 that of 11 is somehow in germany 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.949
 no longer does i stop for whatever reason 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.620
 so I did not get it anymore 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.410
 looking for an alternative and with 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.780
 finally found the device 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.839
 from building her actually just like 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:07.570
 the v 9 11 a motor single rotor 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.940
 flexible wings super flexible land 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.330
 it will not be so fast now 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:18.070
 break definitely beautiful 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.899
 Aluminum bars and protected 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.250
 Rear engine also relatively important 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.340
 small rubber layer around 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.759
 so that he does not happen anything from the flight 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.259
 behave 11 again before 9 11 so there 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.680
 You can not really do that anymore 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.979
 relatively quiet the thing and flies 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.450
 just really good really good I shows 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.000
 synonymous just a few videos as you 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.229
 because it actually flies outside 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.079
 indoor helicopter but you can too 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.880
 it's not good for a moderate wind outside 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.509
 problem because he has two speed 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.170
 Modi which one then over I believe the 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.950
 button your activated and in the beginner 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.640
 Mode is relatively slow and 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.990
 precise and if you change it 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.280
 he is super fast and strong 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.450
 means one can also counterwind 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.360
 drive that's not that 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.640
 Huge problem really good helicopter can 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.160
 you are definitely recommend 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.989
 two batteries with it so it with the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.709
 scope of delivery I already have mappus 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.440
 ordered because the thing does really found 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.570
 So you should have so many 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.730
 cars as possible thus have only 15 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.820
 billion by battery and have it here 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.139
 a nice receptacle there man 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.200
 flood the channel and said staley 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.930
 copter on 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.459
 and quickly changes another advantage 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.980
 is that the charger can be two rechargeable batteries 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.349
 saying at the same time is of course mega 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.050
 practically one comes home and at 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.050
 the batteries are not doing anything wrong because 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.980
 the guide rails are there and let 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.180
 load very fast 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.519
 with us there is still the right usb 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.650
 charger because of loss of value 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.879
 to have his pc on continuously 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.340
 accordingly easily infected to the 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.310
 outlet does not exceed 500 either 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.810
 milliampere output is accordingly 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.840
 Battery also spares no 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.700
 problems that you that that thing 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.069
 somehow his batteries are broken 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.829
 because if you for example handy 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.060
 charger something else uses it 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.660
 always difficult because they are much more 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.269
 from output so have a usb port 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.569
 from pcs so that simulates more or 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.810
 less normal usb connection his pc 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.220
 and to give water are four batteries 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.500
 lingering can start right so 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.730
 Batteries in the remote control batteries 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.880
 start loading 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.530
 that's it could be great product 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.829
 you do not complain as telekom now soon 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.269
 all and otherwise easy 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.239
 write off if you want special 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.340
 I am looking for bigger batteries 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.790
 probably soon, but sometimes 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.930
 watch 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.280
 there have to wait a bit 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.769
 probably until they come out then 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.670
 because that comes relatively new otherwise 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.250
 then there's red and white in white 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.310
 black orange and another color 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.090
 I did not like that accordingly 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.930
 I have not shopped but is 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.960
 Now available 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:27.090
 beautifully flexible blades rotor blades and it 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.910
 is also an extra rotor blades 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.530
 and another extra hectic 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.349
 leaf and this connection stones the 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.800
 you here so between looks that's it 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:40.050
 actually 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.330
 that the scope of delivery batteries usb 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.530
 adapter live again, of course 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.620
 are the original packed then no 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.020
 worry and now you can have a short look 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.370
 look like the thing then out there 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.370
 behaves when flying
