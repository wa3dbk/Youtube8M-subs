 ecological mushrooms flour gluten free salt 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.130
 without sodium and oil 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.099
 we are going to start making the mass of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.919
 tofu croquettes and mushrooms for this we 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.840
 let's put the tofu out what 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.400
 we want to make is a very compact mass 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.860
 with the tofu with the mushrooms and with the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.970
 prepared flour we're going to start 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.970
 very small 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.580
 Y 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.580
 Y 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.570
 we are going to split the mushrooms in this case 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.570
 are the dogs guys 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.720
 they will provide a lot of aroma and flavor 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.720
 to our croquette 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.270
 ah 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.870
 let's start 1 more 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.450
 i 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.700
 It's a shame that here you can not appreciate 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.730
 the aroma that this mushroom solved has 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.490
 past 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.200
 the smell of wet flour 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.610
 well we would have enough now what 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 what are we going to do to link this mass 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.200
 let's take our prepared from 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.840
 I would bake a little as we go 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.330
 mixing we will be adding more than 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.780
 It consists of kneading 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.240
 and break the tofu in such a way that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.070
 let's create a ball with this let's do 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.300
 our mass of the croquettes does not 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.770
 let's cook but directly 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.230
 when we have the dough what we are going to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.810
 to do is let it rest in the camera 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.550
 At least an hour and you are going to see that I'm going 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.650
 creating a ball and this what we 're going to 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.600
 to do is put it in the minimum camera 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.110
 time to rest and then we're going to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.110
 shape 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.610
 after an hour we have our 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.810
 dough croquettes of your dog what 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.520
 what we are going to do is shape it and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
 pass it through our bread crumbs without 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.450
 gluten 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.040
 we will be able to let the pelotitas 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.690
 we squeeze them a little bit that yes it is 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.599
 true so then when we pass it on 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.980
 for the bread crumbs to the breasts undo 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.690
 let's do as four you have to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.180
 think that this dough is going to be much more 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.020
 delicate than a normal croquette 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.730
 then you have to be very careful 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.019
 pass it through the bread crumbs and then 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.280
 when we are going to put the pan 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.099
 we will also have to be careful 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.050
 because it's going to be very delicate and we 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.080
 it may break but it will be very 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.480
 creamy in the mouth we already have our 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.420
 gluten-free bread croquettes 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.340
 what we are going to do is fry them we have 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.450
 the oil with temperature 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.850
 let's check anyway 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.850
 throwing only one let's fry 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.489
 we will accompany these croquettes 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.379
 with some snacks that we have of carrot 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.510
 potato and beet are totally 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.730
 ecological and are fruits in an oil 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.890
 extra virgin that is also ecological 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.049
 we're going to make it as a snack for a 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.489
 Incoming match day 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.489
 these croquettes we would have them 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.480
 when we would have our croquettes 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.560

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.810
