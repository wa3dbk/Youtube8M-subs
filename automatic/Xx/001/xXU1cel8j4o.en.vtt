hi<00:00:00.810> I'm<00:00:01.439> Steve<00:00:01.770> Jones<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.399> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.850> tell

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to tell

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.079 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to tell
you<00:00:03.120> how<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> light<00:00:03.990> bulb<00:00:04.290> works<00:00:04.589> well<00:00:05.549> first<00:00:05.940> of

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
you how a light bulb works well first of

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.960 
you how a light bulb works well first of
all<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.200> see<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.069> construction<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
all we have to see the construction of

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.430 
all we have to see the construction of
the<00:00:09.210> light<00:00:09.690> bulb<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.500> fact<00:00:11.269> the<00:00:12.269> working<00:00:13.110> part

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the light bulb in fact the working part

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.010 
the light bulb in fact the working part
is<00:00:13.740> what<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.130> call<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.400> filament<00:00:14.940> which<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.990> a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is what we call a filament which is a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.810 
is what we call a filament which is a
thin<00:00:16.470> piece<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> metal<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.199> this<00:00:19.199> gets

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
thin piece of metal and this gets

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.810 
thin piece of metal and this gets
white-hot<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.150> glows<00:00:21.750> very<00:00:21.990> very<00:00:22.500> hot<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.070> of

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
white-hot it glows very very hot and of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.849 
white-hot it glows very very hot and of
course<00:00:24.390> if<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> air<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.619> did

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
course if it was in the air you did

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.410 
course if it was in the air you did
actually<00:00:26.099> burn<00:00:26.640> away

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
actually burn away

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.120 
actually burn away
so<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.830> enclose<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:31.080> bulb<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.740> glass

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
so we enclose this in a bulb of glass

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.510 
so we enclose this in a bulb of glass
which<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.820> sealed<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> screw<00:00:34.920> thread<00:00:35.280> on

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
which is sealed with a screw thread on

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.630 
which is sealed with a screw thread on
here<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.030> attach<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.649> place<00:00:38.309> it's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
here to attach it to the place it's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.280 
here to attach it to the place it's
being<00:00:39.120> put<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.100> we<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.280> two<00:00:41.700> legs<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:43.110> on

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
being put and we have two legs here on

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110 
being put and we have two legs here on
which<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.829> hang<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> filament<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:44.969> are

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
which we hang the filament these are

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
which we hang the filament these are
usually<00:00:45.270> tungsten<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.469> electricity<00:00:49.469> comes

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
usually tungsten the electricity comes

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.240 
usually tungsten the electricity comes
in<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.390> connection<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> bottom

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
in at one connection here at the bottom

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.670 
in at one connection here at the bottom
in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> middle<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.140> it<00:00:55.140> goes<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.649> through

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
in the middle and it goes up through

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.360 
in the middle and it goes up through
here<00:00:56.340> through<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> wire<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.739> down<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
here through the wire and then down and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
here through the wire and then down and
comes<00:00:59.670> out<00:00:59.969> through<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> screw<00:01:00.809> thread<00:01:01.109> at

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
comes out through the screw thread at

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.709 
comes out through the screw thread at
the<00:01:01.379> side<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.910> sometimes<00:01:02.910> we've<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.480> what's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the side or sometimes we've got what's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
the side or sometimes we've got what's
called<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.170> bayonet<00:01:04.439> connection<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> depends

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
called a bayonet connection it depends

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
called a bayonet connection it depends
which<00:01:05.970> country<00:01:06.450> you're<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.810> either<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.100> screw

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
which country you're in either a screw

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.789 
which country you're in either a screw
thread<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> bayonet<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.900> bayonet<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.500> just

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
thread or a bayonet a bayonet is just

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280 
thread or a bayonet a bayonet is just
flat<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.580> push<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.360> turn<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
flat you push it in and turn it and it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.630 
flat you push it in and turn it and it
jams<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.680> glass<00:01:16.950> bulb<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:18.619> evacuated<00:01:19.640> that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
jams so the glass bulb is evacuated that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.030 
jams so the glass bulb is evacuated that
is<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> no<00:01:21.570> air<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.920> were

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
is there is no air in here if there were

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.940 
is there is no air in here if there were
air<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.960> soon<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> got<00:01:25.650> hot

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
air in here this as soon as it got hot

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.170 
air in here this as soon as it got hot
would<00:01:26.220> burn<00:01:26.490> away

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
would burn away

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.600 
would burn away
you<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:27.990> want<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you don't want that what you do is you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.179 
you don't want that what you do is you
put<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.150> gas<00:01:30.420> which<00:01:30.990> won't<00:01:31.320> allow<00:01:31.619> burning

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
put in a gas which won't allow burning

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.730 
put in a gas which won't allow burning
you<00:01:32.400> remove<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> oxygen<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you remove the oxygen in here and you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.390 
you remove the oxygen in here and you
put<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> argon<00:01:35.759> gas<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.380> contains<00:01:37.740> argon

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
put in argon gas so this contains argon

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.340 
put in argon gas so this contains argon
and<00:01:38.579> won't<00:01:39.000> burn<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.079> become

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and won't burn so this can become

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.730 
and won't burn so this can become
white-hot<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.420> will<00:01:42.869> produce<00:01:43.049> mainly

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
white-hot and it will produce mainly

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.420 
white-hot and it will produce mainly
light<00:01:44.490> well<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:45.270> mainly<00:01:45.810> light<00:01:46.049> actually

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
light well not mainly light actually

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.780 
light well not mainly light actually
about<00:01:47.450> 10%<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.689> light<00:01:49.110> most<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.399> heat

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
about 10% is light most of it is heat

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.580 
about 10% is light most of it is heat
and<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.420> glass<00:01:51.840> bulb<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:52.710> very<00:01:53.159> hot

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
and this glass bulb will get very hot

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.370 
and this glass bulb will get very hot
normally<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:56.219> bulbs<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.479> power<00:01:57.990> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
normally these bulbs have a power of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
normally these bulbs have a power of
around<00:01:58.799> 60<00:01:59.520> watts<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> 60<00:02:01.590> watts<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> an

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
around 60 watts so the 60 watts is a an

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.749 
around 60 watts so the 60 watts is a an
average<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.530> fact<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:05.159> from<00:02:05.399> something

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
average they in fact go from something

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.210 
average they in fact go from something
like<00:02:05.880> 25<00:02:06.719> Watts<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.729> 250<00:02:08.729> Watts<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.979> 250<00:02:10.979> watt

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
like 25 Watts up to 250 Watts a 250 watt

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.970 
like 25 Watts up to 250 Watts a 250 watt
lamp<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:12.660> actually<00:02:13.170> use<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> current

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
lamp will actually use a current

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.320 
lamp will actually use a current
of<00:02:14.160> 1<00:02:14.520> ampair<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:18.769> 25<00:02:19.769> watt<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.430> course<00:02:20.940> will

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
of 1 ampair a 25 watt of course will
