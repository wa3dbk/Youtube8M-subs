it<00:01:48.509> Curtis<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.110> nice<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> greenhouse<00:01:49.829> is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it Curtis it's nice the greenhouse is

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.910 
it Curtis it's nice the greenhouse is
supposed<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.340> nice<00:01:50.600> yeah<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> keep<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
supposed to be nice yeah want to keep it
closed<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> cold<00:01:53.670> air<00:01:53.820> stays<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.240> little

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
closed so the cold air stays a little

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.139 
closed so the cold air stays a little
bit<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> warm<00:01:54.990> air<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.939> nice

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
bit of the warm air in here it is nice

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.090 
bit of the warm air in here it is nice
and<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> ventilation<00:01:58.560> holes<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.890> talked

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and see the ventilation holes we talked

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.010 
and see the ventilation holes we talked
about<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.490> outside<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.630> warm<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.990> here

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
about from outside but it's warm in here

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
about from outside but it's warm in here
right<00:02:01.560> they're<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.250> don't<00:02:02.399> make<00:02:02.520> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
right they're not they don't make that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
right they're not they don't make that
much<00:02:02.880> difference<00:02:02.990> okay

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
much difference okay

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
much difference okay
yeah<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.799> cold<00:02:05.100> windy<00:02:05.429> time<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.820> use<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
yeah really cold windy time you use the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.600 
yeah really cold windy time you use the
other<00:02:06.390> cover<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.869> covered<00:02:07.140> up<00:02:07.259> right

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
other cover and it's covered up right

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.620 
other cover and it's covered up right
could<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> tell<00:02:08.880> us<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.000> little<00:02:09.060> bit<00:02:09.209> about<00:02:09.360> how

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
could you tell us a little bit about how

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.449 
could you tell us a little bit about how
you<00:02:09.690> came<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> build<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.250> first

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
you came to build this I know this first

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.160 
you came to build this I know this first
thing<00:02:11.610> had<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.940> do<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> dig<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.300> hole<00:02:12.360> right<00:02:12.690> yeah

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
thing had to do to dig a hole right yeah

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.380 
thing had to do to dig a hole right yeah
we<00:02:13.319> hand<00:02:13.560> dug<00:02:13.769> this<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> reason<00:02:15.300> why

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
we hand dug this we and the reason why

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.110 
we hand dug this we and the reason why
we<00:02:15.510> did<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:16.110> because<00:02:16.290> soil<00:02:16.800> stays<00:02:17.519> at<00:02:17.730> 55

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
we did that is because soil stays at 55

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.690 
we did that is because soil stays at 55
degrees<00:02:18.420> three<00:02:18.690> feet<00:02:18.870> down<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:20.370> figured

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
degrees three feet down and we figured

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.330 
degrees three feet down and we figured
that<00:02:20.910> with<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.500> we<00:02:22.500> could<00:02:22.680> help<00:02:22.890> maintain

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
that with that we could help maintain

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.890 
that with that we could help maintain
some<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.640> our<00:02:23.850> winner<00:02:24.120> our<00:02:24.330> winter<00:02:24.600> heat

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
some of our winner our winter heat

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.840 
some of our winner our winter heat
inside<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.590> here<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.340> lined<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
inside of here then we lined it with the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.210 
inside of here then we lined it with the
tires<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.660> filled<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.530> tires<00:02:28.799> full<00:02:29.100> of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
tires and and filled the tires full of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.759 
tires and and filled the tires full of
dirt<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.730> four<00:02:30.120> more<00:02:30.299> buffer<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.900> thermal<00:02:31.590> mass

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
dirt for four more buffer a thermal mass

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.590 
dirt for four more buffer a thermal mass
so<00:02:31.950> they<00:02:32.069> absorb<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.760> heat<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.239> keeps<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
so they absorb the heat so it keeps the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.940 
so they absorb the heat so it keeps the
heat<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.290> could<00:02:34.380> also<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.739> used

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
heat in here you could also have used

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.430 
heat in here you could also have used
barrels<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.489> water<00:02:35.640> right<00:02:36.239> yes<00:02:36.690> well<00:02:37.049> in<00:02:37.200> fact

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
barrels of water right yes well in fact

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.960 
barrels of water right yes well in fact
I<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.920> greenhouse<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.640> lined<00:02:38.850> with

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
I do have a greenhouse it's lined with

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.390 
I do have a greenhouse it's lined with
55-gallon<00:02:39.720> black<00:02:40.230> barrels<00:02:40.620> take<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> look<00:02:41.310> at

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
55-gallon black barrels take a look at

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.940 
55-gallon black barrels take a look at
that<00:02:41.459> yeah<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.569> this<00:02:43.049> holds<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> heat<00:02:43.680> and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
that yeah but this holds the heat and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.229 
that yeah but this holds the heat and
things<00:02:44.130> are<00:02:44.280> growing<00:02:44.459> in<00:02:44.640> here<00:02:44.819> you've<00:02:45.060> had

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
things are growing in here you've had

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.420 
things are growing in here you've had
some<00:02:45.450> temperatures<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.380> down<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.190> five

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
some temperatures here down to five

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.699 
some temperatures here down to five
degrees<00:02:47.640> five<00:02:48.030> degrees<00:02:48.390> yes<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> husband<00:02:49.380> so

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
degrees five degrees yes a husband so

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.319 
degrees five degrees yes a husband so
this<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.040> stayed<00:02:50.250> alive<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.880> healthy<00:02:51.030> with

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
this is stayed alive and healthy with

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:51.860 
this is stayed alive and healthy with
what<00:02:51.480> you've<00:02:51.660> got

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
what you've got

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.900 
what you've got
even<00:02:52.140> at<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.320> temperature<00:02:52.620> mm-hmm<00:02:53.430> okay<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
even at that temperature mm-hmm okay and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.910 
even at that temperature mm-hmm okay and
in<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> structure<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> frame<00:02:55.109> right<00:02:55.560> well

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
in the structure of the frame right well

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.560 
in the structure of the frame right well
we<00:02:56.130> started<00:02:56.400> off<00:02:56.519> with<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.820> with<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.329> middle

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
we started off with that with the middle

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.810 
we started off with that with the middle
struts<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:58.590> we<00:02:58.769> reinforced<00:02:59.489> them<00:02:59.640> with

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
struts and then we reinforced them with

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.240 
struts and then we reinforced them with
PVC<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> pretty<00:03:01.739> sturdy<00:03:02.070> little

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
PVC and it's a pretty sturdy little

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.460 
PVC and it's a pretty sturdy little
greenhouse<00:03:02.730> Chris<00:03:03.329> being<00:03:03.600> lower<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.200> winds

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
greenhouse Chris being lower the winds

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.560 
greenhouse Chris being lower the winds
don't<00:03:04.590> bother<00:03:04.859> it<00:03:05.160> like<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.609> higher<00:03:06.090> structure

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
don't bother it like a higher structure

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.009 
don't bother it like a higher structure
would<00:03:06.720> do<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:08.000> then<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.030> heat<00:03:09.359> I<00:03:09.570> hate<00:03:09.870> it

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
would do and then I heat I hate it

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.780 
would do and then I heat I hate it
supplemental<00:03:10.650> heat<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.890> with<00:03:11.010> my<00:03:11.160> heat<00:03:11.459> lamps
