 stiffness the keyboard itself a touchpad 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 large for a product that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.910
 however of an ultramobile category 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 let's talk about a chromebook then a 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.820
 computer that gives its best when 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.079
 has wifi connectivity the system is based 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 clearly on a number of applications 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.379
 that may have gone to call back 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.149
 for free or purchased on the web store 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.370
 of chrome 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.190
 the applications are really many there 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.820
 allow both to play and instead of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.600
 range in productivity with one 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.750
 series of alternatives that are not from 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.210
 minus those that are not offered today 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.000
 in the world of tablets is a product that 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.130
 currently not 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.250
 does not have a launch date for the market 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.280
 Italian but which is already available in 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.430
 other European markets such as the 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.260
 near france 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.890
 let's see the product from close up 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.720
 chromebook highlights its nature 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.180
 through also the insertion in the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 part of the back cover of the logo of 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.250
 chrome 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.810
 we talk about a very very product 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.920
 subtle but that complements the regions 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.910
 45 vga output a hdmi a usb up 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.840
 this side and rotating we can find 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.539
 other b clearly the outlet for the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.490
 anti theft safety hook

 kensington 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.690
 here we have the attack for the adapter plug 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.030
 and the headphone output in the back part 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.590
 cover we can see as well as the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.690
 battery can be removed e 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.430
 possibly replaced if necessary or 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.040
 a second battery can be used 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.380
 in order to still have a guarantee of 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.420
 even longer duration 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.660

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.489
