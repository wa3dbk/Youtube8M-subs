00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.800 
it's 4,000 from top to bottom so it'll
be<00:01:14.189> about<00:01:14.369> 3,000<00:01:15.180> that's<00:01:15.330> beneath<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
be about 3,000 that's beneath the

the<00:01:17.850> next<00:01:18.060> phase<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> caves<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:19.020> gonna<00:01:19.140> go

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the next phase of caves it's gonna go

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.660 
the next phase of caves it's gonna go
all<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> way<00:01:19.710> down<00:01:19.799> we're<00:01:20.070> gonna<00:01:20.130> spread<00:01:20.520> the

of<00:01:33.360> levels<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.869> caves<00:01:34.170> being<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.650> put<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.159> well

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
of levels of caves being it put in well

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.249 
of levels of caves being it put in well
we're<00:01:35.820> working<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> right<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.509> we're

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we're working on it right now we're

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.780 
we're working on it right now we're
working<00:01:37.290> every<00:01:38.009> time<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.280> release<00:01:38.400> something

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
working every time we release something

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.980 
working every time we release something
we're<00:01:39.030> doing<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.329> an<00:01:39.509> iterative<00:01:39.810> fashion

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
we're doing in an iterative fashion

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
we're doing in an iterative fashion
we're<00:01:40.740> working<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.340> our<00:01:41.549> players<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.420> know

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

we're working with our players you know
collaborating<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.409> make<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> best<00:01:43.829> game

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
collaborating to make the best game

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
collaborating to make the best game
possible<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.880> got<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.630> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
possible so we got this out there so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.080 
possible so we got this out there so
that<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.500> players<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:47.130> ideas

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that we can see what players think ideas

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
that we can see what players think ideas
that<00:01:48.299> they<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.630> concerns<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.009> can

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
that they have concerns and then we can

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039 
that they have concerns and then we can
also<00:01:50.250> optimize<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.570> add

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
also optimize it so that we can then add

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.770 
also optimize it so that we can then add
that<00:01:52.290> extra<00:01:52.470> depth<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> would<00:01:53.790> expect<00:01:54.119> hmm

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that extra depth so I would expect hmm

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
that extra depth so I would expect hmm
next<00:01:55.320> few<00:01:55.590> months<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.950> what<00:01:56.460> we're<00:01:56.549> gonna<00:01:56.670> aim

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
next few months is what we're gonna aim

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.870 
next few months is what we're gonna aim

bending
and<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.890> swimming<00:02:11.400> animations<00:02:11.819> are<00:02:11.970> cool

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and so the swimming animations are cool

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.140 
came up with that and how like how
realistic<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.319> well<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.909> swimming

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
realistic that is well for the swimming

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.990 
realistic that is well for the swimming

what they really they have a focus on
detail<00:02:23.549> our<00:02:24.480> animation<00:02:25.110> team<00:02:25.260> wants<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.709> make

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
detail our animation team wants to make

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.199 
detail our animation team wants to make
sure<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.159> everything<00:02:26.190> looks<00:02:26.519> really<00:02:27.060> good

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209

and<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.659> as<00:02:28.140> realistic<00:02:28.769> as<00:02:28.860> possible<00:02:28.920> I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
and is is as realistic as possible I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.589 
and is is as realistic as possible I
mean<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.700> point<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.390> swimming

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
mean to the point that for the swimming

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.140 
mean to the point that for the swimming
animations<00:02:31.079> we<00:02:31.620> were<00:02:31.769> analyzing<00:02:32.220> well<00:02:32.760> can

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
animations we were analyzing well can

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.449 
animations we were analyzing well can
you<00:02:33.269> actually<00:02:33.420> swim<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.200> way<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:35.129> does<00:02:35.310> it

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
you actually swim that way it does it

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.009 
you actually swim that way it does it
look<00:02:35.610> right<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.180> does<00:02:36.329> it<00:02:36.420> feel<00:02:36.599> right<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.900> that

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
look right it does it feel right is that

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.059 
look right it does it feel right is that
something<00:02:37.319> somebody<00:02:37.500> would<00:02:37.709> do<00:02:37.799> in<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> real

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
something somebody would do in the real

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.680 
something somebody would do in the real
world<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:38.849> tweaked<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.329> make<00:02:39.510> sure

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
world and we tweaked it to make sure

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.050 
world and we tweaked it to make sure
that<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> was<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.860> know<00:02:40.890> not<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.790> just

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
that it was you know not so that it just

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.130 
that it was you know not so that it just
looked<00:02:42.299> good<00:02:42.359> but<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.870> was<00:02:42.900> actually

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
looked good but that it was actually

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.050 
looked good but that it was actually
realistic<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.400> made<00:02:44.609> sense<00:02:44.760> right

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
realistic so that it made sense right

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.430 
realistic so that it made sense right
right<00:02:45.269> yeah<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.140> swimming

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
right yeah the the the swimming

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.319 
right yeah the the the swimming
backwards<00:02:46.650> was<00:02:46.980> awesome<00:02:47.280> yeah<00:02:47.640> yeah<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.239> we

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
backwards was awesome yeah yeah that we

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.880 
backwards was awesome yeah yeah that we
have<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> swim<00:02:49.200> back<00:02:49.379> animation<00:02:49.829> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
have a we have a swim back animation a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.650 
have a we have a swim back animation a
lot<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.129> games<00:02:50.310> oftentimes<00:02:50.910> just<00:02:51.329> turn<00:02:51.540> you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
