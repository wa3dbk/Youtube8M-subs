 the fake one is a terrible fire 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.900
 inside city palace with 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.130
 so much smoke injured and emergency vehicles 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.390
 intervened in sirens explained 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.850
 the initiative took place in the area 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.770
 of the three evenings the arts nor organized 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.020
 from the consultation of associations with 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.910

 volunteer street games for 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.410
 activities that took place in the room 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.540
 horsewoman and khobar burn a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.820
 city ​​palace the third 12 to talk to us 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.140
 been the law enforcement make us 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.630
 a report to us as SOS 27 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.480
 we arrive who must enter by 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.520
 see what happens inside 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.129
 this is one of our principles vi 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.860
 let's say goals we do say 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.350
 the evacuation of winners or first aid 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.899
 and so on we say a situation that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.170
 dealt with quite frequently 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.820
 sometimes we say we face it though 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.180
 we say also serves for the boys for 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.250
 let's say be ready in case of 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.200
 calamity or an event let's say del 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.100
 genre is a simulation that 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.950
 basically for the most part reflects 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.260
 what could be an event that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.180
 it could be verified as it is us 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.680
 that the greenhouse we are part of the coc of the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.750
 common of a third 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.450
 then we preferred to do this 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.430
 joint simulation we will intervene 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.920
 at the time they are encountered 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.370
 from the presence of wounded such as 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 could be 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.220
 of polytraumatized or why not also 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.870
 of people without knowledge of the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.710
 unconscious people this simulation 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.000
 provides cardiopulmonary resuscitation 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.980
 through the use of the maneuvers of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.570
 cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.370
 use of the defibrillator as 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.619
 you can see the operators are 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.110
 operating the cardiac massage and the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.170
 defibrillator is practically doing 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.660
 a rhythm analysis to determine the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.460
 its we say ability to download a 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.250
 defibrillate a different heart 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.960
 lartin and involved associations here in 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.730
 what this three program is 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.530
 days full of appointments 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.480
 in practice we tried to give one 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.250
 greater visibility to all 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.870
 associations present on the territory but 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.090
 especially to those associations 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.320
 enrolled in the consultation of which I am the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.990
 president 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.050
 these associations most do not 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.750
 all because as the consult the if 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.670
 contains many associations both those 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.220
 health and social care and those at level 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.260
 tourist is that one that to the protection 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.870
 civil like the one we're going to see 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.610
 in a while of the prevention of 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.830
 of the fire- fighting made by the greenhouses ed 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.730
 in the light we will have all these situations 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.830
 a little pitted during these days 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.730
 for example there was on the part of the pro 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.739
 loco of the ravine 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.650
 a beautiful initiative dedicated to children 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.020
 has therefore the children participated in 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.540
 of medieval games you play 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.190
 they did street games many years ago 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.560
 then we made three associations 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.959
 along my door that the foundation 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.420
 ant most national cancer association 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.280
 the hurricane is more the association together 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.380
 to grow we have organized this 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.660
 evening a burraco tournament that sees 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.100
 there are always so many people involved 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.260
 many participants 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.450
 the commitment of this three days is that 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.280
 to give a greater chance for 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.560
 avoid displacement only three times 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.590
 year these things but to try to 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.300
 make it an event a commitment 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.280
 per month to give visibility for 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.980
 all year round like you said we were right 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.860
 we are working hard 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.730
 for a fundraiser for a 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:57.810
 defibrillator in a fixed location in 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.220
 how much we believe we are protecting 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.550
 people 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.960
 and maybe ready for a bad day 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.510
 we are ready also those of competence a 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.450
 use such equipment on 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.860
 volunteering is developing 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.500
 a lot in fact this association 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.230
 it is growing as it goes on 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.900
 we see that it is also known on 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.990
 territory we have on the territory one 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.880
