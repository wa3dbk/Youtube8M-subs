gonna leave its special attack boost and

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.580 
gonna leave its special attack boost and
go<00:02:06.039> into<00:02:06.459> maybe<00:02:07.329> goodra<00:02:07.840> again<00:02:08.110> maybe<00:02:08.440> he

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
go into maybe goodra again maybe he

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.080 
go into maybe goodra again maybe he
expected<00:02:09.039> he<00:02:09.099> was<00:02:09.220> faster<00:02:09.610> maybe<00:02:09.759> that<00:02:09.940> was<00:02:10.030> a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
expected he was faster maybe that was a

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.940 
expected he was faster maybe that was a
speed<00:02:10.390> tag<00:02:10.630> maybe<00:02:11.260> that's<00:02:11.440> what's<00:02:11.620> up<00:02:11.739> yep

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
speed tag maybe that's what's up yep

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.430 
speed tag maybe that's what's up yep
probably<00:02:12.730> expecting<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.239> win<00:02:13.450> or<00:02:13.840> go<00:02:14.019> faster

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
probably expecting to win or go faster

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.380 
probably expecting to win or go faster
and<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:14.709> get<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.250> have<00:02:15.549> goodra<00:02:15.970> soak<00:02:16.269> up

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and then get out and have goodra soak up

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.870 
and then get out and have goodra soak up
the<00:02:16.510> damage<00:02:16.690> not<00:02:17.110> gonna<00:02:17.319> happen<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.739> time

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
the damage not gonna happen this time

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.309 
the damage not gonna happen this time

mess<00:03:05.769> with<00:03:05.799> protein<00:03:06.459> greninja<00:03:07.030> because

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
mess with protein greninja because

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.069 
mess with protein greninja because
he<00:03:08.610> will<00:03:10.040> bend<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.250> over<00:03:11.900> manectric<00:03:12.900> comes

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
he will bend you over manectric comes

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.589 
he will bend you over manectric comes
back<00:03:13.290> out<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.610> his<00:03:14.700> mega<00:03:14.909> form<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:15.450> it's

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
back out and in his mega form so it's

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.630 
back out and in his mega form so it's
wicked<00:03:15.930> fast<00:03:16.140> goes<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.159> overheat<00:03:17.610> because

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
wicked fast goes to the overheat because

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.559 
wicked fast goes to the overheat because
greninja<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.569> ice<00:03:19.140> right<00:03:19.530> now<00:03:20.450> because<00:03:21.450> this

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
greninja is ice right now because this

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.949 
greninja is ice right now because this
is<00:03:21.629> focused<00:03:22.019> ash<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.680> indeed<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.129> focus<00:03:23.700> sash

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
is focused ash it is indeed a focus sash

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.440 
is focused ash it is indeed a focus sash
so<00:03:24.959> greninja<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.409> gonna<00:03:25.560> survive<00:03:26.450> probably

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
so greninja is gonna survive probably

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.440 
so greninja is gonna survive probably
why<00:03:27.569> he<00:03:27.720> stayed<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:28.140> um<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.489> go<00:03:29.760> with<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> surf

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450
