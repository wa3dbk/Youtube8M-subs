 wonderful and beautiful we are going to 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.550
 take advantage of doing today in the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.320
 dynamic tension exercises for 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.449
 gain resistance at waist level 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.629
 scapular or the upper back what 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.210
 includes trapezius shoulders and rhomboids ok 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.339
 then the first exercise maria goes to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.409
 place and you're going to do extension towards 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.380
 the sides with arms outstretched 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.110
 that's you're going to save a break is not that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.150
 the league between relaxation that keeps 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.710
 the resistance of the league and you give 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.420
 remember that the double is going to be 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.490
 according to the resistance they have 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 you or according to the resistance that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.430
 can they handle the league ok 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.870
 today we are going to do three series of 15 or 20 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.100
 repetitions 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.400
 as we saw earlier we are going to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.560
 work there what is back shoulder 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.830
 let's work trapezium and rhomboid 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.830
 hockey 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.689
 that we go to the other exercise in another 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.610
 exercise some more doubles because in 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.530
 This will make the gesture that makes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.630
 the swordsman or the person he uses 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.700
 swords when you take it out because you must use 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.870
 shoulder strength should use the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.060
 sterrato force 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.920
 and must use the dorsal strength 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.869
 then we will work doing that 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.150
 movement and let's do it is that 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.520
 between relaxation keep it here that's 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.160
 We will work on the basis of three series 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.260
 of 15 or 20 reps and we do 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.660
 always the pause we keep the pause 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.780
 we use the attention to work the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.780
 resistance 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.880
 that we're going to work the other side 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.739
 exactly and you have here you take 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.000
 you come back out that's there's a job 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.410
 the shoulder is being worked on 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.720
 later is also working 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.470
 triceps is working the dorsal and what 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.470
 a while ago ok 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.260
 let's go to the other exercise going to raise 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.870
 arms and in this exercise is going to be a 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.210
 total opening to that until you align the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.210
 arms you go back up keeps it there 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.790
 there we will work what is dorsal 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.860
 let's work triceps biceps let's go to 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.170
 work shoulders besides that as 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.700
 Stability is always worked on 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.410
 the point of view of the resistance of 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.720
 abdomen because I think it's the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.280
 anterior stabilizer of the column by 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.440
 therefore when exercising with members 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.570
 higher the back should stabilize 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.910
 at the bottom ok let's do 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.450
 three series of 15 or 20 repetitions 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.450
 as well 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.700
 also with something we can have in 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.160
 any part in the wallet rolling 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.470
 in the ship exactly that is to say there is no 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.140
 excuses for where you are from 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.180
