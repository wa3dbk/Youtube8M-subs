00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:03.890 
hi this is Craig Rosenfeld from loop

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.019 
hi this is Craig Rosenfeld from loop
today<00:00:04.890> I'm<00:00:05.009> going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> show<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:05.549> how<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.790> do

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
today I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.670 
today I'm going to show you how to do
the<00:00:06.210> herringbone<00:00:06.690> stitch<00:00:07.020> for<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
the herringbone stitch for the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.089 
the herringbone stitch for the
herringbone<00:00:08.040> neck<00:00:08.429> or<00:00:08.700> Myr<00:00:09.320> this<00:00:10.320> requires<00:00:10.860> an

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
herringbone neck or Myr this requires an

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.049 
herringbone neck or Myr this requires an
even<00:00:11.490> number<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.790> stitches<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.599> cast<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.290> 12

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
even number of stitches so I cast on 12

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.060 
even number of stitches so I cast on 12
just<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.120> have<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> little<00:00:15.540> piece<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.619> work<00:00:16.830> on

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
just to have a little piece to work on

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
just to have a little piece to work on
I've<00:00:17.940> already<00:00:18.180> done<00:00:18.359> two<00:00:18.660> rows<00:00:18.990> which<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> why

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
I've already done two rows which is why

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.529 
I've already done two rows which is why
the<00:00:19.619> stitches<00:00:20.100> aren't<00:00:20.310> spread<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> way

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the stitches aren't spread out the way

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.810 
the stitches aren't spread out the way
they<00:00:21.689> normally<00:00:21.900> would<00:00:22.350> be

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
they normally would be

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.189 
they normally would be
so<00:00:23.820> we're<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.119> start<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.449> Row<00:00:24.689> 1<00:00:24.720> which

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
so we're going to start with Row 1 which

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.519 
so we're going to start with Row 1 which
is<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> knit<00:00:25.710> row<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> we're<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.289> knit

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
is the knit row so we're going to knit

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.319 
is the knit row so we're going to knit
one<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.920> repeat<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.700> slip<00:00:33.059> one

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
one and then the repeat is you slip one

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
one and then the repeat is you slip one
knit<00:00:34.670> one<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.559> then<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> tricky

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
knit one and then this is the tricky

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.060 
knit one and then this is the tricky
part<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.760> pass<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> slip<00:00:39.540> stitch<00:00:39.780> over<00:00:40.070> while

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
part you pass the slip stitch over while

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
part you pass the slip stitch over while
knitting<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.489> through<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> back<00:00:41.969> loop<00:00:42.260> but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
knitting it through the back loop but

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.110 
knitting it through the back loop but
really<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.829> insert<00:00:44.309> your<00:00:44.340> needle<00:00:44.730> into

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
really you just insert your needle into

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.709 
really you just insert your needle into
the<00:00:45.300> slip<00:00:45.629> stitch<00:00:46.250> wrap<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> yarn<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.059> then

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the slip stitch wrap the yarn and then

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.290 
the slip stitch wrap the yarn and then
pull<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> slip<00:00:49.379> stitch<00:00:49.620> over<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.460> knit<00:00:51.090> one

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
pull the slip stitch over the knit one

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.400 
pull the slip stitch over the knit one
and<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.840> wrap<00:00:52.039> so<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:54.410> sew

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and the wrap so there you have to sew

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.490 
and the wrap so there you have to sew
your<00:00:55.559> slip<00:00:58.100> knit

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
your slip knit

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.850 
your slip knit
insert<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.580> needle<00:01:01.990> into<00:01:02.990> the<00:01:03.320> slip<00:01:03.620> stitch

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
insert the needle into the slip stitch

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.420 
insert the needle into the slip stitch
wrap<00:01:04.840> pass<00:01:05.840> over<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.290> knit<00:01:06.530> stitch<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.130> the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
wrap pass over the knit stitch and the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.910 
wrap pass over the knit stitch and the
slip<00:01:07.700> stitch<00:01:08.170> that's<00:01:09.170> why<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.440> ends<00:01:09.650> up<00:01:09.740> kind

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
slip stitch that's why the ends up kind

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.700 
slip stitch that's why the ends up kind
of<00:01:10.010> grouped<00:01:10.250> together<00:01:10.490> like<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.530> so<00:01:12.530> there's

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
of grouped together like that so there's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.460 
of grouped together like that so there's
a<00:01:12.770> slip<00:01:14.260> knit<00:01:16.540> insert<00:01:17.540> into<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.960> slip<00:01:18.200> stitch

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
a slip knit insert into the slip stitch

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.780 
a slip knit insert into the slip stitch
wrap<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:21.470> pass<00:01:21.950> over<00:01:24.220> so<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.250> think<00:01:25.340> that's

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
wrap and pass over so I think that's

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.660 
wrap and pass over so I think that's
really<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.210> that's<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.230> part<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:28.010> hard

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
really the that's the part that is hard

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.370 
really the that's the part that is hard
when<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.000> just<00:01:29.210> read<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.540> pattern<00:01:31.900> but<00:01:32.900> once

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
when you just read the pattern but once

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.630 
when you just read the pattern but once
you<00:01:33.590> get<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.920> hang<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.190> this<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.490> actually

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
you get the hang of this you actually

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
you get the hang of this you actually
can<00:01:35.000> go<00:01:35.180> pretty<00:01:35.570> quickly

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.020 

well<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:41.850> pull<00:01:42.240> over<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:44.730> at<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
well I'm pull over and then so at the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.970 
well I'm pull over and then so at the
end<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.720> should<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.350> same<00:01:46.560> number<00:01:46.920> of

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
end you should have the same number of

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.790 
end you should have the same number of
stitches<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.610> that's<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.120> to<00:01:48.180> check

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
stitches so that's a good way to check

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.090 
stitches so that's a good way to check
we<00:01:49.800> have<00:01:49.830> two<00:01:50.370> four<00:01:51.560> six<00:01:52.560> eight<00:01:52.950> ten<00:01:53.430> twelve

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
we have two four six eight ten twelve

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.270 
we have two four six eight ten twelve
okay<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.160> now<00:01:56.600> Row<00:01:57.600> two<00:01:57.660> is<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.350> row<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.190> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
okay so now Row two is the row where you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.930 
okay so now Row two is the row where you
purl<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.830> little<00:02:02.220> tricky<00:02:02.580> as<00:02:02.700> well

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
purl and it is a little tricky as well

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.609 
purl and it is a little tricky as well
you<00:02:03.210> insert<00:02:03.869> two<00:02:04.350> purl<00:02:04.619> two<00:02:04.830> together<00:02:06.619> you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
you insert two purl two together you

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
you insert two purl two together you
wrap<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.100> pull<00:02:08.310> through<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> normally

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
wrap and pull through like you normally

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.470 
wrap and pull through like you normally
would<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.080> now<00:02:10.320> you're<00:02:10.590> gonna<00:02:10.709> go<00:02:10.950> back<00:02:11.480> into

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
would but now you're gonna go back into

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.790 
would but now you're gonna go back into
the<00:02:12.810> stitch<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.260> front<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.890> purl<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.580> again

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
the stitch in front and purl it again

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.229 
the stitch in front and purl it again
pull<00:02:16.800> through<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.370> then<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.730> drop<00:02:17.970> both

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
pull through and then you drop both

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.100 
pull through and then you drop both
stitches<00:02:18.570> off<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.900> left<00:02:19.350> needle

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
stitches off the left needle

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.790 
stitches off the left needle
so<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.260> insert<00:02:22.860> into<00:02:23.070> two<00:02:24.320> wrap<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.590> pull

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
so it's insert into two wrap and pull

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.229 
so it's insert into two wrap and pull
through<00:02:27.230> insert<00:02:28.230> into<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.680> first<00:02:29.010> one<00:02:29.310> wrap

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
through insert into the first one wrap

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.680
