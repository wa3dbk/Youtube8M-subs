00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.220 

I<00:00:08.720> became<00:00:09.720> a<00:00:09.800> very<00:00:10.800> aware<00:00:11.100> of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.820> sort<00:00:12.059> of

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
I became a very aware of the sort of

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.560 
I became a very aware of the sort of
issues<00:00:13.230> regarding<00:00:13.830> food<00:00:14.160> waste<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.879> just

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
issues regarding food waste and just

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.870 
issues regarding food waste and just
waste<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.990> general<00:00:16.380> it<00:00:16.680> became<00:00:17.099> a<00:00:17.369> problem<00:00:17.580> for

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
waste in general it became a problem for

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.600 
waste in general it became a problem for
me<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> had<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.689> do<00:00:19.410> something<00:00:19.740> about<00:00:19.860> it<00:00:20.160> so

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
me so I had to do something about it so

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.730 
me so I had to do something about it so
began<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.390> idea<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.200> a<00:00:22.290> zero<00:00:22.560> waste

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
began this idea of a zero waste

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.020 
began this idea of a zero waste
restaurant

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.260 

we<00:00:28.930> work<00:00:29.290> directly<00:00:29.560> with<00:00:30.010> the<00:00:30.280> source<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.120> an

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
we work directly with the source of an

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.000 
we work directly with the source of an
ingredient<00:00:31.480> we<00:00:31.960> go<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.200> where<00:00:32.560> something<00:00:32.890> is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
ingredient we go to where something is

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.550 
ingredient we go to where something is
produced<00:00:33.850> or<00:00:34.060> created<00:00:34.600> we<00:00:34.840> say<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.110> them<00:00:35.380> look

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
produced or created we say to them look

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.040 
produced or created we say to them look
we<00:00:36.100> cannot<00:00:36.640> deal<00:00:36.940> with<00:00:36.970> any<00:00:37.240> packaging<00:00:37.810> we

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
we cannot deal with any packaging we

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.250 
we cannot deal with any packaging we
have<00:00:38.080> no<00:00:38.410> bin<00:00:38.650> so<00:00:39.370> what<00:00:39.580> we<00:00:39.730> need<00:00:39.880> to<00:00:39.910> do<00:00:40.240> is<00:00:40.540> get

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
have no bin so what we need to do is get

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.830 
have no bin so what we need to do is get
your<00:00:41.410> product<00:00:42.100> from<00:00:42.490> here<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:43.240> our<00:00:43.360> restaurant

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
your product from here so our restaurant

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.740 
your product from here so our restaurant
in<00:00:43.990> a<00:00:44.530> vessel<00:00:44.770> in<00:00:45.580> which<00:00:45.790> can<00:00:46.030> endlessly<00:00:46.510> be

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
in a vessel in which can endlessly be

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.220 
in a vessel in which can endlessly be
reused<00:00:47.200> so<00:00:47.739> it's<00:00:47.890> an<00:00:47.950> endless<00:00:48.190> cycle<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:49.230> you

infrastructure<00:00:53.020> of<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.380> food<00:00:53.590> industry<00:00:54.220> is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
infrastructure of the food industry is

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.180 
infrastructure of the food industry is
built<00:00:54.670> for<00:00:55.330> convenience<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.170> choice<00:00:56.410> mean<00:00:56.950> is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
built for convenience and choice mean is

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.640 
built for convenience and choice mean is
that<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.520> food<00:00:57.820> is<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.870> certain<00:00:59.110> nature

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
that the food is of a certain nature

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.060 
that the food is of a certain nature
which<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.940> lack<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.420> nature<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.440> food<00:01:02.710> is<00:01:02.860> not

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
which is a lack of nature so food is not

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.580 
which is a lack of nature so food is not
very<00:01:03.370> alive<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.390> when<00:01:04.540> food<00:01:04.720> isn't<00:01:04.900> alive<00:01:05.320> it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
very alive and when food isn't alive it

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.310 
very alive and when food isn't alive it
typically<00:01:06.280> is<00:01:06.610> packaged<00:01:07.390> when<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.140> food

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
typically is packaged when the food

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.230 
typically is packaged when the food
industry<00:01:08.800> is<00:01:08.860> so<00:01:09.100> built<00:01:09.400> on<00:01:09.670> these<00:01:10.000> ideas

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
industry is so built on these ideas

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.350 
industry is so built on these ideas
convenience<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.200> choice<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:12.130> makes<00:01:12.700> our<00:01:12.970> life

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
convenience a choice it makes our life

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.440 
convenience a choice it makes our life
very<00:01:13.960> difficult<00:01:14.170> if<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.920> buy<00:01:15.159> ingredients

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
very difficult if you buy ingredients

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.320 
very difficult if you buy ingredients
from<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.630> source<00:01:16.870> in<00:01:17.170> its<00:01:17.770> whole<00:01:18.070> form<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:19.180> is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
from the source in its whole form it is

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.000 
from the source in its whole form it is
so<00:01:19.540> much<00:01:19.720> cheaper<00:01:19.960> now<00:01:20.500> people<00:01:20.740> say<00:01:20.860> well

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
so much cheaper now people say well

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.990 
so much cheaper now people say well
isn't<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.370> lot<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.580> hard<00:01:21.729> work<00:01:21.790> no

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.639 

the<00:01:30.000> compost<00:01:30.329> machine<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.990> anaerobic

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
the compost machine is a anaerobic

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.709 
the compost machine is a anaerobic
digester<00:01:32.280> which<00:01:32.759> works<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> human

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
digester which works like a human

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.350 
digester which works like a human
stomach<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.100> warm<00:01:35.549> environment<00:01:36.180> with

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
stomach so it's a warm environment with

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.539 
stomach so it's a warm environment with
lots<00:01:36.539> of<00:01:36.659> microbes<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.740> bacterial<00:01:38.520> culture

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
lots of microbes or a bacterial culture

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.539 
lots of microbes or a bacterial culture
which<00:01:39.420> breaks<00:01:39.750> down<00:01:40.020> food<00:01:40.350> rapidly<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:41.369> like

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
which breaks down food rapidly just like

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.660 
which breaks down food rapidly just like
a<00:01:41.579> stomach

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
a stomach

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.539 
a stomach

as a business model a typical restaurant

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.660 
as a business model a typical restaurant
might<00:01:46.909> work<00:01:47.119> at<00:01:47.390> 30%<00:01:48.200> staff<00:01:48.619> costs<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.340> 30%

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
material waste generated in this space

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.630 
material waste generated in this space
and<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.599> kind<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.930> amazing<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.590> think<00:02:17.430> it's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and that's kind of amazing I think it's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.830 
and that's kind of amazing I think it's
just<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.239> world<00:02:18.480> needs<00:02:19.040> less<00:02:20.040> waste<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.840> it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
just the world needs less waste and it
