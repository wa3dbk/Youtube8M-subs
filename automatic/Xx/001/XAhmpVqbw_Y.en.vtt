hi<00:00:05.150> I'm<00:00:05.360> Jenny<00:00:05.600> C<00:00:05.840> and<00:00:05.990> I'm<00:00:06.080> here<00:00:06.230> to<00:00:06.320> talk<00:00:06.470> to

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
hi I'm Jenny C and I'm here to talk to

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.640 
hi I'm Jenny C and I'm here to talk to
you<00:00:06.740> about<00:00:06.970> schizophrenia<00:00:07.970> in<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:08.210> brain<00:00:08.650> so

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
you about schizophrenia in the brain so

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.200 
you about schizophrenia in the brain so
there<00:00:09.950> are<00:00:10.010> a<00:00:10.040> couple<00:00:10.100> of<00:00:10.460> things<00:00:10.700> that<00:00:10.760> we<00:00:11.000> see

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
there are a couple of things that we see

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.529 
there are a couple of things that we see
in<00:00:12.020> brain<00:00:12.350> development<00:00:13.030> for<00:00:14.030> people<00:00:14.450> with

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
in brain development for people with

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.029 
in brain development for people with
schizophrenia<00:00:15.400> one<00:00:16.810> one<00:00:17.810> area<00:00:18.230> we<00:00:18.440> have

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
schizophrenia one one area we have

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.880 
schizophrenia one one area we have
learned<00:00:19.280> some<00:00:19.550> things<00:00:19.760> about<00:00:20.000> is<00:00:20.300> the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
learned some things about is the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.720 
learned some things about is the
neurotransmitters<00:00:21.890> or<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:22.190> chemicals<00:00:22.610> in

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
neurotransmitters or the chemicals in

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.830 
neurotransmitters or the chemicals in
the<00:00:22.760> brain<00:00:22.940> that<00:00:23.060> are<00:00:23.270> involved<00:00:23.690> in

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
the brain that are involved in

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.450 
the brain that are involved in
schizophrenia<00:00:24.080> a<00:00:24.710> lot<00:00:24.950> of<00:00:25.040> the<00:00:25.160> research

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
schizophrenia a lot of the research

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.250 
schizophrenia a lot of the research
tends<00:00:25.760> to<00:00:25.880> be<00:00:25.940> focused<00:00:26.330> on<00:00:26.480> dopamine<00:00:26.900> and

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
tends to be focused on dopamine and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.330 
tends to be focused on dopamine and
acetylcholine<00:00:27.820> so<00:00:28.820> dopamine<00:00:29.390> was<00:00:30.340> initially

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
acetylcholine so dopamine was initially

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.590 
acetylcholine so dopamine was initially
a<00:00:31.670> focus<00:00:32.390> of<00:00:32.480> research<00:00:32.809> because<00:00:33.260> our<00:00:33.680> earlier

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
a focus of research because our earlier

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.980 
a focus of research because our earlier
antipsychotic<00:00:35.600> medications<00:00:36.400> were<00:00:37.400> all

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
antipsychotic medications were all

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.840 
antipsychotic medications were all
dopamine<00:00:38.990> blockers<00:00:39.560> and<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.250> we<00:00:40.370> knew<00:00:40.550> that<00:00:40.700> if

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
dopamine blockers and so we knew that if

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.870 
dopamine blockers and so we knew that if
you<00:00:40.970> blocked<00:00:41.570> dopamine<00:00:42.140> in<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.290> brain<00:00:42.880> some

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
you blocked dopamine in the brain some

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.670 
you blocked dopamine in the brain some
of<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.450> positive<00:00:44.660> symptoms<00:00:45.110> like

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
of the the positive symptoms like

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.770 
of the the positive symptoms like
delusions<00:00:46.220> or<00:00:46.310> hallucinations<00:00:46.780> would

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
delusions or hallucinations would

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.040 
delusions or hallucinations would
subside<00:00:48.530> or<00:00:48.560> go<00:00:48.829> away<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.970> so<00:00:50.210> there's<00:00:50.420> we

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
subside or go away and so there's we

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.050 
subside or go away and so there's we
know<00:00:51.200> that<00:00:51.380> that's<00:00:51.530> implicated<00:00:52.220> acetal

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
know that that's implicated acetal

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.710 
know that that's implicated acetal
choline<00:00:53.510> also<00:00:53.870> seems<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.320> be<00:00:54.500> involved<00:00:55.399> as<00:00:55.720> in

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
choline also seems to be involved as in

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.840 
choline also seems to be involved as in
in<00:00:57.200> interacting<00:00:57.890> with<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.130> dopamine<00:00:58.579> but

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
in interacting with the dopamine but

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.120 
in interacting with the dopamine but
also<00:00:59.030> independently<00:00:59.989> in<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.590> some<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
also independently in in some of the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.090 
also independently in in some of the
symptoms<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.550> schizophrenia<00:01:02.620> we<00:01:03.620> also<00:01:03.860> know

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
symptoms of schizophrenia we also know

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.899 
symptoms of schizophrenia we also know
we're<00:01:04.820> doing<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.210> lot<00:01:05.390> of<00:01:05.420> research<00:01:05.689> too<00:01:06.350> on<00:01:06.909> the

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
we're doing a lot of research too on the

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.600 
we're doing a lot of research too on the
structure<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.840> brain<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.320> schizophrenia

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
structure of the brain in schizophrenia

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.780 
structure of the brain in schizophrenia
what<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:10.729> know<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:12.370> cortex<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:13.700> the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
what we know is that the cortex of the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.330 
what we know is that the cortex of the
brain<00:01:13.970> or<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.020> gray<00:01:15.229> matter<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.770> brain<00:01:15.860> is

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
brain or the gray matter in the brain is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.880 
brain or the gray matter in the brain is
thinner<00:01:17.090> in<00:01:17.390> people<00:01:17.810> with<00:01:17.960> schizophrenia<00:01:18.049> and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
thinner in people with schizophrenia and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.180 
thinner in people with schizophrenia and
that<00:01:19.430> there<00:01:19.610> seems<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.090> be<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.270> lower<00:01:20.960> volume<00:01:21.860> of

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
that there seems to be a lower volume of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.690 
that there seems to be a lower volume of
brain<00:01:22.369> tissue<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.020> decreases<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.700> brain

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
brain tissue and decreases in brain

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.820 
brain tissue and decreases in brain
volumes<00:01:26.060> over<00:01:26.299> time<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:27.020> things<00:01:27.650> that

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
volumes over time and things that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.130 
volumes over time and things that
contribute<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.610> those<00:01:29.090> decreases<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.990> volume

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
contribute to those decreases in volume

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.460 
contribute to those decreases in volume
include<00:01:30.740> both<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.610> number<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:31.970> relapses<00:01:32.840> that

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
include both the number of relapses that

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.230 
include both the number of relapses that
somebody<00:01:33.860> might<00:01:34.100> have<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.460> schizophrenia<00:01:35.119> so

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
somebody might have on schizophrenia so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.080 
somebody might have on schizophrenia so
the<00:01:35.360> amount<00:01:35.900> of<00:01:35.960> times<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.320> they<00:01:36.500> get<00:01:36.680> sick

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
the amount of times that they get sick

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.149 
the amount of times that they get sick
but<00:01:38.090> also<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.869> medications<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.590> we<00:01:39.710> use<00:01:39.950> to

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
but also the medications that we use to

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.370 
but also the medications that we use to
treat<00:01:40.369> schizophrenia<00:01:40.670> may<00:01:41.630> decrease<00:01:42.020> brain

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
treat schizophrenia may decrease brain

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.590 
treat schizophrenia may decrease brain
volume<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.010> it's<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.220> bit<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.520> catch-22<00:01:43.939> and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
volume so it's a bit of a catch-22 and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.950 
volume so it's a bit of a catch-22 and
our<00:01:45.229> science<00:01:46.189> is<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:46.490> crude<00:01:46.760> that<00:01:46.970> we<00:01:47.750> don't

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
our science is so crude that we don't

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.590 
our science is so crude that we don't
necessarily<00:01:48.080> know<00:01:48.799> what<00:01:49.159> these<00:01:49.939> decreases<00:01:50.240> in

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
necessarily know what these decreases in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.460 
necessarily know what these decreases in
volume<00:01:50.720> represent<00:01:51.530> however<00:01:52.220> we<00:01:52.460> know<00:01:52.670> that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
volume represent however we know that

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.830 
volume represent however we know that
you<00:01:54.470> know<00:01:54.590> both<00:01:54.920> both<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.729> disease<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.360> its

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
you know both both the disease and its

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.960 
you know both both the disease and its
treatment<00:01:57.080> may<00:01:57.380> decrease<00:01:57.710> volumes<00:01:58.280> which<00:01:58.490> is

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
treatment may decrease volumes which is

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.890 
treatment may decrease volumes which is
bad<00:01:59.330> news

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
bad news

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.749 
bad news
lots<00:02:00.409> more<00:02:00.560> research<00:02:01.040> needs<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.430> be<00:02:01.490> done

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
lots more research needs to be done

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.520 
lots more research needs to be done
about<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.240> there's<00:02:02.780> been<00:02:02.990> some<00:02:03.200> research

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
about this there's been some research

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.700 
about this there's been some research
too<00:02:03.890> as<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.869> relationship<00:02:05.869> between<00:02:06.049> head

too as to the relationship between head

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.759 
too as to the relationship between head
injury<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.369> schizophrenia<00:02:08.319> this<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:09.470> still

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
injury and schizophrenia this is still

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.970 
injury and schizophrenia this is still
largely<00:02:10.039> inconclusive<00:02:11.000> we<00:02:11.209> don't<00:02:11.420> know<00:02:11.629> that
