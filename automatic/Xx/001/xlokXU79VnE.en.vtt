00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.140 
have my pass in for the trains basically
it's<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> little<00:01:37.729> impasse<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.000> can

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it's like a little impasse that I can

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's like a little impasse that I can
use<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.659> money<00:01:39.960> off<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.770> I've<00:01:40.920> got<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
use to get money off so I've got that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.340 
use to get money off so I've got that
and<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> reason<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> keep<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> front

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and the reason I keep that in the front

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
and the reason I keep that in the front
is<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.920> obviously<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.549> need<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.000> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
is because obviously I need to take it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
is because obviously I need to take it
to<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.390> into<00:01:45.600> uni<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.439> need<00:01:46.500> one

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to get into uni but then I need one

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
to get into uni but then I need one
comment<00:01:47.100> back<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.759> ideal<00:01:48.060> for

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
something I'm looking at for one of my

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.570 
something I'm looking at for one of my
modules<00:06:13.139> and<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.830> last<00:06:14.009> thing<00:06:14.219> I've<00:06:14.340> got<00:06:14.370> in

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
modules and the last thing I've got in

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.089 
modules and the last thing I've got in
here<00:06:14.699> is<00:06:14.880> definitely<00:06:15.569> an<00:06:15.690> essential<00:06:16.259> and<00:06:16.469> it's

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
here is definitely an essential and it's

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.709 
here is definitely an essential and it's
a<00:06:17.250> note<00:06:17.430> pad<00:06:17.610> now<00:06:17.849> what<00:06:18.000> I<00:06:18.029> do<00:06:18.150> is<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.449> just<00:06:18.479> take

my notes and they're for the day and

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.959 
my notes and they're for the day and
then<00:06:22.800> I'll<00:06:22.919> take<00:06:23.130> them<00:06:23.279> out<00:06:23.400> when<00:06:23.550> I<00:06:23.580> get<00:06:23.759> home

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
then I'll take them out when I get home

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.879 
then I'll take them out when I get home
and<00:06:24.180> I'll<00:06:24.300> fail<00:06:24.509> them<00:06:24.750> are<00:06:24.900> we<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.289> a<00:06:25.529> definite

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
and I'll fail them are we and a definite

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.730 
and I'll fail them are we and a definite
folder<00:06:26.190> and<00:06:26.490> so<00:06:27.169> this<00:06:28.169> is<00:06:28.319> the<00:06:28.440> one<00:06:28.590> that<00:06:28.680> I

what I do in as I basically have folders
for<00:07:14.739> each<00:07:14.860> module<00:07:15.219> so<00:07:15.759> here's<00:07:16.209> an<00:07:16.389> example<00:07:16.659> of

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:16.929 
for each module so here's an example of

00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:19.350 
for each module so here's an example of
two<00:07:16.989> of<00:07:17.259> my<00:07:17.469> folders<00:07:17.889> for<00:07:18.159> two<00:07:18.339> modules<00:07:18.819> and<00:07:19.029> I
