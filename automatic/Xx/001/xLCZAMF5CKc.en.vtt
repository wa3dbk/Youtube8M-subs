00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 around 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.310
 as Karl Lagerfeld used to, it also needs some sobbing even if 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.690
 he presented here no new collection special his 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.299
 honored photographic work 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.810
 From 1986 to today 23 years ago, the designer photographed for the first time 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 Sometimes an advertising campaign will be exciting 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.500
 we worried press kit 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.100
 there already l and how i allowed me to talk to him a lot after one 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.500
 third attempt of a same young had in the shoulder of John Allan 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.970
 Greg Henderson and when she had to do so hard 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.120
 We have been rented with camera and employed after send percent down 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.180
 started and made the first with the photos but not in this period 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.180
 and then there's suddenly Bavarian ball over an industrial wasteland 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.920
 and a passion the exhibition in the European House of Photography 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.250
 Paris shows about 150 of his pictures mostly black and white and yet quite 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.210
 different of course fashion photos but also self-portraits nude shots 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.740
 landscapes 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.479
 without buildings like here facades in New York 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.630
 I love architecture 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.030
 that is the opposite of fashion, reason not so a clean sheet and 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.090
 I all love that I can hear alone with the small chamber 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.180
 where i am not a sophie people i have six permanent employees who have stanton under 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 the motto organization but for example now this Eiffel Tower photos and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.300
 Wind gusts want ready advertises and the Westerholt and everything means small 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.950
 camera 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.590
 but also portraits have it done to me here ever US actress Sharon 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.770
 Stone 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.810
 The German Hollywood actress Career Rueger Jack Nicholson or the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 American film director 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.300
 is transferred 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.920
 the DAX put on a portrait is the best photo that one made by me 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.450
 he just has an eye for that presses and the picture is in the box 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.850
 a parent 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.439
 French actress Vanessa Paradis is also enthusiastic about Karl 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.429
 Lagerfeld's photographic create 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.700
 not always great ideas and his pictures are very strong 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 Landshut with a lot of wit and poetry as he laughs at a photo shoot 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.590
 We work a lot and work hard that is a lot of fun 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.909
 I know these as Clooney is currently Karl Lagerfeld's favorite 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.829
 Fashion model the young Frenchman even has an illustrated book this year 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.829
 led and in the exhibition a whole wall 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.180
 but respect for human rights Yahoo 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.479
 Karl knows exactly what she wants 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:45.119
 when he arrives immediately showed the customers to photograph and that goes 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.329
 very quickly because he has everything in his head or counting does not benefit 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.930
 Basler Shaqiri, we have been working together for a while now 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:56.489
 we recognize each other well and understand and puncture the deep sea and so come then 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.829
 also quite nice results while getting out of commerce also in the new one 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:00.889
 pathogen 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.919
 Drug chance 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.919
 be first 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.559
 a large part of the exhibition shows 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.559
 creative experiments of the master 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:16.069
 for these images in American Vogue was top model Imbery Vangelis 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.089
 after hours of conversation 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.959
 the medium photography their 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.179
 the technique children 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:25.869
 from the past and the most modern today the paper you work with 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:27.979
 and all that I think 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.979
 because he has important penalties like photography but that 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.449
 I think that's really interesting 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.039
 but I personally visited 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.169
 As little as possible to use Photoshop if you look a bit 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.419
 Make an effort and so 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.699
 the light right useless farmers photo Schaper the 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.529
 Photojournalist a bit what should follow 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.529
 Comfort can not be Clean for sure 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:55.139
 But multitalented Karl Lagerfeld does not seem to be too busy in the work 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.939
 Contrary to the fashion designer and the photographer complement each other 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.560
 we will connect everything for that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.619
 and that he continues that LÃ¶w 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:09.249
 Willy Division also ne i do not see the photo with an eye height of one 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.359
 Euro the draftsman is said to be building a photographer's graphic element 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.079
 not the creative element in the end betrays Karl Lagerfeld still be 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.279
 Desired motif places 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.289
 the mighty man photographing the Acropolis without people 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.919
 maybe he would have to meet soon in Athens in Paris you can 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.889
 his extensive exhibition still visited until 31 7 on Toprak 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.119
 rank
