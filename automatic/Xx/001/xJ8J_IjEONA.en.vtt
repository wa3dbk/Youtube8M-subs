and you know you're not looking at too
big<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.329> difference<00:04:19.510> but<00:04:19.900> definitely<00:04:20.260> I

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
big of a difference but definitely I

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.490 
big of a difference but definitely I
mean<00:04:20.349> you<00:04:20.530> know<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:21.060> solid<00:04:22.060> inch<00:04:22.270> for<00:04:22.930> sure<00:04:23.140> but

when it comes to the overall bodies and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.890 
when it comes to the overall bodies and
I<00:04:25.419> mean<00:04:25.570> the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
I mean the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.040 
I mean the
I<00:04:25.990> feel<00:04:26.770> as<00:04:27.100> if<00:04:27.160> they're<00:04:28.120> just<00:04:28.150> about<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.900> same

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
I feel as if they're just about the same

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.700 
I feel as if they're just about the same
size<00:04:29.350> i<00:04:29.410> know<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.949> g<00:04:30.340> pad<00:04:30.550> 8.3<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:31.419> 3<00:04:31.750> 38<00:04:32.410> grams

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
size i know the g pad 8.3 is 3 38 grams

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.070 
size i know the g pad 8.3 is 3 38 grams
not<00:04:33.490> sure<00:04:33.699> on<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.000> nexus<00:04:34.330> 7's<00:04:34.630> weight<00:04:34.870> but

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
not sure on the nexus 7's weight but

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.360 
not sure on the nexus 7's weight but
it's<00:04:35.199> got<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.500> be<00:04:35.590> right<00:04:35.889> in<00:04:35.949> the<00:04:36.160> same

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
it's got to be right in the same

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.990 
it's got to be right in the same
ballpark<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:37.810> not<00:04:37.930> too<00:04:38.229> bad<00:04:38.259> but<00:04:39.000> we're

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
ballpark it's not too bad but we're

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.240 
ballpark it's not too bad but we're
going<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.150> be<00:04:40.240> doing<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.509> full<00:04:40.750> full<00:04:41.500> look<00:04:41.830> at

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
going to be doing a full full look at

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.210
