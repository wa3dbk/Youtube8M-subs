00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.080
 we have the gold here today 7 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.400
 we have the old version here 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.189
 and once the new version the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.779
 probably come out in january 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.830
 will be very short old version 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.970
 Again we have two here 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.769
 Monocrystalline solar panels with one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.510
 one has power of 7 wat over here 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.610
 the connection options for usb for 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 purchase the battery in addition to the man 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.710
 Can for the battery pack and additional 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.010
 12 volt connection 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.550
 here is the little bag in addition 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.920
 then used this akkupack 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.379
 can be 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.730
 But now to the exciting question what is 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.890
 new in new in the new version 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.100
 version is this connection module are 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.100
 Stowed in a handy bag and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.189
 though on the back of the panel one does 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 does not have these anymore 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.340
 trinity but only the two 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.150
 craft that also has another 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.350
 big advantage because we can do that now 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 just here again completely city 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.060
 look at 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 here it is on the back you can 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 you have sharp edges and if you have that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.460
 often used and unfavorable and something 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.530
 glad to deal with it can just happen 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.159
 that maybe the corners here 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.990
 that can pierce with the new 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.899
 not happen anymore because it is on the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.740
 solid surface of the solar panel 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.340
 is appropriate 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.540
 as we have heard this now 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.369
 then you can still belong to it 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.110
 plug in 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.110
 for example, just this said 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.970
 then you can all devices with 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.850
 a power up to 7 watts for one 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.950
 It should be enough for a smartphone 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.230
 load with it 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.130
 and otherwise the other details 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.130
