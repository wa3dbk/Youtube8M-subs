they<00:01:48.570> won't<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.890> put<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> little

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
they won't like it so I I put a little

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.069 
they won't like it so I I put a little
bit<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:51.299> could<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.630> used<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.020> it

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
bit in it so they could get used to it

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.050 
bit in it so they could get used to it
mixed<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.740> their<00:01:52.950> normal<00:01:53.189> litter<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
mixed it with their normal litter and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.859 
mixed it with their normal litter and
slowly<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.649> became<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869

slowly you know it became all of the
corn<00:01:58.140> litter<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.509> it's<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.689> really<00:02:00.960> good<00:02:01.110> litter

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.790 
any of you know about Bengal cats which
I<00:02:10.830> didn't<00:02:11.190> before<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.610> got<00:02:11.879> her<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.330> I'm

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
I didn't before I got her and I'm

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.890 
I didn't before I got her and I'm
that<00:02:12.920> person<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.610> know<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.790> lot<00:02:14.090> about<00:02:14.120> cats<00:02:14.630> but

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
that person I know a lot about cats but

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.640 
that person I know a lot about cats but
I<00:02:15.140> guess<00:02:15.920> because<00:02:16.340> they're<00:02:17.050> they're<00:02:18.050> wild

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
I guess because they're they're wild

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.870 
I guess because they're they're wild
they<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.220> wild<00:02:19.580> gene<00:02:20.240> in<00:02:20.570> them<00:02:21.880> they're

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
they have that wild gene in them they're

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.570 
they have that wild gene in them they're
more<00:02:23.270> their<00:02:23.720> urine<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.530> stronger<00:02:25.370> than<00:02:25.520> a

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
more their urine is stronger than a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.000 
more their urine is stronger than a
regular<00:02:25.820> cats<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.710> more<00:02:27.920> potent<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:30.010> wow

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
regular cats so it's more potent and wow

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.480 
regular cats so it's more potent and wow
it<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.310> yeah<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:33.140> with<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.710> corn<00:02:34.070> letter<00:02:34.370> I

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
it is yeah so with this corn letter I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.630 
it is yeah so with this corn letter I
find<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.930> absorbs<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.040> keeps<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
find it it absorbs it and it keeps the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.390 
find it it absorbs it and it keeps the
odors<00:02:37.960> in<00:02:38.960> it's<00:02:39.590> really<00:02:39.950> good<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.370> can
