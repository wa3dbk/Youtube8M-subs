couple<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.219> days<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.760> head<00:00:47.940> towards<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
couple of days as we head towards that

couple of days as we head towards that
big<00:00:48.600> travel<00:00:49.079> day<00:00:49.190> going<00:00:50.190> into<00:00:50.550> Wednesday<00:00:51.000> I'm

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
big travel day going into Wednesday I'm

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.220 
big travel day going into Wednesday I'm
gonna<00:00:51.180> turn<00:00:51.329> off<00:00:51.510> everything<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:52.110> we're

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
gonna turn off everything here we're

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560 
gonna turn off everything here we're
going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> flip<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.610> our<00:00:53.699> model<00:00:54.149> data<00:00:54.300> so

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
going to flip on just our model data so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.670 
going to flip on just our model data so
we<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:54.930> how<00:00:55.050> things<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
we can see how things are going to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
we can see how things are going to
unfold<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> GFS<00:00:57.510> model<00:00:57.539> which<00:00:57.989> I'm

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
unfold this is the GFS model which I'm

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.959 
unfold this is the GFS model which I'm
leaning<00:00:58.559> towards<00:00:58.859> right<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
leaning towards right now because the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.270 
leaning towards right now because the
solution<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:01.079> least<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> track<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> stuff

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
solution at least the track and stuff

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.650 
solution at least the track and stuff
are<00:01:02.489> starting<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.820> make<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.180> sense<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
are starting to make more sense with the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.530 
are starting to make more sense with the
GFS<00:01:04.199> than<00:01:04.439> any<00:01:04.589> other<00:01:04.860> model<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.519> couple<00:01:06.299> things

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
GFS than any other model a couple things

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.640 
GFS than any other model a couple things
you'll<00:01:06.750> notice<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.229> we'll<00:01:07.409> put<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you'll notice you and we'll put the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.289 
you'll notice you and we'll put the
model<00:01:07.979> overlay<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> good<00:01:09.240> idea

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
model overlay on so you get a good idea

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
model overlay on so you get a good idea
on<00:01:09.780> where<00:01:10.409> our<00:01:10.530> system<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> big<00:01:11.369> area<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> high

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.969 
on where our system is big area of high
pressure<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> north<00:01:13.049> we'll<00:01:13.830> go

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
pressure up here to the north we'll go

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
pressure up here to the north we'll go
out<00:01:14.159> into<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> future<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> again<00:01:15.689> just

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
out into the future here and again just

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.350 
out into the future here and again just
see<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.350> color<00:01:16.560> coding<00:01:16.860> these<00:01:17.100> your

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
see the color coding these your

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.660 
see the color coding these your
precipitation<00:01:18.360> types<00:01:18.600> blue<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.350> snow<00:01:19.670> oranges

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
precipitation types blue is snow oranges

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.840 
precipitation types blue is snow oranges
sleet<00:01:21.030> red<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.229> freezing<00:01:22.920> rain<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.310> ice<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
sleet red is freezing rain or ice and

sleet red is freezing rain or ice and
obviously<00:01:24.570> green<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.549> rain<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.909> we'll<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.180> out

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
obviously green is rain so we'll go out

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
obviously green is rain so we'll go out
to<00:01:27.720> tomorrow<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.560> will<00:01:29.009> start<00:01:29.310> getting<00:01:29.460> towards

tomorrow morning you can see the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.249 
tomorrow morning you can see the

precipitation starting to move into our
general<00:01:34.710> direction<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.250> still<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.640> an<00:01:35.759> area

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
general direction we still got an area

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
of high pressure sitting over us as we
go<00:01:37.650> through<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> afternoon<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:39.240> initial

go through the afternoon the initial
moisture<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> tough<00:01:40.470> time

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
moisture is going to have a tough time

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.920 
moisture is going to have a tough time
moving<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.700> i<00:01:41.759> do<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.000> by<00:01:42.869> tomorrow

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
moving in but i do think by tomorrow

moving in but i do think by tomorrow
night<00:01:43.710> monday<00:01:44.340> night<00:01:44.549> we're<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> start

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
night monday night we're going to start

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.030 
night monday night we're going to start
to<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.360> some<00:01:45.390> moisture<00:01:45.899> moving<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.560> lot<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
to see some moisture moving in a lot of

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.980 
to see some moisture moving in a lot of
this<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.399> evaporate<00:01:47.700> before<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.570> reaches

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
this will evaporate before it reaches

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.410 
this will evaporate before it reaches
the<00:01:49.530> ground<00:01:49.770> which<00:01:50.220> means<00:01:50.490> we're<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the ground which means we're going to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.969 
the ground which means we're going to
see<00:01:51.630> some<00:01:51.840> evaporative<00:01:52.320> cooling<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
see some evaporative cooling which you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.889 
see some evaporative cooling which you
further<00:01:53.310> cool<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.909> atmosphere<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> allow

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
further cool the atmosphere and allow

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.420 
further cool the atmosphere and allow
the<00:01:54.960> surface<00:01:55.500> layer<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.009> cold<00:01:56.310> enough

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
the surface layer to get cold enough

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
the surface layer to get cold enough
that<00:01:56.790> we're<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.719> start<00:01:58.020> as

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that we're going to see this start as

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.380 
that we're going to see this start as
ice<00:01:58.350> maybe<00:01:58.770> even<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.310> around<00:01:59.549> Charlotte<00:02:00.000> won't

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
ice maybe even in around Charlotte won't

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.170 
ice maybe even in around Charlotte won't
last<00:02:00.630> long<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.229> ice<00:02:02.040> because<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> warm<00:02:02.909> air

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
last long as ice because the warm air

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.120 
last long as ice because the warm air
aloft<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> overwhelm<00:02:04.320> things<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
aloft is going to overwhelm things and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.399 
aloft is going to overwhelm things and
it<00:02:05.250> actually<00:02:05.729> will<00:02:06.030> rain<00:02:06.299> warm<00:02:06.719> air<00:02:06.990> down<00:02:07.259> to

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
it actually will rain warm air down to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
it actually will rain warm air down to
the<00:02:07.530> surface<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.459> warm<00:02:08.940> is

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the surface now it's going to be warm is

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.510 
the surface now it's going to be warm is
all<00:02:09.300> relative<00:02:09.509> we're<00:02:09.929> talking<00:02:10.319> maybe<00:02:11.099> upper

30s low 40s is not going to
really<00:02:13.510> warm<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.129> warmer<00:02:15.580> than

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
really warm then it's just warmer than

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.460 
mountains are heading up into Virginia
and<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:16.120> later<00:03:16.329> we<00:03:16.569> get<00:03:16.720> on<00:03:16.900> Wednesday<00:03:17.319> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
and the later we get on Wednesday the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.069 
and the later we get on Wednesday the
colder<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.190> gets<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:19.209> we<00:03:19.359> may<00:03:19.569> actually<00:03:19.720> see<00:03:20.049> a

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
colder it gets so we may actually see a

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.099 
colder it gets so we may actually see a
little<00:03:20.319> icy<00:03:20.799> snowy<00:03:21.220> rainy<00:03:22.060> mix<00:03:22.450> even<00:03:22.900> across

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
little icy snowy rainy mix even across

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.809 
little icy snowy rainy mix even across
the<00:03:23.380> Piedmont<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:24.010> by<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.160> time<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
the Piedmont but by this time the

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.150 
the Piedmont but by this time the
moisture<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.690> moving<00:03:26.049> out<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.920> we're<00:03:27.069> not

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
moisture is moving out so we're not

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.979 
moisture is moving out so we're not
looking<00:03:27.370> at<00:03:27.639> a<00:03:27.670> lot<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.940> precipitation<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:28.840> the

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
looking at a lot of precipitation so the

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.589 
looking at a lot of precipitation so the
time<00:03:29.139> we<00:03:29.230> get<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.700> basically<00:03:30.700> one<00:03:31.060> o'clock<00:03:31.389> in

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
time we get to basically one o'clock in

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.670 
time we get to basically one o'clock in
the<00:03:31.630> morning<00:03:32.019> Thursday<00:03:32.500> Thanksgiving

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
the morning Thursday Thanksgiving

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.890 
the morning Thursday Thanksgiving
morning<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.760> main<00:03:33.940> precipitation<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:34.720> moved

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
morning the main precipitation is moved

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.690 
morning the main precipitation is moved
out<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.319> basically<00:03:35.680> we<00:03:35.889> just<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.190> northwest

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
out and basically we just have northwest

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.460 
out and basically we just have northwest
flow<00:03:36.940> snow<00:03:37.299> which<00:03:37.870> will<00:03:38.019> continue<00:03:38.380> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
flow snow which will continue the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.740 
flow snow which will continue the
mountains<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:38.950> can<00:03:39.069> see<00:03:39.750> Wednesday

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
mountains but you can see Wednesday

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.599 
mountains but you can see Wednesday
especially<00:03:41.380> late<00:03:41.799> in<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.980> day<00:03:42.160> you're<00:03:42.489> going

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
especially late in the day you're going

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.099 
especially late in the day you're going
to<00:03:42.669> be<00:03:42.790> driving<00:03:43.030> into<00:03:43.450> some<00:03:43.630> wintry<00:03:43.959> weather

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
to be driving into some wintry weather

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.199 
to be driving into some wintry weather
heading<00:03:44.889> north<00:03:45.099> or<00:03:45.280> west<00:03:45.400> where's<00:03:45.700> Tuesday

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
heading north or west where's Tuesday

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.750 
heading north or west where's Tuesday
right<00:03:47.139> now<00:03:47.290> that<00:03:47.530> looks<00:03:47.680> like<00:03:47.859> all<00:03:48.099> rain<00:03:48.459> so

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
right now that looks like all rain so

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.129 
right now that looks like all rain so
let's<00:03:48.940> look<00:03:49.090> at<00:03:49.239> some<00:03:49.389> of<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.569> other<00:03:49.599> model

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
let's look at some of the other model

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.370 
let's look at some of the other model
parameters<00:03:50.650> will<00:03:51.220> start<00:03:51.489> off<00:03:51.669> with<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.380> GFS

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
parameters will start off with the GFS

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.780 
parameters will start off with the GFS
again<00:03:53.680> i<00:03:53.709> just<00:03:54.010> showed<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:54.609> here's

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
again i just showed it to you so here's

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.030 
again i just showed it to you so here's
another<00:03:54.970> recap<00:03:55.450> as<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:56.200> system<00:03:56.709> moves<00:03:56.950> through

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
another recap as a system moves through

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.059 
another recap as a system moves through
pretty<00:03:57.970> much<00:03:58.060> straightforward<00:03:58.889> european<00:03:59.889> or

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
pretty much straightforward european or

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.819 
pretty much straightforward european or
the<00:04:00.160> GFS<00:04:00.549> snowfall<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.630> GFS<00:04:02.049> snowfall<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.590> lot

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
the GFS snowfall the GFS snowfall a lot

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.650 
the GFS snowfall the GFS snowfall a lot
of<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.099> is<00:04:03.400> initially<00:04:03.790> some<00:04:04.150> sleet<00:04:04.510> or

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
of this is initially some sleet or

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.690 
of this is initially some sleet or
freezing<00:04:04.720> rain<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.620> then<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.250> back<00:04:06.370> end

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
freezing rain and then on the back end

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.610 
freezing rain and then on the back end
we<00:04:06.849> may<00:04:07.030> see<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.329> dusting<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.959> an<00:04:08.109> inch<00:04:08.290> these

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
we may see a dusting to an inch these

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.860 
we may see a dusting to an inch these
totals<00:04:09.069> are<00:04:09.220> probably<00:04:09.519> in<00:04:09.669> my<00:04:09.790> opinion<00:04:10.120> well

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
totals are probably in my opinion well

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.599 
totals are probably in my opinion well
overdone<00:04:11.380> but<00:04:11.410> you're<00:04:11.829> looking<00:04:12.130> at<00:04:12.220> maybe<00:04:12.459> a

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
overdone but you're looking at maybe a

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.059 
overdone but you're looking at maybe a
tenth<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.060> an<00:04:13.180> inch<00:04:13.380> dusting<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.530> half<00:04:14.859> an

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
tenth of an inch dusting to a half an

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.490 
tenth of an inch dusting to a half an
inch<00:04:15.209> European<00:04:16.209> model<00:04:16.599> very<00:04:16.870> similar<00:04:17.349> with

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
inch European model very similar with

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.379 
inch European model very similar with
the<00:04:17.590> precipitation<00:04:18.160> this<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.639> just<00:04:19.000> liquid

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
the precipitation this is just liquid

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.879 
the precipitation this is just liquid
here<00:04:19.630> how<00:04:19.810> much<00:04:19.989> rain<00:04:20.200> is<00:04:20.349> going<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.590> move<00:04:20.680> in

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
here how much rain is going to move in

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.740 
here how much rain is going to move in
you<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:21.459> see<00:04:21.579> pretty<00:04:21.789> heavy<00:04:22.060> amounts<00:04:22.510> moving

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
you can see pretty heavy amounts moving

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.740 
you can see pretty heavy amounts moving
across<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.740> translates<00:04:24.370> into<00:04:24.580> some<00:04:24.909> decent

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
across that translates into some decent

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.879 
across that translates into some decent
snows<00:04:26.050> on<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.349> European

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
snows on the European

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.820 
snows on the European
maybe<00:04:27.189> about<00:04:27.340> a<00:04:27.490> half<00:04:27.729> an<00:04:27.939> inch<00:04:28.060> or<00:04:28.389> so<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:29.710> can

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
maybe about a half an inch or so you can

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.320 
maybe about a half an inch or so you can
see<00:04:29.979> areas<00:04:30.340> around<00:04:30.460> Charlotte<00:04:30.939> a<00:04:30.999> half<00:04:31.150> an

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
see areas around Charlotte a half an

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.420 
see areas around Charlotte a half an
inch<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:31.509> dusting<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.229> again<00:04:32.439> the<00:04:33.159> ground<00:04:33.370> is

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
inch to dusting and again the ground is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.010 
inch to dusting and again the ground is
going<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.610> be<00:04:33.789> really<00:04:33.969> warm<00:04:34.509> it's<00:04:34.840> going<00:04:34.960> to

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
going to be really warm it's going to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.779 
going to be really warm it's going to
have<00:04:35.139> rain<00:04:35.379> for<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.740> better<00:04:36.129> part<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.550> day<00:04:36.729> so

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
have rain for a better part of a day so

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.640 
have rain for a better part of a day so
we'll<00:04:37.180> have<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.360> tough<00:04:37.569> time<00:04:37.599> getting<00:04:38.379> this

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
we'll have a tough time getting this

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.559 
we'll have a tough time getting this
stick<00:04:39.099> and<00:04:39.279> one<00:04:39.669> of<00:04:39.789> my<00:04:39.879> favorite<00:04:40.270> things<00:04:40.479> I

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
stick and one of my favorite things I

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.029 
stick and one of my favorite things I
look<00:04:40.779> at<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:41.139> something<00:04:41.499> we<00:04:41.590> call<00:04:41.800> the

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
look at is something we call the

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.909 
look at is something we call the
ensemble's<00:04:42.639> or<00:04:42.789> schref<00:04:43.449> for<00:04:43.870> short<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.770> can

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
ensemble's or schref for short you can

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.679 
ensemble's or schref for short you can
see<00:04:45.069> this<00:04:45.219> this<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.580> basically<00:04:46.210> going<00:04:46.419> out

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
see this this is basically going out

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.200 
see this this is basically going out
into<00:04:46.900> Wednesday<00:04:47.469> and<00:04:47.620> Thursday<00:04:48.210> Tuesday

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
into Wednesday and Thursday Tuesday

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.550 
into Wednesday and Thursday Tuesday
Wednesday<00:04:49.389> Thursday<00:04:49.539> you<00:04:49.990> can<00:04:50.139> see<00:04:50.289> the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
Wednesday Thursday you can see the
