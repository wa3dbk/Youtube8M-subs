00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
techniques say I went online and I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.680 
techniques say I went online and I
checked<00:04:10.690> out<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.870> bunch<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.260> online<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.950> so

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
checked out a bunch of online and so

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:22.540 
checked out a bunch of online and so
that'd<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.840> pretty<00:04:14.020> fun

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550
