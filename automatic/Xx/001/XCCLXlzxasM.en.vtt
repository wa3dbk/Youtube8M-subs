00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 so hello to everyone in general decided equipped 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.349
 video that is , I will immediately say that to me 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.160
 many messages come in contact 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.429
 about 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.780
 and video for such a model for such me 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.480
 only my eight available 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.880
 the long-suffering which I do not know 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.180
 how to remove even more confuse in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.019
 Generally as soon as I appear on 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.269
 repair four or old woman that is 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.830
 A video of 4 skeleton devices will appear . 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.870
 the moment is so eight 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.559
 only hardcore 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.640
 As far as I understand, the attention is not surprised 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.899
 such an important thing as a pendulum motorcycle 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.789
 so immediately here my thorny but 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.110
 motorcycle 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:56.010
 this pendulum of a good friend here painted 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.020
 it and in general pulled out from the turner 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 here are such sleeves sleeves turned out 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.789
 linen bronze material 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.770
 I think they are made like this 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:12.200
 here are the lubrication grooves screw 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.540
 one one groove per pass in total 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.299
 plant on the eight established 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.790
 such a grease cup on this from niki 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 was i bought and punched ie carving 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.710
 there is an ordinary six so in general plant 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.740
 plant on these pits 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.220
 used bushings in which the internal 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.180
 diameter 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.000
 same as these outer diameter 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.900
 a little less and that is this sleeve 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.860
 factory 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.710
 goes from steel and she tucked on 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.420
 material that is copper graphite as 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.860
 to insert I do not know what to call 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.990
 such a strong copper spelled 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.210
 it turns into graphite in one turn 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.090
 put up in a pendulum well, roughly 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.220
 as far as I understand it is dry such that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.530
 does the grease itself track him on 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.530
 exclaim that she go the other often 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.140
 as a result I have over 70 thousand run 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.720
 does a common pendulum jet remain 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.369
 mesh is worn metal on metal 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.610
 started working it stuck that is 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.040
 pendulum create no option look this 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.550
 the axis is therefore a may quiet algae 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.050
 trip to three parts to three parts 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.140
 grinder neatly so as not to damage 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.400
 frame engine shot in general and kill 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.319
 central part then side 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.600
 to pull out because no special 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.190
 dray sledgehammer effort can't be done on 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.810
 pendulum by what he's through is strange 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.549
 TV frames are generally 2 links 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.489
 this bearing sleeve spacer 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.970
 when we bolt these bolts us bushings 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.230
 abut our forum sleeve and how would 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.390
 wedged ie this sleeve 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.760
 work this surface on the inside 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.430
 pendulum surfaces 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.040
 Means that I invented for lubrication in general 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.930
 Here I have collected motorcycles start with 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.090
 pendulum I looked to the entrance from 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.829
 nick need to look for somebody ben 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.450
 such a bend that's such a bend 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.799
 the very tip itself and I don't know 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.780
 This is why I decided to study 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.970
 different than ordinary hose 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.340
 reinforced without affecting the system 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.310
 any car and 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.959
 2 grease cups means look here on 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.069
 this is the oiler prize we remove the ball 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.950
 use go for it turns 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:28.239
 pass-through 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.500
 we put on the hose tighten the clamp here 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.690
 there we are it turns out and 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.760
 here here on the end of the hose on the other 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.720
 also clamp grease nipple 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.770
 we are like a ball for this you this thing 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.500
 in order to serov 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.760
 if necessary just slando like that 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.550
 that's from the little fastened 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.380
 plugged in the plus oiler and pumped one 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.450
 the ball is chosen because well, much 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.550
 more need pressure Valita 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.670
 crazy to be Moscow, too , is yours 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.590
 That two valves open here that is 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.420
 if you have a visa and so far the germans plus 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.520
 oiler such a system is not necessary but I 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.840
 for convenience I still wanted to say 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.330
 that is, if you don't want to drink and 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.030
 plant belberdu two clamps and two 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.760
 my oiler for sale I just could not 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.660
 find but never said at all what 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.140
 ride hoses which are on one side 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.860
 here one end goes the nut is empty like 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.880
 scare to common with thread m6 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.860
 which is screwed instead 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.150
 present at the other end of the plant on 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.750
 press lubricator 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.440
 for the sake of these elephants go for atmos and in my 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.610
 release bearing 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.460
 trucks maz kamaz on old models in 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.860
 overall you can twist them or here 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.630
 make holes for thread in the top ten and 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.910
 spinning up the hose I saw the sale date 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.580
 50 which turns a dozen on 1 m 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.800
 m usual prize oiler 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:56.190
 so about the new video will be 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.770
 come out on the sly smaller because 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.930
 its I almost lied in principle 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.670
 I already have no special plans 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.920
 Of course you can from the Belgian brakes 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.700
 there will be standing on the process blog this 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.070
 all will shoot the engine for the season 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.790
 ready to completely replaced all consumables 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.970
 that is, a little bit about the rods wear these 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.530
 heels of rods for 20,000 are not at all 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.920
 detected ie no elevators appeared 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.670
 nothing, that is, in principle Satan can 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.680
 take even Chinese so generally my 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.260
 fame doggy I repair Chinese 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.810
 songs nobody cross on golden scooters 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.850
 mopeds with volume up to 200 cubes 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.620
 that is, maybe on my channel will be 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.880
 appear video on repairing these china 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.260
 chikov that is, let's see that is, if it 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.110
 I will demand an answer, I will 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.090
 shoot so but waiting for income 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.530
 some java or cardinal 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.960
 rework my mug and I think it makes no sense 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.480
 shoot a video like are shot legrand and 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:00.560
 it showed how I change the oil you think 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:03.390
 can do everything well, so here you think and 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.870
 write me questions vkontakte build all 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.870
 answer here and the farm was not lost
