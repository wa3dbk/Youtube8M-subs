brother trying to save him trying to
find<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.280> way<00:00:34.400> to<00:00:34.430> get<00:00:34.730> him<00:00:34.850> back<00:00:35.030> but<00:00:35.630> in

find a way to get him back but in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.990 
find a way to get him back but in

reality he's completely separate himself

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.140 
reality he's completely separate himself
from<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:38.300> group<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:39.110> he<00:00:39.700> moved<00:00:40.700> away<00:00:40.880> from

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
from the group and he moved away from

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.440 
from the group and he moved away from
Mystic<00:00:41.390> Falls<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.290> he<00:00:42.410> started<00:00:42.830> his<00:00:42.950> own<00:00:43.070> life

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
Mystic Falls and he started his own life

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.730 
Mystic Falls and he started his own life
completely<00:00:44.450> as<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.690> separate<00:00:45.110> B<00:00:45.260> storyline

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
completely as a separate B storyline

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.700 
completely as a separate B storyline
away<00:00:45.980> from<00:00:46.190> everyone

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
away from everyone

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.190 
away from everyone
I<00:00:51.520> think<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:52.610> a<00:00:52.670> combination<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.390> denial<00:00:53.840> and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
I think it's a combination of denial and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.170 
I think it's a combination of denial and
pain<00:00:54.740> and<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.400> and<00:00:55.730> also<00:00:57.580> logic<00:00:58.580> he<00:00:58.850> genuinely

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
pain and and and also logic he genuinely

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.030 
pain and and and also logic he genuinely
thinks<00:00:59.840> he<00:00:59.930> can't<00:01:00.140> get<00:01:00.260> his<00:01:00.350> brother<00:01:00.560> back<00:01:00.770> and

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
thinks he can't get his brother back and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.830 
thinks he can't get his brother back and
so<00:01:01.220> he's<00:01:01.460> decided<00:01:01.880> he's<00:01:02.210> made<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.450> very

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
so he's decided he's made a very

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.180 
so he's decided he's made a very
conscious<00:01:03.170> decision<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:04.189> not<00:01:04.870> suffer<00:01:05.870> or<00:01:06.590> do

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
conscious decision to not suffer or do

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.120 
conscious decision to not suffer or do
anything<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.940> is<00:01:09.520> futile

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130
