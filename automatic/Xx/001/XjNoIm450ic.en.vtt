00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.560 
sometimes you can't you know you do this
kind<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.430> thing<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.910> gets<00:04:22.330> quite

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
kind of thing and it gets quite

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.240 
kind of thing and it gets quite
frustrating<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.290> you're<00:04:23.440> not<00:04:23.590> sure<00:04:23.830> how<00:04:24.070> he's

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
frustrating and you're not sure how he's

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.760 
frustrating and you're not sure how he's
supposed<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.550> kill<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.970> thing<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:26.560> under

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
supposed to kill the thing and you under

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.020 
supposed to kill the thing and you under
paint<00:04:26.980> it<00:04:27.040> over<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.340> over<00:04:27.460> again<00:04:27.550> just<00:04:27.700> as<00:04:27.940> you

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
paint it over and over again just as you

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.060 
paint it over and over again just as you
determine<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.570> complete<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:31.230> also<00:04:32.230> so<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:32.890> is

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
determine to complete it also so this is

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.350 
determine to complete it also so this is
the<00:04:33.280> kind<00:04:33.430> of<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.669> first<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.120> three

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
the kind of the first of the three

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.940 
the kind of the first of the three
levels<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:34.720> we<00:04:34.840> saw<00:04:35.080> as<00:04:35.530> ice<00:04:35.680> here<00:04:35.830> at<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
levels that we saw as ice here at the

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.980 
levels that we saw as ice here at the
bottom<00:04:36.340> it's<00:04:36.520> showing<00:04:36.790> one<00:04:37.030> stream<00:04:37.510> one<00:04:37.810> of

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
bottom it's showing one stream one of

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.710 
bottom it's showing one stream one of
three<00:04:38.580> while<00:04:39.580> there<00:04:39.760> there's<00:04:40.000> what<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.570> in

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
three while there there's what and in

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:49.830 
three while there there's what and in
fact<00:04:40.930> anyone<00:04:42.419> know<00:04:43.419> anyone<00:04:47.790> so<00:04:48.790> a<00:04:49.180> bit<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.690> math

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
fact anyone know anyone so a bit of math

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.670 
fact anyone know anyone so a bit of math
tells<00:04:50.140> me<00:04:50.290> 63<00:04:50.860> on<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:52.000> level<00:04:52.300> alone<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:53.530> you

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
tells me 63 on that level alone and you

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.830 
tells me 63 on that level alone and you
can<00:04:53.830> see<00:04:53.950> there<00:04:54.160> I'm<00:04:54.460> not<00:04:54.640> sure<00:04:54.700> if<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.450> stars

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
can see there I'm not sure if the stars

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.650 
can see there I'm not sure if the stars
are<00:04:56.400> see<00:04:57.400> of<00:04:57.550> course<00:04:57.730> I've<00:04:58.150> got<00:04:58.210> up<00:04:58.390> to<00:04:58.480> three

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
are see of course I've got up to three

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.360 
are see of course I've got up to three
stars<00:04:58.960> from<00:04:59.050> each<00:04:59.230> level<00:05:01.050> in<00:05:02.050> 63<00:05:02.650> times<00:05:03.040> three

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
stars from each level in 63 times three

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.730 
stars from each level in 63 times three
well<00:05:03.700> you<00:05:03.850> know<00:05:04.000> there<00:05:04.210> we<00:05:04.300> go

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
well you know there we go

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.410 
well you know there we go
so<00:05:06.740> there's<00:05:07.610> not<00:05:07.730> quite<00:05:07.910> as<00:05:07.970> many<00:05:08.240> in<00:05:08.330> the

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
so there's not quite as many in the

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.020 
so there's not quite as many in the
second<00:05:08.780> one<00:05:08.900> look<00:05:09.080> 126<00:05:09.980> starts<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.580> be<00:05:10.700> hard<00:05:10.910> on

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
second one look 126 starts to be hard on

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.020 
second one look 126 starts to be hard on
135<00:05:12.310> goodness<00:05:13.310> I<00:05:13.340> should<00:05:13.520> have<00:05:13.610> added<00:05:13.760> this<00:05:13.910> so

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
135 goodness I should have added this so

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.110 
135 goodness I should have added this so
before<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.510> three<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.080> good

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
before and three and good

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.400 
before and three and good
okay<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.150> mean<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.450> base<00:05:17.600> is<00:05:17.780> probably<00:05:18.230> about<00:05:18.320> a

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
okay I mean the base is probably about a

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.770 
okay I mean the base is probably about a
hundred<00:05:18.680> twenty<00:05:18.830> had<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> quick<00:05:19.850> guess<00:05:20.090> you

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
hundred twenty had a quick guess you

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.270 
hundred twenty had a quick guess you
guys<00:05:20.930> have<00:05:21.080> got<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.230> you<00:05:21.530> can<00:05:21.680> pause<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:21.920> add<00:05:22.190> it

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
guys have got a you can pause and add it

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.470 
guys have got a you can pause and add it
up<00:05:22.370> properly<00:05:22.550> but<00:05:22.820> it's<00:05:22.940> good<00:05:23.030> about<00:05:23.210> hundred

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
up properly but it's good about hundred

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.790 
up properly but it's good about hundred
twenty<00:05:23.690> levels<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:23.990> think<00:05:24.020> all<00:05:24.290> in<00:05:24.440> all<00:05:24.530> which

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
twenty levels I think all in all which

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.950 
twenty levels I think all in all which
is<00:05:25.030> that's<00:05:26.030> enough<00:05:26.330> to<00:05:26.420> keep<00:05:26.540> you<00:05:26.630> going<00:05:26.780> for<00:05:26.840> a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
is that's enough to keep you going for a

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.320 
is that's enough to keep you going for a
long<00:05:27.170> time<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.620> long<00:05:28.010> space<00:05:28.700> in<00:05:28.940> some<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.240> them

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
long time a long space in some of them

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.730 
long time a long space in some of them
take<00:05:29.630> you<00:05:29.780> ten<00:05:29.990> or<00:05:30.080> fifteen<00:05:30.410> minutes<00:05:30.650> to

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
take you ten or fifteen minutes to

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.790 
take you ten or fifteen minutes to
complete<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:31.360> well<00:05:32.360> you've<00:05:32.480> got<00:05:32.570> a<00:05:32.600> good<00:05:32.960> good

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
complete so well you've got a good good

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.600 
complete so well you've got a good good

intuitive kind of snuck in the bottom
corner<00:05:57.230> down<00:05:57.380> here<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:58.340> then<00:05:58.610> he<00:05:58.670> went<00:05:58.820> to

corner down here and then he went to
wagon<00:05:59.270> I<00:05:59.330> think<00:06:00.580> and<00:06:01.580> again<00:06:01.790> they've<00:06:01.970> on<00:06:02.150> their

wagon I think and again they've on their

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.670 
wagon I think and again they've on their
Twitter<00:06:02.600> feed<00:06:02.840> they've<00:06:02.990> said<00:06:03.170> snow<00:06:03.350> about<00:06:03.500> his

Twitter feed they've said snow about his
throw<00:06:03.830> at<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:04.100> bookmark<00:06:04.850> it<00:06:05.000> was<00:06:05.120> they<00:06:05.330> don't

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
throw at the bookmark it was they don't

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.330 
throw at the bookmark it was they don't
want<00:06:05.600> to<00:06:05.690> charge<00:06:05.900> for<00:06:06.160> something<00:06:07.160> that<00:06:07.250> they

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
want to charge for something that they

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.700 
want to charge for something that they
don't<00:06:07.490> think<00:06:07.700> it's<00:06:07.880> perfect<00:06:08.360> so<00:06:08.720> I<00:06:09.050> guess<00:06:09.440> just
