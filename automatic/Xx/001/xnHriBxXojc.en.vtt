two<00:00:25.080> things<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.039> ballast<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.500> you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
two things you have a ballast and you

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.859 
two things you have a ballast and you
have<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.160> driver<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.689> particular

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
have a driver and in this particular

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.350 
have a driver and in this particular
case<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.439> ballast<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> included<00:00:32.850> this

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
50 watt driving light in here you might

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.670 
50 watt driving light in here you might
go<00:00:45.329> well<00:00:45.480> 50<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> sound<00:00:46.469> pretty

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
go well 50 was this is sound pretty

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.330 
go well 50 was this is sound pretty
impressive

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
impressive

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.830

at 100 watts the big difference with HID

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.600 
at 100 watts the big difference with HID
is<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> bulb<00:00:52.590> size<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.399> how

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
is not so much the bulb size it's how

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790 
is not so much the bulb size it's how
it's<00:00:53.820> driven<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.379> back<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.680> this

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.050 
and the lumen output on this particular
light<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.500> bulb<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.520> at<00:02:01.549> 5200<00:02:02.549> lumens

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
light with this bulb is at 5200 lumens

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.240 
light with this bulb is at 5200 lumens
that's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.390> 62%<00:02:04.320> increase<00:02:05.240> over<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> normal<00:02:07.250> 35

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that's a 62% increase over the normal 35

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.830 
that's a 62% increase over the normal 35
watt<00:02:08.489> HID<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.479> an<00:02:09.599> even<00:02:09.810> more

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
watt HID so this is an even more

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.559 
watt HID so this is an even more
powerful<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.679> than<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> 35<00:02:12.000> white<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.390> course

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
powerful one than a 35 white of course

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.820 
powerful one than a 35 white of course
at<00:02:12.660> 50<00:02:12.989> watts<00:02:13.200> you're<00:02:13.349> going<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.650> great

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
at 50 watts you're going to have great

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.470 
at 50 watts you're going to have great
output<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.640> definitely<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.150> light<00:02:15.360> is

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
output but definitely this light is

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360

going<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.660> pack<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> serious<00:02:16.470> amount<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.100> punch

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370
