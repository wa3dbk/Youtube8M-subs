00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.070
 The big production of shrimp banana flowers cocoa coffee 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.950
 will go directly from this point to the United States Spain and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.380
 the whole region 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.409
 turning it into a true pole of development of our country 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.140
 also

 great tremor 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.229
 from london next - 21 but vanity but man visibly 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.140
 problem 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 the technical specifications of being opposed are better than those of the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.990
 quito airports and I go here 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.759
 with a weather topography I made another fiat that will serve for the actress age of all 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:02.840
 type of aircraft 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.980

 the harbor district as a fortress 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.779
 conditions of winds by geographical conditions ie many

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.289
 the intraday standards of it from the internet that is going to know the rules 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.649
 of airports that have greater security 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.950
 the old yearning of the southern populations 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.300
 that were affected by border disputes as Peru becomes concrete 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.099
 today with what becomes the road to the economic reactivation of this 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.789
 zone 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.789
 with greater productivity in the country 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:44.559
 amazing 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:45.619
 we 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.839
 many things like shrimp 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.339
 percent flowers 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.659

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.269
 without fear of being wrong, they mean 70% that will be developed 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.560
 it can even be more in the future 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.640
 besides being a strategic place for the collection, it would fall 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.349
 with different countries 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.560
 with which we maintain commercial and tourist exchanges 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.290
 allowing Ecuador to have better interconnection routes 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:15.979
