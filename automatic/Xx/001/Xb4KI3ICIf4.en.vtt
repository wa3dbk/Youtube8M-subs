patina which will give it that antiquey

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.500 
patina which will give it that antiquey
flavor<00:00:06.180> right<00:00:07.280> so<00:00:08.280> here<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:08.730> our<00:00:08.940> bikini

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
flavor right so here we have our bikini

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.680 
flavor right so here we have our bikini
patina<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.469> comes<00:00:11.309> also<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.910> copper<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.509> is

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
patina it comes also in copper this is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.860 
patina it comes also in copper this is
black<00:00:12.980> which<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.429> because<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:15.450> gives<00:00:15.630> it

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
black which I like because it gives it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.179 
black which I like because it gives it
the<00:00:16.770> ancient<00:00:17.220> look<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.990> put<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.100> on

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the ancient look and we just put it on

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.800 
the ancient look and we just put it on
it<00:00:20.400> instantly<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.550> old

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
it instantly we have this the old

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.390 
it instantly we have this the old
metallurgy<00:00:24.810> look<00:00:27.650> no<00:00:28.650> one<00:00:28.859> would<00:00:29.070> guess<00:00:29.369> that

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
metallurgy look no one would guess that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.470 
metallurgy look no one would guess that
it's<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.560> modern<00:00:31.560> piece<00:00:34.550> see<00:00:35.550> how<00:00:35.670> quickly<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it's a modern piece see how quickly it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:46.279 
it's a modern piece see how quickly it
goes<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:38.870> very<00:00:39.870> fast<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:43.610> it<00:00:44.610> protects<00:00:45.289> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
goes on very fast and it protects the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.819 
goes on very fast and it protects the
solder<00:00:46.969> from<00:00:47.969> oxidizing<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> copper<00:00:49.530> foil

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
solder from oxidizing on the copper foil

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.970 
solder from oxidizing on the copper foil
so<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.030> important<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> otherwise<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so it's important for that otherwise the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.729 
so it's important for that otherwise the
stuff<00:00:53.340> gets<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.969> flaky<00:00:54.600> look<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:55.680> we

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
stuff gets this flaky look so now we

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.880 
stuff gets this flaky look so now we
have<00:00:56.120> given<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.360> instant<00:00:57.930> patina<00:00:58.469> black

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
have given it that instant patina black

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.440 
have given it that instant patina black
look<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.640> antiquing<00:01:02.899> how<00:01:03.899> nice<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:05.450> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
look the antiquing how nice that is the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.600 
look the antiquing how nice that is the
light<00:01:06.720> coming<00:01:07.200> through<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.460> sure<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:11.340> we

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
light coming through I'm not sure and we

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.999 
light coming through I'm not sure and we
will<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:13.430> turn<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.490> over<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:16.290> protective

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
will then turn it over the protective

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.580 
will then turn it over the protective
beautifying<00:01:18.409> patina

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.260 

and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:28.159> we'll<00:01:29.159> give<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> rinse<00:01:29.789> with<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
and then we'll give it to rinse with the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.740 
and then we'll give it to rinse with the
wash<00:01:31.039> with<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.189> water<00:01:32.399> again<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:36.509> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
wash with the water again and it is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.309 
wash with the water again and it is
complete<00:01:39.439> stage<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:43.219> now<00:01:44.219> over<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> sink

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
complete stage and now over to the sink

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:51.980 
complete stage and now over to the sink
for<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.530> rinsing<00:01:49.939> little<00:01:50.939> hot<00:01:51.149> water<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
for the rinsing little hot water and the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:24.970 
for the rinsing little hot water and the
brush<00:01:52.200> action<00:01:57.679> probably<00:01:58.679> not<00:01:58.799> that

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.820
