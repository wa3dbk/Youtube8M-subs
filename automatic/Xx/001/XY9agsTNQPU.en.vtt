00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you guys like this I know that it's kind

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.459 
you guys like this I know that it's kind
of<00:00:44.219> an<00:00:44.340> awful<00:00:44.640> lot<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.170> tutorials<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.320> they're

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of an awful lot of tutorials but they're

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.540 
of an awful lot of tutorials but they're
all<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:46.710> short<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:47.340> should<00:00:47.520> be

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
all really short so they should be

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
all really short so they should be
pretty<00:00:47.910> easy<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.480> figure<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.579> yeah<00:00:51.379> okay

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
pretty easy to figure out and yeah okay

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.959 
pretty easy to figure out and yeah okay
so<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.649> look<00:00:52.860> actually<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> whole<00:00:53.820> lot

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
so this look actually is not a whole lot

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
so this look actually is not a whole lot
different<00:00:54.090> than<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> last<00:00:54.629> look<00:00:54.899> kind<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.320> as

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
different than the last look kind of as

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.439
