00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.190
 very bad weather very bad 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.680
 weather was 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.780
 so the bike doesn't even do everything 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.280
 ride school nothing actually snow and 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.300
 it's raining and so decided to show you 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.270
 just not saying anything 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.650
 just want to show you 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:48.780
 belarus 82 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:52.229
 that is, it turned out all 20 times so he 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.699
 In general, we are commissioned as if with 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:01:04.559
 he had problems and what did we do 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:09.420
 this tractor we have a half years already 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.770
 Of course , he is practically 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.530
 all new how will moto hours with him 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.219
 also just here it is even funny for 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.640
 a year and a half 150 I will even tell you 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.640
 to you for sure 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.160
 158 muddy hours wound by one and a half 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.990
 years it's generally just as service funny 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.270
 Well what can I say about him as if in 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.300
 exploitation we have it well of course they 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.420
 no plow heavy anything 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.210
 so goes to the trailer checks there 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.910
 cropping carries on 5 the maximum that 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.810
 probably it is even five tons 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.830
 I never 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.170
 by the tone of 2 well, so we had problems 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.170
 immediately when there were problems 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.080
 something flowed from the hydraulics pump 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.080
 samosa drove 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:15.440
 and called a guarantee his cheeks came his 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.300
 did but more principle any 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.790
 problems with him were not well for so many 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.410
 o'clock what else can it be in the new 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.180
 tractor 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.060
 Well, so that the oil is of course everywhere 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.730
 undercut that is from all nodes 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.410
 the oil oozes that is like a wharf when 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.550
 the little pirates didnâ€™t ask any problems right away 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.060
 have it started immediately appearing on 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.870
 that I was answered and also Belarus that you 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:47.150
 do you want for dusting all said no 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.489
 well, it can be seen and exploited but so 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.230
 more principle no problems in winter yes 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.480
 something bad started I don't know why 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.900
 constantly had to close the air 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.530
 then somehow less 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.200
 started up but with severe frosts 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.200
 passed one third of the pallet to start 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.209
 so more so 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.650
 such a principle as if with him nothing 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.310
 it was bad nothing broke 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.750
 the only thing that the front wheel is looking for 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.269
 lowered it was such a flat tire 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.189
 front we removed it transported 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.200
 the camera 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.489
 got well damn there just factory 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.769
 there was such a kind 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.159
 i.e. they didn't just break it 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.439
 from the factory proceq was there such and she 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.870
 just went and all 500 letters and closed 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:37.129
 put everything enters all normal yes 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.700
 still so for what I say so in the back 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.980
 bodywork 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.200
 before rust appeared there almost 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.950
 in a month, the whole beginning also rusts on 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.680
 the joints so it is where it was smearing 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:54.040
 ground passed 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:58.329
 but it works outside the dominguez to her 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.329
 ride gets everything even got 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.590
 here you see there 158 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.560
 Such already in mountains all electronic 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.480
 all the floor all electrics work no 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.460
 river 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.680
 Of course, is there a pancake everywhere? q 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.340
 and gets into this tractor not even 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:40.380
 car something else to expect well, so everything 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.870
 everything works fine i just wanted 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.810
 show how here we have it in operation 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.730
 how does well, again, we have time for 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.430
 drain charge of 8:00 and a half years is 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:55.890
 that damn new tractor therefore therefore 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.140
 everything here is not working center I'm sure that 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.190
 if somewhere he was any 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:06.120
 there she worked on the collective farm 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.919
 absolutely everything would be done because 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.410
 what know how the tractor works when in 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.100
 collective farms they strain plow from morning till night 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.620
 and this is how it works for us for three hours 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:23.280
 day 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:26.630
 so sata and the state is so good 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.630
 all principle on this all all bye
