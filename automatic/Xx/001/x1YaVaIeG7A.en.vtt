you<00:04:45.880> have<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.150> pretty<00:04:47.050> conclusive<00:04:47.590> proof<00:04:47.800> that

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
you have it pretty conclusive proof that

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.370 
you have it pretty conclusive proof that
using<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.610> permanent<00:04:49.060> magnetic<00:04:49.380> synchronous

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
using a permanent magnetic synchronous

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.710 
using a permanent magnetic synchronous
motor<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.160> real<00:04:51.370> world<00:04:51.520> application<00:04:51.720> can

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
motor in a real world application can

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.500 
motor in a real world application can
save<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.080> energy

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510
