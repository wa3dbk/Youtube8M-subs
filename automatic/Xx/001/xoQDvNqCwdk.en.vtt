00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:04.550
 two 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.550
 p 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.280
 although they are away from home 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.650
 The only one 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.660
 secret war 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.400
 that July 21, 1969 our aldrin went away a few meters from the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.190
 module 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.100
 confirming this incredible construction 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.520
 this 14-minute movie was never broadcast by NASA 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.730
 and red was one of the few Americans that had its origin 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.360
 a few meters away and the league 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.659
 and it was not chance everything was meticulously 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.659
 you have to program it 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.760
 these mysterious ruins as others similarly filmed by the remaining 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.810
 troubles 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.479
 they had been photographed before by the different waves 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020
 automatic 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.500
 one of them will be superior 5 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.999
 the rise of September 8, 1967 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.900
 Thursday 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.530
 landed in the sea of â€‹â€‹tranquility very close to this construction sending 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 19 thousand photographs 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.470
 ruined buildings 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.499
 buildings on the surface of the moon 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.499
 buildings apparently of great ambiguity 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.049
 but I had raised them 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.049
 for us humans obviously not 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.809
 there was only one answer 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.879
 with this I want offers a numancy civilization 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.269
 the military 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.540
 had satisfied the first part of his time against me 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.409
 now we had the second 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.860
 according to my confidant the astronauts proceeded 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.279
 to the programmed 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.150
 picked up 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.729
 samples of the walls took measurements 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.729
 and they retired 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.569
 the unusual construction very similar to a friend 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.940
 half 60 meters in length with a maximum height in the walls of nine 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.499
 meters 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:40.229
 had 12 holes or windows there is a kind of front door 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.229
 five meters deep by cristian tula 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.899
 according to the analyzes practiced on earth the material with which there was 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:49.110
 been built 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.279
 and it's similar to the lunar surface 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:57.869
 60% of the atoms would have oxygen with zero points 0 1% of the weight 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.869
 constituted by hydrogen 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.849
 the very eroded forecasts 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.449
 this circumstance since the moon practically does not exist atmosphere made 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.620
 think to the military that the building in question could have several 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.619
 ministers 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.069
 the secret is a matter of armstrong aldrin to this hangar and naturally the 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:30.999
 14 minutes of film 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:32.960
 they were never spread by the nasa
