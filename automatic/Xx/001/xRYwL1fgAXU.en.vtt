00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
going to be pulling a version well

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.120 
going to be pulling a version well
they're<00:00:24.210> going<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.480> pulling<00:00:24.859> 120<00:00:25.859> skill

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.390 
they're going to be pulling 120 skill
kits<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.510> twist<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.500> skills

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
kits but the twist here is that skills

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.420 
kits but the twist here is that skills
aren't<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.210> go<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> level<00:00:31.230> 120<00:00:32.009> instead

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
aren't going to go to level 120 instead

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.209 
aren't going to go to level 120 instead
you're<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.360> 104<00:00:34.140> million<00:00:34.350> XP<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
you're going to get 104 million XP and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.950 
you're going to get 104 million XP and
then<00:00:35.820> you're<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.239> rewarded<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
then you're going to be rewarded with a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
then you're going to be rewarded with a
master<00:00:37.410> care<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.370> haven't<00:00:38.730> seen<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
master care if you haven't seen what a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.119 
master care if you haven't seen what a
master<00:00:39.540> kit<00:00:39.690> looks<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.350> imagined<00:00:40.950> you

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
master kit looks like I had imagined you

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
master kit looks like I had imagined you
will<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.610> done<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.719> basically<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
will have done but basically the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.869 
will have done but basically the
dungeoneering<00:00:44.100> kit<00:00:44.309> they're<00:00:44.520> all<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
dungeoneering kit they're all going to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.229 
dungeoneering kit they're all going to
look<00:00:45.030> similar<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.870> engineering<00:00:46.200> Kip

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
look similar to the do engineering Kip

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.170 
look similar to the do engineering Kip
active<00:00:48.239> QRS<00:00:48.960> made<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.550> some

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
active QRS made some you know some

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.860 
active QRS made some you know some
similar<00:00:52.110> concepts<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.829> gas<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.719> some<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
similar concepts of gas and some of the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.779 
similar concepts of gas and some of the
video<00:00:55.079> makers<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.739> well<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> past<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
video makers have as well in the past of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
video makers have as well in the past of
the<00:00:57.079> master<00:00:58.079> capes<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.800> imagine<00:00:59.160> they're

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the master capes and imagine they're

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.470 
the master capes and imagine they're
going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.550> different<00:00:59.760> colors<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
going to be different colors with the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
going to be different colors with the
skill<00:01:00.840> logos<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.410> them<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> then<00:01:01.949> probably

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
skill logos on them and then probably

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.700 
skill logos on them and then probably
different<00:01:02.730> color<00:01:02.940> particles<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.719> well<00:01:03.899> but

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
different color particles as well but

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
different color particles as well but
the<00:01:04.890> emotes<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> same<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the emotes going to be the same is the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
the emotes going to be the same is the
99<00:01:06.540> skill<00:01:06.840> capes<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
99 skill capes and they are going to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910 
99 skill capes and they are going to
have<00:01:08.790> exactly<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> same<00:01:09.479> starts<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.110> 99<00:01:10.619> skill

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
have exactly the same starts as 99 skill

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
have exactly the same starts as 99 skill
kit<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.280> i<00:01:11.340> guess<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.700> gives<00:01:11.820> somebody<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.420> um

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
kit but i guess it gives somebody is um

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.740 
kit but i guess it gives somebody is um
so<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> plays<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.939> bit<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> show

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
so it plays a little bit more to show

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.580 
so it plays a little bit more to show
off<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.200> when<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:19.259> much

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
off with when they have that much

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.190 
off with when they have that much
experience<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.939> skill<00:01:21.240> personally<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
experience in one skill personally I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960 
experience in one skill personally I
wouldn't<00:01:22.590> wear<00:01:22.890> any<00:01:23.159> other<00:01:23.400> clips<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.909> I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
wouldn't wear any other clips that I

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
wouldn't wear any other clips that I
could<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.540> access<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.530> about<00:01:25.710> five

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
could have access to which is about five

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.109 
could have access to which is about five
or<00:01:26.250> six<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.970> I'd

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
or six I think but you know I'd

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.850 
or six I think but you know I'd
obviously<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.170> much<00:01:31.229> income<00:01:31.619> cap

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
obviously want to want much income cap

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.440 
obviously want to want much income cap
instead<00:01:32.130> whenever<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.909> back<00:01:33.119> because

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
instead whenever get that back because

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.319 
instead whenever get that back because
of<00:01:33.479> low<00:01:33.780> pots<00:01:34.460> but<00:01:35.460> I'd<00:01:35.700> imagine<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.180> would

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
of low pots but I'd imagine it would

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.109 
of low pots but I'd imagine it would
appeal<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.189> wide<00:01:38.430> range<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.880> people

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
appeal to you know wide range of people

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.990 
appeal to you know wide range of people
who<00:01:39.840> haven't<00:01:40.170> got<00:01:40.500> comp<00:01:40.799> curbs<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.490> I've<00:01:41.759> got

a<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.750> high<00:01:43.130> XP<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:45.540> skill<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.259> two

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
a really high XP in one skill or two

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.950 
a really high XP in one skill or two
skills<00:01:46.829> or<00:01:47.100> something<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.579> maybe<00:01:48.540> but

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
skills or something like that maybe but

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.289 
skills or something like that maybe but
I'm<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:49.799> against<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.549> quite<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.139 
have just made it two hundred mil Kip's
instead<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.329> 120<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.700> 200<00:02:02.700> miles<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
instead of 120 because 200 miles are a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.459 
instead of 120 because 200 miles are a
bit<00:02:03.299> bigger<00:02:03.479> achievements<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.170> guess<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
bit bigger achievements and I guess it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.620 
bit bigger achievements and I guess it
would<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.950> worth<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> development<00:02:06.149> time<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
would be worth the development time in a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.479 
would be worth the development time in a
way<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.049> little<00:02:07.560> bit<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> know

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
way a little bit more but you know

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.529 
way a little bit more but you know
whatever<00:02:08.700> i'm<00:02:08.940> happy<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.479> too

happening<00:02:25.719> on<00:02:26.379> thursday<00:02:26.799> this<00:02:27.430> video<00:02:27.700> should

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909

go<00:02:28.090> up<00:02:28.209> on<00:02:28.359> Thursday<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.109> update<00:02:29.379> should

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
go up on Thursday so the update should

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.789 
go up on Thursday so the update should
be<00:02:29.680> today<00:02:31.079> basically<00:02:32.079> what<00:02:32.379> happens<00:02:32.859> is<00:02:33.689> the

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
be today basically what happens is the

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.949 
be today basically what happens is the
system<00:02:35.799> will<00:02:36.129> detect<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.730> bots<00:02:36.939> and<00:02:37.180> move

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
system will detect the bots and move

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.860 
system will detect the bots and move
them<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> world<00:02:38.889> that<00:02:39.220> only<00:02:39.849> has<00:02:40.299> bots<00:02:40.569> in<00:02:40.750> it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
them to a world that only has bots in it

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.349 
them to a world that only has bots in it
so<00:02:41.019> they<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.379> be<00:02:41.469> analyzed<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.400> checked<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
so they can be analyzed and checked and

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.160 
so they can be analyzed and checked and
so<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.260> bot<00:02:44.409> war<00:02:44.590> software<00:02:45.069> can<00:02:45.340> be<00:02:46.170> you

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
so that the bot war software can be you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.220 
so that the bot war software can be you
know<00:02:47.200> made<00:02:48.189> better<00:02:48.459> in<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:49.000> way<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.540> we

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
know made better in a way so that we

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.690 
know made better in a way so that we
don't<00:02:50.439> need<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.859> worlds<00:02:51.129> in<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.250> future<00:02:51.609> and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
don't need the worlds in the future and

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.789 
don't need the worlds in the future and
they<00:02:51.819> can<00:02:51.970> just<00:02:52.150> be<00:02:52.269> aldo<00:02:52.569> band<00:02:52.840> but<00:02:53.169> it<00:02:53.319> they

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
they can just be aldo band but it they

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.640 
they can just be aldo band but it they
solve<00:02:54.359> acknowledge<00:02:55.359> that<00:02:55.659> okay<00:02:56.019> they're

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
solve acknowledge that okay they're

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.009 
solve acknowledge that okay they're
being<00:02:56.919> a<00:02:57.099> few<00:02:57.579> bands<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:58.569> been<00:02:58.720> wrong

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
being a few bands that have been wrong

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.470

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
can you check it and then the system

seconds later that do it to the other

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.479
