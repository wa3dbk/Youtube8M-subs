going to take it up down up down up down

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 
going to take it up down up down up down
up<00:00:38.070> down<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> music<00:00:39.510> it'll<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
up down now with the music it'll be a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.170 
up down now with the music it'll be a
little<00:00:40.320> faster<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.640> basically<00:00:42.059> all

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
little faster but this is basically all

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.420 
little faster but this is basically all
you're<00:00:42.600> doing<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.440> taking<00:00:43.829> your<00:00:44.160> hip

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430

from<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.620> switch<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
from up to down and then we switch to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
from up to down and then we switch to
the<00:00:47.399> left<00:00:47.579> side<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.570> you're<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.200> up

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the left side so that you're going up

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.139 
the left side so that you're going up
down<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:50.160> down<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.789> down<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:51.420> down<00:00:52.699> ok<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
down up down up down up down ok so this

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.700 
down up down up down up down ok so this
is<00:00:54.329> our<00:00:54.539> first<00:00:54.840> step<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.230> we're<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is our first step that we're going to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
is our first step that we're going to
use<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.670> we're<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> take<00:00:57.239> what

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
use and then we're going to take what

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.080 
use and then we're going to take what
you<00:00:57.539> learned<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.320> basic<00:00:59.039> footwork<00:00:59.340> which

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you learned in the basic footwork which

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
you learned in the basic footwork which
is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.539> 1-2-3<00:01:01.440> step<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.100> we're<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> take

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
is a 1-2-3 step and we're going to take

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.880 
is a 1-2-3 step and we're going to take
it<00:01:02.879> backwards<00:01:03.409> let's<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.650> without<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it backwards let's do it without the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.429 
it backwards let's do it without the
hands<00:01:05.309> first<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.390> you're<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.140> back

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
hands first so that you're going back

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.530 
hands first so that you're going back
with<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:07.950> right<00:01:08.189> foot<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:09.270> stepping

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
one two three one two three one two

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.789 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:01:14.210> one<00:01:15.210> two<00:01:15.420> three<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.619> take

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
three one two three now you can take

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.190 
three one two three now you can take
that<00:01:16.860> same<00:01:17.040> thing<00:01:17.549> forward<00:01:17.970> stepping<00:01:18.780> again

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that same thing forward stepping again

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
that same thing forward stepping again
with<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:20.880> three

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
with the right and it's one two three

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.649 
with the right and it's one two three
one<00:01:22.140> two<00:01:22.439> three<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:23.009> two<00:01:23.430> three<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:24.630> two

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
one two three one two three one two

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.470> let's<00:01:25.680> try<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> take<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> little

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
three so let's try to take that a little

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.350 
three so let's try to take that a little
bit<00:01:26.880> faster<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.659> five<00:01:28.470> six<00:01:28.979> seven<00:01:29.759> eight<00:01:29.939> it's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
bit faster in five six seven eight it's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.749 
bit faster in five six seven eight it's
one<00:01:30.689> two<00:01:30.900> three<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:31.770> three<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.729> two

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
one two three one two three one two

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.420 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:01:33.000> great<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> forward<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.860> two<00:01:34.890> three

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
three great and forward one two three

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.330 
three great and forward one two three
one<00:01:35.820> two<00:01:36.060> three<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.540> two<00:01:36.900> three<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.619> two

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
one two three one two three one two

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.210 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.900> next<00:01:40.049> step<00:01:40.380> we're<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
three the next step we're going to do is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.789 
three the next step we're going to do is
take<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.909> around<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.229> we're<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:43.680> an

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
take this around so we're going to do an

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.710 
take this around so we're going to do an
around-the-world<00:01:44.310> starting<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> front

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
around-the-world starting with the front

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.840 
around-the-world starting with the front
and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.470> hitting<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> sides<00:01:47.430> just

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
and then hitting all the sides just

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.819 
and then hitting all the sides just
stepping<00:01:48.119> out<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.750> toe<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.619> you're

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
stepping out with the toe so you're

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.410 
stepping out with the toe so you're
going<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.960> side<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:53.189> back<00:01:53.549> then

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
going to go one then side then back then

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
going to go one then side then back then
side<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.290> we'll<00:01:55.619> take<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.130> our<00:01:56.250> left

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
side and we'll take it with our left

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.929 
side and we'll take it with our left
foot<00:01:56.670> leading<00:01:57.240> top<00:01:57.869> front<00:01:58.320> side<00:01:59.119> back<00:02:00.119> side<00:02:01.939> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
foot leading top front side back side so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.060 
foot leading top front side back side so
that's<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.329> next<00:02:03.540> step<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.829> goes

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that's the next step and then that goes

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.449 
that's the next step and then that goes
straight<00:02:05.310> into<00:02:06.110> you'll<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.829> limp<00:02:08.129> step

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
straight into you'll do your limp step

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.790 
straight into you'll do your limp step
again<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.660> time<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.140> body<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.649> going

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
again but this time your body is going

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.180 
again but this time your body is going

from<00:02:11.370> down<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:12.450> up<00:02:12.480> using<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.500> hand<00:02:13.860> roll<00:02:14.100> so

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
from down to up using a hand roll so

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.160
