fudge the issue a little bit and talk

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:14.619 
fudge the issue a little bit and talk
about<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.819> health<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.449> medical

practices rather than the doping and I

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.899 
practices rather than the doping and I
also<00:05:17.810> fear<00:05:18.319> that<00:05:18.560> um

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
also fear that um

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
Oprah Winfrey and that again that means

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.159 
Oprah Winfrey and that again that means
some<00:05:22.550> American<00:05:22.969> audience<00:05:23.270> wouldn't<00:05:23.960> be<00:05:24.050> all

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
some American audience wouldn't be all

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.050 
some American audience wouldn't be all
that<00:05:24.199> interested<00:05:24.529> in<00:05:25.069> the<00:05:25.189> rules<00:05:25.400> of<00:05:25.699> people

Verbruggen or the UCI that kind of

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.930 
Verbruggen or the UCI that kind of
specific<00:05:30.409> information<00:05:30.949> that<00:05:31.370> cycling<00:05:31.729> fans

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
specific information that cycling fans

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.309 
specific information that cycling fans
would<00:05:32.090> be<00:05:32.210> very<00:05:32.389> interesting<00:05:32.810> thing<00:05:32.960> out<00:05:33.110> but

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
would be very interesting thing out but

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.689 
would be very interesting thing out but
I<00:05:33.379> don't<00:05:33.529> think<00:05:33.710> that<00:05:33.949> means<00:05:34.159> Team<00:05:34.340> American

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
I don't think that means Team American

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.730 
I don't think that means Team American
audience<00:05:35.029> will<00:05:35.270> be<00:05:35.419> all<00:05:35.960> that<00:05:36.139> interested<00:05:36.650> in

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
audience will be all that interested in

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.820 
audience will be all that interested in
okay<00:05:37.460> so<00:05:37.520> we<00:05:37.729> get<00:05:37.879> the<00:05:38.029> admission<00:05:38.650> that's<00:05:39.650> what

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
okay so we get the admission that's what

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.040 
okay so we get the admission that's what
we<00:05:39.949> want<00:05:40.219> for<00:05:40.669> cycling<00:05:41.300> what<00:05:41.870> are<00:05:41.960> the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
we want for cycling what are the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.260 
we want for cycling what are the
implications<00:05:42.349> once<00:05:42.979> we've<00:05:43.159> got<00:05:43.400> it<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:43.759> don't

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
implications once we've got it I don't

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.119 
implications once we've got it I don't
think<00:05:44.419> there<00:05:45.050> are<00:05:45.199> many<00:05:45.379> implications<00:05:45.710> for

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
think there are many implications for

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.219 
think there are many implications for
cycling<00:05:46.430> we<00:05:46.490> know<00:05:46.669> what<00:05:46.849> went<00:05:47.029> on<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.599> it's

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
cycling we know what went on and it's

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.839 
cycling we know what went on and it's
more<00:05:48.379> about<00:05:48.560> Lance<00:05:48.889> Armstrong<00:05:49.430> though<00:05:49.610> and

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
more about Lance Armstrong though and

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.219 
more about Lance Armstrong though and
that's<00:05:50.089> why<00:05:50.360> he's<00:05:50.509> doing<00:05:50.690> it<00:05:50.810> he's<00:05:50.960> doing<00:05:50.990> it

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
that's why he's doing it he's doing it

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.680 
that's why he's doing it he's doing it
to<00:05:51.379> try<00:05:51.529> and<00:05:51.620> manage<00:05:52.520> some<00:05:52.909> kind<00:05:53.120> of<00:05:53.150> return<00:05:53.479> I

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
to try and manage some kind of return I

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.240 
to try and manage some kind of return I
think<00:05:53.719> to<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.319> public<00:05:54.620> life<00:05:54.770> in<00:05:54.979> some<00:05:55.219> way

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
think to the public life in some way

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.980 
think to the public life in some way
shape<00:05:55.430> or<00:05:55.729> form<00:05:55.849> I<00:05:56.000> don't<00:05:56.180> think<00:05:56.389> that<00:05:56.509> can<00:05:56.839> be

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
shape or form I don't think that can be

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.779 
shape or form I don't think that can be
in<00:05:57.110> sport<00:05:57.500> no<00:05:57.830> it's<00:05:58.310> certainly<00:05:58.430> not<00:05:58.580> in

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
in sport no it's certainly not in

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.939 
in sport no it's certainly not in
cycling<00:05:59.240> but<00:05:59.960> he<00:06:00.050> clearly<00:06:00.229> you<00:06:00.770> know<00:06:00.889> it

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
cycling but he clearly you know it

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.649 
cycling but he clearly you know it
doesn't<00:06:01.219> want<00:06:01.310> to<00:06:01.370> go<00:06:01.490> quietly<00:06:01.849> he<00:06:02.210> wants<00:06:02.479> to

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
doesn't want to go quietly he wants to

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.629 
doesn't want to go quietly he wants to
return<00:06:03.020> otherwise<00:06:03.349> why<00:06:03.860> would<00:06:04.099> he<00:06:04.190> be<00:06:04.370> and

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
return otherwise why would he be and

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.180 
return otherwise why would he be and
