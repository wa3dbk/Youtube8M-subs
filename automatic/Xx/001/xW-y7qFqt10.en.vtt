00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.350 
the lawn or something so just be careful
when<00:01:53.490> you're<00:01:53.580> going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.910> overextend

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
when you're going to overextend

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.000 
when you're going to overextend
especially<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.290> you're<00:01:55.380> running<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.710> black

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
especially if you're running like black

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.880 
especially if you're running like black
wings<00:01:56.310> or<00:01:56.550> synchro<00:01:56.910> cattle<00:01:57.330> as<00:01:57.480> though<00:01:57.890> all

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
wings or synchro cattle as though all

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
wings or synchro cattle as though all
right<00:01:58.980> so<00:01:59.220> uh<00:01:59.250> another<00:02:00.120> thing<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.690> do

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
right so uh another thing that they do

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.350 
right so uh another thing that they do
is<00:02:01.050> a<00:02:01.080> calling<00:02:01.530> priority<00:02:02.250> some<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.240> guys

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
is a calling priority some of you guys

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.880 
is a calling priority some of you guys
might<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:03.900> it<00:02:03.930> does<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:04.470> of<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.650> may

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
might know what it does some of you may

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.630 
might know what it does some of you may
not<00:02:05.900> basically<00:02:06.900> priority<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.280> simplest

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
not basically priority in the simplest

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.940 
not basically priority in the simplest
terms<00:02:09.000> as<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> monster<00:02:09.899> uses<00:02:10.170> its<00:02:10.560> effect

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
terms as a monster uses its effect

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.400 
terms as a monster uses its effect
before<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.550> dies<00:02:11.870> it's<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:12.990> let's<00:02:13.230> say<00:02:13.290> you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
before it dies it's like let's say you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.550 
before it dies it's like let's say you
something<00:02:13.740> snipe<00:02:13.980> honor<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.520> example<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
something snipe honor for example and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.340 
something snipe honor for example and
your<00:02:16.680> opponent<00:02:16.890> chains<00:02:17.340> bottomless<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.350> you

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
your opponent chains bottomless if you

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.140 
your opponent chains bottomless if you
call<00:02:19.620> party<00:02:19.950> already<00:02:20.100> on<00:02:20.340> site<00:02:20.550> hunter<00:02:20.910> will

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
call party already on site hunter will

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.970 
call party already on site hunter will
still<00:02:21.360> get<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.630> use<00:02:21.660> as<00:02:21.930> effect<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:22.710> time

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
still get to use as effect just one time

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.740 
still get to use as effect just one time
so<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.610> discard<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.270> wall<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
so you get to discard in the wall and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.580 
so you get to discard in the wall and
then<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.710> then<00:02:26.340> it'll<00:02:26.580> die<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.660> let's<00:02:28.500> say

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
then I then it'll die but like let's say

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.580 
then I then it'll die but like let's say
you<00:02:29.090> dump<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.480> get<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.200> still

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
you dump and you get a for you still

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.920 
you dump and you get a for you still
destroy<00:02:31.920> your<00:02:32.070> opponent's<00:02:32.430> monster<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.150> also

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
destroy your opponent's monster I also

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.690 
destroy your opponent's monster I also
works<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.320> cards<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.800> Gale<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.520> other

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
works for cards like Gale and just other

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.240 
works for cards like Gale and just other
things<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:37.380> use<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.770> once<00:02:38.040> per

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
things that you can use like once per

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.440 
things that you can use like once per
turn<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.070> can't<00:02:41.400> call<00:02:41.670> priority<00:02:42.270> on

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
turn but like you can't call priority on

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.699 
turn but like you can't call priority on
a<00:02:42.480> banisher<00:02:43.080> because<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.680> a

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
a banisher because it's like a

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.310 
a banisher because it's like a
continuous<00:02:44.430> effect<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.230> anything<00:02:46.230> with

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
continuous effect to like anything with

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.020 
continuous effect to like anything with
a<00:02:46.380> continuous<00:02:47.040> effect<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.550> can't<00:02:47.820> call

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
a continuous effect you can't call

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.030 
a continuous effect you can't call
priority<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:49.470> anything<00:02:49.740> what's<00:02:49.920> in

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
priority on but anything what's in

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.890 
priority on but anything what's in
effect<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.330> use<00:02:51.450> once<00:02:51.690> per

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
effect like that you can use once per

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.449 
effect like that you can use once per
turn<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.350> think<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:52.800> called<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.220> trigger

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
turn I think it's called like a trigger

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.940 
turn I think it's called like a trigger
effect<00:02:53.670> or<00:02:54.030> something<00:02:54.330> like<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.800> could

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
effect or something like that you could

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.460 
effect or something like that you could
use<00:02:56.250> priority<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.900> just<00:02:57.930> make<00:02:58.290> sure

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
use priority on it so you just make sure

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.979 
use priority on it so you just make sure
you<00:02:58.560> do<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.880> way<00:03:00.030> it's<00:03:00.209> supposed<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.750> be

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
you do that the way it's supposed to be

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.410 
you do that the way it's supposed to be
your<00:03:01.320> opponent<00:03:01.560> ask<00:03:01.980> if<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.610> want<00:03:02.820> priority

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
your opponent ask if you want priority

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.540 
your opponent ask if you want priority
so<00:03:03.600> like<00:03:03.750> let's<00:03:04.050> say<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.260> summon<00:03:04.709> saipan<00:03:05.400> it

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
so like let's say you summon saipan it

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.210 
so like let's say you summon saipan it
and<00:03:05.790> they'll<00:03:06.480> ask<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:07.019> do<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.350> want<00:03:07.590> priority

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
and they'll ask you do you want priority

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.530 
and they'll ask you do you want priority
and<00:03:08.340> most<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:08.970> time<00:03:09.150> you're<00:03:09.269> going<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.450> say

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
and most of the time you're going to say

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.860 
and most of the time you're going to say
yes<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:10.050> is<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.290> stupid<00:03:10.680> not<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:12.540> just

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
yes that is just stupid not to it's just

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.290 
yes that is just stupid not to it's just
in<00:03:13.019> case<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.709> priority<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:14.850> smart<00:03:15.000> to

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
in case like priority is just smart to

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.880 
in case like priority is just smart to
do<00:03:15.450> if<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.810> didn't<00:03:16.050> know<00:03:16.140> about<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.650> now<00:03:16.830> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
do if you didn't know about it now you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.350 
do if you didn't know about it now you
should<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.550> should<00:03:17.580> be<00:03:17.820> calling<00:03:18.030> party
