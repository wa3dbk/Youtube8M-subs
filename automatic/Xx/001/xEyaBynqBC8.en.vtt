00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
too sure if I'm going to go out and loan

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.109 
too sure if I'm going to go out and loan
I'm<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:43.979> too<00:01:44.189> sure<00:01:44.369> yet<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:44.610> he<00:01:44.790> played<00:01:44.970> what

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
I'm not too sure yet but he played what

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.130 
I'm not too sure yet but he played what
a<00:01:45.149> couple<00:01:45.450> game<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.780> them<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.049> they

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a couple game to them and then they

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.270 
a couple game to them and then they
probably<00:01:46.229> offered<00:01:46.530> me<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> loan<00:01:46.829> deal<00:01:49.280> alright

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
probably offered me a loan deal alright

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
probably offered me a loan deal alright
so<00:01:50.520> looks<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> first<00:01:51.119> game<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.509> against

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
