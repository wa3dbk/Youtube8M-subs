helped tremendously not only to read
about<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.200> needed<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.559> done<00:00:37.649> but

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
about what needed to be done but

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.430 
about what needed to be done but
actually<00:00:38.969> see<00:00:39.210> somebody<00:00:39.629> doing<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
actually see somebody doing it and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.900 
actually see somebody doing it and
following<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> process<00:00:41.190> those

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
following the process those

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.520 
following the process those
instructional<00:00:42.540> videos<00:00:42.840> were<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.200> helpful

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
instructional videos were really helpful

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.200 
instructional videos were really helpful
the<00:00:43.770> most<00:00:43.980> fun<00:00:44.160> part<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> project<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.059> me

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the most fun part of the project for me

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.029 
the most fun part of the project for me
I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.690> spraying<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> color<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I think was spraying on the color and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
I think was spraying on the color and
then<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.700> watching<00:00:48.030> each<00:00:48.239> successive<00:00:48.989> step

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
then just watching each successive step

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.319 
then just watching each successive step
of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> color<00:00:49.890> process<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> sealer

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of the color process and then a sealer

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.970 
of the color process and then a sealer
just<00:00:51.960> bring<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> colors<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.890> want

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
just bring out the colors that you want

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.920 
just bring out the colors that you want
to<00:00:53.100> put<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.280> there<00:00:53.430> putting<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.570> concrete

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to put in there putting on the concrete

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.310 
to put in there putting on the concrete
the<00:00:55.170> troweling<00:00:55.500> took<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> time<00:00:57.230> but<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the troweling took a lot of time but it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
the troweling took a lot of time but it
was<00:00:58.440> fun<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.770> watch<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.070> come<00:00:59.190> together<00:00:59.370> I'd

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
was fun to watch it come together I'd

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
was fun to watch it come together I'd
say<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.510> favorite<00:01:00.539> part<00:01:01.020> was<00:01:01.140> actually<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.680> me

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
say my favorite part was actually for me

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.260 
say my favorite part was actually for me
on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> sealer<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.820> didn't<00:01:03.030> put<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> on

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
on the sealer which I didn't put it on

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.859 
on the sealer which I didn't put it on
he<00:01:03.539> put<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.970> feel<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.330> even

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
he put it on but it I feel like even

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.420 
he put it on but it I feel like even
though<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.110> was<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> end<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> color

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
though I was at the end of the color

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
though I was at the end of the color
process<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.510> okay<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:09.930> that's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
process I was like okay I think that's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.760 
process I was like okay I think that's
what<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> like

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
what I like

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.649 
what I like
once<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> sealer<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> actually<00:01:12.210> really

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
once the sealer was on I actually really

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
once the sealer was on I actually really
liked<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.049> yeah<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.740> sealing<00:01:14.490> process

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
liked it yeah the the sealing process

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.200 
liked it yeah the the sealing process
was<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.479> relatively<00:01:15.930> easy<00:01:16.080> -<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:17.210> putting

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
was was relatively easy - just putting

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.789 
was was relatively easy - just putting
it<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.720> rolling<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> off<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> tools

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it on and rolling it off all the tools

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.499 
it on and rolling it off all the tools
that<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.130> need<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.700> process<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.390> in

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that you need to do that process or in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
that you need to do that process or in
the<00:01:21.630> kit<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.619> made<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> really

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the kit and it just made it really

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.290 
the kit and it just made it really
straightforward<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.759> simple<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.390> that

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
straightforward really simple to do that

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.420 
straightforward really simple to do that
I<00:01:26.160> know<00:01:27.160> that<00:01:27.460> if<00:01:27.580> we<00:01:27.840> went<00:01:28.840> out<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.200> bought<00:01:29.650> a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
I know that if we went out and bought a

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.620 
I know that if we went out and bought a
different<00:01:30.640> kind<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:30.910> countertop<00:01:31.330> we<00:01:31.480> would

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
different kind of countertop we would

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.090 
different kind of countertop we would
have<00:01:31.720> spent<00:01:31.930> thousands<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.500> thousands<00:01:32.920> more

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
have spent thousands and thousands more

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.910 
have spent thousands and thousands more
and<00:01:33.370> so<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.150> be<00:01:34.270> able<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.480> do<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.800> do

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
and so to be able to do this and to do

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.190 
and so to be able to do this and to do
it<00:01:36.040> ourselves<00:01:36.360> even<00:01:37.360> saving<00:01:37.630> money<00:01:37.870> over

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
it ourselves even saving money over

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.410 
it ourselves even saving money over
having<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.530> contractor<00:01:39.190> do<00:01:39.370> it<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.330> was

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
having a contractor do it and it was

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.860 
having a contractor do it and it was
very<00:01:40.630> doable<00:01:40.810> I'm<00:01:41.410> just<00:01:41.620> excited<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.130> use<00:01:42.310> it

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
very doable I'm just excited to use it
