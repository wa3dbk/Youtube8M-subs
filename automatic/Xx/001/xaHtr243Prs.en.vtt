00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
be more comfortable so that is what we

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.039 
be more comfortable so that is what we
like<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.289> do<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:42.149> this<00:01:42.450> part<00:01:42.719> normally

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
like to do here and this part normally

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.240 
like to do here and this part normally
just<00:01:43.200> takes<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.469> couple<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.770> seconds<00:01:44.130> then

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
just takes a couple of seconds then

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:53.200 
just takes a couple of seconds then
we'll<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.490> back<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.000> running

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.620 

cool<00:01:54.109> part<00:01:54.380> about<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:56.240> does

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
cool part about this is that it does

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.429 
cool part about this is that it does
change<00:01:56.990> everything<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.799> Spanish<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.439> that's

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
change everything to Spanish so that's

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.459 
change everything to Spanish so that's
why<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.649> does<00:02:00.859> take<00:02:01.039> so<00:02:01.219> long<00:02:01.369> for<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.819> to<00:02:02.469> you

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
why it does take so long for it to you

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.289 
why it does take so long for it to you
know<00:02:03.619> set<00:02:04.159> up<00:02:04.189> obviously<00:02:04.549> right<00:02:04.850> now<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.210> in
