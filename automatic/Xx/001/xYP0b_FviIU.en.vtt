00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.759
 hi everyone is giving up for a new text video 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.679
 in the historic heart 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.429
 a few hours today and I'll teach you from the command see a 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.869
 police helicopter 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.960
 without being discovered in europe to unblock the second 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.919
 half 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.029
 his advice vouaux I must go 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.449
 right here 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.800
 so there I do not know if you see that this 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.679
 right here 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.050
 it takes a car fast enough activate the code 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.560
 improved driving 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.430
 to be able to jump 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 but now you see that it's up to God 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.650
 so percent you for that you go in this house 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.840
 and then 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 they must succeed in framing 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.840
 you have to go between this level 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.220
 and this post 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.700
 to get on the bridge 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.400
 so I will show you 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.300
 manpower 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.300
 it's a little hard in the stands also generate the tp not 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.870
 still worth it 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.600
 after the busy from then on 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.700
 you jump 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 it's the feast of the woods those who do not know it 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 for me 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 so after you say nothing 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.340
 and to jump you 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.290
 you arrive on the bridge 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.550
 so the last one said that here you cite 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.020
 poutine that me 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.490
 if necessary you disable the code 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.490
 code improve driving if you arrive ravec boss 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 but I do not want disabled to avoid a waste of time 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 that's the solution 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.220
 these options are 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.100
 young and old here 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.560
 for him if you always continue straight 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.670
 cross this guy is there 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 in shape to russia you turn right 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.740
 then left 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.819
 and here it is the police station 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.199
 but they are not the same as in the first city 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.239
 carole usa here after the usa 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.199
 finally on the roof there is a helicopter 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.589
 so convey it here 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.409
 then to burst 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.639
 their counter and the days that followed to have fun 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.639
 she could even if her site the current list 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.529
 finally very robust and% and especially very manageable 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:41.809
 no longer be able to max speed slightly the cabin down 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.879
 we have a lot of support for three years 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.109
 to accelerate 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.010
 for all the nose at night at everyone's taste meeting 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.419
 the panel of him 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.309
 analog 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.189
 which is not very practical however which is very convenient for 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.739
 the user the buttons l and r 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.789
 it's like that 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:01.849
 now that you are already in the morning as if 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:02.760
 fortis 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.689
 ouattara 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.939
 the halls like that 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.449
 you are lightly and to fall you are more on earth wen 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.509
 she for left-handed pr to raise taxes 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.149
 so here is appeal to you can opt for three quarters of the balloons 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:21.699
 in Europe and more than half of the flights are accessible only by 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.539
 those who operate 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.879
 so here you go on the roof 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.349
 as I was happy in my previous video on the same place 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.349
 right next to the ax for lavillenie 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.349
 I do not have unpunished are not forgetting the fait accompli 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.299
 but there 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.169
 You put 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.459
 the helicopter carrier 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.579
 and you can find a lot of beautiful things and so must look for it a little 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.149
 thank you for having a look at this video 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.949
 and we find ourselves for next videos 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.369
 so thanks to all of you again 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.599
 how are your goods and chaos
