that can be recycled coins jewelry and

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.719 
that can be recycled coins jewelry and
there<00:01:49.049> isn't<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> big<00:01:50.100> means<00:01:50.399> they're

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
there isn't there is a big means they're

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
there isn't there is a big means they're
start<00:01:51.119> buying<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.049> they<00:01:52.259> start<00:01:52.560> digging

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
start buying it they start digging

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.730 
start buying it they start digging
because<00:01:53.720> they<00:01:54.720> start<00:01:55.079> turning<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
because they start turning to the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.399 
because they start turning to the
sources<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:57.180> they<00:01:57.479> weren't<00:01:57.810> considering

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
sources that they weren't considering

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.889 
sources that they weren't considering
before<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.579> take<00:01:59.820> enough<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
before because they can take enough to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.999 
before because they can take enough to
meet<00:02:02.659> investments<00:02:03.659> silver<00:02:04.290> because<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:04.799> can

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
meet investments silver because they can

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
meet investments silver because they can
they<00:02:05.219> cannot<00:02:05.549> find<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:05.969> enough<00:02:06.299> silver<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
they cannot find in enough silver for it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.809 
they cannot find in enough silver for it
for<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> demand<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> price<00:02:08.520> should<00:02:08.789> be

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
for the demand so the price should be

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:16.369 
for the demand so the price should be
much<00:02:09.119> higher<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:13.250> okay<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.989> i'm<00:02:15.989> going<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
much higher and okay so now i'm going to

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.040 
much higher and okay so now i'm going to
i<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.959> watch<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.520> endless<00:02:20.520> Mountain<00:02:21.060> videos

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
about and he mentioned the correction

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.040 
about and he mentioned the correction
thirty<00:02:25.770> percent<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.390> want<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.660> link

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
thirty percent and I just want to link

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.470 
thirty percent and I just want to link
to<00:02:28.170> something<00:02:28.860> here<00:02:29.400> because<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.970> think<00:02:30.239> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
to something here because I think that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
to something here because I think that
is<00:02:31.019> how<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.860> physical<00:02:32.010> schools<00:02:32.610> will<00:02:32.849> play

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
is how the physical schools will play

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.650 
is how the physical schools will play
out<00:02:33.170> okay<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.580> have<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.940> price<00:02:36.180> let's<00:02:36.480> say

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
out okay so we have the price let's say

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.800 
out okay so we have the price let's say
if<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:37.080> if<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.280> happened<00:02:38.730> really<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.510> really

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
if if if it's happened really a really

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.020 
if if if it's happened really a really
fast<00:02:40.110> i<00:02:40.349> think<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.709> really<00:02:40.950> possible<00:02:41.030> so

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
fast i think it's really possible so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.199 
fast i think it's really possible so
let's<00:02:42.840> say<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.110> price<00:02:43.319> goes<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:44.099> them<00:02:44.430> forty

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
let's say the price goes to them forty

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.699 
let's say the price goes to them forty
dollars<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.930> week<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.500> then<00:02:48.530> because<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
dollars in one week and then because the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.740 
dollars in one week and then because the
investor<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.160> mine<00:02:50.489> from<00:02:50.940> what<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> discovered

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
investor the mine from what I discovered

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.170 
investor the mine from what I discovered
when<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.140> price<00:02:52.379> moves<00:02:52.769> higher<00:02:53.160> there<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
when the price moves higher there is a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.180 
when the price moves higher there is a
bigger<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.660> rash<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.680> silver<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:57.590> if<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
bigger a rash to the silver and if the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.820 
bigger a rash to the silver and if the
investor<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.590> price

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
investor see is that the it's the price

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.410 
investor see is that the it's the price
is<00:03:02.040> what<00:03:02.250> coming<00:03:03.030> down<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.959> my<00:03:04.140> my<00:03:04.379> traders

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
is what coming down and my my traders

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.960 
is what coming down and my my traders
sideways<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.810> couple<00:03:07.140> days<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.560> if<00:03:08.099> did<00:03:08.730> more

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
sideways for couple days but if did more

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.149 
sideways for couple days but if did more
than<00:03:09.000> man<00:03:09.390> camps<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.319> dent<00:03:10.530> price<00:03:10.920> will

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
than man camps then the dent price will

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.750 
than man camps then the dent price will
move<00:03:11.400> higher<00:03:11.670> again<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.300> if<00:03:12.690> there<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:12.989> a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
move higher again and if there is a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.100 
move higher again and if there is a
appearance<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.909> the<00:03:15.030> physical<00:03:15.420> squeeze<00:03:15.870> you

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
appearance of the physical squeeze you

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.100 
appearance of the physical squeeze you
will<00:03:16.319> have<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> big<00:03:16.920> rush<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:18.110> speculative

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
will have a big rush of the speculative

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.940 
will have a big rush of the speculative
money<00:03:19.500> where<00:03:20.310> which<00:03:20.730> make<00:03:21.360> move<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.709> price

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
money where which make move the price

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.050 
money where which make move the price
even<00:03:23.190> higher<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.239> think<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:26.670> it's<00:03:26.879> not

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
even higher and I think that it's not

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.869 
even higher and I think that it's not
going<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.420> make<00:03:27.569> if<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.830> move<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.459> sixty

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
going to make if this move to sixty

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.420 
going to make if this move to sixty
dollars<00:03:30.269> really<00:03:31.110> fast<00:03:31.379> let's<00:03:31.650> let's<00:03:31.980> say<00:03:32.159> at

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
dollars really fast let's let's say at

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.420 
dollars really fast let's let's say at
this<00:03:33.299> moving<00:03:33.750> one<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.140> can<00:03:34.290> move<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.769> in

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
this moving one we can move like that in

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.780 
this moving one we can move like that in
two<00:03:35.670> weeks<00:03:35.879> or<00:03:36.180> even<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.110> one<00:03:37.349> week<00:03:37.620> then<00:03:38.489> it's

people that are holding silver right now

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.280 
people that are holding silver right now
I'm<00:04:02.250> not<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.730> make<00:04:03.569> their<00:04:03.870> silver

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
I'm not going to make their silver

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.240 
I'm not going to make their silver
available<00:04:04.890> at<00:04:05.099> this<00:04:05.549> price<00:04:05.849> so<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:07.500> has<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.860> go

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
available at this price so it has to go

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.429 
available at this price so it has to go
to<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.549> other<00:04:08.819> value<00:04:09.360> level<00:04:09.989> really<00:04:10.260> fast

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
to the other value level really fast

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:16.249 
to the other value level really fast
okay<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:12.409> you<00:04:13.409> will<00:04:13.560> see<00:04:14.099> money<00:04:14.700> moves<00:04:15.629> there

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
okay and you will see money moves there

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.920 
okay and you will see money moves there
really<00:04:16.919> quick<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.870> price<00:04:19.139> may<00:04:19.560> double

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
really quick and the price may double

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.749 
really quick and the price may double
maybe<00:04:21.930> this

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
maybe this

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.689 
maybe this
might<00:04:23.759> take<00:04:24.500> more<00:04:25.500> than<00:04:25.710> one<00:04:26.009> week<00:04:26.220> okay

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
might take more than one week okay

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.439 
might take more than one week okay
because<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:28.650> know<00:04:28.800> from<00:04:29.100> 62<00:04:29.729> it's<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.090> hundred

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
because you know from 62 it's a hundred

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.810 
because you know from 62 it's a hundred
percent<00:04:30.570> gain<00:04:31.050> here<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:31.830> maybe<00:04:32.310> we'll<00:04:32.639> be

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
percent gain here so maybe we'll be

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.680 
percent gain here so maybe we'll be
talking<00:04:33.080> one<00:04:34.080> month<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:35.060> derek<00:04:36.060> when<00:04:36.270> he<00:04:36.300> said

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
talking one month and derek when he said

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.219 
talking one month and derek when he said
thirty<00:04:37.199> percent<00:04:37.590> intermediate<00:04:38.430> correction

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
thirty percent intermediate correction

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.060 
thirty percent intermediate correction
which<00:04:40.229> is<00:04:40.410> i<00:04:40.530> calculate<00:04:41.340> $84<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:42.870> that's<00:04:43.229> how<00:04:44.039> I

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
which is i calculate $84 so that's how I

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.900 
which is i calculate $84 so that's how I
think<00:04:44.520> it's<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.300> play<00:04:45.539> out<00:04:45.810> okay<00:04:46.910> because

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
think it's it can play out okay because
