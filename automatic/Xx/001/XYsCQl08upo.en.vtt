00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.830
 today we attend the launch 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.250
 from firefox 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.259
 in Mexico this is thanks to telephone 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.209
 that is working to bring this to 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.209
 world level let's know what 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.369
 it's basically an operating system 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:37.110
 new open that is web-based 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.090
 he said it his moment is based on all 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.070
 the web programmers that exist in the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 world that exist in mexico is going to be 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.100
 native to them that they can create 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 applications for this platform is the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:54.880
 Argentinean Ecuador possible 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.880
 then Central America the five countries 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.880
 Guatemala 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.110
 the importance that what are the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.150
 factors that most concern this 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.810
 generation one of the relevant data 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.680
 What this survey shows is that the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 part of this generation 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.230
 the next presents already of leaders of the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.840
 world 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.390
 think that access to technology 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.670
 opens or no access to technology opens 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.220
 more the gap between rich and poor with 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 which between greater access to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.710
 technology there are greater opportunities 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 there and that gap can be closed others to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.400
 from there is that we see here 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.470
 in Mexico like 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.950
 a very important project for our 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.950
 rear 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.570
 we think that today in the world of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.150
 device in the world of systems 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.700
 operational although it is very competitive 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.750
 today there are well-known brands such as 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.610
 platforms such as memories 18 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.580
 android et cetera etcetera but we see a 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.280
 opportunity to think from an optical 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.870
 very different from what these companies 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.850
 that they are seeing the market 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.399
 we see an opportunity for the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 beginner for the one who starts in 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.940
 this world of technology this world 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.550
 of smartphones in having a 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.250
 platform that is not completely closed 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.520
 it's an open platform and it's starting 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.980
 from that moment that our show the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.700
 company in our main reference 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.060
 What is it 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.090
 josemari albacete takes the initiative 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.250
 look for a platform that already has 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.709
 experience in the world in the field of 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.959
 the web to take it to mobile phones and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.000
 the telephone hand as a means to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.850
 market and to take this 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.780
 technology to many people who 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.780
 go one way or another 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.940
 today 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.810
 that's why it's one of the models that 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.810
 available 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.670
 is a phone that adapts to the user 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.810
 we are here 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.170
 results for example 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.310
 sample 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.310
 the service 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.990
 looking for some of those are also 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.860
 applications that can be taught in the 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.860
 phone 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.040
 one of the five 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.920
 we are going to go because they leave the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.920
 time 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.659
 but if the lady 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.380
 yet can not do any other 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.380
 smartphone 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.720
 you can make calls 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.580
 m 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.580
 Text message 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 merkel 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.800
 any other 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.800
 democracy functionality 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.210
 one of the advantages of this 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.340
 product is also accessibility in 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.460
 price terms price ratio 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.539
 benefits of this device 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.800
 he has powerful processors and even 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.389
 when the device does not have a 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.520
 processor so powerful thanks to the 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.560
 feature that has to be based 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.690
 in html5 strong forgiveness and no earthquakes 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.690
 it is simply the coding that 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.870
 used to make web pages we could 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.240
 the latest version of that encoding 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.889
 makes the musician's performance 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.409

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.219

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.540
 more and more people can access the 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.670
 smartphones and this platform has 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:11.090
 mozilla systems that already has a 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.880
 experience in the world of the web carry 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.800
 to the mobile with many more capabilities with 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.310
 many more virtues than today is 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.310
 known 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:24.900
 How would you comment? 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:26.580
 specifically and what are the 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.960
 attributes what are things 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.569
 additional to do this new 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.340
 platform that we know ourselves today and 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:34.590
 we believe that there is an opportunity to 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.909
 many Mexicans who today have it 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.069
 of 'smartphones' to reach a 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:39.870
 power smartphone by internet 

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:43.129
 be able to have applications but with other 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.129
 with our conceptuality
