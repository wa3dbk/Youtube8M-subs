00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
 5000 red he 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.820
 Nicholas combs plays just 45 5 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.889
 Tomsk region 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.009
 and now attention to the screen 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.009
 be careful 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.539
 Ararat Arakelyan 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.589
 when every day I go work in Omsk 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.119
 Omsk region is my specialty again 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.679
 now the job of a barrier mechanizer 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.210
 the last five years we can not work 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.800
 if this is the first libretto four years 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.390
 I'm married and this cookie and yet I managed 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.700
 see what where when and without playing 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.270
 approach and now attention turn 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.480
 five big book about the famous 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.780
 italian math 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.270
 teacher organizer 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.360
 ask you for an example 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.480
 sequences 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.440
 tending to the golden section in 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.220
 which is still arguing about foreclosure and 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.580
 architecture good luck to you whale attention they 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.580
 organized two things we exist 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.800
 so maybe these are those to whom the quantity 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.430
 there are five professions in battle self control 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.649
 a separate place to even point 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.009
 sell him out there is always here 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.460
 unpleasant if you give them the opportunity 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.979
 project implementation 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.270
 responsibility for left 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.180
 comments 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.000
 certificate of fsfr 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.990
 it is clear that it does not put in 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.180
 particular obligatory 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.480
 security 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.810
 itar tass main purpose 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.859
 so another state 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.369
 the second problem is to do it he resolved 25 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.619
 21 this is suitable at the start of the next 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230
 4 years 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.880
 from 5 8 to 4 13 million 421 8 5 million match ended 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.000
 defeat 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.440
 match start for sure 13 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.620
 experts 612 to 13 20 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.970
 the driver died on the spot must say 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.270
 that he refused the government 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.950
 Komsomol truth 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.520
 portugal government 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.790
 in transmission 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.390
 and for dating is mathematics 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.030
 humpback 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.030
 last year's period our 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.170
 well 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.439
 the fact is that with 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.639
 Nikolai Stepanovich really gave 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.879
 answered us substantially 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.099
 hint 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.699
 he called us a lot 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.999
 true 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.249
 their order may not be exactly the same as 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.549
 order sequence 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:26.959
 development 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.409
 indifferent to the fact that Leonardo Ryazan 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.409
 also known by the name because on what 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.789
 and the number of overtaking 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.229
 the sequence he 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:40.959
 invented 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.700
 very wide application of the method 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.579
 sequence 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.219
 for example rabbit 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.419
 we asked 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.699
 prosecutors returned spoke now 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.930
 for example, Nikolai Ilyichev 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.939
 do you think what 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.189
 I consider the essence of the premier 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.199
 which is essentially a measure of course numbers 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.269
 fibonacci 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.719
 namely he 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.649
 with boar numbers of tea this is related to the percentage 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.249
 I was shocked by this 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.669
 main sequence 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.449
 as I said yushchenko women 1 and 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.519
 again nikolaya combeschikova 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.290
 basic idea for example nicholas 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.400
 Levichev numbers got sweet 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.480
 buns and people I ask 2009 2010 and the number of nikolai 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.459
 combs, he was accepted 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.779
 what he meant did not say anything 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.869
 we know rowers billion dollars 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:34.869
 what 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.019
 clear skull water are born 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.629
 it is gold based 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.959
 section 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.239
 in may 1991, the security of each 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.670
 partial lesions 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.800
 after a year two to desperately find a way out 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.930
 from the position of resignation what to say but it 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.410
 still half the trouble I ask the captain to intervene and 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.260
 would ensure the defeat of the national team 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.380
 for theft 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.890
 it is a dangerous country for the amount of non-recruited 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.300
 so important but it's not so bad 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.770
 the answer to this formula and what each after 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.450
 she knew from the time of Nikolai Levichev that 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.019
 I saw Nikolayevich Tolstoy 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.569
 3 5 8 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.769
 n 4 percent 13 12 11 th class 1 34 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.539
 the truth is still a number 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.520
 of residence 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.520
 and now attention is the right answer 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.519
 p as for the first responders 

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:35.519
 it was the second league in expecting data 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.810
 interest is paid 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.610
 probably us 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.400
 what is surprising to me is that 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.610
 if he 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.389
 I will be good in bulk 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.569
 living in exile in a row on 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.060
 your recent recent kindness has spoken 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.800
 truth can't even count on 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.440
 factories and in relation to pilafs 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.440
 but the leadership 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:01.669
 many 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.819
 and the captain's answer 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.819
 accepted and now the correct answer 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:09.289
 dear children 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.669
 five professions eight jobs in 13 years 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.339
 twenty-one 234 years passed 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.809
 i.e. an example of hourly return 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:21.709
 sequences of specific causes 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:23.759
 aspiring brivio golden section 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.479
 which i'm sure he is nikolai combmen 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.410
 but captain recession 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.629
 failure 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.620
 Now say that as soon as
