00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
morning and in the meantime I had got

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.560 
morning and in the meantime I had got
creative<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:02.440> decided<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:02.860> take<00:01:03.010> no<00:01:03.190> part<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
creative and decided to take no part and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.230 
creative and decided to take no part and
after<00:01:05.280> inspection<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.850> other<00:01:07.000> light

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
after inspection of the other light

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.890 
after inspection of the other light
because<00:01:07.600> there<00:01:07.780> was<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:08.410> off<00:01:09.100> of<00:01:09.310> both<00:01:09.520> lights

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
because there was a I off of both lights

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.070 
because there was a I off of both lights
this<00:01:10.900> was<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.200> piece<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:12.040> was<00:01:12.280> painted<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
this was the piece that was painted the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.800 
this was the piece that was painted the
insert<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.850> that's<00:01:15.850> what<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.210> eye<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.330> glued

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
insert and that's what the eye is glued

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.160 
insert and that's what the eye is glued
to<00:01:17.190> now<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:19.090> problem<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:19.570> I'm<00:01:19.690> thinking<00:01:19.869> of

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
to now the problem that I'm thinking of

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.390 
to now the problem that I'm thinking of
that<00:01:20.320> they<00:01:20.500> had<00:01:20.830> was<00:01:21.300> they<00:01:22.300> weren't<00:01:22.690> properly

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that they had was they weren't properly

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.950 
that they had was they weren't properly
sandblasted<00:01:24.400> before<00:01:24.700> blasting<00:01:25.390> at<00:01:25.509> all<00:01:25.660> it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
sandblasted before blasting at all it

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.760 
sandblasted before blasting at all it
looks<00:01:26.140> like<00:01:26.320> somebody<00:01:26.650> took<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:27.160> very<00:01:28.770> light

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
looks like somebody took a very light

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.680 
looks like somebody took a very light
piece<00:01:30.009> of<00:01:30.190> sandpaper<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.880> barely<00:01:31.300> scratched

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
piece of sandpaper and barely scratched

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.150 
piece of sandpaper and barely scratched
the<00:01:32.759> chrome<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.530> paint<00:01:35.530> does<00:01:35.680> not<00:01:35.860> bound<00:01:36.100> to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
the chrome and paint does not bound to

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.530 
the chrome and paint does not bound to
chrome<00:01:36.399> so<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:36.790> needs<00:01:36.940> to<00:01:37.119> be<00:01:37.210> completely

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
chrome so it needs to be completely

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.940 
chrome so it needs to be completely
sambo<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.229> can<00:01:38.320> see<00:01:38.500> that's<00:01:38.680> still

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
sambo so you can see that's still

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.650 
sambo so you can see that's still
reflecting<00:01:39.490> like<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:40.090> shouldn't<00:01:40.390> reflect

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
reflecting like it shouldn't reflect

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.730 
reflecting like it shouldn't reflect
that<00:01:40.899> all<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:42.070> I<00:01:42.369> don't<00:01:42.759> know<00:01:42.820> how<00:01:42.970> well<00:01:43.180> let's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that all so I don't know how well let's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.980 
that all so I don't know how well let's
see<00:01:44.740> how<00:01:45.869> much<00:01:46.869> does<00:01:47.140> not<00:01:47.640> scratched<00:01:48.640> up<00:01:48.990> but

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
see how much does not scratched up but

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.840 
see how much does not scratched up but
anyways<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.560> lights<00:01:50.740> came<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.280> they<00:01:51.369> fell

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
anyways the lights came and they fell

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.499 
anyways the lights came and they fell
off<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.860> what<00:01:53.979> I'm<00:01:54.039> going<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.190> do<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.550> take

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
off and so what I'm going to do is take

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.090 
off and so what I'm going to do is take
them<00:01:55.660> down<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.810> my<00:01:55.960> shop<00:01:56.229> have<00:01:56.500> my<00:01:56.649> guys<00:01:56.830> sound

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.460 
them down to my shop have my guys sound
blossom<00:01:57.550> and<00:01:58.210> basically<00:01:58.569> repaint<00:01:59.110> them<00:01:59.259> and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
blossom and basically repaint them and

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.719 
blossom and basically repaint them and
put<00:02:00.369> them<00:02:00.399> back<00:02:00.610> together<00:02:00.819> myself<00:02:02.729> basically

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
put them back together myself basically

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.279 
put them back together myself basically
what<00:02:03.819> I<00:02:03.850> was<00:02:04.030> hoping<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.390> avoid<00:02:04.420> doing<00:02:04.929> but<00:02:05.229> it

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
what I was hoping to avoid doing but it

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.900 
what I was hoping to avoid doing but it
looks<00:02:05.470> like<00:02:05.560> in<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.800> long<00:02:05.979> run<00:02:06.009> that's<00:02:06.399> well

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
looks like in the long run that's well

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.869 
looks like in the long run that's well
then<00:02:07.119> look<00:02:07.270> good<00:02:07.450> so
