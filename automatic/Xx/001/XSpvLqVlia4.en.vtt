is my dog chewing on a bone but anyway
back<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> point<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.110> guess<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:47.070> talk<00:00:47.250> about

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
back to the point I guess to talk about

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.030 
back to the point I guess to talk about
my<00:00:48.120> setup<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.229> may<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.409> already<00:00:49.620> seen<00:00:49.890> my

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
my setup as you may have already seen my

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.219 
my setup as you may have already seen my
previous<00:00:50.250> video<00:00:50.790> that's<00:00:51.750> where<00:00:51.960> i'm<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.199> like

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
previous video that's where i'm out like

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.590 
previous video that's where i'm out like
camera<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.879> reason<00:00:54.120> why<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.390> here

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
camera and the reason why it's up here

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.329 
camera and the reason why it's up here
not<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.080> like<00:00:55.470> most<00:00:55.710> guys<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.129> is

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
not down there like most guys do is

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.049 
not down there like most guys do is
because<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> shape<00:00:57.479> of<00:00:57.659> this<00:00:57.780> helmet<00:00:58.170> this

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
because of the shape of this helmet this

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.860 
because of the shape of this helmet this
the<00:01:00.059> sticky<00:01:00.620> surface<00:01:01.620> doesn't<00:01:02.519> sit<00:01:02.940> flush<00:01:03.330> on

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the sticky surface doesn't sit flush on

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.070 
the sticky surface doesn't sit flush on
the<00:01:03.930> side<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.040> leaves<00:01:05.549> gaps<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the side here and leaves gaps so when it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.950 
the side here and leaves gaps so when it
leaves<00:01:07.260> gaps<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.950> doesn't<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> good<00:01:08.960> grab

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
leaves gaps it doesn't have a good grab

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.800 
leaves gaps it doesn't have a good grab
it<00:01:10.799> does<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> hole<00:01:11.220> tight<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.790> I've<00:01:12.570> actually

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it does a hole tight so I've actually

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
it does a hole tight so I've actually
tried<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.320> almost<00:01:13.530> fell<00:01:13.710> off<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> helmet<00:01:14.310> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
tried and almost fell off the helmet so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.670 
tried and almost fell off the helmet so
the<00:01:15.420> only<00:01:15.600> service<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:16.409> sticks

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the only service that really sticks

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.050 
the only service that really sticks
really<00:01:16.860> well<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> top<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
really well is on the top here and I

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
really well is on the top here and I
don't<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.720> trying<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.770> well

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
don't want up there trying out as well

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.520 
don't want up there trying out as well
as<00:01:20.010> possible<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.940> only<00:01:21.060> point

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
as possible and that was the only point

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.170 
as possible and that was the only point
because<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.680> got<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.980> crease<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.000> this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
because it's got this crease on this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
because it's got this crease on this
particular<00:01:24.450> helmet<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> goes<00:01:25.290> across<00:01:25.440> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
particular helmet that goes across that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.030 
particular helmet that goes across that
way<00:01:25.980> and<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.060> goes<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:28.110> very

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
way and as it goes down that here very

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
way and as it goes down that here very
narrow<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:30.210> enough<00:01:30.420> surface<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.050> mount

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
narrow not enough surface and this mount

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.970 
narrow not enough surface and this mount
is<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:31.770> wide<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> pretend<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> actual

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
is very wide so pretend that the actual

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.310 
is very wide so pretend that the actual
case<00:01:35.370> is<00:01:35.550> up<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.820> let's<00:01:36.060> imagine<00:01:36.690> that<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
case is up there let's imagine that the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.990 
case is up there let's imagine that the
case<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.590> sitting<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.280> actually<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> might

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
case is sitting there actually I might

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.970 
case is sitting there actually I might
just<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.420> grab<00:01:39.660> my<00:01:39.930> spare<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> um

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
just go and grab my spare one and um

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.820 
just go and grab my spare one and um
I'll<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.520> back<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.720> trying<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.710> give

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
I'll be back in that and trying to give

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.380 
I'll be back in that and trying to give
you<00:01:43.890> guys<00:01:44.010> more<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.250> realistic<00:01:44.820> approach<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
you guys more a realistic approach of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.130 
you guys more a realistic approach of
what<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.660> looks<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:47.840> ok<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.900> basically

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
what it looks like ok so basically

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.320 
what it looks like ok so basically
that's<00:01:52.140> where<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.640> amounts<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.880> imagine

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
that's where the amounts it's imagine

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.640 
that's where the amounts it's imagine
the<00:01:54.420> camera<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.050> recording<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.530> now

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
the camera that I'm recording with now

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.130 
the camera that I'm recording with now
is<00:01:55.830> inside<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:56.580> yes<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.720> does<00:01:57.870> look<00:01:58.020> like

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is inside here yes it does look like

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
is inside here yes it does look like
it's<00:01:58.320> pointing<00:01:58.710> up<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.550> your<00:01:59.730> helmet

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it's pointing up but when your helmet

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.560 
it's pointing up but when your helmet
tilts<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:02.280> showdown<00:02:02.760> that's<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.480> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
tilts it showdown that's that's just the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.760 
tilts it showdown that's that's just the
way<00:02:03.690> its<00:02:03.810> position<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> moment<00:02:04.530> no

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
way its position at the moment no

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.530 
way its position at the moment no
actually<00:02:05.640> might<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.940> little<00:02:06.090> bit<00:02:06.240> too<00:02:06.390> high

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
actually might be a little bit too high

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.940 
actually might be a little bit too high
yeah<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.080> does<00:02:07.230> look<00:02:07.260> like<00:02:07.470> it's<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> bit<00:02:07.800> higher

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
yeah it does look like it's a bit higher

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.580 
yeah it does look like it's a bit higher
been<00:02:08.220> anyway<00:02:08.489> imagine<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.349> it's

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
been anyway imagine that it's it's it's

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.009 
been anyway imagine that it's it's it's
positioned<00:02:11.069> right<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.670> there<00:02:11.909> so<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.989> is

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
positioned right it's there so this is

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.449 
positioned right it's there so this is
not<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.379> case<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.769> actually<00:02:13.890> use<00:02:14.310> I've

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
not the case that I actually use I've

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.830 
not the case that I actually use I've
got<00:02:14.610> another<00:02:14.819> one<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.239> I've<00:02:15.330> drilled<00:02:15.629> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
got another one that I've drilled and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.500 
got another one that I've drilled and
remove<00:02:16.110> these<00:02:16.260> bits<00:02:16.590> off<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.970> draw<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.269> hole

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
remove these bits off and draw the hole

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.479 
remove these bits off and draw the hole
underneath<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.260> microphone<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.190> sit<00:02:20.400> in

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
underneath so the microphone can sit in

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.190 
underneath so the microphone can sit in
there<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.569> microphone<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.110> I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
there and the microphone that I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.789 
there and the microphone that I
generally<00:02:22.739> use<00:02:25.489> is<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.930> particular<00:02:28.230> one

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.869 

this<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:31.920> what<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.189> is<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.310> that's<00:02:32.609> the<00:02:32.730> part

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
this is what it is and that's the part

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.209 
this is what it is and that's the part
the<00:02:33.209> plug<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.420> huge<00:02:33.780> yes<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.739> was<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.069> wrong

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.219 
the plug is huge yes it was the wrong

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.839 
the plug is huge yes it was the wrong
plug<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.790> touch<00:02:36.689> to<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.739> use<00:02:38.609> it<00:02:38.760> because

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
plug a touch to it but I use it because

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.819 
plug a touch to it but I use it because
I<00:02:39.000> drilled<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.390> big<00:02:39.510> enough<00:02:39.719> hole<00:02:39.870> too<00:02:40.230> for

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
I drilled the big enough hole too for

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.050 
I drilled the big enough hole too for
this<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.099> go<00:02:41.219> in<00:02:41.400> as<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.609> does<00:02:41.760> work<00:02:42.030> really

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
this to go in as it does work really

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.780 
this to go in as it does work really
well<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.620> don't<00:02:44.609> keep<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.000> clip<00:02:45.269> on<00:02:45.420> here

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
well and I don't keep this clip on here

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.819 
well and I don't keep this clip on here
little<00:02:47.790> thing<00:02:48.000> then<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.480> comes<00:02:49.319> off<00:02:49.469> I<00:02:49.620> take

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
little thing then that comes off I take

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.559 
little thing then that comes off I take
that<00:02:49.980> off<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.370> I'll<00:02:51.030> show<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.269> what<00:02:51.480> I

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
that off and I'll show you what I

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.190 
that off and I'll show you what I
basically<00:02:51.780> do<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:53.540> let's<00:02:54.540> imagine<00:02:54.659> this<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:55.139> a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
basically do so let's imagine this as a

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.410 
basically do so let's imagine this as a
whole<00:02:55.439> this<00:02:56.189> plug<00:02:56.519> goes<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.909> there<00:02:57.120> it's

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
whole this plug goes in there it's

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.660 
whole this plug goes in there it's
inside<00:02:57.959> I'm<00:02:58.260> just<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.159> to<00:02:59.189> leave<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.400> over

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
inside I'm just going to leave it over

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.050 
inside I'm just going to leave it over
that<00:02:59.819> way<00:03:00.739> take<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:01.919> out<00:03:02.099> oh<00:03:02.340> I'll<00:03:02.790> show<00:03:02.849> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
that way take that out oh I'll show you

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.909 
that way take that out oh I'll show you
what<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.329> camera<00:03:03.810> there<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.590> microphone

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
what that camera there the microphone

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:11.899 
what that camera there the microphone
actually<00:03:05.159> looks<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.489> um<00:03:07.669> tiny<00:03:08.840> stereo<00:03:10.909> very

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
actually looks like um tiny stereo very

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.920 
actually looks like um tiny stereo very
little<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:14.849> just<00:03:15.030> keep<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:15.510> there<00:03:15.719> to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
little so I just keep this on there to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.740 
little so I just keep this on there to
protect<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.469> phone<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:16.859> noise<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.750> so

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
protect the phone with noise and so

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.270 
protect the phone with noise and so
basically<00:03:19.139> I've<00:03:19.230> feedly<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.889> microphone

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
basically I've feedly the microphone

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.190 
basically I've feedly the microphone
through<00:03:20.489> down<00:03:20.669> here<00:03:23.569> take<00:03:24.569> all<00:03:24.719> the<00:03:24.900> excess

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
through down here take all the excess

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.809 
through down here take all the excess
cable<00:03:25.439> down<00:03:25.799> as<00:03:25.980> well<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:28.549> if<00:03:29.549> you're<00:03:29.700> getting

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
cable down as well and if you're getting

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.280 
cable down as well and if you're getting
a<00:03:30.000> customer<00:03:30.419> made<00:03:30.659> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.959> ask<00:03:31.079> for<00:03:31.200> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
a customer made you can ask for a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.259 
a customer made you can ask for a
shorter<00:03:31.620> one<00:03:31.739> but<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:32.730> never<00:03:32.879> know<00:03:33.000> when<00:03:33.180> you

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
shorter one but you never know when you

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.289 
shorter one but you never know when you
might<00:03:33.389> need<00:03:33.449> it<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.440> what<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.620> do<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:35.099> I<00:03:35.909> roll<00:03:36.150> it

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
might need it so what I do is I roll it

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.409 
might need it so what I do is I roll it
around<00:03:39.290> leave<00:03:40.290> about<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.709> much<00:03:40.919> out<00:03:41.419> and

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
around leave about that much out and

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:49.339 
around leave about that much out and
this<00:03:42.870> much<00:03:43.109> out<00:03:44.269> yeah<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:48.199> feed<00:03:49.199> it<00:03:49.319> through

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
this much out yeah and I feed it through

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.520 
this much out yeah and I feed it through
under<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.829> visor<00:03:50.040> goes<00:03:50.790> underneath<00:03:51.530> through

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
under the visor goes underneath through

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.679 
under the visor goes underneath through
net<00:03:52.739> comes<00:03:53.669> out<00:03:53.939> from<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.979> side<00:03:55.979> inside<00:03:56.879> and

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
net comes out from the side inside and

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:05.179 
net comes out from the side inside and
what<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:59.449> if<00:04:00.449> you<00:04:00.540> can<00:04:00.689> see<00:04:03.949> the<00:04:04.949> cheek

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
what I do is if you can see the cheek

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.020 
what I do is if you can see the cheek
pad<00:04:05.400> there<00:04:05.639> I<00:04:05.879> put<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.250> inside<00:04:08.250> right<00:04:08.909> in

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
pad there I put this inside right in

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.399 
pad there I put this inside right in
between<00:04:09.150> let's<00:04:10.049> add<00:04:10.199> the<00:04:10.349> way<00:04:12.109> may<00:04:13.109> not<00:04:13.290> be

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
between let's add the way may not be

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.619 
between let's add the way may not be
neat<00:04:13.650> right<00:04:13.859> now<00:04:14.040> but<00:04:14.280> that's<00:04:14.939> how<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.090> do<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.299> I

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
neat right now but that's how I do it I

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.680 
neat right now but that's how I do it I
fix<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.430> later<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:20.519> that<00:04:20.699> basically<00:04:20.909> the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
fix it later on and that basically the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.999 
fix it later on and that basically the
microphone<00:04:22.139> where<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.680> sits<00:04:26.900> mm-hm<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.169> can't

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
microphone where it sits mm-hm I can't

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.249 
microphone where it sits mm-hm I can't
really<00:04:29.190> see<00:04:29.310> me<00:04:29.520> too<00:04:29.669> dark<00:04:29.940> in<00:04:30.060> my<00:04:30.150> garage<00:04:30.330> but

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
I put a Velcro down there and that sits

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.969 
I put a Velcro down there and that sits
inside<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.810> velcro<00:04:36.990> no<00:04:37.199> put<00:04:37.469> velcro<00:04:37.680> it

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
inside the velcro no put velcro it

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.490 
inside the velcro no put velcro it
around<00:04:38.659> sticks<00:04:39.659> onto<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.020> front<00:04:40.289> of<00:04:40.349> the
