00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.950
 well we are at the franciacorta racetrack 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.120
 with luca at the catera experience he did not 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.380
 it is paid because this morning it is not 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.269
 changed the shirt because we are 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.749
 I went down he and we are so many then 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.499
 you will see it 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:22.720
 from these cars try to frame it the 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.060
 caterham and luca 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.919
 tell us what machine is then the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.779
 chair but it is an old project and the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.970
 initial project of colin lotus 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.390
 chapman who wanted a car that 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.600
 was very close to a motorcycle and so 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.850
 did and is a 500 kg machine 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.710
 looks like an old car but catera but 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.190
 then took the production of this 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.390
 project and continues to produce 500 kg 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.190
 in this case we are talking about one 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.110
 motorization not too pushed because 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.720
 it's a 1600 but it's very good to do 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.340
 this type of exercises in yards and 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.840
 then we also have the most 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.239
 precious that are the super light and alle 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.030
 300 which are more delicate to use 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.980
 track and the catrame experience is a course 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.770
 that lasts all day you learn to 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.479
 do handling drift not really 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.829
 drift let's say that drift and it works 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.899
 commercially because now it goes a lot 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.939
 fashionable to do for the term, however, we are here 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.409
 we do not teach to make a lot of angle e 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.929
 so much smoke novi learn to do 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.429
 check sideways and with these 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.740
 machines that weigh so little can 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.619
 do everything at very low speeds 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.509
 so lots of safety light machines 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.179
 which also allow us to make gods 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.490
 very good prices because we use little and 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.450
 so it costs us little and we can do 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.310
 very good prices 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.159
 then let 's talk about these prices with the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.259
 can do this experience 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.240
 a complete course where we do also 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.799
 host we offer you the lunch you arrive 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.009
 here the morning of 10 and a half ends 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.500
 around 5 and you spend â‚¬ 325 more 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.880
 vat and you are all day doing 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.380
 transoms 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 I went up I did a few laps is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.179
 it was really fun now 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.840
 we go to the Venetian car we with him 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.369
 for this spiri and on the cutter am a little 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.630
 of water but to do what I had to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.209
 do maybe but even better 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.310
 and the same looked very well which 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.020
 dry but nothing 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.950
 let's do mine 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.629
 fantastic 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.019
 we must also say what we are after 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.030
 to a control that is also fine on 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.069
 wet in the sense we have only a little 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.550
 less grip but therefore it is necessary 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.550
 take into consideration 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.470
 before I can say 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.430
 However 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.910
 those slowcore excuse port I need 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.470
 the pillow like the children behind the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.970
 back 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.420
 but it is more comfortable than with i 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.060
 sides because they write sv and the chair but 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.590
 wide frame because there is also tells 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.890
 citing a few of these are two models 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.020
 basically s3 l sms two 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.790
 the one we say for those who have a little more 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.410
 wide 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.000
 in general so they have all come 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.730
 made this model the broad pp because 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.400
 a mario comfortably small it is good 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.200
 so you have to learn how to shift weight to 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.600
 make the car ring and make pendulum 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.440
 in the first three doors and then a beam 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 long 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.710
 ok you will see that cars slipped immediately 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.990
 so not totally 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.330
 before we go only first then 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.240
 enter the door remove gas from inside 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.190
 steering you gas again the slips dead he died 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:48.300
 soft and fender the other side there 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.300
 we try bye bye bye work 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:13.340
 you do happen so the next 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.340
 hilarious kids 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.850
 they wanted to break it down 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.850
 we get nailed we make them 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:35.449
 my first of NASA the donut 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.190
 so anyway now you have to try to 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.389
 get closer to the visa than keeping the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.900
 through tool can be able to 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.180
 check then go exact 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.100
 and immediately really meanwhile amusing 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.100
 display so go go go go 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.710
 big maximum lumia made very fast 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.410
 fantastic since he sees us ahead for 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.410
 the go go soft opposite 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.300
 worry
