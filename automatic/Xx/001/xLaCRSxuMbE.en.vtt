through<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> nitrogen<00:01:07.950> cycle<00:01:08.720> then<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.930> can

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
through the nitrogen cycle then you can

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.250 
through the nitrogen cycle then you can
add<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> male<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.360> female<00:01:12.390> goldfish
