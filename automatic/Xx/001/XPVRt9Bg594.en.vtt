something<00:02:26.489> new<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.910> table<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.299> 2d

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
something new to the table for 2d

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.270 
something new to the table for 2d
fighting<00:02:27.840> games<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.290> haven't<00:02:28.530> seen<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:29.040> in

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
fighting games I haven't seen this in

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.250 
fighting games I haven't seen this in
other<00:02:29.579> games<00:02:29.910> I'm<00:02:30.239> sure<00:02:30.540> some<00:02:30.780> people<00:02:31.049> think

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
other games I'm sure some people think

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.900 
other games I'm sure some people think
that<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.680> similar<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.160> another<00:02:32.400> series

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
that this is similar to another series

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.580 
that this is similar to another series
that<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.120> unfamiliar<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:33.750> called<00:02:34.109> guilty

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
that I'm unfamiliar with called guilty

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.900 
that I'm unfamiliar with called guilty
gear<00:02:34.799> but<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.160> don't<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.700> there<00:02:35.849> was

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
gear but I don't think there was

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.550 
gear but I don't think there was
anything<00:02:36.180> quite<00:02:36.599> like<00:02:36.629> this<00:02:36.840> with<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> homing

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
anything quite like this with the homing

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.160 
anything quite like this with the homing
system<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:38.010> very<00:02:38.750> interesting<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.870> that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
system it's very interesting is that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.259 
system it's very interesting is that
alone<00:02:40.980> makes<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.370> work<00:02:41.639> for<00:02:41.819> thirty<00:02:42.030> dollar

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
alone makes it work for thirty dollar

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.270 
alone makes it work for thirty dollar
purchase

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.000 

now<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.209> personally<00:02:46.840> feel<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.140> 2d<00:02:47.620> fighters

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
now I personally feel that 2d fighters

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.930 
now I personally feel that 2d fighters
are<00:02:48.220> nowhere<00:02:49.030> near<00:02:50.340> their<00:02:51.340> full<00:02:51.580> potential

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
are nowhere near their full potential

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.780 
are nowhere near their full potential
but<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:53.020> think<00:02:53.590> Arcana<00:02:53.950> hearts<00:02:54.220> homing<00:02:54.580> system

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
but I think Arcana hearts homing system

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.280 
but I think Arcana hearts homing system
and<00:02:55.150> some<00:02:55.360> other<00:02:55.510> elements<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:55.990> this<00:02:56.110> game

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
and some other elements in this game

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.059 
and some other elements in this game
should<00:02:57.040> definitely<00:02:58.560> contribute<00:02:59.560> towards<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
should definitely contribute towards the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.720 
should definitely contribute towards the
ultimate<00:03:00.220> fighter<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.090> will<00:03:01.510> never<00:03:01.989> be<00:03:02.319> made

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
ultimate fighter that will never be made

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.210 
ultimate fighter that will never be made
the<00:03:03.730> graphics<00:03:03.970> are<00:03:04.239> fairly<00:03:04.900> nice<00:03:05.260> but<00:03:05.620> nothing

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
the graphics are fairly nice but nothing

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.300 
the graphics are fairly nice but nothing

it doesn't look too bad I mean all I
focus<00:03:15.400> on<00:03:15.489> really<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.120> technique<00:03:16.600> this

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
focus on really is the technique this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.930 
focus on really is the technique this
