00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
I used on the unearthed record now right

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.250 
I used on the unearthed record now right
here<00:01:58.400> I'm<00:01:59.060> gonna<00:01:59.270> start<00:01:59.510> profiling<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.200> I'm

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
here I'm gonna start profiling it so I'm

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.310 
here I'm gonna start profiling it so I'm
gonna<00:02:00.380> hit<00:02:00.560> next<00:02:01.900> I'm<00:02:02.900> gonna<00:02:03.050> choose

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
gonna hit next I'm gonna choose

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.590 
gonna hit next I'm gonna choose
distorted<00:02:03.980> because<00:02:04.640> it's<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.970> distorted<00:02:05.330> tone

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
distorted because it's a distorted tone

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.880 
distorted because it's a distorted tone
I'm<00:02:05.780> not<00:02:05.930> gonna<00:02:06.080> really<00:02:06.260> mess<00:02:06.470> with<00:02:06.650> any<00:02:06.860> of

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
I'm not gonna really mess with any of

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.680 
I'm not gonna really mess with any of
the<00:02:06.980> settings<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:07.940> I'm<00:02:08.090> gonna<00:02:08.210> hit<00:02:08.390> start

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
the settings and I'm gonna hit start

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.680 
the settings and I'm gonna hit start
profiling<00:02:08.980> when<00:02:09.980> I<00:02:10.010> hit<00:02:10.190> start<00:02:10.400> profiling

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
profiling when I hit start profiling

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.480 
profiling when I hit start profiling
this<00:02:11.690> thing<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.440> gonna<00:02:12.590> make<00:02:12.800> these<00:02:12.980> awesome

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
this thing is gonna make these awesome

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.790 
this thing is gonna make these awesome
noises<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.030> about<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.240> minute<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:21.560> pretty

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
noises for about a minute it's pretty

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.530 
noises for about a minute it's pretty
awesome<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.400> cuz<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:22.850> what<00:02:23.030> it's<00:02:23.150> doing<00:02:23.210> is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
awesome so cuz like what it's doing is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.160 
awesome so cuz like what it's doing is
taking<00:02:23.570> frequencies<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:25.600> whether<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.720> be<00:02:26.810> soft

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
taking frequencies of whether it be soft

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.760 
taking frequencies of whether it be soft
or<00:02:27.440> loud<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.360> capturing<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:30.140> game<00:02:30.410> like

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
or loud and capturing the game like

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.990 
or loud and capturing the game like
everything<00:02:31.130> everything<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> way<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.820> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
everything everything the way that the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.400 
everything everything the way that the
amp<00:02:32.180> plays<00:02:32.710> natural<00:02:33.710> rate<00:02:34.010> at<00:02:34.190> real<00:02:34.430> time<00:02:34.700> and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
amp plays natural rate at real time and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.570 
amp plays natural rate at real time and
investigating<00:02:36.410> per<00:02:36.740> se<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:36.950> would<00:02:37.250> say<00:02:37.400> like

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
investigating per se I would say like

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.280 
investigating per se I would say like
it's<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:38.210> also<00:02:38.330> taking<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.720> screenshot<00:02:39.050> of

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
it's it's also taking a screenshot of

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.440 
it's it's also taking a screenshot of
the<00:02:39.470> room<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.760> environment<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
the room and the environment and

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.390 
the room and the environment and
everything<00:02:41.660> just<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:42.680> basically<00:02:43.220> what's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
everything just just basically what's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.090 
everything just just basically what's
going<00:02:43.550> through<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.850> microphones<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:45.100> this

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
going through the microphones and this

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.270 
going through the microphones and this
will<00:02:46.280> allow<00:02:46.460> you<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.640> play<00:02:46.850> dynamically<00:02:47.600> and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
will allow you to play dynamically and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.590 
will allow you to play dynamically and
everything<00:02:49.280> most<00:02:49.520> most<00:02:49.820> digital<00:02:50.150> lamps<00:02:50.420> won't

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
everything most most digital lamps won't

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.750 
everything most most digital lamps won't
let<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.900> do<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.140> but<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:52.400> why<00:02:52.580> it's<00:02:52.700> this

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
let you do this but it's why it's this

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.910 
let you do this but it's why it's this

and<00:06:50.460> presents

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.500 

but<00:06:58.220> for<00:06:58.370> me<00:06:58.460> I<00:06:58.490> think<00:06:58.610> all<00:06:58.940> this<00:06:59.090> stuff<00:06:59.330> sounds

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
but for me I think all this stuff sounds

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.420 
but for me I think all this stuff sounds
really<00:06:59.840> good<00:06:59.960> at<00:07:00.110> zero<00:07:00.350> maybe<00:07:00.830> just<00:07:01.130> a<00:07:01.190> little

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
really good at zero maybe just a little

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.680 
really good at zero maybe just a little
bit<00:07:01.550> of<00:07:01.639> raising<00:07:01.940> the<00:07:02.000> base<00:07:02.180> maybe<00:07:02.479> some

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
bit of raising the base maybe some

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.629 
bit of raising the base maybe some
treble<00:07:02.870> you<00:07:03.470> can<00:07:03.620> EQ<00:07:03.860> it<00:07:03.979> a<00:07:04.040> lot<00:07:04.220> of<00:07:04.340> times<00:07:04.520> I

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 
treble you can EQ it a lot of times I

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.920 
treble you can EQ it a lot of times I
find<00:07:04.790> that<00:07:04.910> you<00:07:05.030> can<00:07:05.180> even<00:07:05.270> get<00:07:05.419> a<00:07:05.449> better<00:07:05.690> tone

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
find that you can even get a better tone

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.430 
find that you can even get a better tone
