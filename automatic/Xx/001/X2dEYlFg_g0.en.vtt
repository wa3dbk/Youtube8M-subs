00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.709
 a people like are welcome to this 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.539
 new video and good this video is going to 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.519
 try to reproduce your plant 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.049
 carnivorous since I do not know if there 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.219
 past you when you start with 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.140
 this of the hobby of the plants 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.439
 carnivorous then good who in another 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.900
 plant and another plant and another plant and 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.430
 Well I'm going to teach you a method of 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.679
 reproduction that in this case the method 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.970
 so simpler or easier to 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.940
 we execute since we 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.339
 let's provoke this method is called 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.070
 cutting and good is also applicable 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.340
 for other types of plants practically 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.700
 the esqueje explore your plant and how 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.180
 we are going to do then we are going to start a 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.120
 leaf of our plant with a small 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.550
 rhizome horn and we can also a 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.550
 little root chunk if it is that we 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.039
 we can but the most recommended is that 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.350
 have at least a little rhizome 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.869
 one of the things that can also be taken 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.090
 in this video is that what advantages and that 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.240
 disadvantages I have to do the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.880
 cutting 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.829
 the kg allows us to clone our plant 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.560
 carnivorous have an exact copy of 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.210
 our plant can be said but the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.080
 detail is that if for example our 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.869
 plant has some settled to the size of 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.750
 the leaves I do not know about 10 centimeters 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.820
 the one that is going to start sprouting with 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.670
 traps or leaves of a centimeter size 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.009
 At the most it is difficult that our plant 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.869
 will make the plant quite small 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.759
 what we want is going to be quite small 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.159
 another one of the risks that we have is 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.429
 hurt our root plant and if 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.009
 we got to do that because I know 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.649
 well that our root plant gets the same 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.200
 are going to be tinier maybe not from 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.569
 everything or we do not have it but if it goes 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.459
 to diminish a little bit good I here in 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.649
 this video I will show you how it is that 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.479
 I leave a carnivorous plant in this 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.009
 case is going to be a bullsight already good and here 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.920
 As you can see I have a target 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.709
 pretty big I recommend you do 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.709
 the cutting of a large plant 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:12.019
 so that the mouths or the new thing that 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.670
 they are going to remove from the plant because it does not come out 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.560
 so small since it's back to them 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.940
 mention that one is 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.540
 I do not know what 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.300
 the new plant is quite small and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.110
 well I think -ha recommend you is that the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.320
 that is more outward or more towards 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.110
 down as you want to see what 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.810
 is all the sheets if they are fixed this is 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.900
 up this is on top of this one and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.270
 so let's go see is not we could 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.010
 start it since it does not have any 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.990
 work and the safest thing is that here 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.720
 down is the root 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.890
 but well I'm going to complain or I'm going to 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.890
 start this one 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.190
 since good this sheet is already 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.660
 practically dying and then we're going to 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.570
 take advantage of who is dying to 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.580
 to be able to get a new one out of it and how 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.670
 we will do as we will try 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.580
 Take it out carefully with a little bit of 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.410
 root that could also be this one that does not 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.250
 it's not bad 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.260
 and here you have almost the root 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.980
 we are not going to start these two to see which one 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.710
 it comes out because it's pretty hard 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:27.040
 and this is already breaking 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.040
 let's see I hope to see 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:36.480
 and we are going to try to get little by little 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.480
 operating against the earth 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.340
 decision if it came out I hear a little 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.950
 click as you can see is right this 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.280
 will help us so that maybe if 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.870
 yield the script to our sheet they are already 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.690
 pretty battered was already for 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.720
 die we're going to try to get this other 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.770
 It is also good that we are going to see if 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.770
 it comes out again 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.290
 do not believe it a little while ago I tried with 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.090
 several and 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.400
 It is the first time I get over and over and 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.850
 with a little laugh everything is white 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.650
 who see here our target is part of 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.760
 the root and all this we would have to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:27.840
 bury it this way in this way 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.460
 they used the little clamps 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.280
 to teach them how to tell them that 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.340
 we make a small milestone on earth and 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.590
 everything that is white we would find out like this 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.870
 I want 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.760
 we will try to give air to a 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.180
 small white portion I do not know if it 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.240
 catch up to see hope and yes 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.940
 but instead of it being all green 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.090
 here a little white portion something like that 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.860
 and on quite damp ground after 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.990
 a few weeks we are going to start 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.840
 notice that small people 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.160
 protuberances start to come out of there and 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.340
 It is our new plant 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.020
 and good for me has been everything I hope 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.560
 this video has served you well and 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.430
 good if it served you then click on me 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.050
 like to comment and well I have started to see 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.300
 23 people who start commenting 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.640
 videos about something that is starting to come out 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.220
 as black to the plants if they could 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.890
 observe well what is the last one that I 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.260
 cutting began as well as to wither 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.330
 you have that good leave me an image or 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.970
 make a life of response how is 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.770
 your plant for it to be able to give me 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.380
 an idea about what is in itself what 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.500
 they want me to try good I hope they've 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.680
 served and once again I invite you to 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.300
 give him the laica of the video and well 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.860
 they start to follow my social networks 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.500
 since for them I do not upload photos of myself 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.770
 but photos of my plants and well I hope 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.770
 like it
