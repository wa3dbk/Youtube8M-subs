00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:09.960
 Hello, I want to tell you how I once 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:15.000
 sewed flippers to a larger size 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.430
 under the socks nine last summer I bought 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.430
 imagine these flippers mares 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.039
 you are also more than half a year in monastery 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.380
 they at me are lined with little 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.960
 scratched ie combat tequila st and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.989
 So I bought a lot of water under Pyaterochka 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.320
 water water temperature dropped to two three 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.059
 degrees had to buy a suit 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.050
 nine and socks nine so the size 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.030
 legs naturally in sock increased and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:55.559
 I had to embroider the flippers in order not to buy 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:59.430
 new galos what i did i took here 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.300
 such 2 punch one bigger here 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.740
 razmerchikom other smaller marked 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.350
 first marked out where the holes here are alone 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.799
 only and here's another shader princess for 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.200
 lacing for control 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.890
 control i made myself a hole here and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.540
 then later I just cut it 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.119
 in order to continue to galosh not torn 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.860
 smaller punch make here 6 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.710
 holes for lacing itself 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.610
 We put a dose of a wheelbarrow 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.860
 easy enough punch we now 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.850
 nothing vulcanized glue like you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.200
 see no did for snags and 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:52.979
 all sorts of obstacles not clinging not 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.710
 clinging my flippers so it was all in 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.380

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.850

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.649
