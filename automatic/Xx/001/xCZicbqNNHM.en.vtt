setup called old man boxing as this is
easy<00:00:34.370> I<00:00:34.670> didn't<00:00:35.090> do<00:00:35.180> that<00:00:35.590> actually<00:00:36.590> did<00:00:36.949> it

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.020 

looks<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:42.290> bit<00:00:42.410> difficult<00:00:42.710> still<00:00:43.460> doing<00:00:43.940> it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
looks a bit difficult still doing it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.280 
looks a bit difficult still doing it
slowly<00:00:44.150> because<00:00:44.600> it's<00:00:44.720> not<00:00:44.809> supposed<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:45.230> be

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
slowly because it's not supposed to be

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.780 
slowly because it's not supposed to be
done<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.769> would<00:00:45.949> obviously<00:00:46.129> we'll<00:00:46.550> learn

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
done so it would obviously we'll learn

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.450 
done so it would obviously we'll learn
it<00:00:46.940> slowly<00:00:47.180> at<00:00:47.360> first<00:00:47.530> but<00:00:48.530> you'll<00:00:48.710> see<00:00:48.890> if<00:00:49.309> you

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
it slowly at first but you'll see if you

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.930 
it slowly at first but you'll see if you
have<00:00:49.580> to<00:00:49.699> set<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.089> rear<00:00:50.269> foot<00:00:51.760> rather<00:00:52.760> than

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
have to set the rear foot rather than

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.579 
have to set the rear foot rather than
the<00:00:53.030> front<00:00:53.269> one<00:00:53.420> for<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.720> strike<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.290> you're

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
the front one for the strike and you're

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.969 
the front one for the strike and you're
doing<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:54.949> with<00:00:55.640> far<00:00:55.879> Jean<00:00:59.680> so<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:00.739> get

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
doing it with far Jean so you get

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.469 
doing it with far Jean so you get
tremendous<00:01:01.430> power<00:01:01.820> coming<00:01:02.089> out<00:01:02.269> of<00:01:02.299> your

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479

concave<00:03:14.769> am<00:03:15.220> i<00:03:15.310> pulling<00:03:15.549> those<00:03:16.150> little<00:03:17.130> that's

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
concave am i pulling those little that's

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.310 
concave am i pulling those little that's
already<00:03:18.310> got<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.609> do<00:03:18.730> in<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.910> beginning<00:03:19.320> the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
already got to do in the beginning the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.930 
already got to do in the beginning the
main<00:03:20.530> thing<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.859> get<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.160> body<00:03:21.400> movement

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
main thing is to get the body movement

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.220 
main thing is to get the body movement
so<00:03:22.450> that's<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.750> main<00:03:22.959> thing<00:03:22.989> not<00:03:23.709> just<00:03:23.739> like

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
so that's the main thing not just like

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.430 
so that's the main thing not just like
see<00:03:26.230> that's<00:03:26.410> absolutely<00:03:27.040> incorrect<00:03:27.880> it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
see that's absolutely incorrect it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.910 
see that's absolutely incorrect it
that's<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.590> first<00:03:29.829> thing<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.340> then<00:03:31.769> see<00:03:32.769> how

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
that's the first thing and then see how

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.699 
that's the first thing and then see how
just<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:33.459> just<00:03:33.940> slightly<00:03:34.269> past<00:03:34.630> Wally<00:03:35.380> just

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
just you just slightly past Wally just

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.009 
just you just slightly past Wally just
out<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.130> side<00:03:36.370> here<00:03:36.640> slightly<00:03:37.060> I'm<00:03:37.390> not

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
out to the side here slightly I'm not

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.509 
out to the side here slightly I'm not
directly<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.709> front<00:03:38.769> of<00:03:38.950> him<00:03:39.070> so<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> start

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
directly in front of him so you start

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.699 
directly in front of him so you start
out<00:03:39.670> directly<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.150> front<00:03:40.260> your<00:03:41.260> partner<00:03:41.530> puts

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
a little bit of tension in the hands to

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.940 
a little bit of tension in the hands to
indicate<00:03:43.420> someone<00:03:43.630> may<00:03:43.810> be<00:03:43.840> coming<00:03:44.560> like<00:03:44.739> that

indicate someone may be coming like that
too<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:45.640> get<00:03:46.030> up<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.840> see<00:03:47.260> how<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.440> move<00:03:47.620> this

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
too so get up that see how you move this

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.750 
too so get up that see how you move this
body<00:03:47.980> now<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.550> is<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.909> snake<00:03:49.120> pit<00:03:49.269> spur

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
body now and this is the snake pit spur

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.929 
body now and this is the snake pit spur
in<00:03:49.939> a<00:03:50.030> perfect<00:03:50.239> shot<00:03:50.689> for<00:03:51.489> for<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:52.819> you

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
in a perfect shot for for that so you

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.130 
in a perfect shot for for that so you
don't<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.330> move<00:03:53.420> your<00:03:53.569> fingers<00:03:53.900> at<00:03:53.989> all

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
don't have to move your fingers at all

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.080 
don't have to move your fingers at all
remember<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:55.220> rule<00:03:55.459> is<00:03:56.680> if<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:58.760> can<00:03:58.909> simply

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
remember the rule is if you can simply

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.780 
remember the rule is if you can simply
turn<00:03:59.450> your<00:03:59.720> body<00:03:59.930> your<00:04:00.290> waist<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.890> strike

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
turn your body your waist and strike

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.069 
turn your body your waist and strike
something<00:04:02.090> without<00:04:02.360> having<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.810> move<00:04:02.930> your

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
something without having to move your

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.430 
something without having to move your
hand<00:04:03.319> then<00:04:04.159> you're<00:04:04.310> doing<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.610> correctly<00:04:05.440> so

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
hand then you're doing it correctly so

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.030 
hand then you're doing it correctly so
if<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.769> were<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:06.950> go<00:04:07.129> like<00:04:07.310> this<00:04:07.459> for<00:04:07.670> instance

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
if I were to go like this for instance

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.089 
if I were to go like this for instance
and<00:04:10.040> I'll<00:04:10.519> turn<00:04:10.760> my<00:04:10.940> body<00:04:11.090> look<00:04:11.390> I<00:04:11.890> hit<00:04:12.890> him<00:04:12.980> in

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
and I'll turn my body look I hit him in

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.710 
and I'll turn my body look I hit him in
the<00:04:13.129> shoulder<00:04:13.190> which<00:04:13.730> is<00:04:13.819> no<00:04:13.940> good<00:04:14.209> or<00:04:14.390> just
