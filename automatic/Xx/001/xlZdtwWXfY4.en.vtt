00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:28.070
 so clearly no favorites yes my 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.700
 party but favorite on paper thank you 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.210
 to have warned is everything 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.470
 so part when renÃ© tys is gone on 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.420
 so we are on clarkin very work 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.220
 interesting cloud kingdom who loved small 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.360
 baky here is one who has a lot of small 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.890
 nooks so we know it's rather 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.160
 not bad for the protos and that it can 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.170
 to be complicated if nestea does it wrong 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.610
 of really good the army of his 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.080
 adversary that you see it in the middle 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.120
 for example if there is room but good 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.920
 rock there is a small passage will make it a 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.840
 little passage of the six as you watch 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.190
 cuda the camera here another passage so 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.750
 you have to really take between 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.850
 slices it's a bit like a sandwich 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.729
 I can only chopper on cheese 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.860
 down on the meat no so you're careful 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.960
 it's a bit of one or the other what are you 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.180
 choose either you climb the tomato six 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.710
 month you go get the salad that's it 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.360
 and you can not have both passes to 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.860
 the aged atom made a chelous gazpacho and 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.390
 that's not very much it's a Greek and 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.660
 we 're not in the good stuff anymore 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.430
 clear 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.930
 so suddenly the clean that goes scouts 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.729
 and so we'll say that for a first 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.790
 map listening party that can allow him 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.649
 to try dramas herberger stupidly 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.619
 clearly clearly to swing from the 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.320
 fried to send from the season and that's 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.600
 home 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.310
 and yeah I'm hungry actually that's why 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.060
 I think he said he think of food 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.520
 way is so constrained destiny ch'ti 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.850
 who will put his genetic pool to 15 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.860
 and who has a good chance of getting 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.220
 take the special parking anyway 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.140
 we were talking about tomato salad onions 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.690
 the good old 7 gate of the friend parking 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.020
 it's one of the best prototypes of 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.580
 world 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.930
 this is one of the strata it must be said 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.450
 the most farting when she is well 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.400
 executed that exist so if you put 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 the two sets are debating 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.380
 potentially a weapon of destruction 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.660
 mass 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.570
 yeah that's clear part so I was costing 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.140
 the hen on the other hand she is at 14 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.540
 little hen 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.600
 so this is interesting because 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.140
 that you see nestea it does not grow up 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.180
 15 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.910
 so for me it stays a little bit in the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.260
 small fashion watch out to yourself what is 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.269
 sure I have my hands in my pockets but 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.830
 it can leave and he will not have seen it coming 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.780
 so we still see that the nexus 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.820
 first on the parking side so 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.870
 listen martin who will not let us go 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.390
 to say that he does not let himself be dragged by 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.769
 there by fear and who knows very well 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.510
 that he could at worst get stuck doing 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.810
 a small gateway the place of the body 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.330
 so we'll see but after I imagine that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.799
 still invested there he wants to go 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.970
 scratch maybe he wants to penalize 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.319
 and maybe that's it too 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.840
 1LE 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.670
 the solution to the seven gates and maybe 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.310
 to prevent him from arriving as gates 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.379
 robot all that means to send from 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.269
 zerglings before a lot of zerglings of 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.950
 strength and sees the production of zealot 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.319
 position of what you want to try to 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.989
 pick up boon pros is there then there he 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.909
 there is a mistral there is there I feel 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.530
 landes is afraid of a mail to 4.1 euros in 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.359
 the soul she must and they are first 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.709
 left right actually at the beginning so 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.000
 I really feel like he wanted 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.139
 scouts and that there is no proof 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.060
 which had remained stained 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.099
 and yet with his overlord he has this 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.560
 side 1 it was that it was nexus 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.180
 first so it's funny that he is 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.290
 stressed at his level anyway 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.599
 it proves that the styles 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.159
 adding really very here is very safe 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.560
 reached he continuing the 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:36.040
 prod2 gling dude that's pretty strange 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.060
 he is cash in fact that's why he 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.620
 scooted it on the top right 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.219
 he is stalled the cages he poses anyway 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.060
 three big hungers launched a huge 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.409
 buzz 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.870
 yeah no gas jack 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.900
 the moment it's the b3 it's not going 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.849
 harvested on this island and pantone it 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.680
 remains on a single base these tags and it 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.849
 There he has the vision with the overlord 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.500
 can we show the vision there if you 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.729
 you are like zerg and what to see 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.060
 lamballe they see that it is that it is 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.269
 open 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.430
 these plates know if he will go there I 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.379
 want to 26.1 mixing the five speedway 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:19.329
 minutes we did not have no see 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:22.060
 for the moment at these diseases at the same time the 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.150
 bladder only between the antenna that has been placed 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.409
 and for the moment it leaves us the 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.400
 time that will fall the photo that goes 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:37.120
 to fall here we have a lot of his friends 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:39.430
 all sauces feeding 18 jarry 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:46.509
 non-production the favorite bo on 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:49.750
 hockey so the fact that air had us 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:53.199
 dined show style is indeed veil the 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.389
 head elsewhere who had great 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.130
 played like what but that's the paw 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.699
 big what's that bait of 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.699
 waste
