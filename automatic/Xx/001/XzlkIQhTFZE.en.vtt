00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:07.241
Hello everyone. 

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:12.748
I decided to look at my old vlogs (clips) at youtube.

00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:19.156
I picked one clip called “ASL: Deaf People Like What?”

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:24.358
That was in February 2007. 

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:33.734
There are over 400 comments at youtube and over 
 120,000 people to view this clip. 

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.802
Interesting!

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.869
The reason I decided to look at old clip is 

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:46.788
because one minor part caused people angry at me or against me. 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.150
This clip was original,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.311
however, I had to make another vlog to clarify my mistake. 

00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:57.794
I made public apologize for made a bad comment.

00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:02.663
I want to polish up and make another clarifying message.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:09.822
In 2007, I mean in 2006, I made first vlog/clip,

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:11.192
since then I made many vlogs. 

00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:13.421
However, in beginning of vlogs, I made some mistake and 
 learned how to express message in vlog. 

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:22.477
When I first started vlog, I was so excited like a 
 little boy is looking forward to having Christmas gifts.

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:28.793
My previous vlog “Knowledge is Power,”

00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:36.177
I did not do “homework” with this clip 
 such as not reading enough info. 

00:01:36.177 --> 00:01:43.330
But now since 2007, I studied, learned and experienced from 
 different books to make this clip more clear.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.410
I decided to look at my old vlog 
 and it made me really laugh 

00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:54.750
because it is so old, two years ago and message is inaccurate information.

00:01:54.753 --> 00:02:00.050
I want to make summarize points what I will say in this clip.

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:16.770
Hearing people, not all but some/around 70-80%, viewed Deaf people as low class.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.200
Their views Deaf people are like a category of

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:26.870
Jazz musicians (they view Jazz as low class),

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:29.930
prostitutes,

00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:40.940
gamblers,

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:45.630
and bums.

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:55.200
These are very low class in eyes of hearing people.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:59.930
I studied and learned the reason why hearing people’s views are.

00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:04.680
It is because of hearing anything.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:09.450
Able to hear anything is the best thing such as 

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:33.670
able to hear music, water fall, sirens, telephone ring, bird 
 singing, and noise of vary animals, and etc. 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.030
When hearing people look at Deaf people and find 
 that they can’t hear at all, 

00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:45.980
it is really awful for them to know 
 because to hear anything is very important.

00:03:45.977 --> 00:03:52.040
Meaning, Deaf people can be function in hearing world 
 due to not able to hear. 

00:03:52.826 --> 00:03:58.070
In their view of people who can’t hear are very low class or function.

00:03:58.074 --> 00:04:09.590
Some people believe Deaf people are sinned, evil and bad people.

00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:12.520
It is what hearing people believe. 

00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:34.230
It is reason why I was angry and made old vlog when 
 Carl Scheodar’s (he couldn’t spell out his last name) vlog. 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.420
It is very true that hearing people view Deaf people

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:50.580
as very low class and not function in hearing 
 world because they can’t hear at all.

00:04:50.575 --> 00:04:54.430
With technology, many Deaf babies/children got cochlear implanted 

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:57.240
because they wanted to fix their deafness and able to hear.

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:59.770
With cochlear implanted and hearing aids,

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:10.610
they are almost equal with hearing people that they 
 are able to be function in hearing world.

00:05:10.613 --> 00:05:13.960
In hearing people’s view if you don’t have cochlear implanted or hearing aids, 

00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:17.880
you are not functioning in hearing world.

00:05:18.508 --> 00:05:20.500
Interesting, huh? 

00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:23.620
How do I know? 

00:05:23.617 --> 00:05:27.330
I have several books, however, one book is best information.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.200
This is a very good book. 

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:45.440
The author, Harlan Lane, is hearing and wrote this book by hearing from people,

00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:47.120
seeing what Deaf people had been through and then wrote this book.

00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:48.370
It is a very interesting book! 

00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:54.170
It is conclusion note. 

00:05:55.722 --> 00:06:06.570
I mentioned in my old vlog about truckers.

00:06:06.573 --> 00:06:07.920
I have respect for them. 

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.440
No, they are not low class.

00:06:12.843 --> 00:06:23.150
In my old vlog, I mentioned that truckers are 
 in low class category like prostitutes, gamblers, etc.

00:06:23.152 --> 00:06:26.590
However, I am deadly wrong! 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:28.560
I mean I am wrong! 

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:38.530
I high respect the truckers because they carry our food, furniture and other things.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:44.050
In fact is that we have a Deaf trucker at DeafVideo.TV. 

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:48.790
I enjoyed watching his some vlogs at DVTV. 

00:06:48.787 --> 00:06:50.740
I always wanted to drive 18-wheel truck.

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:54.960
Good day!

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:56.360
So long!
