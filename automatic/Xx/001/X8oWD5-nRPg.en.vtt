anyways um one neat feature of the
windows<00:00:44.710> seven<00:00:45.039> is<00:00:45.280> if<00:00:45.850> we<00:00:46.089> open<00:00:46.359> this<00:00:46.719> up<00:00:47.489> we

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
windows seven is if we open this up we

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.860 
windows seven is if we open this up we
drag<00:00:48.760> this<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.569> either<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.440> right

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
drag this to either the right

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.160 
drag this to either the right
the<00:00:52.469> left<00:00:53.719> on<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> top<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.969> our<00:00:56.969> screen

the left on are at the top of our screen

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
the left on are at the top of our screen
it<00:00:58.170> will<00:00:58.320> mini-map<00:00:58.769> not<00:00:59.309> minimize<00:00:59.640> maximize

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it will mini-map not minimize maximize

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.350 
it will mini-map not minimize maximize
it<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.660> maximize<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.860> side<00:01:02.030> if<00:01:03.030> we

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
it or maximize it to one side if we

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.249 
it or maximize it to one side if we
could<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.660> again<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.759> this

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
could do it again and you can see this

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.070 
could do it again and you can see this
glass<00:01:07.259> effect<00:01:07.470> again<00:01:07.979> around<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> edge<00:01:09.149> so

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
glass effect again around the edge so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.930 
glass effect again around the edge so
that<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> feature<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:13.490> Windows<00:01:14.490> 7
