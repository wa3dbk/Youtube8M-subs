squid jigs or EG jigs as they're known
in<00:00:11.470> japan<00:00:12.010> and<00:00:12.220> there<00:00:12.880> are<00:00:12.970> a<00:00:13.000> few<00:00:13.150> factors

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
in japan and there are a few factors

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.330 
in japan and there are a few factors
that<00:00:13.720> make<00:00:13.960> a<00:00:13.990> good<00:00:14.260> quality<00:00:14.620> squid<00:00:14.980> jig<00:00:15.160> and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
that make a good quality squid jig and

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.509 
that make a good quality squid jig and
first<00:00:16.000> and<00:00:16.209> foremost<00:00:16.630> is<00:00:16.869> the<00:00:17.529> prongs<00:00:18.130> on<00:00:18.369> the

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:18.519 
first and foremost is the prongs on the

first and foremost is the prongs on the
jig<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:19.359> black<00:00:19.749> magic<00:00:19.900> ones<00:00:20.199> are<00:00:20.439> black<00:00:20.679> and

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
jig the black magic ones are black and

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.620 
jig the black magic ones are black and
they're<00:00:21.429> incredibly<00:00:21.820> sharp<00:00:22.119> because<00:00:22.449> when<00:00:22.599> a

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
they're incredibly sharp because when a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.120 
they're incredibly sharp because when a
squid<00:00:22.929> comes<00:00:23.169> along<00:00:23.380> on<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.560> tacks<00:00:23.800> your<00:00:23.949> lure

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
squid comes along on the tacks your lure

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.029 
squid comes along on the tacks your lure
you<00:00:24.730> my<00:00:25.689> newest<00:00:26.079> touch<00:00:26.259> of<00:00:26.409> a<00:00:26.470> tentacle<00:00:26.890> and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
you my newest touch of a tentacle and

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.319 
you my newest touch of a tentacle and
you<00:00:27.130> will<00:00:27.279> hook<00:00:27.460> it<00:00:27.609> they<00:00:27.789> are<00:00:27.849> very<00:00:27.939> very

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
you will hook it they are very very

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.290 
you will hook it they are very very
sharp<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.710> end<00:00:29.890> cap<00:00:30.130> has<00:00:30.369> a<00:00:30.400> bit<00:00:30.669> of<00:00:30.699> LUMO<00:00:31.150> on

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
sharp the end cap has a bit of LUMO on

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.729 
sharp the end cap has a bit of LUMO on
it<00:00:31.449> which<00:00:31.869> I<00:00:31.989> think<00:00:32.169> gives<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.470> squid<00:00:32.710> a

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
it which I think gives the squid a

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.500 
it which I think gives the squid a
target<00:00:33.190> point<00:00:33.310> to<00:00:33.489> aim<00:00:33.670> for<00:00:33.700> so<00:00:34.360> that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
target point to aim for so that

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.020 
target point to aim for so that
increases<00:00:34.840> your<00:00:34.990> hookup<00:00:35.380> rate<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:36.940> the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
increases your hookup rate one of the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.700 
increases your hookup rate one of the
most<00:00:37.300> critical<00:00:37.720> factors<00:00:37.750> with<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.320> squid<00:00:38.530> jig

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
most critical factors with the squid jig

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.310 
most critical factors with the squid jig
is<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:39.010> keel<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.450> black<00:00:40.780> magic<00:00:40.990> ones

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
is the keel now the black magic ones

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.680 
is the keel now the black magic ones
have<00:00:41.920> kills<00:00:42.370> they<00:00:42.910> have<00:00:43.060> a<00:00:43.090> different<00:00:43.420> sink

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
have kills they have a different sink

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.930 
have kills they have a different sink
rate<00:00:43.900> for<00:00:44.560> each<00:00:44.710> weight<00:00:44.950> of<00:00:45.130> lure<00:00:45.340> so<00:00:45.820> that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
rate for each weight of lure so that

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.310 
rate for each weight of lure so that
which<00:00:46.120> means<00:00:46.360> they<00:00:46.510> sink<00:00:46.750> at<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:47.020> different

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
which means they sink at a different

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.990 
which means they sink at a different
speed<00:00:47.650> depending<00:00:48.310> on<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.520> depth<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:48.910> the

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
speed depending on the depth and the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.610 
speed depending on the depth and the
current<00:00:49.360> which<00:00:49.750> is<00:00:49.900> very<00:00:50.080> good<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:50.500> can

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
current which is very good so you can

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.810 
current which is very good so you can
actually<00:00:50.830> control<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.430> depth<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:51.730> you're

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
actually control the depth that you're

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.280 
actually control the depth that you're
fishing<00:00:52.150> it<00:00:52.270> to<00:00:52.600> make<00:00:52.750> sure<00:00:52.930> that<00:00:53.140> you're

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
fishing it to make sure that you're

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.080 
fishing it to make sure that you're
hovering<00:00:53.620> your<00:00:53.770> lure<00:00:53.920> over<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.310> weed<00:00:54.490> the

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
hovering your lure over the weed the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.370 
hovering your lure over the weed the
other<00:00:55.240> factor<00:00:55.570> is<00:00:55.600> if<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:55.870> let<00:00:56.020> them<00:00:56.110> rest

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
other factor is if you let them rest

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.290 
other factor is if you let them rest
they<00:00:56.920> will<00:00:57.070> actually<00:00:57.220> sit<00:00:57.580> like<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:57.790> on<00:00:58.180> the

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
they will actually sit like this on the

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.180 
they will actually sit like this on the
bottom<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:59.110> can<00:00:59.140> jerk<00:00:59.470> them<00:00:59.650> and<00:00:59.800> get

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
bottom and you can jerk them and get

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.380 
bottom and you can jerk them and get
some<00:01:00.340> action<00:01:00.579> out<00:01:00.730> of<00:01:00.820> your<00:01:00.970> lure<00:01:01.090> without

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
some action out of your lure without

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.569 
some action out of your lure without
snagging<00:01:01.720> up<00:01:02.020> so<00:01:02.470> good<00:01:02.740> keel<00:01:02.980> is<00:01:03.130> essential

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
snagging up so good keel is essential

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.039 
snagging up so good keel is essential
the<00:01:03.910> other<00:01:04.030> thing<00:01:04.239> is<00:01:04.360> these<00:01:04.449> little<00:01:04.629> feathers

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
the other thing is these little feathers

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.710 
the other thing is these little feathers
as<00:01:05.259> well<00:01:05.920> as<00:01:06.040> Xing<00:01:06.430> has<00:01:06.610> added<00:01:07.180> attractant

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
as well as Xing has added attractant

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.870 
as well as Xing has added attractant
they<00:01:08.170> give<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.590> lure<00:01:08.800> stability<00:01:09.550> so<00:01:09.760> they

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
they give the lure stability so they

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.420 
they give the lure stability so they
don't<00:01:10.060> fall<00:01:10.300> to<00:01:10.510> one<00:01:10.630> side<00:01:10.990> they<00:01:11.590> come<00:01:11.830> in<00:01:12.010> five

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
don't fall to one side they come in five

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.480 
don't fall to one side they come in five
sizes<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.510> different<00:01:14.350> colors<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.860> suit<00:01:15.070> every

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
sizes and different colors to suit every

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.790 
sizes and different colors to suit every
sort<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.760> condition<00:01:16.210> because<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.110> some<00:01:17.440> areas

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
sort of condition because in some areas

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.530 
sort of condition because in some areas
you<00:01:17.830> have<00:01:17.979> stronger<00:01:18.490> current<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.270> want

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
you have stronger current so you want

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.200 
you have stronger current so you want
your<00:01:19.659> jig<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.229> sink<00:01:20.620> at<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.430> right<00:01:21.640> rate<00:01:21.940> and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
your jig to sink at the right rate and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.450 
your jig to sink at the right rate and
not<00:01:22.870> snag<00:01:23.170> up<00:01:23.350> all<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.650> time<00:01:23.860> otherwise<00:01:24.400> you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
not snag up all the time otherwise you

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.310 
not snag up all the time otherwise you
just<00:01:24.580> won't<00:01:24.880> catch<00:01:25.150> any<00:01:25.330> squid<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:26.170> other

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
just won't catch any squid the other

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.649 
just won't catch any squid the other
thing<00:01:26.590> is<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.310> light<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.850> need<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.450> have<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
thing is the light you need to have the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.030 
thing is the light you need to have the
right<00:01:28.870> colors<00:01:29.200> for<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.470> different<00:01:29.740> sorts<00:01:29.979> of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
right colors for the different sorts of

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.969 
right colors for the different sorts of
light<00:01:30.220> bright<00:01:30.520> days<00:01:30.790> dark<00:01:31.210> days<00:01:31.950> obviously<00:01:32.950> a

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
lot of squid fishing is done in clear

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.789 
lot of squid fishing is done in clear
water<00:01:34.420> over<00:01:34.840> weed<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.290> some<00:01:35.620> of<00:01:35.740> the

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
water over weed and some of the

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.310 

let's<00:01:54.310> talk<00:01:54.490> about<00:01:54.610> six<00:01:55.000> all<00:01:55.540> squared<00:01:55.900> of<00:01:56.020> born

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
let's talk about six all squared of born

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.200 
let's talk about six all squared of born
female<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.040> right<00:01:57.400> yeah<00:01:57.909> basically

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
female is that right yeah basically

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.859 
female is that right yeah basically
those<00:01:58.750> spread<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.729> names<00:02:00.970> they<00:02:01.210> call<00:02:01.240> it's<00:02:01.600> a

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
those spread the names they call it's a

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.399 
those spread the names they call it's a
board<00:02:02.560> female<00:02:03.040> squid<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:03.880> literally<00:02:04.750> they

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
board female squid so literally they

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.859 
board female squid so literally they
come<00:02:05.619> in<00:02:05.770> they<00:02:05.920> are<00:02:05.950> female<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.610> they<00:02:07.600> come

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
come in they are female and they come

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.790 
come in they are female and they come
and<00:02:08.050> sha<00:02:08.289> HT<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:09.220> spawn<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:10.560> once<00:02:11.560> they

and sha HT to spawn and once they

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.400 
and sha HT to spawn and once they

a couple of few of them in a group of my
turn<00:02:17.680> into<00:02:17.980> Mouse<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.550> then<00:02:19.330> they<00:02:19.569> they<00:02:20.080> start

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
turn into Mouse and then they they start

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.729 
turn into Mouse and then they they start
you<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:20.890> mating<00:02:21.730> together<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:23.110> yet<00:02:23.380> when

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
you know mating together but yet when

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.680 
you know mating together but yet when
they<00:02:23.830> come<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.670> apparently<00:02:25.209> they're<00:02:25.570> on

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
they come in they apparently they're on

they come in they apparently they're on
our<00:02:25.870> females<00:02:26.769> here<00:02:29.400> now<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.459> basic<00:02:30.910> principle

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
our females here now the basic principle

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.780 
our females here now the basic principle
for<00:02:31.450> fishing<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.989> squid<00:02:32.200> jig<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:33.250> cast<00:02:33.550> it

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
for fishing a squid jig is you cast it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.300 
for fishing a squid jig is you cast it
out<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.780> let<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.050> sink<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.590> then<00:02:36.190> you

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
out and you let it sink and then you

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.400 
out and you let it sink and then you
give<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.550> some<00:02:36.910> rapid<00:02:37.239> jerks<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.840> then<00:02:38.260> you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
give it some rapid jerks and then you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.320 
give it some rapid jerks and then you
slowly<00:02:38.800> retrieve<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.550> or<00:02:39.670> even<00:02:39.819> just<00:02:40.090> draw

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
slowly retrieve it in or even just draw

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.900 
slowly retrieve it in or even just draw
it<00:02:40.390> in<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.989> squid<00:02:41.230> attack<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.680> but<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
it in and the squid attack it but the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.910 
it in and the squid attack it but the
big<00:02:43.060> question<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.600> said<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.870> Tony<00:02:44.080> should

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
big question as I said to Tony should

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
big question as I said to Tony should
you<00:02:45.670> strike<00:02:46.000> with<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.330> squid<00:02:46.600> jig<00:02:47.459> not<00:02:48.459> is<00:02:48.700> that

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
you strike with a squid jig not is that

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.940 
you strike with a squid jig not is that
aggressive<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.569> grow<00:02:49.720> honestly<00:02:50.140> basically

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
aggressive to grow honestly basically

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.180 
aggressive to grow honestly basically
and<00:02:51.310> was<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.300> desire<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.810> squid<00:02:53.140> jigs<00:02:53.380> and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
and was the desire of the squid jigs and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.340 
and was the desire of the squid jigs and
the<00:02:54.310> way<00:02:54.459> squid<00:02:54.940> takes<00:02:55.209> your<00:02:55.510> squid<00:02:55.900> jigs<00:02:56.110> all

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
the way squid takes your squid jigs all

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.770 
the way squid takes your squid jigs all
you<00:02:56.620> need<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.980> do<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.760> nice<00:02:58.000> easy<00:02:58.329> lift

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
you need to do is just a nice easy lift

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.770 
you need to do is just a nice easy lift
on<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.140> tip<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.500> they<00:02:59.980> should<00:03:00.220> be<00:03:00.370> hooked<00:03:00.780> if

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
on the tip and they should be hooked if

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.050 
on the tip and they should be hooked if
you<00:03:01.989> do<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> too<00:03:02.410> aggressive<00:03:02.860> strike<00:03:03.610> you

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you do a too aggressive strike you

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.789 
you do a too aggressive strike you
normally<00:03:04.390> find<00:03:04.660> out<00:03:04.840> there<00:03:05.049> some<00:03:05.260> tentacles

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
normally find out there some tentacles

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.250 
normally find out there some tentacles
left<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.310> your<00:03:06.519> squid<00:03:06.790> jig<00:03:06.970> hook<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.420> but

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
left on your squid jig hook and but

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.420 
left on your squid jig hook and but
you're<00:03:08.380> not<00:03:08.530> attached<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.950> way<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.130> whole

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
you're not attached the way this whole

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.860 
you're not attached the way this whole
squid

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
squid

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.120 
squid
so<00:03:10.870> basically<00:03:11.230> when<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.470> touch<00:03:11.739> your<00:03:11.890> squid

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
so basically when you touch your squid

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.890 
so basically when you touch your squid
Jack's<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.640> good<00:03:12.820> squid<00:03:13.269> jig<00:03:13.420> should<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.750> go

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
Jack's a good squid jig should it go

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.350 
Jack's a good squid jig should it go
give<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.410> very<00:03:15.130> nice<00:03:15.450> zigzag<00:03:16.450> action<00:03:16.870> like

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
give you a very nice zigzag action like

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.870 
give you a very nice zigzag action like
and<00:03:19.560> then<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.829> repeat<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.280> again<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.760> will

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
and then if you repeat it again it will

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.380 
and then if you repeat it again it will
do<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.150> same<00:03:22.299> thing<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.730> that's<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.180> only

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
do the same thing so that's a that only

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.740 
do the same thing so that's a that only
comes<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:25.870> winter<00:03:26.350> reasonably<00:03:27.310> quality<00:03:27.750> squid

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
comes in winter reasonably quality squid

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.240 
comes in winter reasonably quality squid
jigs<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.200> gives<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.500> really<00:03:29.680> good<00:03:29.859> action

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
jigs it gives you a really good action

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.520 
jigs it gives you a really good action
that's<00:03:30.640> very<00:03:30.940> important<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.840> attract<00:03:32.200> it's

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
that's very important to attract it's

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.699 
that's very important to attract it's
good<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:33.519> come<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.970> bite<00:03:34.180> your<00:03:34.359> jig<00:03:34.560> after<00:03:35.560> the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
good to come to bite your jig after the

hook up a squid

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.059 
hook up a squid
if<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.420> yank<00:04:04.659> it<00:04:04.750> too<00:04:04.959> hard<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.409> might<00:04:05.860> pull

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
if you yank it too hard and might pull

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.470 
if you yank it too hard and might pull
out<00:04:06.099> or<00:04:06.459> break<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.849> tentacle

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
out or break the tentacle

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.240 
out or break the tentacle
so<00:04:08.480> tell<00:04:08.750> me<00:04:08.840> about<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.140> lifecycle<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.920> squid

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
so tell me about the lifecycle of squid

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.790 
so tell me about the lifecycle of squid
basically<00:04:11.060> they<00:04:11.330> hang<00:04:11.599> around<00:04:11.750> our<00:04:12.170> Shore<00:04:12.500> and

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
basically they hang around our Shore and

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.520 
basically they hang around our Shore and
on<00:04:13.519> East<00:04:14.209> Coast<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:14.810> far<00:04:15.019> as<00:04:15.110> far<00:04:15.170> as<00:04:15.440> I

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
on East Coast so far as far as I

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.930 
on East Coast so far as far as I
discover<00:04:16.959> all<00:04:17.959> year-round<00:04:18.320> but<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.579> reason

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
discover all year-round but the reason

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.460 
discover all year-round but the reason
we've<00:04:20.090> been<00:04:20.120> catching<00:04:20.449> them<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.989> because

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
we've been catching them is because

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.879 
we've been catching them is because
they're<00:04:22.190> big<00:04:22.370> enough<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.790> be<00:04:23.240> caught<00:04:23.449> and<00:04:23.889> they

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
they're big enough to be caught and they

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.070 
they're big enough to be caught and they
they<00:04:25.250> start<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.760> get<00:04:25.850> into<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.210> hen<00:04:26.810> size

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
they start to get into a hen size

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.460 
they start to get into a hen size
they're<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.680> big<00:04:28.190> around<00:04:28.729> May<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.990> June<00:04:30.290> I

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
they're this big around May in June I

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.890 
they're this big around May in June I
mentioned<00:04:30.949> previously<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.729> so<00:04:32.570> these<00:04:32.720> the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
mentioned previously and so these the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.080 
mentioned previously and so these the
