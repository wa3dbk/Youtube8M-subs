00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
disappointing and the end of this story

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.650 
disappointing and the end of this story
is<00:02:42.020> not<00:02:42.410> worth<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:43.070> you've<00:02:43.820> slogged<00:02:44.540> through

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
is not worth it you've slogged through

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.630 
is not worth it you've slogged through
all<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.200> game<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.740> you<00:02:45.770> think<00:02:46.430> that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
all of the game and you think that

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.890 
all of the game and you think that
you're<00:02:46.790> actually<00:02:46.940> going<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.420> see<00:02:47.600> something

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
you're actually going to see something

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.530 
you're actually going to see something
spectacular<00:02:48.710> at<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.890> end<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.970> looks<00:02:50.360> like

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
spectacular at the end and it looks like

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.940 
spectacular at the end and it looks like
the<00:02:50.690> setup<00:02:50.840> for<00:02:51.170> another<00:02:51.440> mission<00:02:51.770> then<00:02:51.890> it

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
the setup for another mission then it

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.620 
the setup for another mission then it
just<00:02:52.100> cuts<00:02:52.370> off<00:02:52.640> which<00:02:52.910> is<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.090> great

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
just cuts off which is a great

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.590 
just cuts off which is a great
disappointment<00:02:54.220> but<00:02:55.220> for<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.060> game<00:02:56.300> that<00:02:56.330> you

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
disappointment but for a game that you

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.170 
disappointment but for a game that you
either<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.900> rent<00:02:57.230> at<00:02:57.470> least<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.550> will<00:02:58.880> get

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
either to rent at least you will get

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.000 
either to rent at least you will get
some<00:02:59.570> play<00:02:59.780> time<00:02:59.810> out<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.560> you'll<00:03:00.890> get

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
some play time out of it and you'll get

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.550 
some play time out of it and you'll get
some<00:03:01.190> trophies<00:03:01.610> from<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.910> which<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.210> nice<00:03:02.560> but

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
some trophies from it which is nice but

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.620 
some trophies from it which is nice but
when<00:03:03.770> all<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.130> said<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.400> done<00:03:04.580> it's<00:03:05.120> not

when all is said and done it's not

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.780 
when all is said and done it's not
really<00:03:06.140> worth<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.560> purchase<00:03:06.740> for<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.550> single

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790
