season<00:01:33.900> long<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.610> top<00:01:35.790> shoots<00:01:36.060> pretty

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
season long and the top shoots pretty

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.550 
season long and the top shoots pretty
unique<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.659> well<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> metal<00:01:37.259> flake

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
unique as well it has a metal flake

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.730 
unique as well it has a metal flake
finish<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.100> kind<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.670> shines<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:40.619> it's

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
finish to it kind of shines but it's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.510 
finish to it kind of shines but it's
made<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> bio<00:01:41.400> plastic<00:01:42.119> beads<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.869> basalt
