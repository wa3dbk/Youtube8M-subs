00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.980
 Y 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.500
 there were people here in a new video and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.520
 today I bring you the farm of villagers very 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.710
 well let's start 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.630
 these are the materials that we are going to 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.700
 need I do not think we need many 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.710
 more, but we're going to pick them up 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.050
 the march the first thing we need is 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.059
 a three-by-seven platform of 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:36.379
 long is three wide and seven 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.590
 long is very good here in this block 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.220
 and in this block is where the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.850
 sauce or soul sand very well now 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.420
 we have to make a small wall at 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.420
 long of her 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.039
 for we make a small wall at 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.039
 long of her 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.660
 perfect what is the secret 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.880
 this here I usually put it 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.240
 crystal more than anything to see them 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.240
 like 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.440
 OK 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.410
 now here's where it's going to be 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.700
 where our people are going to be locked 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.980
 villagers here and therefore this block and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.260
 this I believe that here they will be removed when 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.290
 there are enough villagers here to 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.130
 reproduce 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.630
 with two floor and leave it there 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.370
 about fifteen at least here inside 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.770
 to make it more efficient 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.300
 farm is worth so therefore here 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.020
 I'm going to put them to use to remember us 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.020
 to remove it 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.120
 this is all covered now and here 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.300
 we can put 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.530
 and 2 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.440
 and we close 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.300
 very well this so that later you do not know 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.860
 come out the small villagers 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.570
 to be able to remove the block without 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.110
 need to break the block there 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.350
 here we put a slam and others the way 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.390
 from here 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.330
 to break or put back what 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 we want to be worth 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.930
 okay now just above the resolution 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.930
 that is, here we put a poster and here another 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.660
 here a poster and here another very well 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.410
 Now this will have to go up 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.410
 another little more 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.860
 and this wall therefore also the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.460
 we have to climb very well 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.740
 now here how do we make the water 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.410
 is out on this side I'm going to 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.000
 take out by the side 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.660
 but you can take it wherever you want 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.270
 ok I'm here I'm going to upload another one 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.210
 so that the villagers the system is 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.610
 out there jumping 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.390
 it's not temporary jumping and giving us the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.760
 because it's the only thing they do if they jump 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.970
 so this is going to close very well 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.430
 now here so that this water does not fall and 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.520
 stay here what we can put 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.560
 we remove this poster as here a block 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.390
 so that the water does not go away now 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.620
 also out there 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.620
 this block I will remove 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.060
 therefore now I put the water and good 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.380
 now 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.380
 to be able to do that 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.640
 now we remove this we put the poster and 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.330
 here with a used 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.330
 here 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.960
 OK 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.150
 now 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.030
 open those ears well because there is something 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.160
 very important that you have to know 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.190
 this down here this may be 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.990
 just like this was the floor of 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.210
 our house by center 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.310
 what's below can be this can 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.880
 be underground with the condition with 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.940
 the condition that here here and here 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.800
 always be free whether or not there 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.750
 blocking or that there is crystal but this 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.239
 you have to be always free either 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.100
 here like 80 blocks above it's worth not 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.299
 you can build nothing on top of this 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.690
 never 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.900
 these crystals have you always 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.870
 it's worth down here 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.870
 and so I was missing the most important thing 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.870
 doors 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.110
 it's worth below what we have to do 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.280
 it's fair 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.090
 under this block we just put three 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:49.200
 ports of fire presto answers there and 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.169
 another three doors here like this 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.719
 so that this will leave you acid 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.860
 in this case for example I could now 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:01.990
 leave this with nothing but this if I 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.030
 I want this to be 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.430
 where I'm going because this is 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.020
 here I have to free myself and not 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.009
 drop me because the glass is already 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.740
 fixed up 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.740
 and now right here and here 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.020
 we have to put here a villager here 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.020
 have a villager 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.380
 and now this is from here they are going to go 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.380
 giving love 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.390
 I do not think it takes long 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.460
 ok I'll cut here the video when 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.240
 There are some with Cesc villagers further in 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.180
 I return it's worth until now it's worth 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.820
 how many more villagers and now we are going to see 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.420
 I do not know how many 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.370
 well there are about 20 and one more villager or 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.220
 less 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.360
 yes, now I will remove some times 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.360
 there are small goes far and now I am here 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.360
 for 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:06.580
 well you just see how they are going 

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:08.979
 moving vale there they move and from there already 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.429
 they can not get out of there they can not 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.429
 go out 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.950
 What do you think, guys here? 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.500
 they can leave 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.260
 and well, guys, up to here 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.290

 Here you have the proof that it that 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.880
 they give love 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.190
 because he was already seeing me in the 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.880
 comments that someone says sure that
