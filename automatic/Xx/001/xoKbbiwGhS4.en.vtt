00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
and fill in the front with that so that

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.979 
and fill in the front with that so that
the<00:02:32.590> front<00:02:32.890> isn't<00:02:33.129> too<00:02:33.640> half<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:37.480> like<00:02:37.599> that

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
the front isn't too half just like that

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.500 
the front isn't too half just like that
and<00:02:38.430> I'll<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:39.609> do<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:39.879> other<00:02:40.239> side<00:02:40.450> of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
and I'll just do the other side of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.270 
and I'll just do the other side of
camera<00:02:41.109> because<00:02:41.439> obviously<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.980> video<00:02:42.220> is

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
camera because obviously this video is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.589 
camera because obviously this video is
going<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.459> be<00:02:42.519> too<00:02:42.700> long<00:02:42.879> if<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.150> enjoyed<00:02:43.420> both

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
going to be too long if I enjoyed both

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.750 
going to be too long if I enjoyed both
okay<00:02:44.379> so<00:02:44.439> that's<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.859> eyebrows<00:02:45.189> all<00:02:45.370> drawn<00:02:45.609> on

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
okay so that's the eyebrows all drawn on

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.449 
okay so that's the eyebrows all drawn on
and<00:02:46.030> then<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.269> use<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.870> mac<00:02:47.140> brow<00:02:47.409> set<00:02:47.769> in<00:02:48.099> show

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
and then I use the mac brow set in show

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:58.680 
and then I use the mac brow set in show
off<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.209> set<00:02:49.510> them<00:02:49.629> in<00:02:49.689> place<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:57.690> then

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
off to just set them in place and then

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.449 
off to just set them in place and then
for<00:02:58.900> some<00:02:59.019> reason<00:02:59.079> I<00:02:59.560> tend<00:02:59.799> to<00:02:59.889> move<00:03:00.040> on<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.340> my

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
is actually limited edition so I'm

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.530 
is actually limited edition so I'm
really<00:03:31.620> sorry<00:03:31.830> but<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:33.000> one<00:03:33.239> which<00:03:33.480> is

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
really sorry but it is this one which is

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.660 
really sorry but it is this one which is
Matt<00:03:34.049> right<00:03:34.319> for<00:03:34.530> love<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.010> was<00:03:35.220> part<00:03:35.489> of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
Matt right for love and this was part of

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.170 
Matt right for love and this was part of
their<00:03:37.250> temperature<00:03:38.250> rising<00:03:38.670> collection<00:03:39.060> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
their temperature rising collection and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.580 
their temperature rising collection and
I<00:03:39.239> believe<00:03:39.480> that's<00:03:39.870> what<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.110> was<00:03:40.170> called<00:03:40.230> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
I believe that's what it was called and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.009 
I believe that's what it was called and
it's<00:03:41.190> quite<00:03:41.430> similar<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:42.120> NARS<00:03:42.360> blush<00:03:42.480> in

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
it's quite similar to the NARS blush in

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.720 
it's quite similar to the NARS blush in
liberty<00:03:43.470> or<00:03:43.709> something<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.099> it's

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
liberty or something like that it's

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.850 
liberty or something like that it's
quite<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.239> similar<00:03:45.720> sort<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.989> peachy<00:03:46.379> shade<00:03:46.409> so

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
quite a similar sort of peachy shade so

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.890 
quite a similar sort of peachy shade so
if<00:03:47.159> you<00:03:47.489> can't<00:03:48.180> get<00:03:48.299> hold<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:48.840> we

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
if you can't get hold of this so we

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.899 
if you can't get hold of this so we
don't<00:03:49.049> have<00:03:49.110> this<00:03:49.170> then<00:03:49.620> NARS<00:03:49.890> Liberty<00:03:50.250> might

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
don't have this then NARS Liberty might

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.360 
don't have this then NARS Liberty might
be<00:03:51.060> an<00:03:51.180> option<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:51.989> try<00:03:52.409> and<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:53.190> just

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
because it's just so easy to use and

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.080 
because it's just so easy to use and

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
it's so creamy and blendable but I just

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.570 
it's so creamy and blendable but I just
that's<00:05:29.750> quite<00:05:29.960> not<00:05:30.590> natural<00:05:31.070> but<00:05:31.100> it<00:05:31.460> just

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
that's quite not natural but it just

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.820 
that's quite not natural but it just
blends<00:05:31.850> in<00:05:32.030> really<00:05:32.200> seamlessly<00:05:33.200> and<00:05:33.530> doesn't

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
blends in really seamlessly and doesn't

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.650 
blends in really seamlessly and doesn't
look<00:05:34.010> like<00:05:34.190> you've<00:05:34.370> applied<00:05:34.580> ton<00:05:35.300> of<00:05:35.420> powder

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.220 
loving the penis of the lips rather than
just<00:06:27.770> being<00:06:27.980> a<00:06:28.190> plain<00:06:28.370> nude<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.630> I<00:06:29.960> think<00:06:30.140> the

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
just being a plain nude and I think the

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.420 
just being a plain nude and I think the
cheeks<00:06:30.470> are<00:06:30.680> just<00:06:30.830> really<00:06:31.040> nice<00:06:31.190> because

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
cheeks are just really nice because

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.590 
cheeks are just really nice because
they're<00:06:31.669> warm<00:06:31.910> but<00:06:32.120> they<00:06:32.180> do<00:06:32.240> have<00:06:32.390> a<00:06:32.450> bit<00:06:32.540> of

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
they're warm but they do have a bit of

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.420 
they're warm but they do have a bit of
color<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:33.350> it<00:06:33.440> doesn't<00:06:33.710> look<00:06:33.740> like<00:06:33.860> I've<00:06:34.160> put

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
color and it doesn't look like I've put

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.220 
color and it doesn't look like I've put
too<00:06:34.880> much<00:06:35.030> blush<00:06:35.390> on<00:06:35.630> or<00:06:35.750> anything<00:06:35.840> like<00:06:36.080> that

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
too much blush on or anything like that

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.470 
too much blush on or anything like that
and<00:06:36.710> I<00:06:37.370> just<00:06:37.580> really<00:06:37.790> don't<00:06:37.910> have<00:06:38.210> to<00:06:38.330> bother

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
and I just really don't have to bother

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.270 
and I just really don't have to bother
too<00:06:38.780> much<00:06:38.810> with<00:06:39.260> this<00:06:39.410> makeup<00:06:39.620> because<00:06:39.980> it's

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
too much with this makeup because it's

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.370 
too much with this makeup because it's
just<00:06:40.340> so<00:06:40.490> simple<00:06:40.850> the<00:06:41.510> eyes<00:06:41.660> is<00:06:41.900> actually<00:06:42.200> one

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
just so simple the eyes is actually one

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.320 
just so simple the eyes is actually one
color<00:06:42.620> but<00:06:42.740> it<00:06:43.010> just<00:06:43.190> makes<00:06:43.370> them<00:06:43.640> look<00:06:44.150> a

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
color but it just makes them look a

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.820 
color but it just makes them look a
little<00:06:44.570> bit<00:06:44.720> nicer<00:06:44.870> and<00:06:45.230> they<00:06:45.380> stand<00:06:45.650> out<00:06:45.770> a

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
little bit nicer and they stand out a

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.010 
little bit nicer and they stand out a
bit<00:06:45.890> more<00:06:46.160> so<00:06:46.700> I<00:06:47.030> definitely<00:06:47.390> love<00:06:47.630> this<00:06:47.750> level

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
bit more so I definitely love this level

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.870 
bit more so I definitely love this level
I<00:06:48.110> think<00:06:48.320> it<00:06:48.410> was<00:06:48.470> suit<00:06:48.650> a<00:06:48.710> lot<00:06:48.830> of<00:06:48.919> people<00:06:49.310> so

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
I think it was suit a lot of people so

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.490 
I think it was suit a lot of people so
definitely<00:06:50.150> try<00:06:50.540> it<00:06:50.600> out<00:06:50.810> and<00:06:51.080> I'll<00:06:51.169> leave<00:06:51.350> all
