with<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.829> video<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.360> HTML

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
with this video but there is the HTML

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.990 
with this video but there is the HTML
we've<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.290> been<00:01:31.439> looking<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.280> next<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
we've just been looking at and next to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.929 
we've just been looking at and next to
it<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.540> images<00:01:34.079> folder<00:01:34.680> which<00:01:35.340> includes

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
it is the images folder which includes

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.510 
it is the images folder which includes
the<00:01:36.150> actual<00:01:36.630> image<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the actual image that we see on that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.749 
the actual image that we see on that
page<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> HTML<00:01:41.250> you'll

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
page so if we go back to the HTML you'll

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.719 
page so if we go back to the HTML you'll
see<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.509> image<00:01:42.930> source<00:01:43.470> path<00:01:43.890> goes<00:01:44.430> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
see that the image source path goes to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.480 
see that the image source path goes to
that<00:01:44.909> images<00:01:45.570> folder<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.500> specifies<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that images folder and specifies the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.450 
that images folder and specifies the
name<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.479> image<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.619> we're<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> have

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
name of the image so we're going to have

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.880 
name of the image so we're going to have
to<00:01:50.610> put<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.970> onto<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.600> site<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.259> order<00:01:52.530> to
