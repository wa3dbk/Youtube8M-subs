about<00:06:36.620> this<00:06:36.949> my<00:06:37.490> theory<00:06:37.729> is<00:06:37.880> that<00:06:38.139> since<00:06:39.139> PC

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
online for free the idea was just

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.790 
online for free the idea was just
ludicrous<00:06:44.270> to<00:06:44.719> them<00:06:44.870> as<00:06:45.020> it<00:06:45.349> should<00:06:45.560> have<00:06:45.680> been

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
ludicrous to them as it should have been

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.659 
ludicrous to them as it should have been
now<00:06:46.550> a<00:06:46.849> lot<00:06:47.750> of<00:06:47.779> console<00:06:48.320> players<00:06:48.589> their<00:06:49.279> first
