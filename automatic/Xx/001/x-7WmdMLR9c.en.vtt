00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.140
 sensational eyelash mascara from gemey 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.250
 maybelline 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.040
 but what does he do they unfold the eyelashes 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.650
 like a fan does you good in 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.379
 any case level if I am rather du 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.140
 kind not too many lengths say that 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.090
 if we want to compare I have a square I 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.980
 not long hair I do not have the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.109
 short hair I have a frame so that's 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.250
 very short but it's but it's not no 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.820
 plus level curvature 0 I am lice of the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.770
 eyelash completely and volume level 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.129
 well here we can like hair 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.480
 shiny slab 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.940
 suddenly when I put my wishes it to me 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.670
 promises lashes to multiply and a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.280
 fan effect volume I tell myself this is 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.340
 for me it's my product it's good I 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.620
 am the destiny of this product for 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.579
 apply it there is a small gesture then 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.230
 you take your eyelash mascara 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.359
 sensational and you already see the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.989
 brush I like to show you a little 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.150
 this recipe because you already have a little 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.740
 with the pico the fan effect for 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.000
 apply it there is a small gesture that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.979
 is called their twitter 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.420
 so I do not really know if we're going to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.490
 translate to France she learns to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.250
 to turn good is better their authors 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.170
 so I always take my mirror 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.350
 downstairs as I taught you 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.890
 and then watch out - the movement 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 you take it like that you shook well and you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 turn up 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 you see how you do it well 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.710
 if he a little blow- dry the aito rediÃ¨re 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.860
 progress we redo gÃ¼len movement 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.470
 twitter because you have to make a note of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.049
 pilates pilot 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.850
 ok not just no you take it like that but 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.700
 you pilots 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.090
 you take hockey pivot and that's it 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.759
 that he gives this deployed effect had to pose 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.270
 my six-year-old mascara and strength 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.670
 is to note there is a 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.099
 length that I did not have before well 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.310
 obviously a lot of volume and especially 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.530
 because I noticed and I missed 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.390
 it's this curvature you see then 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.709
 obviously a little used to see her 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.330
 with an eyelash curler but there the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.010
 principle is to do it without being 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.400
 hump it's there even without recourse 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.290
 possible 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.030
 I think we can see the facts and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.370
 that there is a real curvature we see 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.560
 really this effect deployed then there 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.790
 Tuesday effect fan you can say 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.819
 all the other words you want 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.269
 it's a deploying effect sends over 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.630
 eyelashes and especially so there feat of the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.400
 day 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.380
 there is no people and no package 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.120
 total validation of sensational eyelashes 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.690
 ever wiebe nine with 6 and 26 May 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.500
