I believe they're the HFS models you've
got<00:00:53.500> your<00:00:53.620> volume<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:54.039> tone<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.910> got<00:00:55.030> your

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
got your volume on tone and you got your

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.479 
got your volume on tone and you got your
3-way<00:00:55.480> selector<00:00:55.539> switch<00:00:56.230> but<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.010> tone<00:00:57.219> knob

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
3-way selector switch but the tone knob

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.880 
3-way selector switch but the tone knob
also<00:00:58.059> acts<00:00:58.300> as<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.570> push-pull<00:00:59.079> as<00:00:59.230> well<00:00:59.440> so<00:00:59.829> you
