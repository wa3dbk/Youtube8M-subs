play it over and over again because as

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.190

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
you move on through the game the levels

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:16.580 
you move on through the game the levels
get<00:02:04.380> harder<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.010> harder<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.660> only<00:02:16.140> thing<00:02:16.440> I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
get harder and harder the only thing I

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.520 
get harder and harder the only thing I
do<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> put<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.970> app<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.260> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
do not like and put this app is that you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.250 
do not like and put this app is that you
don't<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.550> see<00:02:20.820> where<00:02:21.690> you're<00:02:21.930> shooting

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
don't get to see where you're shooting

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.040 
don't get to see where you're shooting
the<00:02:22.350> bird<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.940> know<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.120> gotta<00:02:27.450> try<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
the bird so you know you gotta try and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.960 
the bird so you know you gotta try and
guess<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.650> only<00:02:28.800> good<00:02:29.070> thing<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.670> leaves

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
guess the only good thing is it leaves

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.020 
guess the only good thing is it leaves
you<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> little<00:02:30.420> trail<00:02:31.430> from<00:02:32.430> where<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.850> were

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
you a little trail from where you were

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.630 
you a little trail from where you were
before

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.860 

but<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:41.940> get<00:02:42.090> past<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.510> then<00:02:42.630> this

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
but if you can get past that then this

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:54.750 
but if you can get past that then this
is<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.110> pretty<00:02:43.650> good<00:02:43.860> game

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.850 

so<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.239> isn't<00:02:56.480> mark<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.110> tech<00:02:57.319> guy<00:02:57.500> today
