00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.160
 each of the yolks 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.430
 Guillermo Lasso the permanent candidate 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.890
 to the presidency says that the first of 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.740
 May you have to go out into the streets to

 protest the lack of employment I would 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.010
 I ask what commemoration of the day of 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.220
 work we will have the first of May 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.289
 yes of 7 million Ecuadorians who 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.210
 they are part of the labor force of the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:38.630
 country only three have work four no 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.110
 they have a formal job the first of 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.690
 May should become the day of the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.739
 general protest of the unemployed in 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.980
 the equator because there is no employment 60% 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.850
 of the labor force is unemployed 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.600
 says the banker lasso 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.000
 look 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.699
 is on the contrary lord tie today the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.160
 population with a job exceeds six 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.960
 million nine hundred thousand Ecuadorians and 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.470
 we have one of the rates of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.960
 lowest unemployment in the region 3.8 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.479
 hundred it seems that the banker lasso is 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.340
 confuse of era because when it was 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.220
 minister of economy in the government of 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.610
 banking holiday six out of ten 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.670
 Ecuadorians were poor today instead 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.950
 it is two out of ten when the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.819
 tie banker was economy minister 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.569
 urban unemployment came to exceed the 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:37.569
 11 percent today on the other hand this 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.940
 indicator does not exceed 5 percent 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.960
 when the tie banker was a minister 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.259
 economy 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.020
 'ecuador collapsed such a collapse caused the 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.549
 exit of millions of Ecuadorians who 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.460
 they were left in the street not only because 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.100
 they lost their jobs but because they were 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.159
 literally assaulted with the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.770
 seizure of your money your savings 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.770
 disappeared and they even changed the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.799
 currency 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.530
 but there the banker lasso did not go out to the 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.280
 streets to defend the Ecuadorians 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.050
 there he did not remember the first of May 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.650
 now in return for wanting to be 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.270
 president until he loses memory I 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.810
 I want to be president of the equator 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.830
 I want to be president of the equator 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.550
 the banker guillermo lasso that I will do 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.550
