00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.340 
of be aggressive with it and see how far
we<00:01:10.799> could<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.720> pretty<00:01:12.869> surprised

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
we could go and I was pretty surprised

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.840 
we could go and I was pretty surprised
that<00:01:13.619> aesthetically<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> started<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> look

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that aesthetically it started to look

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.690 
that aesthetically it started to look
really<00:01:15.150> good<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.960> I've<00:01:16.560> grown<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> really

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
really good and and I've grown to really

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.230 
really good and and I've grown to really
like<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> look<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.880> most

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
like the look of it I think it the most

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.370 
like the look of it I think it the most
important<00:01:21.570> thing<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> course<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.170> you

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
important thing of course is that you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590 
important thing of course is that you
can<00:01:22.409> play<00:01:22.710> way<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.300> play<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
can play way up here and you can play a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.750 
can play way up here and you can play a
lot<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.900> fast<00:01:25.110> things<00:01:25.440> that<00:01:25.800> require<00:01:26.460> your

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
lot of fast things that require your

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.850 
lot of fast things that require your
fingers<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:27.990> jumping<00:01:28.620> up<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
fingers to be you know jumping up and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.090 
fingers to be you know jumping up and
down

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
down

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.250 
down
you<00:01:29.760> never<00:01:30.000> come<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.390> contact<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.050> wood

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
you never come in contact with the wood

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260 
you never come in contact with the wood
and<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.620> know<00:01:32.370> I<00:01:32.400> checked<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:32.940> with<00:01:33.150> some

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and you know I checked it out with some

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
and you know I checked it out with some
older<00:01:33.540> guitarists<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.140> strats<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> things

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
older guitarists like strats and things

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.070 
older guitarists like strats and things
like<00:01:35.190> that<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.760> make<00:01:35.940> sure<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:37.049> think

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
like that just to make sure and I think

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.780 
like that just to make sure and I think
we<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> much<00:01:38.100> better

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
we have a much better

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.740 
we have a much better
clearance<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.870> think<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.380> more<00:01:40.620> comfortable

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
clearance I think it is more comfortable

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.840 
clearance I think it is more comfortable
the<00:01:43.320> way<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.460> keeps<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the way we have it and it keeps the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:02:02.900 
the way we have it and it keeps the
basic<00:01:45.210> aesthetic<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> jazz<00:01:46.170> guitar

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.500 

this<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.120> pro<00:02:04.690> track<00:02:04.960> from<00:02:05.440> DiMarzio<00:02:06.510> the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
this is a pro track from DiMarzio the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.850 
this is a pro track from DiMarzio the
reason<00:02:07.810> why<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:07.930> went<00:02:08.140> with<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.560> because<00:02:08.830> I

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
reason why I went with this is because I

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.190 
reason why I went with this is because I
noticed<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.580> most<00:02:10.000> guitarists<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.869> modern

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
noticed that most guitarists the modern

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.860 
noticed that most guitarists the modern
guitars<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.580> full-on<00:02:13.000> 24<00:02:13.630> fret

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
guitars that have the full-on 24 fret

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.680 
guitars that have the full-on 24 fret
fretboard<00:02:14.440> here<00:02:14.790> they<00:02:15.790> take<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> humbucker<00:02:16.540> and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
fretboard here they take a humbucker and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.750 
fretboard here they take a humbucker and
they've<00:02:16.990> got<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.260> move<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.560> way<00:02:17.770> back<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.580> that

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
they've got to move it way back and that

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.310 
they've got to move it way back and that
sort<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.090> kills<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> sound<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.140> neck

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
sort of kills the sound of the neck

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.190 
sort of kills the sound of the neck
pickup<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.880> neck<00:02:22.060> pickup<00:02:22.300> with<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> j/s

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
pickup and the neck pickup with a j/s

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.180 
pickup and the neck pickup with a j/s
line<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.740> very<00:02:24.010> important<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:25.090> my<00:02:25.360> music<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
line is very important in my music and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.500 
line is very important in my music and
the<00:02:27.190> music<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.550> make<00:02:27.580> with<00:02:27.880> chicken<00:02:28.150> foot<00:02:28.330> it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
the music I make with chicken foot it

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.780 
the music I make with chicken foot it
really<00:02:28.540> figures<00:02:29.290> into<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.190> records<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
really figures into the records and the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.190 
really figures into the records and the
live<00:02:30.970> performance<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.750> didn't<00:02:31.990> want<00:02:32.140> to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
live performance so I didn't want to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.340 
live performance so I didn't want to
lose<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.740> particular<00:02:33.580> tone<00:02:34.060> quality<00:02:34.360> but<00:02:35.170> I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
lose that particular tone quality but I

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.810 
lose that particular tone quality but I
also<00:02:35.590> wanted<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.980> take<00:02:36.160> advantage<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
also wanted to take advantage of the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.040 
also wanted to take advantage of the
fact<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.300> we<00:02:37.390> were<00:02:37.540> going<00:02:37.870> with<00:02:38.020> a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
fact that if we were going with a

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.650 
fact that if we were going with a
smaller<00:02:38.440> pickup<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.970> we<00:02:40.150> could<00:02:40.300> get<00:02:40.510> it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
smaller pickup here so we could get it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.750 
smaller pickup here so we could get it
as<00:02:40.780> close<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.470> fret<00:02:41.680> board<00:02:41.740> as<00:02:42.040> possible

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
as close to the fret board as possible

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.820 
as close to the fret board as possible
we<00:02:43.060> had<00:02:43.210> some<00:02:43.390> great<00:02:43.600> options<00:02:44.080> from<00:02:44.230> DiMarzio

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
we had some great options from DiMarzio

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.010 
we had some great options from DiMarzio
to<00:02:44.950> fool<00:02:45.130> around<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.490> so<00:02:46.090> after<00:02:46.810> working

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
to fool around with so after working

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.730 
to fool around with so after working
with<00:02:47.940> Steve<00:02:48.940> blue<00:02:49.120> shirt<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:50.140> Larry

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
with Steve blue shirt and Larry

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.680 
with Steve blue shirt and Larry
quite<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.070> bit<00:02:51.280> we<00:02:51.490> came<00:02:51.730> up<00:02:51.910> with<00:02:52.420> something

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
quite a bit we came up with something

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.180 
quite a bit we came up with something
that<00:02:52.900> they<00:02:53.020> already<00:02:53.170> had<00:02:53.470> going<00:02:53.830> which<00:02:54.010> was

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
that they already had going which was

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.980 
that they already had going which was
great<00:02:54.460> in<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.610> pro<00:02:54.850> track<00:02:55.150> gives<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.840> that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
great in the pro track gives you that

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.450 
great in the pro track gives you that
throaty<00:02:56.320> tone<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:56.860> you're<00:02:56.980> looking<00:02:57.220> for<00:02:57.340> that

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
throaty tone if you're looking for that

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.540 
throaty tone if you're looking for that
hendrix<00:02:57.910> e<00:02:58.060> strat<00:02:58.600> kind<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.170> sound<00:02:59.430> but<00:03:00.430> it

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
hendrix e strat kind of sound but it

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.850 
hendrix e strat kind of sound but it
also<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:01.120> big<00:03:01.450> enough<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.750> sort<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.560> take<00:03:02.740> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
also is big enough to sort of take the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.130 
also is big enough to sort of take the
place<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.430> humbucker<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.900> comes<00:03:05.080> very

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
place of the humbucker so it comes very

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.949 
place of the humbucker so it comes very
close<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.740> PAF<00:03:06.130> Pro<00:03:06.370> or<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.940> PAF<00:03:07.390> Joe<00:03:07.660> and

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
close to the PAF Pro or the PAF Joe and

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.620 
close to the PAF Pro or the PAF Joe and
it<00:03:08.770> seems<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.190> balance<00:03:09.340> really<00:03:09.790> well<00:03:10.300> with<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
it seems to balance really well with the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:30.960 
it seems to balance really well with the
Mojo<00:03:10.810> pickup

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.540 

well<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.780> think<00:03:31.900> anytime<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.950> get<00:03:33.190> an

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
well I think anytime that you get an

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.130 
well I think anytime that you get an
extra<00:03:33.850> two<00:03:34.060> frets<00:03:34.300> on<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.510> guitar

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
extra two frets on a guitar

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.200 
extra two frets on a guitar
you're<00:03:35.320> gonna<00:03:35.440> wander<00:03:36.190> up<00:03:36.430> there<00:03:36.670> see<00:03:37.060> what

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
you're gonna wander up there see what

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.780 
you're gonna wander up there see what
they<00:03:37.330> do<00:03:37.390> so<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.590> obvious<00:03:38.740> answer<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.550> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
they do so the obvious answer to the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.950 
they do so the obvious answer to the
question<00:03:40.150> doesn't<00:03:40.360> make<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.750> play

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
question doesn't make you play

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.420 
question doesn't make you play
differently<00:03:41.380> as<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> yeah<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.890> play<00:03:42.220> some

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
differently as a yeah you play some

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.370 
differently as a yeah you play some
higher<00:03:42.610> notes<00:03:42.910> not<00:03:43.510> everyone<00:03:43.960> in<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.170> band

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
higher notes not everyone in the band

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.950 
higher notes not everyone in the band
will<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.680> happy<00:03:45.010> with<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.190> but<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:46.180> think<00:03:46.690> that

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
will be happy with that but I think that

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.470 
will be happy with that but I think that
after<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:48.010> get<00:03:48.250> over<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.760> obvious<00:03:49.180> thing

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
after you get over the obvious thing

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.900 
after you get over the obvious thing
that<00:03:49.780> wow<00:03:50.020> I<00:03:50.050> can<00:03:50.470> go<00:03:50.620> up<00:03:50.740> there<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.130> just<00:03:51.190> Bend

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
that wow I can go up there and just Bend

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.630 
that wow I can go up there and just Bend
from<00:03:52.060> there<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:53.650> begin<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.010> see<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.250> benefits

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
from there you begin to see the benefits

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.730 
from there you begin to see the benefits
of<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.820> number<00:03:55.150> one<00:03:55.390> when<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.720> are<00:03:56.050> reaching

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
of it number one when you are reaching

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.130 
of it number one when you are reaching
up<00:03:57.040> there<00:03:57.250> for<00:03:57.520> ease<00:03:57.730> or<00:03:58.090> F<00:03:58.390> sharps<00:03:58.750> or<00:03:58.900> even

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
up there for ease or F sharps or even

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.920 
up there for ease or F sharps or even
G's<00:03:59.410> you<00:04:00.130> can<00:04:00.280> actually<00:04:00.430> get<00:04:00.820> them<00:04:01.060> whereas<00:04:01.780> on

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
G's you can actually get them whereas on

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.140 
G's you can actually get them whereas on
a<00:04:01.960> 22<00:04:02.380> fret<00:04:02.560> guitar<00:04:02.890> it's<00:04:03.490> a<00:04:03.610> pretty<00:04:03.880> scary

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
a 22 fret guitar it's a pretty scary

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.240 
a 22 fret guitar it's a pretty scary
venture<00:04:04.630> because<00:04:04.990> you've<00:04:05.530> really<00:04:05.860> got<00:04:06.160> to

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
venture because you've really got to

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.500 
venture because you've really got to
bend<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.490> string<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.240> could<00:04:07.360> always

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
bend that string and it could always

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.930 
bend that string and it could always
break<00:04:07.930> because<00:04:08.230> in<00:04:08.350> here<00:04:08.530> you're<00:04:08.920> pushing<00:04:09.850> the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
break because in here you're pushing the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.880 
break because in here you're pushing the
limits<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.690> flexibility<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.620> string

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
limits of the flexibility of the string

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.860 
limits of the flexibility of the string
there<00:04:12.100> so<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:13.210> know<00:04:13.330> one<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.660> things

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
there so I you know one of the things

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.480 
there so I you know one of the things
that<00:04:14.020> I<00:04:14.050> did<00:04:14.290> right<00:04:14.590> away<00:04:14.620> though<00:04:15.100> which<00:04:15.340> is

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
that I did right away though which is

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.740 
that I did right away though which is
the<00:04:15.610> obvious<00:04:16.000> thing<00:04:16.209> when<00:04:16.330> we<00:04:16.450> were<00:04:16.600> making

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
the obvious thing when we were making

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.500 
the obvious thing when we were making
the<00:04:17.560> Chickenfoot<00:04:18.040> record<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.580> had<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.120> do<00:04:19.269> a

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
the Chickenfoot record I had to do a

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.950 
the Chickenfoot record I had to do a
solo<00:04:19.810> for<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.350> song<00:04:20.560> oh<00:04:20.890> yeah<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:22.150> we<00:04:22.810> were

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
solo for the song oh yeah and we were

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.570 
solo for the song oh yeah and we were
fooling<00:04:23.260> around<00:04:23.470> with<00:04:23.620> different<00:04:23.920> ideas<00:04:24.220> and

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
fooling around with different ideas and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.760 
fooling around with different ideas and
and<00:04:24.760> different<00:04:25.630> guitars<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:26.380> pulled

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
and different guitars and so I pulled

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.740 
and different guitars and so I pulled
out<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.040> prototype<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.700> yellow<00:04:27.940> one<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:28.450> I

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
out the prototype the yellow one and I

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.240 
out the prototype the yellow one and I
said<00:04:28.960> let's<00:04:29.140> see<00:04:29.260> what<00:04:29.410> this<00:04:29.530> thing<00:04:29.710> does<00:04:29.890> and

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
said let's see what this thing does and

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.820 
said let's see what this thing does and
we<00:04:30.670> did<00:04:30.850> one<00:04:31.510> take<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.110> first<00:04:32.530> thing<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.770> did

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
we did one take and first thing I did

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.800 
we did one take and first thing I did
was<00:04:33.070> as<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.370> was<00:04:33.400> wandering<00:04:33.970> up<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.210> neck<00:04:34.420> was<00:04:34.630> I

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
was as I was wandering up the neck was I

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.110 
was as I was wandering up the neck was I
bet<00:04:35.260> I<00:04:35.290> could<00:04:35.530> hit<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.710> G<00:04:36.040> on<00:04:36.250> this<00:04:36.460> real<00:04:36.820> easy

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
bet I could hit a G on this real easy

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.900 
bet I could hit a G on this real easy
and<00:04:37.419> it<00:04:38.320> wound<00:04:38.650> up<00:04:38.800> as<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.640> know<00:04:39.669> the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
and it wound up as that you know the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.400 
and it wound up as that you know the
solo<00:04:40.120> track<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.570> we<00:04:40.660> use<00:04:40.810> for<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.050> record

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
solo track that we use for the record

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.000 
solo track that we use for the record
and<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:43.450> kind<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.780> worried<00:04:44.260> me<00:04:44.410> on<00:04:44.530> tour<00:04:44.770> later

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
and it kind of worried me on tour later

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.860 
and it kind of worried me on tour later
when<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.310> only<00:04:45.550> had<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.880> json'<00:04:46.330> thousands

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
when I only had the json' thousands

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.270 
when I only had the json' thousands
because<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.140> had<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.470> hit<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:47.740> high<00:04:47.800> G

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
because I had to hit that high G

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.909 
because I had to hit that high G
sometimes<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.210> would<00:04:49.390> cheat<00:04:50.110> play<00:04:50.470> it<00:04:50.590> on<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.710> B

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
sometimes I would cheat play it on the B

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.470 
sometimes I would cheat play it on the B
string<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.370> try<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.640> make<00:04:51.970> an<00:04:52.120> artificial

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
string and try to make an artificial

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.659 
string and try to make an artificial
harmonic<00:04:53.169> but<00:04:53.680> now<00:04:53.830> that<00:04:54.070> we're<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:54.550> know

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
harmonic but now that we're you know

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.909 
harmonic but now that we're you know
starting<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.120> put<00:04:55.360> this<00:04:55.480> into<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.990> line<00:04:56.710> about
