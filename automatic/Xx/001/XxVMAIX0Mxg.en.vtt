00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
time last week you talked about making a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.309 
time last week you talked about making a
real<00:00:02.580> start<00:00:02.970> with<00:00:03.419> Manchester<00:00:03.870> United<00:00:03.899> was

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
real start with Manchester United was

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.510 
real start with Manchester United was
that<00:00:04.470> for<00:00:04.920> nil<00:00:05.100> win

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
that for nil win

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.690 
that for nil win
the<00:00:05.790> real<00:00:05.940> start<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.420> were<00:00:06.509> looking<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:07.700> yeah

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
the real start you were looking for yeah

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.780 
the real start you were looking for yeah
of<00:00:09.179> course<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.960> result<00:00:10.380> was<00:00:10.590> very<00:00:10.950> good<00:00:11.370> I

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
of course the result was very good I

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
of course the result was very good I
think<00:00:11.880> for<00:00:13.219> Sarah<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> big<00:00:14.759> result<00:00:15.920> but<00:00:16.920> also

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
think for Sarah is a big result but also

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.349 
think for Sarah is a big result but also
the<00:00:17.490> way<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:18.150> played<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:21.090> fence

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the way we have played I think the fence

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:29.300 
the way we have played I think the fence
sell<00:00:22.170> shall<00:00:22.710> enjoy<00:00:23.600> themselves<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.890> diamond

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
sell shall enjoy themselves the diamond

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.279 
sell shall enjoy themselves the diamond
formation<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.150> midfield<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.720> solution<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
formation in midfield the solution to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
formation in midfield the solution to
all<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:31.890> players<00:00:32.130> playing<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
all these good players playing in the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.459 
all these good players playing in the
same<00:00:33.149> team<00:00:33.420> oh<00:00:35.690> yes<00:00:36.690> that's<00:00:37.469> true

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
same team oh yes that's true

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.060 
same team oh yes that's true
I've<00:00:40.469> shared<00:00:40.800> already<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> beginning<00:00:43.070> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
I've shared already in the beginning and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.549 
I've shared already in the beginning and
then<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.450> started<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:46.200> another<00:00:47.270> system

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
then I have started with another system

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.080 
then I have started with another system
because<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> quality<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.820> players

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
because of the quality of the players

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
because of the quality of the players
and<00:00:52.460> now<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.940> bought<00:00:56.000> quality<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and now we have bought quality of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.240 
and now we have bought quality of
players<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.410> look<00:01:01.920> at

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
players in and then you have to look at

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
players in and then you have to look at
these<00:01:03.149> qualities<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.909> want<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
these qualities and then you want to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.340 
these qualities and then you want to
perform<00:01:06.920> perform<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> philosophy<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.930> we

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
perform perform the philosophy that we

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.260 
perform perform the philosophy that we
have<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:12.020> then<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.740> coming<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
have and then you are coming out in the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.060 
have and then you are coming out in the
English<00:01:15.420> system<00:01:16.400> but<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.799> changed

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
English system but it can be changed

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.100 
English system but it can be changed
also<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> fixed

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
also it's not that it is a fixed

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.910 
also it's not that it is a fixed
solution

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.610 

I<00:01:28.060> have<00:01:29.060> played<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:30.760> already<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.960> my<00:01:33.260> first

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
I have played that already in my first

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.730 
I have played that already in my first
match<00:01:34.070> as<00:01:34.370> a<00:01:34.430> trainer<00:01:34.850> coach<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.290> second

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
match as a trainer coach of the second

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.130 
match as a trainer coach of the second
team<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:37.250> iyx<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.680> there<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:40.100> was<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:43.840> law<00:01:44.840> that

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
team of iyx and there it was a law that

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.080 
team of iyx and there it was a law that
we<00:01:45.410> have<00:01:45.440> to<00:01:45.710> play<00:01:45.920> four<00:01:46.250> three<00:01:46.520> three<00:01:46.550> but<00:01:47.060> I

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
we have to play four three three but I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.160 
we have to play four three three but I
played<00:01:47.540> four<00:01:47.930> four<00:01:48.229> two<00:01:48.500> as<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.820> as<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.810> trainer

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
coach of the second team of I acts

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.740 
coach of the second team of I acts
because<00:01:54.229> I<00:01:54.440> thought<00:01:54.830> it's<00:01:55.370> more<00:01:56.000> suitable<00:01:56.360> for

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
because I thought it's more suitable for

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.560 
because I thought it's more suitable for
the<00:01:56.840> quality<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.290> my<00:01:57.470> place<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:58.120> was<00:01:59.120> I<00:01:59.680> think

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
the quality of my place that was I think

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:09.400 
the quality of my place that was I think
and<00:02:02.570> when<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.900> was<00:02:04.840> 90<00:02:05.840> 88<00:02:06.369> 88<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:08.450> long<00:02:09.140> time

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
and when it was 90 88 88 so long time

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.220 
and when it was 90 88 88 so long time
ago<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:10.700> brought<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.239> many<00:02:11.360> big<00:02:11.630> players<00:02:11.900> into

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
ago you brought so many big players into

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.930 
ago you brought so many big players into
Manchester<00:02:12.530> United<00:02:13.040> could<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.340> bring

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
Manchester United could you bring

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.090 
Manchester United could you bring
someone<00:02:14.209> like<00:02:14.360> Cristiano<00:02:14.959> Ronaldo<00:02:15.410> back<00:02:15.920> to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
someone like Cristiano Ronaldo back to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.800 
someone like Cristiano Ronaldo back to
Manchester<00:02:16.489> United<00:02:16.520> that's<00:02:16.970> certainly<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
Manchester United that's certainly the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.199 
Manchester United that's certainly the
discussion<00:02:18.350> at<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> moment

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
discussion at the moment

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.800 
discussion at the moment
yeah<00:02:21.019> but<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:22.159> always<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.609> discussion<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.540> in

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
yeah but it's always a discussion in in

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.630 
yeah but it's always a discussion in in
the<00:02:23.930> papers<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:25.780> don't<00:02:26.780> think<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
the papers and I don't think the the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.410 
the papers and I don't think the the
media<00:02:28.969> shall<00:02:29.299> buy<00:02:29.510> another<00:02:30.079> so<00:02:34.150> when<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.269> is

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
media shall buy another so when it is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.229 
media shall buy another so when it is
possible<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.140> always<00:02:36.560> what<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.459> have<00:02:37.670> said<00:02:37.939> with

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
possible is always what I have said with

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.429 
possible is always what I have said with
fork<00:02:39.079> our<00:02:40.540> players<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.810> Ronaldo<00:02:42.129> give<00:02:43.129> a<00:02:44.439> lot

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
fork our players like Ronaldo give a lot

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:51.360 
fork our players like Ronaldo give a lot
of<00:02:45.469> extra<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:47.379> selection<00:02:48.379> or<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:49.159> a<00:02:49.189> team<00:02:49.689> and

of extra to selection or to a team and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.470 
of extra to selection or to a team and
but<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.549> don't<00:02:52.849> think<00:02:53.120> very<00:02:53.450> Amadeo<00:02:54.519> selling<00:02:55.519> of

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
but I don't think very Amadeo selling of

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.869 
but I don't think very Amadeo selling of
all<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.139> players<00:02:57.409> in<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:58.099> formation<00:02:58.609> that

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
all the players in the formation that

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.699 
all the players in the formation that
you<00:02:58.970> have<00:02:59.180> put<00:02:59.689> out<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.139> far<00:03:00.349> this<00:03:00.500> season

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
you have put out so far this season

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.490 
you have put out so far this season

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
suggest that matter is the one that

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.020 
suggest that matter is the one that
might<00:04:15.260> be<00:04:15.410> removed<00:04:15.710> to<00:04:16.370> fit<00:04:16.550> in<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.820> others

but does his recent record almost make

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.850 
but does his recent record almost make
him<00:04:20.210> one<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.930> first<00:04:21.170> players<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.680> might

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
him one of the first players you might

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.740 
him one of the first players you might
pretend<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:23.890> don't<00:04:24.890> think<00:04:25.490> any<00:04:26.030> player<00:04:26.330> is

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750
