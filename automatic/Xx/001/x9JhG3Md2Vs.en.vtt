00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.679 
really have a problem with tanks in them
but<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.880> objective<00:01:35.880> games<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.659> just

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
but in objective games they really just

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.850 
but in objective games they really just
don't<00:01:36.900> belong

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.220 

so<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.010> modern<00:01:44.340> warfare<00:01:44.370> 2<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.810> should<00:01:46.200> have

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
so in modern warfare 2 they should have

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.250 
so in modern warfare 2 they should have
no<00:01:46.860> tanks<00:01:47.400> no<00:01:47.700> vehicles<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.300> any<00:01:48.390> type<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.050> I

no tanks no vehicles of any type that I

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.460 
no tanks no vehicles of any type that I
know<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.820> unless<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.060> count<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.420> ac-130<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.440> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
know of unless you count the ac-130 as a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.250 
know of unless you count the ac-130 as a
vehicle<00:01:53.510> technically<00:01:54.510> you<00:01:54.750> won't<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.080> flying

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
vehicle technically you won't be flying

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:09.499 
vehicle technically you won't be flying
it<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.220> be<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.370> gunner<00:01:56.730> in<00:01:56.970> it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.410 

and<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.989> is<00:02:11.200> why<00:02:11.349> I<00:02:11.379> use<00:02:11.739> fireworks<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:13.000> get

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
and that is why I use fireworks to get

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:24.059 
and that is why I use fireworks to get
the<00:02:13.569> most<00:02:13.599> bang<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.590> buck<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:23.260> can<00:02:23.530> let

this<00:04:08.080> particular<00:04:08.470> moment<00:04:08.800> what<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.400> might

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
this particular moment what that might

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.150 
this particular moment what that might
be<00:04:12.030> if<00:04:13.030> i<00:04:13.120> had<00:04:13.300> to<00:04:13.450> guess<00:04:13.800> just<00:04:14.800> venture<00:04:15.130> a

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
be if i had to guess just venture a

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.830 
be if i had to guess just venture a
guess<00:04:15.250> right<00:04:15.760> now<00:04:15.819> i'm<00:04:16.269> going<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.540> make<00:04:16.720> an

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
guess right now i'm going to make an

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.449 
guess right now i'm going to make an
early<00:04:17.079> prediction<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.790> say<00:04:19.269> that<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.660> famas

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
early prediction and say that the famas

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.080 
early prediction and say that the famas
will<00:04:21.459> be<00:04:21.639> that<00:04:21.940> particular<00:04:22.270> weapon<00:04:22.630> i<00:04:24.090> think

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
will be that particular weapon i think

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.580 
will be that particular weapon i think

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
it's going to be you know a lot like the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:36.240 
it's going to be you know a lot like the
m16<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.919> all<00:04:30.550> doing<00:04:30.850> for<00:04:34.650> have<00:04:35.650> no<00:04:35.800> idea<00:04:36.070> why

it's<00:05:09.270> hard<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.690> say<00:05:09.780> yet<00:05:10.140> whether<00:05:10.350> that's

it's hard to say yet whether that's

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.070 
it's hard to say yet whether that's
going<00:05:11.100> to<00:05:11.160> give<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.490> more<00:05:11.790> ammo<00:05:12.600> in<00:05:12.810> your

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
going to give you more ammo in your

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.170 
going to give you more ammo in your
weapon<00:05:13.500> or<00:05:13.650> whether<00:05:14.520> it's<00:05:14.760> going<00:05:14.880> to<00:05:14.970> be<00:05:15.060> like

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
weapon or whether it's going to be like

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.080 
weapon or whether it's going to be like
bandolier<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.050> just<00:05:16.200> get<00:05:16.470> have<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:17.090> have

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
bandolier and just get have you have

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.060 
bandolier and just get have you have
more<00:05:18.330> ammo<00:05:18.570> on<00:05:18.870> your<00:05:19.110> person<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:19.830> can

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
more ammo on your person so you can

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.240 
more ammo on your person so you can
reload<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:21.380> tend<00:05:22.380> to<00:05:22.470> think<00:05:22.560> it's<00:05:22.980> going<00:05:23.190> to

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
reload I tend to think it's going to

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.990 
reload I tend to think it's going to
give<00:05:23.460> your<00:05:23.670> weapon<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.510> higher<00:05:24.720> ammo<00:05:25.170> capacity

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
give your weapon a higher ammo capacity

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.640 
give your weapon a higher ammo capacity
which<00:05:27.000> if<00:05:27.180> that<00:05:27.420> is<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.720> case<00:05:27.750> that<00:05:28.350> could

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
which if that is the case that could

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.370 
which if that is the case that could
lead<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.370> some<00:05:30.060> weapons<00:05:30.480> being<00:05:30.750> overpowered

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
lead to some weapons being overpowered

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.770 
lead to some weapons being overpowered
much<00:05:31.620> like<00:05:31.860> mp40<00:05:32.640> is<00:05:32.760> now<00:05:33.030> in<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.450> world<00:05:33.600> of
