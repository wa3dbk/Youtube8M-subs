 everything you have to know about 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.760
 steven universe 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.020

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.180
 very dark brown almost black takes a 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.549
 pink shirt with a yellow star 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.920
 in the front and also carries 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.980
 some pants apparently blue jeans 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.990
 and sandals roses its gem is a quartz 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.680
 pink that he has inherited from his mother in the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.529
 which is located in your navel is very 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.269
 cheerful optimist and very affectionate has a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.160
 great love for music by which he 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.769
 love to sing and apparently its 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.629
 instrument is the ukulele enjoys a lot 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.330
 of the adventures and want to learn to 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:44.210
 use your powers to become strong and 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.210
 save the world accompanied by the written 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.479
 steven is the fruit of the love of gredos 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.210
 universe and rose quartz but currently 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.220
 he only owns his father since his mother 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.619
 he had to give up his physical form 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.140
 to be able to bring it to the world to him since 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:05.479
 apparently they could not both be in the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.479
 same time we go we can not exist 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.530
 steven will much affect failure 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.830
 have a mother 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.030
 he is happy since the headquarters take care of him 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 also that he always has adventures 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.680
 accompanied by them age change 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.479
 in the episode too many birthdays are 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.909
 can see that steven can change 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.570
 age depending on the emotional state and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.170
 maturity that has healing saliva in the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.690
 episode 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.460
 an indirect kiss is known to share 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.430
 an ability with his mother that is the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.979
 cure but difference rose that she 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.979
 can heal with that tears that bubble 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.380
 protective this skill is the most 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.240
 used by steven to invoke a bubble 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.990
 magical capable of protecting from danger 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.369
 like projectiles or natural disasters 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.069
 this ability could be seen in many 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.229
 episodes friends of bubbles the lion 2 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.259
 the movie adventures on the island and the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.630
 gem of the ocean second part besides that 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.000
 this bubble may increase according to the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.880
 size that he wants although not yet what 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.220
 perfectly dominates the shield of the rose 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.470
 this shield apparently also can 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.830
 throwing Captain America style which 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.500
 be 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.900
 attacks over long distances to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.300
 look like the rose shield is much more 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.790
 strong or much stronger than the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.480
 bubble shield this proven in many 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.820
 of sentinel episodes can do 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.760
 that the plants come to life and protect it 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.090
 and apparently these plants are very much 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.430
 stronger than normal gems 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.460
 even more than the james crystals and 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.060
 also without forgetting the clear fusion 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.060
 this bonus 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.890
 the second name of steven is quartz and 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.829
 his surname is universe apparently not 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.310
 has a second name in breakfast 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.379
 together 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.079
 Steven seems to be surprisingly more 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.780
 strong since he was able to defeat the 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.319
 Mutant breakfast without need or help 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.780
 of the buds is the only crystal gem 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.889
 that does have a gender confirmed by the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.780
 same creator in the USA the voice is made 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.680
 for a man instead in america 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.659
 latina for a woman and in Spain too 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.689
 his powers are based on depending since 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.120
 in some appearances is a shield the 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.579
 Steven's signature is his name and some 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.189
 stars which is a very firm 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.280
 curious the only minor appearances 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.169
 what Steven did up to now are the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.569
 Garnett universe and history 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.939
 similar is shown in the episode 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.040
 adventures on the island that steven does not know 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.230
 really the concept of privacy does not 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.459
 you know what is prima tub or people 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.470
 come in and out of my room all the 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.510
 time in the trailer episode 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.319
 haunted uncle staples can be 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.950
 observe yet 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.930
 is very similar to steve stevens is the one 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.299
 he has more friends in the whole beach city 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.620
 since he knows the names of each of 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.569
 the inhabitants 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.489
 in the fugitive episode it is shown that 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.609
 steven knows how to invoke his bubble shield 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.030
 but although it is not known or unknown 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.889
 how did he learn to invoke him in the 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.039
 episode a story for steven it 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.139
 reveals that his shirt with a star is a 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.940
 promotional clothing of the concerts that 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.310
 they gave great universe when I was young 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.660
 one of the great mysteries is also 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.320
 how is it that steven knows the program 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.360
 There are theories about that maybe there 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.520
 seen one of those programs 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.860
 stevens and can travel through the portals 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.590
 on your own and in gem shine 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.670
 steven for the first time can invoke his 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.590
 weapon 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.720
 steven is the only gem he needs 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.170
 breathe and eat this on the part of the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.330
 half human that is the in the episode 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.730
 uncle grampa it is discovered that the mister gos 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.640
 you will know about the crystal gems a 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.670
 theory is that he has seen before 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.690
 they crossing their dimension 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.880
 remember that the portals of the 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.010
 keys also travel by dimensions and 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.010
 maybe it 's Mr. 2 and he looked at them before 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.220
 although uncle grampa never knew 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.380
 steven in person knew very well his 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.900
 first name 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:28.410
 before helping this event because it helped 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.410
 finally the human and then I followed Clarence 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.730
 since steven and connie merged 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.710
 and they created this pretty unofficial name 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.140
 began to come out several theories about 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.480
 the requirements to achieve the merger to 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.700
 seem the minimum requirements are that 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.550
 one of the members has a gem and 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.020
 that have a true coordination 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.240
 although it is said that steven is half 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.490
 human and half bud does not mean that your 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.700
 body is composed of 50% human and 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.090
 50% gto is just a way of saying 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.400
 that Steven is a human and a gem in the 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.550
 indirect kiss episode there are parts in the 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.600
 that Amethyst speaks very strangely 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.490
 really the message he gives in those 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.450
 moments are understandable thanks to the 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.520
 magic of the edition 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.250
 next you will see the parts 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.110
 originals and then the edited parts and 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.830
 so you will hear the message you leave in 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.830
 these moments 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.659
 and to dawn wide video that is a 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.659
 wonder 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.930
 maybe there's an entrance here 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.990
 the same 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:49.990
 you posted height you have to cry or 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:51.840
 scream if your body does not want 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.160
 single 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.160
 the big the fissure 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.310
 finally I want to show you a 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.310
 video 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:22.749
