00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.409
 go 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.000

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.860
 leinster players with shane 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.100

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.500
 there is little to return but this 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.239
 time with fronts like 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.060
 third lines and that then allows 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.489
 to deliberate outdoor spaces yes that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.230
 smells good double and good the rebound and 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.670
