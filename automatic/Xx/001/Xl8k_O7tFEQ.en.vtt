00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
shoulder length so you know that he's

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.120 
shoulder length so you know that he's
not<00:02:01.510> growing<00:02:01.900> them<00:02:02.229> for<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.590> length<00:02:02.860> he's

just kind of keeping them at the same so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.639 
just kind of keeping them at the same so
that<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.640> continues<00:02:06.880> his<00:02:07.450> look

an original you read a head in that in

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.509 
an original you read a head in that in
that<00:02:40.620> sense<00:02:42.739> looking<00:02:43.739> at<00:02:43.919> a<00:02:43.950> picture<00:02:44.159> his

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
that sense looking at a picture his

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.640 
that sense looking at a picture his
brother<00:02:44.849> also<00:02:46.549> had<00:02:47.549> locks<00:02:48.200> nut<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.409> was<00:02:49.560> his

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
brother also had locks nut that was his

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.870 
brother also had locks nut that was his
brother<00:02:49.889> I<00:02:49.980> believe

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.150 

but<00:02:56.480> most<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.810> times<00:02:56.990> waka<00:02:57.290> flocka<00:02:57.560> few<00:02:58.010> will

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
but most of times waka flocka few will

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.120 
but most of times waka flocka few will
have<00:02:58.190> his<00:02:58.700> head<00:02:58.970> his<00:02:59.510> locks<00:02:59.900> tied<00:03:00.350> back<00:03:00.770> like

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
have his head his locks tied back like

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.900 
have his head his locks tied back like
so

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
so

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.060 
so
check<00:03:02.480> out<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.780> thinning<00:03:03.260> going<00:03:03.650> on<00:03:03.770> over

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
check out the thinning going on over

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.950 
check out the thinning going on over
here<00:03:04.430> it's<00:03:04.610> really<00:03:05.120> thin<00:03:05.360> at<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.660> point

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
here it's really thin at that point

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.450 
here it's really thin at that point
really<00:03:06.830> thick<00:03:07.310> here<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.950> course<00:03:13.220> this<00:03:13.340> is

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
really thick here and of course this is

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.760 
really thick here and of course this is
when<00:03:13.610> his<00:03:13.730> hair<00:03:13.940> was<00:03:14.090> shorter<00:03:14.690> usually<00:03:15.620> his

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
when his hair was shorter usually his

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.010 
when his hair was shorter usually his
hair<00:03:15.980> was<00:03:16.100> at<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:16.400> length<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:17.210> now<00:03:17.720> we<00:03:17.780> can

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
hair was at this length but now we can

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.000 
hair was at this length but now we can
see<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.350> it's<00:03:18.740> grown<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.460> little<00:03:20.390> bit<00:03:20.660> longer

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
see that it's grown a little bit longer

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.920 
see that it's grown a little bit longer
but<00:03:22.010> we<00:03:22.100> never<00:03:22.340> really<00:03:22.640> see<00:03:22.910> waka<00:03:23.150> flocka<00:03:23.450> with

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930
