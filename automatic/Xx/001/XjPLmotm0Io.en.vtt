of<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.550> track<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:57.789> I've<00:00:58.059> currently

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
of the track that I've currently

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.810 
of the track that I've currently
constructed<00:00:59.079> basically<00:00:59.679> the<00:01:00.429> way<00:01:00.519> it's<00:01:00.670> made

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
constructed basically the way it's made

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.000 
constructed basically the way it's made
is<00:01:00.879> by<00:01:01.149> laying<00:01:01.359> down<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.629> 2x2<00:01:02.109> square<00:01:02.590> of<00:01:02.710> track

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
is by laying down a 2x2 square of track

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.890 
is by laying down a 2x2 square of track
and<00:01:03.309> then<00:01:03.489> placing<00:01:03.910> a<00:01:03.969> couple<00:01:04.150> mine<00:01:04.420> carts<00:01:04.780> on

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
and then placing a couple mine carts on

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.420 
and then placing a couple mine carts on
it<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:05.229> don't<00:01:05.770> know<00:01:05.920> if<00:01:06.009> any<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.369> ever

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
it I don't know if any of you ever

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.010 
it I don't know if any of you ever
played<00:01:06.820> with<00:01:07.000> Hot<00:01:07.180> Wheels<00:01:07.390> as<00:01:07.630> little<00:01:07.840> kids

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
played with Hot Wheels as little kids

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.770 
played with Hot Wheels as little kids
but<00:01:08.290> I<00:01:08.710> know<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:09.189> certainly<00:01:09.460> did<00:01:09.939> but<00:01:10.150> this

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
but I know I certainly did but this

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.660 
but I know I certainly did but this
basically<00:01:11.140> works<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.710> exact<00:01:12.040> same<00:01:12.250> way<00:01:12.310> as

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
basically works in the exact same way as

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.840 
basically works in the exact same way as
those<00:01:13.509> little<00:01:13.869> two<00:01:14.290> wheels<00:01:14.619> spinning<00:01:15.369> Hot

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
those little two wheels spinning Hot

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.700 
those little two wheels spinning Hot
Wheel<00:01:16.119> accelerator<00:01:16.900> things<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:17.590> would

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
Wheel accelerator things that would

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.830 
Wheel accelerator things that would
allow<00:01:17.950> for<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.610> little<00:01:18.880> Hot<00:01:19.060> Wheel<00:01:19.240> cars<00:01:19.570> to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
allow for the little Hot Wheel cars to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.260 
allow for the little Hot Wheel cars to
get<00:01:20.110> sent<00:01:20.409> around<00:01:20.619> loops<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.340> whatnot<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
get sent around loops and whatnot the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.700 
get sent around loops and whatnot the
only<00:01:22.479> trick<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.900> is<00:01:23.049> making<00:01:23.290> sure<00:01:23.409> the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
only trick to it is making sure the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.020 
only trick to it is making sure the
carts<00:01:24.040> spinning<00:01:24.579> in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.759> right<00:01:24.880> direction

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
carts spinning in the right direction

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.600 
carts spinning in the right direction
which<00:01:25.479> is<00:01:25.659> pretty<00:01:26.380> easy<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.799> see<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.189> correct

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
which is pretty easy to see and correct

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.480 
which is pretty easy to see and correct
if<00:01:28.060> necessary<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:29.829> that<00:01:30.040> we've<00:01:30.189> gotten<00:01:30.369> that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
if necessary now that we've gotten that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.420 
if necessary now that we've gotten that
the<00:01:31.360> way<00:01:31.540> however<00:01:31.810> this<00:01:32.500> coaster<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.070> not<00:01:33.250> yet

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
the way however this coaster is not yet
