cats a good really interesting thing but

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.020 
cats a good really interesting thing but
it's<00:00:41.219> been<00:00:41.370> pointed<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it's been pointed out that's a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.910 
it's been pointed out that's a
particular<00:00:42.780> vertical<00:00:43.079> which<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.620> kind<00:00:43.860> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
particular vertical which is kind of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
particular vertical which is kind of
real-time<00:00:44.870> live<00:00:45.870> streaming<00:00:46.940> no<00:00:47.940> saving<00:00:48.570> you

real-time live streaming no saving you
know<00:00:48.989> impermanent<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.120> thinking<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.719> for

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
know impermanent but I'm thinking as for

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.319 
know impermanent but I'm thinking as for
instance<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.129> got<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> big<00:00:53.460> vacation<00:00:53.640> coming<00:00:54.090> up

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
instance we got a big vacation coming up

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.830 
instance we got a big vacation coming up
and<00:00:54.539> Jade<00:00:55.379> July<00:00:55.710> we're<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.690> Holland<00:00:57.690> in

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and Jade July we're going to Holland in

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.430 
and Jade July we're going to Holland in
Germany<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.440> Austria<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.340> Hungary<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.350> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
Germany and Austria and Hungary and I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
Germany and Austria and Hungary and I
thought<00:01:01.590> it'd<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.010> cool<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.570> able

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
thought it'd be kind of cool to be able

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.719 
thought it'd be kind of cool to be able
to<00:01:04.280> live<00:01:05.280> stream<00:01:05.880> everyday<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> little<00:01:07.439> bit

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
to live stream everyday for a little bit

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
to live stream everyday for a little bit
show<00:01:08.729> where<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> am<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.020> save<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
show where I am and and save it as a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.080 
show where I am and and save it as a
photo<00:01:11.010> album<00:01:11.189> instead<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.580> having<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> be

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
photo album instead of having it be

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.530 
photo album instead of having it be
ephemeral<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.640> seems<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.090> way<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> do

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
ephemeral so this seems like a way to do

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.749 
ephemeral so this seems like a way to do
it<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> streams<00:01:16.110> live<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.590> youtube<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.400> YouTube

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it it streams live to youtube if YouTube

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
it it streams live to youtube if YouTube
still<00:01:18.000> allows<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.479> I'm<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.409> they've

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
still allows that I'm I know they've

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
still allows that I'm I know they've
changed<00:01:19.920> youtube<00:01:20.430> live<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
changed youtube live so that's one of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.640 
changed youtube live so that's one of
the<00:01:21.720> reasons<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.080> doing<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.350> experiment

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the reasons I'm doing this experiment

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.240 
the reasons I'm doing this experiment
right<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.369> also<00:01:24.500> then<00:01:25.500> saves<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.950> later

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
right now but also then saves it later

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.390 
right now but also then saves it later
as<00:01:26.960> upenn<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.530> too<00:01:28.829> leo

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
as upenn if you go to you too leo

as upenn if you go to you too leo
laporte<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.880> youtube<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.570> live

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
laporte on youtube to see my live

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.499 
laporte on youtube to see my live
streams<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> past<00:01:32.490> using<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> HTC<00:01:33.329> re

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
streams from the past using the HTC re

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.359 
streams from the past using the HTC re
so<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.380> would<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.799> cool<00:01:35.040> now<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so this would be really cool now the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.760 
so this would be really cool now the
read<00:01:35.610> self<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.270> very<00:01:36.450> big<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.960> guess<00:01:37.619> I'd

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
read self is not very big I guess I'd

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.490 
read self is not very big I guess I'd
need<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> mirror<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> show<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.350> what<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.439> looks

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
need a mirror to show you what it looks

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.179 
need a mirror to show you what it looks
like<00:01:41.450> it's<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.049> little<00:01:43.259> periscope

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
like it's just it's a little periscope

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.670 
like it's just it's a little periscope
thing<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:45.659> easy<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> carry<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.409> pocket

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
thing so it's easy to carry in my pocket

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.060 
thing so it's easy to carry in my pocket
it's<00:01:47.490> battery-powered<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:49.470> does<00:01:49.649> tie<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it's battery-powered it does tie to the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.999 
it's battery-powered it does tie to the
phone<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.810> use<00:01:51.810> my<00:01:51.840> smartphone<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.770> see

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
phone so I can use my smartphone to see

phone so I can use my smartphone to see
the<00:01:53.250> shot<00:01:53.490> which<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:55.040> similar<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
the shot which is kind of similar to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
couple of things what the twitter

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.550 
couple of things what the twitter
message<00:02:23.640> looks<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.060> from<00:02:24.870> twitter<00:02:25.140> mail<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
I can I guess customize that and then

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.330 
I can I guess customize that and then
what<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.470> YouTube<00:02:28.770> video<00:02:28.890> looks<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.430> so
