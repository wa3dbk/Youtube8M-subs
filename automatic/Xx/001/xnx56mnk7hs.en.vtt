00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
see that this man has obviously been

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.900 
see that this man has obviously been
killed<00:02:14.780> by<00:02:14.930> something<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.520> important

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
killed by something but the important

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.360 
killed by something but the important
part<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.750> he's<00:02:18.170> holding<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.010> letter<00:02:19.250> in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
part is that he's holding this letter in

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.509 
part is that he's holding this letter in
his<00:02:19.459> hand<00:02:19.519> most<00:02:20.420> likely<00:02:20.689> this<00:02:21.650> letter<00:02:22.159> is<00:02:22.370> of

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
his hand most likely this letter is of

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.190 
his hand most likely this letter is of
some<00:02:22.670> kind<00:02:22.819> of<00:02:22.939> significance

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
some kind of significance

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.830 
some kind of significance
it's<00:02:24.620> possible<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.209> either<00:02:26.390> who<00:02:26.690> he

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
it's possible that this is either who he

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.990 
it's possible that this is either who he
was<00:02:26.989> going<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.319> assassinate<00:02:28.069> or<00:02:28.280> he<00:02:28.819> could

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
was going to assassinate or he could

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.880 
was going to assassinate or he could
this<00:02:29.150> could<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.690> random<00:02:29.959> encounter<00:02:30.470> but<00:02:30.680> I

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
this could be a random encounter but I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.009 
this could be a random encounter but I
think<00:02:31.730> it's<00:02:31.819> probably<00:02:32.150> pretty<00:02:32.629> clear<00:02:32.989> that

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
think it's probably pretty clear that

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.600 
think it's probably pretty clear that
this<00:02:33.260> letter<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.709> probably<00:02:34.040> going<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.250> be<00:02:34.370> in

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
this letter is probably going to be in

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.690 
this letter is probably going to be in
some<00:02:35.000> way<00:02:35.150> significant<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.319> game<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.580> as

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
some way significant to the game so as

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.009 
some way significant to the game so as
the<00:02:37.790> trailer<00:02:37.970> starts<00:02:38.269> up<00:02:38.450> again<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:38.989> see

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
the trailer starts up again we can see

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.350

Connor<00:02:39.440> being<00:02:39.800> attacked<00:02:40.129> by<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.370> bear<00:02:40.730> which<00:02:41.180> is

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
Connor being attacked by a bear which is

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.140 
Connor being attacked by a bear which is
a<00:02:41.390> very<00:02:41.900> scary<00:02:42.319> thing<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:43.370> if<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:43.819> stop<00:02:44.000> it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
a very scary thing and if we stop it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.540 
a very scary thing and if we stop it
right<00:02:44.269> here<00:02:44.569> we<00:02:44.720> can<00:02:44.900> see<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.980> Connor<00:02:46.280> is

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
right here we can see that Connor is

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.120 
right here we can see that Connor is
with<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:46.880> British<00:02:47.239> soldier<00:02:47.680> not<00:02:48.680> exactly<00:02:48.860> who

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
with a British soldier not exactly who

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.800 
with a British soldier not exactly who
this<00:02:49.459> character<00:02:49.700> we're<00:02:50.420> not<00:02:50.510> exactly<00:02:50.599> sure

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
this character we're not exactly sure

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.320 
this character we're not exactly sure
who<00:02:51.019> this<00:02:51.110> character<00:02:51.319> is<00:02:52.090> one<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.209> the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
who this character is one of the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.240 
who this character is one of the
theories<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:53.989> have<00:02:54.140> here<00:02:54.319> VG<00:02:54.650> utopia<00:02:55.160> is

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
theories that we have here VG utopia is

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.150 
theories that we have here VG utopia is
that<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.819> Benedict<00:02:56.599> Arnold<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.680> we're

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
that this is Benedict Arnold but we're

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.220 
that this is Benedict Arnold but we're
not<00:02:58.250> one<00:02:58.340> hundred<00:02:58.370> percent<00:02:58.580> sure<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.230> so

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
not one hundred percent sure on that so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.380 
not one hundred percent sure on that so
you<00:03:00.830> know<00:03:00.920> take<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.280> for<00:03:01.459> what<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.819> but<00:03:02.120> it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
you know take that for what it is but it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.729 
you know take that for what it is but it
looks<00:03:02.420> like<00:03:02.660> he's<00:03:02.780> definitely<00:03:02.930> some<00:03:03.440> kind<00:03:03.470> of

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
looks like he's definitely some kind of

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.360 
looks like he's definitely some kind of
significant<00:03:04.310> character<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.160> trailer

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
significant character so as the trailer

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.830 
significant character so as the trailer
continues<00:03:07.790> we<00:03:07.910> can<00:03:08.030> see<00:03:08.180> more<00:03:08.420> large-scale

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
continues we can see more large-scale

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.289 
continues we can see more large-scale
battles<00:03:09.290> going<00:03:09.739> on<00:03:10.720> power<00:03:11.720> more<00:03:13.150> British<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
battles going on power more British and

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.390 
battles going on power more British and
Americans<00:03:14.720> going<00:03:15.440> at<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.980> we<00:03:16.069> stop<00:03:16.250> it

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
Americans going at it if we stop it

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.300 
Americans going at it if we stop it
right<00:03:16.519> here<00:03:16.790> we<00:03:17.630> can<00:03:17.780> see<00:03:17.959> Connor<00:03:18.220> climbing<00:03:19.220> a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
right here we can see Connor climbing a

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.940 
right here we can see Connor climbing a
rock<00:03:19.489> face<00:03:19.880> here<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.440> significant

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
rock face here and this is significant

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.250 
rock face here and this is significant
simply<00:03:22.220> because<00:03:22.549> it's<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.209> new<00:03:23.239> thing<00:03:24.079> that's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
simply because it's a new thing that's

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.870 
simply because it's a new thing that's
going<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.410> be<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.709> game<00:03:24.890> Connor<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.760> going

get better vantage points it's going to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.819 
get better vantage points it's going to
be<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.459> similar<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.569> climbing<00:03:33.290> buildings<00:03:33.500> in

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
probably a replacement for that but

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.479 
probably a replacement for that but
