know<00:02:44.290> multiple<00:02:45.160> versions<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.730> each<00:02:45.910> piece<00:02:46.569> of

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
know multiple versions of each piece of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.479 
know multiple versions of each piece of
art<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.350> probably<00:02:47.890> will<00:02:48.100> want<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.310> keep

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
art like you probably will want to keep

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.880 
art like you probably will want to keep
your<00:02:48.730> basic<00:02:49.299> initial<00:02:49.810> outline<00:02:50.530> sketches<00:02:52.890> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
your basic initial outline sketches so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.680 
your basic initial outline sketches so
yeah<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.069> hope<00:02:54.160> that's<00:02:54.489> improved<00:02:55.269> at<00:02:55.450> some

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
yeah I hope that's improved at some

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.780 
yeah I hope that's improved at some
point<00:02:58.200> there's<00:02:59.200> also<00:02:59.349> these<00:02:59.590> two<00:02:59.950> menu

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
point there's also these two menu

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.520 
point there's also these two menu
options<00:03:01.239> here<00:03:01.750> as<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.019> can<00:03:02.080> see<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
options here as you can see on the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.539 
options here as you can see on the
gamepad<00:03:02.769> for<00:03:03.420> lessons<00:03:04.420> which<00:03:04.630> are<00:03:04.810> presumably

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
gamepad for lessons which are presumably

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.339 
gamepad for lessons which are presumably
tutorials<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.910> lessons<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.989> how<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.459> draw

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
tutorials and lessons of how to draw

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.660 
tutorials and lessons of how to draw
create<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:12.430> gallery<00:03:12.849> which<00:03:13.209> I'm<00:03:14.130> guessing<00:03:15.130> is

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
create and gallery which I'm guessing is

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.630 
create and gallery which I'm guessing is
probably<00:03:16.350> some<00:03:17.350> function<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.280> lets<00:03:18.430> you

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
probably some function that lets you

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.599 
probably some function that lets you
look<00:03:18.850> through<00:03:19.090> your<00:03:19.150> friends<00:03:19.510> or<00:03:19.959> other<00:03:20.769> you

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
look through your friends or other you

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.729 
look through your friends or other you

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
know posts on the miiverse creations

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.640 
know posts on the miiverse creations
they're<00:03:24.600> not<00:03:25.600> sure<00:03:25.780> interno<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.470> said

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
they're not sure interno have said

they're not sure interno have said
anything<00:03:26.920> about<00:03:27.160> when<00:03:27.400> they're<00:03:27.549> coming<00:03:27.850> soon

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
anything about when they're coming soon

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.090 
anything about when they're coming soon
if<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:28.540> will<00:03:28.690> be<00:03:28.810> coming<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.319> an<00:03:29.410> update<00:03:29.530> or<00:03:29.980> if

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
if it will be coming in an update or if

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.090 
if it will be coming in an update or if
it<00:03:30.220> would<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.430> paid<00:03:30.670> DLC<00:03:31.269> but<00:03:31.920> hopefully<00:03:32.920> we'll

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
it would be paid DLC but hopefully we'll

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.349 
it would be paid DLC but hopefully we'll
know<00:03:33.130> something<00:03:33.660> on<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:35.019> soon<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:37.120> instead

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
know something on that soon so instead

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.449 
know something on that soon so instead
of<00:03:37.510> spending<00:03:38.079> hours<00:03:38.380> watching<00:03:38.620> me<00:03:38.920> make

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
of spending hours watching me make

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.910 
of spending hours watching me make
half-decent<00:03:40.359> creation<00:03:41.109> we're<00:03:41.769> going<00:03:41.859> to

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
half-decent creation we're going to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.520 
half-decent creation we're going to
watch<00:03:42.069> a<00:03:42.160> time-lapse<00:03:42.700> video<00:03:43.120> here<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.660> one<00:03:44.440> of

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
watch a time-lapse video here of one of

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.349 
watch a time-lapse video here of one of
my<00:03:45.690> efforts<00:03:46.690> from<00:03:47.019> earlier<00:03:47.380> today<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:49.000> this

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
my efforts from earlier today and this

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.460 
my efforts from earlier today and this
is<00:03:49.480> pretty<00:03:49.840> rough<00:03:50.639> even<00:03:51.639> by<00:03:51.940> my<00:03:52.120> standards

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
is pretty rough even by my standards

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.789 
is pretty rough even by my standards
it's<00:03:53.470> pretty<00:03:53.739> hard<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:55.049> draw<00:03:56.049> on<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.410> gamepad

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
it's pretty hard to draw on the gamepad

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.590 
it's pretty hard to draw on the gamepad
when<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.400> have<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.700> have<00:03:57.819> the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
when you have to have the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:19.210 
when you have to have the
camera<00:03:59.020> set<00:03:59.290> up<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.890> see<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.460> screen

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.659 

let's<00:04:20.220> go<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.519> look<00:04:20.639> at<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:22.190> post<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.460> and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
let's go and look at that post it and

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.960 
let's go and look at that post it and
have<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.360> quick<00:04:24.630> look<00:04:24.660> at<00:04:24.930> some<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.199> the<00:04:25.350> other

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
have a quick look at some of the other

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.060 
have a quick look at some of the other
creations<00:04:26.970> I've<00:04:27.090> made<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.330> bit<00:04:28.139> better<00:04:28.290> which

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
creations I've made a bit better which

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.710 
creations I've made a bit better which
will<00:04:29.220> hopefully<00:04:29.370> give<00:04:29.790> you<00:04:29.880> an<00:04:29.970> idea<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.360> how

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
will hopefully give you an idea of how

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.219 
will hopefully give you an idea of how
powerful<00:04:31.380> tools<00:04:31.860> can<00:04:32.220> be<00:04:32.250> in<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.660> right<00:04:33.810> hands

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
powerful tools can be in the right hands

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.550 
powerful tools can be in the right hands
so<00:04:34.830> there<00:04:34.979> you<00:04:35.130> go<00:04:36.110> there's<00:04:37.110> my<00:04:37.260> kind<00:04:37.470> of

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
so there you go there's my kind of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.719 
so there you go there's my kind of
rubbish<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:38.070> blurry<00:04:38.699> Kirby

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.379 

and<00:04:44.229> here's<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.319> much<00:04:46.039> better<00:04:46.580> version<00:04:47.089> I<00:04:47.180> made

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
and here's a much better version I made

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.709 
and here's a much better version I made
with<00:04:47.569> pastels<00:04:48.080> off<00:04:48.409> camera<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.449> prove

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:50.719 
with pastels off camera just to prove

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.379 
with pastels off camera just to prove
that<00:04:51.110> my<00:04:51.740> drawing<00:04:52.279> level<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.669> better<00:04:53.180> than

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
that my drawing level is better than

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.829 
that my drawing level is better than
their<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:53.960> each<00:04:54.080> ten-year-old<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.419> app<00:04:56.569> is

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:56.839 
their of each ten-year-old so the app is

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.499 
their of each ten-year-old so the app is
available<00:04:56.990> on<00:04:57.529> the<00:04:57.889> eshop<00:04:58.550> for<00:04:58.969> I<00:04:59.240> believe

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
available on the eshop for I believe

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.469 
available on the eshop for I believe
it's<00:04:59.719> 349<00:05:00.710> which<00:05:01.129> I<00:05:01.249> think's<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.729> very<00:05:02.270> good

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
it's 349 which I think's a very good

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.679 
it's 349 which I think's a very good
price<00:05:02.719> Nintendo<00:05:03.849> not<00:05:04.849> usually<00:05:05.509> one<00:05:05.629> for

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:05.689 
price Nintendo not usually one for

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.779 
price Nintendo not usually one for
reasonably<00:05:06.409> priced<00:05:07.330> downloads<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:09.669> you<00:05:10.669> know

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
reasonably priced downloads so you know

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.850 
reasonably priced downloads so you know
I<00:05:11.029> think<00:05:11.360> that's<00:05:11.659> quite<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:12.020> bargain<00:05:12.259> if<00:05:12.650> you're

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
I think that's quite a bargain if you're

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.129 
I think that's quite a bargain if you're
an<00:05:13.520> artist<00:05:13.909> who<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.240> likely<00:05:14.629> to<00:05:14.719> get<00:05:14.900> a<00:05:14.960> lot<00:05:15.110> of

an artist who is likely to get a lot of

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.369 
an artist who is likely to get a lot of
use<00:05:15.259> out<00:05:16.099> of<00:05:16.159> it<00:05:18.039> yes<00:05:19.039> if<00:05:19.399> you<00:05:19.779> are<00:05:20.779> making<00:05:21.139> any
