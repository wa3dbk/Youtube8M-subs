00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
stay true to that and then also just

flowed<00:00:53.170> from<00:00:53.699> gameplay<00:00:54.699> to<00:00:55.260> cutscene<00:00:56.260> and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
flowed from gameplay to cutscene and

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.979 
flowed from gameplay to cutscene and

somebody<00:01:05.530> with<00:01:05.620> them<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.720> know<00:01:07.810> just<00:01:08.049> a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
somebody with them so you know just a

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.050 
somebody with them so you know just a
lot<00:01:08.260> of<00:01:08.290> planning<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.680> make<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:09.070> make<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.670> feel

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
lot of planning to make it make it feel

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.080 
lot of planning to make it make it feel
like<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:11.290> never<00:01:11.590> know<00:01:12.100> what<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.730> know<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:12.880> mean

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
like you never know what you know I mean

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.600 
like you never know what you know I mean
what's<00:01:13.770> what's<00:01:14.770> gonna<00:01:14.920> happen<00:01:15.250> next<00:01:15.430> if

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
what's what's gonna happen next if

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.280 
what's what's gonna happen next if
you're<00:01:15.760> watching<00:01:15.910> assume<00:01:16.360> this<00:01:16.870> when<00:01:17.170> the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
you're watching assume this when the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.080 
you're watching assume this when the
action<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:17.620> gonna<00:01:17.800> kick<00:01:18.040> off<00:01:18.220> III<00:01:18.550> think<00:01:18.880> that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
action is gonna kick off III think that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.040 
action is gonna kick off III think that
I<00:01:19.270> think<00:01:19.660> setting<00:01:20.440> in<00:01:20.590> South<00:01:20.860> America<00:01:21.220> has<00:01:21.400> has

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
I think setting in South America has has

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.500 
I think setting in South America has has
added<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.140> bit<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.440> what<00:01:23.620> we<00:01:23.740> what<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.390> know

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
added a bit to what we what you know

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.910 
added a bit to what we what you know
what<00:01:25.660> we're<00:01:25.780> drawing<00:01:26.050> on<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:26.470> terms<00:01:26.680> of

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
what we're drawing on in terms of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.760 
what we're drawing on in terms of
cinematic<00:01:27.640> influence<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.990> leak<00:01:29.170> squad<00:01:29.500> was<00:01:29.740> a

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
cinematic influence the leak squad was a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.590 
cinematic influence the leak squad was a
movie<00:01:30.040> that<00:01:30.070> we<00:01:30.250> really<00:01:30.520> loved<00:01:30.730> and<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.510> know

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
movie that we really loved and you know

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.880 
movie that we really loved and you know
just<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.900> setting<00:01:32.140> itself<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.770> very

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
just the setting itself is very

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.200 
just the setting itself is very
different<00:01:33.370> you<00:01:33.490> know<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.640> lot<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.820> people<00:01:34.120> are

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
different you know a lot of people are

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.270 
different you know a lot of people are
sort<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.500> noting<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.620> it's<00:01:35.800> it's<00:01:36.190> a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
sort of noting that it's it's a

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.160 
sort of noting that it's it's a
different<00:01:36.310> different<00:01:37.240> setting<00:01:37.930> than<00:01:37.960> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
different different setting than the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.040 
different different setting than the
sort<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.470> bleak<00:01:39.000> rainy<00:01:40.000> snowy<00:01:40.420> streets<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.930> New

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
sort of bleak rainy snowy streets of New

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.380 
sort of bleak rainy snowy streets of New
York<00:01:41.260> so<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:42.430> doesn't<00:01:42.700> mean<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:43.000> can't<00:01:43.030> be<00:01:43.360> a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
York so that doesn't mean it can't be a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.960 
York so that doesn't mean it can't be a
noir<00:01:44.610> story<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.940> just<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.960> just<00:01:47.020> means<00:01:47.500> there's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
noir story it just it just means there's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.710 
noir story it just it just means there's
there's<00:01:48.970> more<00:01:49.120> variety<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:50.410> still<00:01:51.280> have

can sort of zoom in a bit closer and aim

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.820 
can sort of zoom in a bit closer and aim
more<00:02:10.119> precisely<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.810> your<00:02:10.989> target<00:02:11.530> at<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
more precisely on your target at the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.009 
more precisely on your target at the
expense<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.370> your<00:02:13.269> ability<00:02:13.629> to<00:02:13.659> move<00:02:13.900> around

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
expense of your ability to move around

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.330 
expense of your ability to move around
quick

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
quick

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.930 
quick
so<00:02:15.760> we<00:02:15.849> added<00:02:16.239> that<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.830> we've<00:02:17.980> added<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.459> cover

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
so we added that and we've added a cover

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.820 
so we added that and we've added a cover
mechanic<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.569> those<00:02:19.750> are<00:02:19.989> ancillary

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
mechanic but those are ancillary

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.880 
mechanic but those are ancillary
additions<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.260> core<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.739> game

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
additions to to the the core of the game

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.890 
additions to to the the core of the game
which<00:02:24.099> is<00:02:24.129> still<00:02:24.459> very<00:02:24.580> much<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.150> run-and-gun

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
which is still very much the run-and-gun

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.020 
which is still very much the run-and-gun
well<00:02:26.530> as<00:02:26.620> far<00:02:26.800> as<00:02:26.890> euphoria<00:02:27.340> its<00:02:27.700> it's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
well as far as euphoria its it's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.110 
well as far as euphoria its it's
basically<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.450> set<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:29.340> behaviors<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.730> you

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
basically a set of behaviors that you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.640 
basically a set of behaviors that you
can<00:02:31.620> tune<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:33.819> really<00:02:34.470> how<00:02:35.470> much

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
can tune and so it's really how much

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.960 
can tune and so it's really how much
effort<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:37.209> put<00:02:37.510> into<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.459> with<00:02:39.670> max

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
effort you you put into that so with max

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.190 
effort you you put into that so with max
we<00:02:40.599> put<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> lot<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.440> effort<00:02:41.769> into<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
we put a lot of effort into the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.740 
we put a lot of effort into the
different<00:02:44.500> aspects<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.069> of<00:02:46.030> euphoria<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.569> how

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
different aspects of of euphoria and how

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.530 
different aspects of of euphoria and how
we<00:02:46.810> use<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.260> there's<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.829> hit<00:02:48.700> reacts<00:02:49.000> for

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
we use it so there's the hit reacts for

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.720 
we use it so there's the hit reacts for
for<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.470> enemies<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.860> sort<00:02:51.069> of<00:02:51.130> evolve<00:02:51.489> that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
for the enemies to sort of evolve that

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.670 
for the enemies to sort of evolve that
and<00:02:51.880> make<00:02:52.030> those<00:02:52.180> feel<00:02:52.480> more<00:02:53.110> connected<00:02:53.349> I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and make those feel more connected I

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.309 
and make those feel more connected I
think<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:54.010> had<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.190> good<00:02:54.459> jump<00:02:54.760> from<00:02:55.079> gta4<00:02:56.079> to

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
think we had a good jump from gta4 to

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.020 
think we had a good jump from gta4 to
read<00:02:56.769> dead<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.280> you're<00:02:57.760> going<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:57.910> see

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
read dead and you're going to see

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.690 
read dead and you're going to see
another<00:02:58.120> good<00:02:58.510> jump<00:02:58.690> from<00:02:59.129> Red<00:03:00.129> Dead<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.459> max

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
another good jump from Red Dead to max

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.319 
another good jump from Red Dead to max
where<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.150> want<00:03:01.360> individual<00:03:01.959> shots<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:03.329> react

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
where you want individual shots to react

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.759 
where you want individual shots to react
properly<00:03:04.569> one<00:03:04.959> people<00:03:05.440> have<00:03:05.530> fall

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
properly one people have fall

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.710 
properly one people have fall
realistically<00:03:06.549> that's<00:03:07.329> something<00:03:07.599> that

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
realistically that's something that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.059 
realistically that's something that
we're<00:03:07.840> always<00:03:07.989> we're<00:03:08.379> always<00:03:08.500> pushing<00:03:08.769> plus

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
we're always we're always pushing plus

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.890 
we're always we're always pushing plus
we<00:03:09.220> have<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.700> know<00:03:09.790> bullet<00:03:10.299> cams<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.750> things

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
we have you know bullet cams and things

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.539 
we have you know bullet cams and things
like<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.410> max<00:03:11.590> where<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.890> basically<00:03:12.099> are

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
like that in max where you basically are

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.580 
like that in max where you basically are
seeing<00:03:13.480> these<00:03:13.599> things<00:03:13.780> up<00:03:14.049> close<00:03:14.349> you're

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
seeing these things up close you're

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.800 
seeing these things up close you're
seeing<00:03:14.829> your<00:03:14.950> bullets<00:03:15.280> impact<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.910> impact

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
seeing your bullets impact the impact

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.080 
seeing your bullets impact the impact
your<00:03:17.019> opponents<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.790> want<00:03:18.970> that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
your opponents and so you want that

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.960 
your opponents and so you want that
stuff<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.389> really<00:03:19.630> show<00:03:20.470> well<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.430> then<00:03:21.819> we're

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
stuff to really show well and then we're

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.990 
stuff to really show well and then we're
also<00:03:22.090> doing<00:03:22.269> something<00:03:22.569> new<00:03:22.840> with<00:03:23.799> max<00:03:24.760> where

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
also doing something new with max where

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.140 
also doing something new with max where
we're<00:03:25.120> sort<00:03:25.299> of<00:03:25.389> doing<00:03:26.970> physics<00:03:27.970> and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
we're sort of doing physics and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.210 
we're sort of doing physics and
animation<00:03:28.600> hybrids<00:03:29.049> like<00:03:29.139> when<00:03:29.829> he<00:03:29.980> shoot

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
animation hybrids like when he shoot

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.500 
animation hybrids like when he shoot
dodges<00:03:30.670> that's<00:03:31.540> physics<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.639> and<00:03:33.639> an<00:03:33.940> opposed

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
dodges that's physics and and an opposed

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.140 
dodges that's physics and and an opposed
library<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.760> animation<00:03:36.760> pose<00:03:36.940> library

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
library that of animation pose library

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.539 
library that of animation pose library
running<00:03:37.660> together<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:39.220> need<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.400> be<00:03:39.489> able

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
running together so you need to be able

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.879 
running together so you need to be able
to<00:03:39.639> control<00:03:40.120> where<00:03:40.450> he's<00:03:40.660> pointing<00:03:41.230> but<00:03:41.739> at

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
to control where he's pointing but at

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.190 
to control where he's pointing but at
the<00:03:41.980> same<00:03:42.160> time<00:03:42.519> he<00:03:43.269> needs<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.630> be<00:03:43.780> able<00:03:43.870> to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the same time he needs to be able to

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.770 
the same time he needs to be able to
behave<00:03:44.739> realistically<00:03:45.669> depending<00:03:46.599> on<00:03:46.690> his

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
behave realistically depending on his

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.150 
behave realistically depending on his
environment<00:03:47.380> whether<00:03:47.530> he's<00:03:47.769> sort<00:03:48.099> of

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
environment whether he's sort of

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.940 
environment whether he's sort of
launching<00:03:49.000> over<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.329> you<00:03:49.989> know<00:03:50.139> some<00:03:50.650> kind<00:03:50.889> of

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
launching over a you know some kind of

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.550 
launching over a you know some kind of
concrete<00:03:51.730> divider<00:03:52.150> or<00:03:52.480> crashing<00:03:53.200> into<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.470> wall

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
concrete divider or crashing into a wall

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.610 
concrete divider or crashing into a wall
or<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.040> bus<00:03:54.280> or<00:03:54.459> something<00:03:54.760> like<00:03:54.849> that<00:03:55.410> he<00:03:56.410> has

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
or a bus or something like that he has

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.129 
or a bus or something like that he has
to<00:03:56.829> feel<00:03:57.220> aware<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:58.030> his<00:03:58.209> surroundings<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.900> so

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
to feel aware of his surroundings and so

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.120 
to feel aware of his surroundings and so
that<00:03:59.889> was<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.130> big<00:04:00.430> challenge<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:02.130> something

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
that was a big challenge and something

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.039 
that was a big challenge and something
that<00:04:03.190> we<00:04:03.310> spent<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.549> lot<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.730> time<00:04:03.970> tuning<00:04:04.299> and

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
that we spent a lot of time tuning and

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.809 
that we spent a lot of time tuning and
then<00:04:05.260> we<00:04:05.349> also<00:04:05.470> have<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:05.980> mechanical<00:04:06.489> Last<00:04:06.730> Man

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
then we also have a mechanical Last Man

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.390 
then we also have a mechanical Last Man

in<00:04:09.519> your<00:04:09.639> inventory<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.180> take<00:04:10.359> sort<00:04:10.569> of<00:04:10.599> a

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
in your inventory and you take sort of a

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.830 
in your inventory and you take sort of a
fatal<00:04:10.900> shot<00:04:11.310> from<00:04:12.310> an<00:04:12.459> enemy<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:13.329> go<00:04:13.510> into

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
fatal shot from an enemy you go into

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.349

this<00:04:14.760> sort<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:15.880> bullet<00:04:16.510> time<00:04:16.919> mode<00:04:17.919> where<00:04:18.370> max

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
this sort of bullet time mode where max

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.659 
this sort of bullet time mode where max
is<00:04:19.570> dying<00:04:19.930> but<00:04:20.260> he<00:04:20.320> still<00:04:20.680> has<00:04:21.099> a<00:04:21.130> little<00:04:21.370> he

is dying but he still has a little he

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.890 
is dying but he still has a little he
has<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.789> little<00:04:22.090> bit<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.300> life<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.599> him<00:04:22.719> and<00:04:22.840> if

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
has a little bit of life in him and if

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.170 
has a little bit of life in him and if
you<00:04:22.990> can<00:04:23.169> find<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.650> person<00:04:23.830> that

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
you can find the person that

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.180 
you can find the person that
got<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.330> shot<00:04:26.629> off<00:04:26.810> on<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:27.349> get<00:04:28.069> your

got that shot off on you and get your

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.260 
got that shot off on you and get your
reticle<00:04:28.520> on<00:04:28.669> them<00:04:28.819> and<00:04:29.210> shoot<00:04:29.930> them

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
painkiller so you know that that state

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.770 
painkiller so you know that that state
where<00:04:45.889> he's<00:04:46.069> sort<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.400> where<00:04:47.360> he's<00:04:47.509> sort<00:04:47.720> of

animation based hybrid that we're we're

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.339 
animation based hybrid that we're we're
doing<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:58.280> that's<00:04:59.240> just<00:04:59.479> prone<00:04:59.690> state<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.199> the

doing is that's just prone state on the

you<00:05:08.479> can<00:05:08.659> stay<00:05:08.930> there<00:05:09.199> and<00:05:09.379> keep<00:05:09.710> moving<00:05:10.009> your

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
you can stay there and keep moving your

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.890 
you can stay there and keep moving your
reticle<00:05:10.370> around<00:05:10.639> and<00:05:10.789> shoot<00:05:11.060> sort<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.419> you

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
reticle around and shoot sort of you

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.230 
reticle around and shoot sort of you
know<00:05:11.960> 360<00:05:12.680> degrees<00:05:12.919> around<00:05:13.069> you<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:13.580> that

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
know 360 degrees around you and that

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.059 
know 360 degrees around you and that
again<00:05:14.750> as<00:05:14.960> Max<00:05:15.169> is<00:05:15.319> sort<00:05:15.500> of<00:05:15.530> rolling<00:05:15.830> around

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
again as Max is sort of rolling around

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.950 
again as Max is sort of rolling around
through<00:05:16.460> from<00:05:16.849> pose<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.240> pose<00:05:17.419> that's<00:05:17.719> another

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
through from pose to pose that's another

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.869 
through from pose to pose that's another
blend<00:05:18.289> of<00:05:18.440> physics<00:05:19.190> and<00:05:19.310> animation<00:05:19.699> that<00:05:19.789> we

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
blend of physics and animation that we

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.119 
blend of physics and animation that we
worked<00:05:20.090> really<00:05:20.870> hard<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.319> get<00:05:21.500> feeling<00:05:21.919> right

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
worked really hard to get feeling right

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:23.830 
worked really hard to get feeling right
and<00:05:22.370> looking<00:05:22.669> right<00:05:22.789> it's<00:05:23.270> very<00:05:23.330> cool

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
and looking right it's very cool

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.959 
and looking right it's very cool
as<00:05:23.930> far<00:05:24.469> as<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.800> way<00:05:25.039> bullet<00:05:25.370> time<00:05:25.550> works<00:05:25.729> now

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
as far as the way bullet time works now

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.550 
as far as the way bullet time works now
compared<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.930> way<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.110> worked<00:05:27.289> in<00:05:27.409> the<00:05:27.500> old

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
compared to the way it worked in the old

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.529 
compared to the way it worked in the old
games<00:05:27.949> and<00:05:28.190> what<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.639> what<00:05:29.029> the<00:05:29.090> greatest

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
games and what the what the greatest

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.300 
games and what the what the greatest
addition<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.110> or<00:05:30.349> the<00:05:30.409> greatest<00:05:30.710> enhancement

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
addition is or the greatest enhancement

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.850 
addition is or the greatest enhancement
it<00:05:31.729> works<00:05:31.909> pretty<00:05:32.060> much<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.389> same<00:05:32.599> it's<00:05:33.440> still

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
it works pretty much the same it's still

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.350 
it works pretty much the same it's still
there<00:05:34.900> for<00:05:35.900> players<00:05:36.139> to<00:05:36.349> use<00:05:36.529> as<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.770> tool<00:05:37.069> to

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
there for players to use as a tool to

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.120 
there for players to use as a tool to
slow<00:05:38.360> down<00:05:38.569> time<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:39.199> give<00:05:39.500> them<00:05:39.680> an<00:05:39.889> advantage

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
slow down time to give them an advantage

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.909 
slow down time to give them an advantage
over<00:05:40.789> their<00:05:41.240> enemies<00:05:41.810> when<00:05:42.229> things<00:05:42.440> get<00:05:42.680> I

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
over their enemies when things get I

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.279 
over their enemies when things get I
think<00:05:43.340> which<00:05:43.490> they<00:05:43.639> do<00:05:43.699> all<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.270> time<00:05:44.300> and

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
think which they do all the time and

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.769 
think which they do all the time and
that<00:05:45.740> is<00:05:45.979> something<00:05:46.219> that<00:05:46.430> we<00:05:46.550> really<00:05:46.909> needed

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:47.779 
that is something that we really needed

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.689 
that is something that we really needed
to<00:05:47.930> keep<00:05:48.229> allowing<00:05:48.860> players<00:05:49.039> to<00:05:49.219> have<00:05:49.460> that

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
to keep allowing players to have that

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.830 
to keep allowing players to have that
control<00:05:50.000> it<00:05:50.690> really<00:05:51.259> it<00:05:51.590> hasn't<00:05:51.860> changed<00:05:52.840> but

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
control it really it hasn't changed but

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.570 
control it really it hasn't changed but
yeah<00:05:54.259> it<00:05:54.500> looks<00:05:54.740> and<00:05:54.919> feels<00:05:55.099> completely

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
yeah it looks and feels completely

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.380 
yeah it looks and feels completely
different

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
different

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.730 
different
