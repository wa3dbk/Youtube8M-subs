00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940

some<00:00:15.299> new<00:00:15.450> products<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.320> not<00:00:16.529> always<00:00:16.859> a

some new products and I'm not always a
fan<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.369> elf<00:00:17.699> because<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.090> feel<00:00:18.390> like<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
fan of elf because I feel like it's a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320 
fan of elf because I feel like it's a
hit<00:00:19.529> or<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> miss<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.369> elf<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.880> sometimes

hit or a miss with elf like sometimes

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.670 
hit or a miss with elf like sometimes
it'll<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.660> really<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.080> good<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
it'll be really really good and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
it'll be really really good and
sometimes<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.699> absolutely<00:00:24.269> terrible

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
sometimes it's just absolutely terrible

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.720 
sometimes it's just absolutely terrible
and<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.769> know<00:00:25.859> whenever<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.400> terrible

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and you know whenever it's terrible

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.070 
and you know whenever it's terrible
people<00:00:26.880> say<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.150> get<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.630> pay<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:27.810> but

people say you get what you pay for but

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.319 
think they just came out with they are
two<00:00:39.420> dollars<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.230> Target<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.149> right<00:00:42.149> in

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
two dollars at Target so right in

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
two dollars at Target so right in
between<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.960> dollar<00:00:43.170> mark<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
between the one dollar mark and the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.290 
between the one dollar mark and the
three<00:00:44.070> dollar<00:00:44.219> mark<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.700> always<00:00:44.969> say<00:00:45.120> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
three dollar mark and I always say that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.790 
three dollar mark and I always say that
the<00:00:45.390> three<00:00:45.570> dollar<00:00:45.870> stuff<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.440> elf<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the three dollar stuff for elf is a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.139 
the three dollar stuff for elf is a
little<00:00:47.160> bit<00:00:47.280> better<00:00:47.430> than<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.969> dollar

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
little bit better than the one dollar

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
little bit better than the one dollar
things<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.170> maybe<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.190> right

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
things so maybe this will be like right

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.939 
things so maybe this will be like right
in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.610> middle<00:00:50.850> who<00:00:51.120> knows<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.320> got<00:00:52.770> the

so you can see what it really looks like

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.559 
so you can see what it really looks like
if<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.530> were<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.489> lip<00:02:51.640> stain<00:02:51.849> so

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.020 
it just gives a little bit of color it's
not<00:02:54.849> too<00:02:55.239> much<00:02:55.420> it's<00:02:55.690> not<00:02:55.750> too<00:02:56.019> overpowering<00:02:56.349> I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
not too much it's not too overpowering I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.740 
not too much it's not too overpowering I
kind<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.209> like<00:02:58.480> it

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
kind of like it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.860 
kind of like it
I'm<00:02:58.900> not<00:02:59.610> really<00:03:00.610> such<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.880> fan<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.360> marker

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
I'm not really such a fan of the marker

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.390 
I'm not really such a fan of the marker
aspect<00:03:02.349> of<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.620> feel<00:03:02.799> like<00:03:02.920> I'm<00:03:03.040> drawing

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
aspect of it I feel like I'm drawing

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.729 
aspect of it I feel like I'm drawing
like<00:03:04.120> with<00:03:04.360> them<00:03:04.480> crayola<00:03:04.900> marker<00:03:05.019> on<00:03:05.380> my<00:03:05.530> face

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
like with them crayola marker on my face

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.300 
like with them crayola marker on my face
so<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:05.950> don't<00:03:06.069> really<00:03:06.459> like<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:06.849> about<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:08.310> but

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
so I don't really like that about it but

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.970 
so I don't really like that about it but
for<00:03:10.239> color<00:03:10.510> wise<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.810> think<00:03:11.049> it's<00:03:11.380> pretty<00:03:11.650> good

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
for color wise I think it's pretty good

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.500 
for color wise I think it's pretty good
I<00:03:12.250> mean<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.459> don't<00:03:12.549> know<00:03:12.790> how<00:03:12.970> long<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.359> is

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
I mean I don't know how long this is

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.789 
I mean I don't know how long this is
going<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.720> last<00:03:13.959> throughout<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.320> day<00:03:14.560> and

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
going to last throughout the day and

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.400 
going to last throughout the day and
it's<00:03:15.310> not<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.519> very<00:03:15.609> vibrant<00:03:16.150> color<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:17.170> it's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
it's not a very vibrant color like it's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.860 
it's not a very vibrant color like it's
just<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.980> lightest<00:03:18.489> amount<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:19.090> pop<00:03:19.329> of<00:03:19.630> color

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
just the lightest amount of pop of color

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.930 
just the lightest amount of pop of color
that<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.739> could<00:03:20.950> get<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.459> if<00:03:21.579> that's<00:03:21.760> what

about the color nude I feel like it's

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.920

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
I like this one a bit better because it

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.119 
I like this one a bit better because it
has<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.000> bit<00:04:13.390> more<00:04:13.540> color<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.989> I<00:04:14.860> don't<00:04:14.950> feel

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
has a bit more color and I don't feel

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.190 
has a bit more color and I don't feel
like<00:04:15.280> it's<00:04:15.430> going<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:15.580> wear<00:04:15.760> off

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
like it's going to wear off

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.630 
like it's going to wear off
away<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.530> other<00:04:16.680> one<00:04:16.830> I<00:04:16.860> feel<00:04:17.070> like<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.400> might

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
away the other one I feel like it might

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.150 
away the other one I feel like it might
wear<00:04:17.940> off<00:04:18.150> throughout<00:04:18.990> the<00:04:19.080> day<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:19.920> one

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
wear off throughout the day this one

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.430 
wear off throughout the day this one
will<00:04:20.340> probably<00:04:20.580> stay<00:04:21.360> on<00:04:21.540> for<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> while<00:04:22.080> just

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
will probably stay on for a while just

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.020 
will probably stay on for a while just
because<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.920> color<00:04:23.160> aspect<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.880> is

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
because of the color aspect of it is

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.670 
because of the color aspect of it is
very<00:04:24.420> pigmented<00:04:24.950> etc<00:04:25.950> etc<00:04:26.010> I<00:04:26.550> would

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
very pigmented etc etc I would

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.080 
very pigmented etc etc I would
definitely<00:04:28.680> put<00:04:28.920> gloss<00:04:29.160> over<00:04:29.490> this<00:04:29.700> because<00:04:30.060> I

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
definitely put gloss over this because I

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.030 
definitely put gloss over this because I
feel<00:04:30.390> like<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.780> mean<00:04:31.380> if<00:04:31.470> you're<00:04:31.590> going<00:04:31.800> for<00:04:32.010> the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
feel like I mean if you're going for the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.440 
feel like I mean if you're going for the
more<00:04:32.250> matte<00:04:32.460> look<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:33.120> feels<00:04:33.330> like

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
more matte look it just feels like

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.730 
more matte look it just feels like
there's<00:04:33.600> nothing<00:04:33.930> on<00:04:34.020> my<00:04:34.050> lips<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.440> like<00:04:34.560> my

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
there's nothing on my lips I like my

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.310 
there's nothing on my lips I like my
lips<00:04:34.980> feel<00:04:35.160> very<00:04:35.490> dry<00:04:35.880> for<00:04:36.540> this<00:04:36.720> one<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:36.990> don't

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
lips feel very dry for this one I don't

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.780 
lips feel very dry for this one I don't
think<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.650> will<00:04:37.740> wear<00:04:37.950> off<00:04:37.980> because<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.730> the

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
think it will wear off because of the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.080 
think it will wear off because of the
color<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:39.300> also<00:04:39.450> because<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.140> just<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:41.580> seems

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
color but also because it just it seems

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.030 
color but also because it just it seems
to<00:04:42.240> be<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.540> sticking<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.230> my<00:04:43.350> lips<00:04:43.680> unlike

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
to be like sticking to my lips unlike

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.520 
to be like sticking to my lips unlike
the<00:04:44.190> other<00:04:44.340> one<00:04:44.670> seem<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.540> like<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.990> wear

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
the other one seem to just like the wear

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.180 
the other one seem to just like the wear
off<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.880> didn't<00:04:48.210> seem<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.680> stick<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.830> my<00:04:49.950> lips

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190

like I'm coloring on my face so as much
as<00:05:15.300> yes<00:05:15.660> when<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.080> do<00:05:16.200> makeup<00:05:16.410> you<00:05:16.710> do<00:05:16.830> color

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
as yes when you do makeup you do color

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.850 
as yes when you do makeup you do color
on<00:05:17.310> your<00:05:17.400> face<00:05:17.640> I<00:05:17.850> realize<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.510> but<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.710> fact

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
on your face I realize that but the fact

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.040 
on your face I realize that but the fact
that<00:05:20.010> it's<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.340> marker<00:05:20.820> is<00:05:21.030> just<00:05:21.270> very<00:05:21.480> strange

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
that it's a marker is just very strange

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.400 
that it's a marker is just very strange
I<00:05:22.080> do<00:05:22.470> also<00:05:22.920> do<00:05:23.250> not<00:05:23.400> like<00:05:23.670> how<00:05:23.940> it's<00:05:24.180> not

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
I do also do not like how it's not

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.240 
I do also do not like how it's not
moisturizing<00:05:25.410> how<00:05:25.710> it's<00:05:26.610> not<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:28.470> makes<00:05:29.040> my

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
moisturizing how it's not it makes my

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.270 
moisturizing how it's not it makes my
lips<00:05:29.430> feel<00:05:29.700> very<00:05:30.000> dry<00:05:30.390> but<00:05:31.230> then<00:05:31.560> again<00:05:31.710> these

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
lips feel very dry but then again these

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.460 
lips feel very dry but then again these
always<00:05:32.880> lip<00:05:33.360> stains<00:05:33.630> are<00:05:33.810> usually<00:05:34.320> unless

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
always lip stains are usually unless

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.960 
always lip stains are usually unless
they're<00:05:34.770> moisturizing<00:05:35.310> lip<00:05:35.460> stains<00:05:35.670> are<00:05:35.790> ones

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
they're moisturizing lip stains are ones

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.090 
they're moisturizing lip stains are ones
that<00:05:36.030> are<00:05:36.120> more<00:05:36.300> glossy<00:05:36.480> they<00:05:37.230> are<00:05:37.620> coupled

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
that are more glossy they are coupled

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.340 
that are more glossy they are coupled
with<00:05:38.400> lip<00:05:39.030> gloss<00:05:39.270> or<00:05:39.630> they<00:05:39.780> go<00:05:39.870> coupled<00:05:40.290> with

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
with lip gloss or they go coupled with

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.170 
with lip gloss or they go coupled with
other<00:05:40.590> things<00:05:40.890> so<00:05:41.310> it<00:05:41.430> makes<00:05:41.610> sense<00:05:41.850> that<00:05:42.060> it

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
other things so it makes sense that it

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.630 
other things so it makes sense that it
would<00:05:42.210> be<00:05:42.300> drying<00:05:42.660> to<00:05:42.840> my<00:05:42.960> skin<00:05:43.290> or<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:44.310> my<00:05:44.400> lips

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
would be drying to my skin or to my lips

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.090 
would be drying to my skin or to my lips
not<00:05:44.880> my<00:05:45.030> skin<00:05:45.270> blah<00:05:45.510> blah<00:05:45.690> blah<00:05:45.900> but<00:05:46.680> anyway<00:05:47.040> so

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
not my skin blah blah blah but anyway so

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.760 
not my skin blah blah blah but anyway so
I<00:05:47.670> think<00:05:48.000> for<00:05:48.720> two<00:05:48.870> bucks<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.380> can't<00:05:49.590> really

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
I think for two bucks you can't really

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.920 
I think for two bucks you can't really
go<00:05:50.010> wrong<00:05:50.040> I<00:05:50.580> like<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.240> new<00:05:51.390> nectar<00:05:51.750> one

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
go wrong I like the new nectar one

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.770 
go wrong I like the new nectar one
better<00:05:52.170> than<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.650> pink<00:05:53.100> petal<00:05:53.550> but<00:05:54.180> for<00:05:54.630> two

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
better than the pink petal but for two

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.870 
better than the pink petal but for two
bucks<00:05:54.960> I<00:05:55.170> can't<00:05:55.380> really<00:05:55.560> complain<00:05:55.980> so<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.460> think

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
bucks I can't really complain so I think

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.280 
bucks I can't really complain so I think
it's<00:05:57.120> pretty<00:05:57.300> good<00:05:57.450> I<00:05:57.510> think<00:05:57.630> if<00:05:57.840> you<00:05:57.930> guys<00:05:58.050> are
