what that chess piece is called I'm kind
of<00:01:00.539> embarrassed<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.350> um

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
of embarrassed about that actually um

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
of embarrassed about that actually um
and<00:01:03.390> here's<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> main<00:01:04.229> problem<00:01:04.619> these<00:01:04.860> three

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and here's the main problem these three

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.510 
and here's the main problem these three
checkboxes<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.439> have<00:01:07.439> no<00:01:07.650> clue<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:08.040> those<00:01:08.250> do

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
checkboxes I have no clue what those do

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.080 
checkboxes I have no clue what those do
but<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.689> default<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.979> last<00:01:11.280> check<00:01:11.610> box<00:01:11.880> is

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
but on default that last check box is

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
but on default that last check box is
unchecked<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:14.250> did<00:01:14.460> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
unchecked and I think that's what did it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.370 
unchecked and I think that's what did it
that's<00:01:15.360> probably<00:01:15.600> why<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.930> wasn't<00:01:16.229> working

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that's probably why it wasn't working

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.109 
that's probably why it wasn't working
speeding<00:01:17.009> acceleration<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> worry<00:01:17.939> about

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
speeding acceleration not to worry about

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.140 
speeding acceleration not to worry about
but<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.130> looking<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.400> mine<00:01:20.790> just

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
click that mofo there and it should be

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.910 
click that mofo there and it should be
able<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.890> work<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.840> perfectly<00:01:27.840> after<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> lot
