00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.850
 and then she guys everybody 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.070
 it's their soft we find ourselves for a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.820
 video guys a review on the legend 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.650
 hernan crespo huge outstanding player 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.480
 so we can start the gaps not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.090
 review the team in which I placed 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.670
 so classic and ajimi two Argentine 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.100
 around him so lavezzi and di maria 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.230
 we can admire these superb stats 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.809
 guys who are who are exceptional 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.120
 that's it you open his little 90 in 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.769
 finish the physical attributes that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.030
 are huge do not hesitate to put 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.080
 break break because frankly that's 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 shocking 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.370
 the small offensive placement of 86 that I 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.890
 advise you to admire the guys 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.180
 look carefully at his placement so that we 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.940
 start right now this review not 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.930
 a little head so hernan crespo 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.010
 players whose stations are pretty 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.080
 quite huge at the level of the head 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.250
 have to say the guys 84 in the lead on the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.340
 card 90 even 94 I believe in precision 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.630
 it's a monster 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.400
 he is one meter eighty-five he has 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.689
 four stars bad foot in four 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.610
 matches and techniques 5 and the bad 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.560
 physically foot there as one can 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.890
 see it broke modric to recover 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.780
 the ball 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 she never falls a physically it's 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.109
 a monster is a rock 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.810
 yet they welcome 73 forcibly 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.969
 but we do not know why guys 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 surely because it's a legend 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.299
 it's a monster that at my site have 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.950
 he never shakes the world we can 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.170
 see on doing it at the level of the gameplay 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.670
 who kivu skull really a lot of 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.960
 world 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.909
 technically serves the guys well and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.249
 crespo 4 stars gesture is that we can get 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.399
 to please with a huge hit 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:53.490
 surgical decision let's say this is 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.249
 terrible frankly with him on the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.819
 number of strikes I made and so 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:01.560
 not be a lot of bankruptcies like 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.020
 do not you say I did not miss a lot 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.549
 working that he frankly hat 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.429
 that I was shooting I was pretty sure of 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.990
 mark did I love crespo 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.090
 it was that he had a quality 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.840
 actually the guys they were they were 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.760
 huge at the striker 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.879
 but at the pass level a quality 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.560
 exceptional at crespo so much in passes 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.470
 short he is 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.290
 he is a lambda player but in the process 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.300
 so the gorgeous gaves we'll see 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
 after in the gameplay that launches 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.840
 had said no he will launch di maria 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.349
 these exceptions and his passing game for 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.840
 the just a little boy who came back there had 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.019
 Crespo noted 6km pedal but 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.510
 crespo crazy power when we combine 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.030
 frankly crespo one combines power and 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.280
 to say the speed the strikes and the head 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.019
 he is a magical league player 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.410
 good it costs a little ticket when 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.170
 same but it's chris paul and his 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.440
 exceptional sees the power the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.890
 speed strength strike the head is 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.110
 magical 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.910
 just have that for one point 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.019
 scorer he watched his moving them 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.640
 he's going to get back and there our site 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.650
 goes deep for di maria 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.110
 she is beautiful and there di maria has 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.620
 concluded with a superb lob flush with the 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.440
 transversal 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.540
 it's beautiful it's magic but 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.769
 i really love crespo said 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.209
 the attacker which I took more than 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.340
 pleasure after that remains a legend it's 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.620
 normal but look at that I'm having fun with 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.010
 I'm having fun and he really made me 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.560
 pleasure 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.660
 an exceptional left foot guys 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.220
 must be said I was honestly I was 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.090
 even more reassured to shoot 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.639
 left only with the right foot 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.049
 is that if we play with martin 5 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.239
 stars the wrong foot 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.269
 he has an exceptional hit and of 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.340
 foot that's what is beautiful and then that's it 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.959
 guys I think I pretty much 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.690
 everything says to door a name that all of me 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.710
 said he is 0 free kick we will see him 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.850
 to be interpreted in the video 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.080
 because I interpreted this because 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.620
 because I missed a free kick 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.140
 luan guys there I shot very well 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.390
 but like shit you'll see at 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.410
 note two small goals there and from 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.660
 frankly I do not know 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.280
 why he said that it shocked me that 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.780
 shocked me look at crispo dancing 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.100
 lavezzi superb goes deep 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.020
 frankly the quality goes on it is there 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.030
 all that is long passes is there 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.830
 the music that marks for once with 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.110
 I do not want you guys and me 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.520
 lavezzi never does anything the device one 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.160
 always have fun and christophe at all 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.980
 right the shot of the left foot in the race 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.020
 frankly if that's not a five 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.040
 bad foot star I do not know 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.050
 frankly the force 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.550
 the strike which mixed of oracle pigouche 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.870
 it's beautiful game has slowed down she 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.050
 passes between the defender's legs if 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.700
 I'm not wrong so here's the guys 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.310
 62 in precision of free-kick crespo 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.560
 that's the only negative point of the player 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.760
 the only negative point to 100 you can 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.480
 see him guys there I really pull him 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.260
 really well and the free kick is good 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.210
 drawn 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.440
 I was laughing well I see and and build 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.950
 and the scotch shots and who will have to like that 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.820
 it comes back with separate relationships 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.610
 look at his fit for finishing 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.680
 perfect with the left foot in addition to this 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.200
 beautiful sport guys is that 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.190
 it's not beautiful frankly crespo 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.930
 stop 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.460
 if they have seen many times the 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.770
 question on twitter but if christ 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.310
 skin but question arises not the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.010
 wars crespo widely 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.430
 in terms of false crisis power 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.930
 political crisis look there the power 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.080
 of the player he still drops two 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.520
 guys did not finish fault there were the 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.680
 mayas not fuck guys and there they 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.580
 have fun technically and small 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.230
 outside of the right foot 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.570
 we will finish on it for these 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.910
 I like it has very little force on the 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.290
 card guys in stats with 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.880
 draw which is opponents are 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.320
 still several are very little strength 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.970
 but you and that proof that it's not 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.130
 it means nothing so that's for the 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.780
 crespo balance sheet five games 11 goals 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.670
 scored 4 assists 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.970
 so we can say that the balance sheet is 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.080
 quite exceptional four sides of his 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.680
 clean for a scorer who was everything 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.010
 single peak 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.900
 the eleven goals c it's magic so for 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.520
 the balance now the guys the points 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.770
 positive the negative points so the 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.410
 negative points the only free kicks 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.100
 normal in 62 years pressure free kick 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.960
 coming from 64 to that's not what's that but 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.180
 good for the rest it's exceptional 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.300
 so power as I said everything to 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.670
 the time that combines the strength the speed the 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.440
 it's all this nerve and but 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.690
 who goes too fast and then he never falls 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.090
 it's a benteke in power all 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.240
 simply the level of the head is 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.860
 such a super strong fra battles it's 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.430
 similar to surgical precision 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.950
 while combining a strike force 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.670
 exceptional just the 4 and 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.390
 wide and steak 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.860
 I 'm always happy I have about five 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.630
 stars in bad foot at home four 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.400
 stars wounded five bad foot 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.190
 deceive in the picture 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.180
 the speed that's for sure the passes 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.610
 long as we saw just now 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.870
 and its positioning 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.949
 go backwards it's not seen well 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.889
 Watch the video 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:06.080
 precisely are investments that's 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:07.190
 exceptional on this guys crespo know 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.560
 not if it's the best attacker 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.440
 I tested what I still test 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.509
 heavy in all this but frankly I 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.630
 will you say it maybe he 'll go 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:19.699
 number one which shocked me on these 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.440
 damage I hope this video has you 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.699
 we will resume a good little pace 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.580
 bascala for a week and a half 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:28.300
 I did not make a video because I was 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:32.330
 tube displacement much energy 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.310
 were busy and that's it on this stage 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:38.050
 except the guys but on the buttocks and 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.050
 soon lifting the nut or episode
