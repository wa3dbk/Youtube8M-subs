all<00:00:01.020> right<00:00:01.199> so<00:00:01.350> we<00:00:01.410> got<00:00:01.560> a<00:00:01.589> revision<00:00:02.310> on<00:00:02.580> the

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
all right so we got a revision on the

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.950 
all right so we got a revision on the
wire<00:00:04.380> harness<00:00:04.770> they<00:00:05.100> now<00:00:05.310> have<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:06.180> new<00:00:06.480> better

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
wire harness they now have a new better

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.930 
wire harness they now have a new better
wire<00:00:07.230> harness<00:00:07.649> that's<00:00:07.950> simpler<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.550> install

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
wire harness that's simpler to install

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.440 
wire harness that's simpler to install
and<00:00:09.620> it<00:00:10.620> also<00:00:10.800> offers<00:00:11.490> high<00:00:11.730> beam<00:00:11.969> low<00:00:12.240> beam

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
and it also offers high beam low beam

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.120 
and it also offers high beam low beam
between<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.019> two<00:00:13.200> lights<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.040> can

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
between the two lights so you can

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.430 
between the two lights so you can
actually<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:14.790> as<00:00:15.570> your<00:00:15.719> high<00:00:15.839> beam<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
actually have one as your high beam and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.400 
actually have one as your high beam and
one<00:00:16.680> as<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.279> low<00:00:17.520> beam<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.000> here's<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.230> new

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
one as your low beam and here's the new

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.540 
one as your low beam and here's the new
wire<00:00:19.619> harness<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.660> everything

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
wire harness that's it that's everything

you got the OEM plug for your headlight

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.380 
you got the OEM plug for your headlight
well<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.859> connectors<00:00:29.310> go<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.939> LED

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
well the connectors go into the LED

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.920 
well the connectors go into the LED
lights<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.759> trigger<00:00:32.759> wire<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
lights and the trigger wire and that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.930 
lights and the trigger wire and that
wire<00:00:34.670> comes<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:35.850> off<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.390> little

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
wire comes right off with that little

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.459 
wire comes right off with that little
right<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.870> we'll<00:00:40.110> show<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.379> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
right there and we'll show you how to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
right there and we'll show you how to
connect<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.610> runs<00:00:41.879> simply

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
connect it and then it just runs simply

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.100 
connect it and then it just runs simply
right<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> front<00:00:44.000> it's<00:00:45.000> an<00:00:45.149> easy<00:00:45.329> one

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
right up to the front it's an easy one

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
right up to the front it's an easy one
wire<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:48.230> headlights<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:50.160> high<00:00:50.460> beam

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
wire and headlights are now high beam

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.250 
wire and headlights are now high beam
low<00:00:50.850> beam<00:00:52.520> all<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.940> first<00:00:54.300> step<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
low beam all right so first step is to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
low beam all right so first step is to
unplug<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.660> plug<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:59.210> from<00:01:00.210> your

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
unplug this little plug here from your

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.439 
unplug this little plug here from your
regulator<00:01:02.090> instructions<00:01:03.090> show<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
regulator instructions show you have to

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.320 
regulator instructions show you have to
unbolt<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.379> obviously<00:01:04.850> just<00:01:05.850> take<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> flat

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
unbolt it but obviously just take a flat

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.250 
unbolt it but obviously just take a flat
blade<00:01:07.850> screwdriver<00:01:08.850> press<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
blade screwdriver press it in there and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.719 
blade screwdriver press it in there and
you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.590> wiggle<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.070> plug<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you can wiggle the plug out it's a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.370 
you can wiggle the plug out it's a
really<00:01:12.150> tight<00:01:12.390> fit<00:01:12.630> cuz<00:01:12.930> you've<00:01:13.080> got<00:01:13.260> all

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
really tight fit cuz you've got all

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.770 
really tight fit cuz you've got all
those<00:01:13.530> blades<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:15.090> friction<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.630> those

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
those blades there the friction of those

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080 
those blades there the friction of those
is<00:01:16.049> holding<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.500> into<00:01:16.650> place<00:01:16.880> but<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.970> can

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
is holding it into place but you can

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
is holding it into place but you can
obviously<00:01:18.420> easily<00:01:19.189> little<00:01:20.189> work<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
obviously easily little work and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.440 
obviously easily little work and
screwdriver<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.869> pry<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.350> loose<00:01:23.119> all<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
screwdriver just pry it loose all it is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.819 
screwdriver just pry it loose all it is
is<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.689> little<00:01:26.450> clip<00:01:27.450> right<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.170> wedge

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
is that little clip right there to wedge

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.319 
is that little clip right there to wedge
your<00:01:28.860> screwdriver<00:01:29.369> behind<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> just

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
your screwdriver behind and you can just

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
your screwdriver behind and you can just
push<00:01:30.570> down<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.979> pry<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.310> loose<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> want

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
push down and pry it loose and you want

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.170 
push down and pry it loose and you want
to<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.820> you're<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
to get it out here and you're going to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.789 
to get it out here and you're going to
basically<00:01:36.420> remove<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> those<00:01:37.500> blades

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
basically remove one of those blades

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.240 
basically remove one of those blades
which<00:01:38.430> goes<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:38.880> headlights<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
which goes to your headlights and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.530 
which goes to your headlights and
instead<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.340> having<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.820> power<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.270> running

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
instead of having the power of running

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260 
instead of having the power of running
from<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.869> regulator<00:01:43.350> which<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.270> stupid

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
from this regulator which is like stupid

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.030 
from this regulator which is like stupid
high<00:01:45.390> voltage<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.140> burns<00:01:46.350> out<00:01:46.590> everything

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
high voltage and burns out everything

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.760 
high voltage and burns out everything
you're<00:01:47.759> gonna<00:01:47.880> run<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.720> directly<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.590> your

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you're gonna run that directly to your

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.200 
you're gonna run that directly to your
taillight<00:01:51.110> power<00:01:52.110> wire<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.909> send

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
taillight power wire and that will send

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.319 
taillight power wire and that will send
the<00:01:55.490> electricity<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:56.909> headlight<00:01:57.180> at

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the electricity up to your headlight at

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.469 
the electricity up to your headlight at
12<00:01:57.600> volts<00:01:57.899> instead<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.939> 40-plus<00:01:59.939> volts<00:02:00.329> coming

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
12 volts instead of 40-plus volts coming

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.520 
12 volts instead of 40-plus volts coming
off<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.930> thing

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.050 

all<00:02:04.530> right<00:02:04.679> once<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.039> get<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.490> plug<00:02:05.729> loose

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
all right once you get the plug loose

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.639 
all right once you get the plug loose
you<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.659> want<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.929> work<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.289> little<00:02:07.409> rubber

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you just want to work the little rubber

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.580 
you just want to work the little rubber
boot<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.700> access<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:10.410> yellow

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
boot back and have access to the yellow

we<00:04:02.720> have<00:04:02.870> an<00:04:02.989> aftermarket<00:04:03.640> taillight<00:04:04.640> on<00:04:04.670> our

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
we have an aftermarket taillight on our

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.429 
we have an aftermarket taillight on our
so<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.480> colors<00:04:05.810> might<00:04:06.079> be<00:04:06.200> slightly

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
so the colors might be slightly

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.319 
so the colors might be slightly
different<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.069> it's<00:04:07.250> basically<00:04:07.760> going<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.180> be

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
different but it's basically going to be

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.809 
different but it's basically going to be
the<00:04:09.280> bottom<00:04:10.280> wire<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:12.230> when<00:04:12.409> you<00:04:12.790> remove<00:04:13.790> that

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
the bottom wire so when you remove that

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.029 
the bottom wire so when you remove that
plug<00:04:15.250> from<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.280> little<00:04:16.609> holder<00:04:17.090> there<00:04:18.039> with

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
plug from a little holder there with

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.140 
plug from a little holder there with
this<00:04:19.600> on<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.799> inside<00:04:21.949> the<00:04:22.550> way<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:22.760> came<00:04:22.940> off

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
this on the inside the way it came off

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.300 
this on the inside the way it came off
of<00:04:23.180> it<00:04:23.479> you're<00:04:24.050> gonna<00:04:24.169> tap<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.740> bottom<00:04:25.130> wire

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
of it you're gonna tap the bottom wire

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.000 
of it you're gonna tap the bottom wire
that's<00:04:25.550> your<00:04:25.729> 12-volt<00:04:26.060> Hotwire<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:27.620> can<00:04:27.770> test

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
that's your 12-volt Hotwire you can test

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.200 
that's your 12-volt Hotwire you can test
it<00:04:28.160> with<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.280> voltmeter<00:04:28.580> if<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.910> want<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.120> be

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
it with a voltmeter if you want to be

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.330 
it with a voltmeter if you want to be
sure<00:04:29.419> but<00:04:30.229> it's<00:04:30.380> gonna<00:04:30.500> be<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.740> bottom<00:04:31.100> wire

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
sure but it's gonna be the bottom wire

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.340 
sure but it's gonna be the bottom wire
when<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.510> have<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:33.639> clip<00:04:34.639> lock<00:04:34.880> here<00:04:35.350> facing

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
when you have that clip lock here facing

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.120 
when you have that clip lock here facing
towards<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:36.979> inside<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.789> bike<00:04:39.130> obviously
