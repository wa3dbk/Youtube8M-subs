we will put it into the press get to

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.569 
we will put it into the press get to
temperature<00:00:44.710> gauges<00:00:44.890> one<00:00:45.160> for<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.399> top

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.120 

and<00:00:57.730> first<00:00:58.060> I'm<00:00:58.240> gonna<00:00:58.390> cut<00:00:58.660> up<00:00:58.810> line<00:00:59.680> about<00:01:00.070> a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
and first I'm gonna cut up line about a

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.900 
and first I'm gonna cut up line about a
millimeter<00:01:00.880> or<00:01:01.120> so<00:01:01.330> thick<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:03.250> around<00:01:03.700> the

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
millimeter or so thick all around the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.870 
millimeter or so thick all around the
outside<00:01:04.360> edge<00:01:04.680> all<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.710> sprue<00:01:06.490> very

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
outside edge all the sprue very

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.180 
outside edge all the sprue very
carefully<00:01:07.510> I<00:01:08.790> counter<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.910> ring<00:01:10.150> I<00:01:11.190> carefully

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
carefully I counter the ring I carefully

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.830 
carefully I counter the ring I carefully
cut<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> inside<00:01:13.330> edge<00:01:13.360> here<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:15.720> lot<00:01:16.720> of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
cut to the inside edge here a lot of

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
cut to the inside edge here a lot of
tension<00:01:17.260> on<00:01:17.410> it<00:01:17.440> when<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.770> do<00:01:17.920> this<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.400> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
tension on it when you do this so it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.270 
tension on it when you do this so it
cuts<00:01:21.520> nice<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:22.000> clean

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.899 

square<00:01:27.280> corners<00:01:27.820> on<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.299> rubber<00:01:28.750> were<00:01:29.200> angled

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
square corners on the rubber were angled

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.700 
square corners on the rubber were angled
corners<00:01:30.909> anyway<00:01:31.210> help<00:01:31.420> keep<00:01:31.930> everything<00:01:32.229> line

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
corners anyway help keep everything line

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.670 
corners anyway help keep everything line
once<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.399> wax<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.240> injected<00:01:34.750> we<00:01:34.930> can<00:01:35.110> pop<00:01:35.470> it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
once the wax is injected we can pop it

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.240 
once the wax is injected we can pop it
out<00:01:35.799> unwrap<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:38.110> last<00:01:38.409> thing<00:01:38.770> up<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.220> little
