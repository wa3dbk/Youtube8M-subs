00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.309
 what's up big boys in this tutorial os 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.330
 I will teach a type of football that 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.200
 flame freak 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.200
 three steps 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.679
 and since there are three steps I will teach one 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.960
 by one we put ourselves in this position 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.359
 ass up stretched legs and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 hands clear on the floor not like that with 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.199
 fingers and arms more or less aligned 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.269
 in the shoulder and the weight in the middle and in 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.890
 arms or legs 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.000
 here is fine then the next 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.129
 step is I raise this arm I put this 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.909
 Heel type in the ass worth 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.909
 you see that it is supported 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.920
 some are worth it but this step we have to 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.740
 do directly 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.680
 then here we change 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:03.080
 we would put this arm this foot picks up 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.080
 I put this arm up a bit and go upstairs 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:12.229
 12 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.210
 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 and this part of here 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.720
 front does not come out play do this os 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.110
 you put like this you put this hand you change with 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.610
 that is the subject you do not change and now 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.860
 directly valera is like a small 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.899
 jump, jump, change a little jump 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.580
 you change trying to get the foot stretched 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.240
 arrive before the one that is shrunken and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.290
 it stretches is like 12 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.579
 1 2 and you can play as a little if you want 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.649
 then to climb do not forget that 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.770
 when you put your arm you have to go up 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.020
 the ass until up to school with 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.670
 game and here was an advice is that 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.170
 when you are in front of your hands 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.240
 go more or less to the level of 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.520
 feet and ass follow very forward os 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.170
 It will cost a lot and it's way behind you 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.000
 you will be falling that when you put the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.649
 palm of the hands the most common is that 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.270
 you're square because you do not get 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.350
 I do not know who has long arms like that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.350
 that now only practice remains 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.039
 so see you in the next tutorial 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.039
 to care for living
