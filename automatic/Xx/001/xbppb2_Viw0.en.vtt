here to talk about a few of the little
hints<00:00:14.610> which<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.940> picked<00:00:15.209> up<00:00:15.360> from<00:00:15.420> fallout

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
hints which I picked up from fallout

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.950 
hints which I picked up from fallout
shelter<00:00:16.950> the<00:00:17.910> amp<00:00:18.120> of<00:00:18.300> course<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:18.780> was

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
shelter the amp of course which was

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.890 
shelter the amp of course which was
released<00:00:19.170> by<00:00:19.770> Bethesda<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.700> the<00:00:21.240> iPhone<00:00:21.690> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
released by Bethesda for the iPhone and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.089 
released by Bethesda for the iPhone and
of<00:00:22.560> course<00:00:22.920> Android<00:00:23.640> devices<00:00:24.269> soon<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.830> I

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
of course Android devices soon so I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.910 
of course Android devices soon so I
believe<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.539> may<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.199> few<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
believe that there may be a few and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.210 
believe that there may be a few and
maybe<00:00:29.119> even<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.330> lot<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.839> little<00:00:31.650> features

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
maybe even a lot of little features

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.030 
maybe even a lot of little features
within<00:00:33.060> fallout<00:00:33.630> shelter<00:00:34.110> which<00:00:34.710> could

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
within fallout shelter which could

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.030 
within fallout shelter which could
indicate<00:00:35.360> to<00:00:36.360> us<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.780> little<00:00:37.380> bit<00:00:37.560> about<00:00:37.800> how

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
indicate to us a little bit about how

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.830 
indicate to us a little bit about how
fallout<00:00:38.460> 4<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.820> play<00:00:39.059> specifically<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
fallout 4 will play specifically in

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.500 
fallout 4 will play specifically in
regards<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.820> crafting<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.030> building

homes and settlement now the main thing
that<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.399> directly<00:00:48.120> translates

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that I can see which directly translates

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260 
that I can see which directly translates
into<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.590> gameplay<00:00:50.010> footage<00:00:50.430> which<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:51.059> have

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
element called safety so what exactly

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.460 
element called safety so what exactly
does<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.470> tell<00:01:19.770> us<00:01:20.210> well<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.540> means<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
does this tell us well it means that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.859 
does this tell us well it means that
most<00:01:22.829> likely<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.880> running<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.329> settlement

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
most likely when running a settlement

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.020 
most likely when running a settlement
we're<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.369> keep<00:01:26.549> up<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.729> our

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
we're going to have to keep up with our

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.200 
we're going to have to keep up with our
resources<00:01:27.600> food<00:01:28.049> water<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.710> power<00:01:28.970> much<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
resources food water and power much the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.569 
resources food water and power much the
same<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.840> did<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.229> fallout<00:01:31.979> shelter<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
same as we did in fallout shelter and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
same as we did in fallout shelter and
that<00:01:33.420> means<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.320> likely<00:01:34.500> have

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that means that we will likely have

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.120 
that means that we will likely have
stations<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.060> produce<00:01:36.329> food<00:01:37.229> water<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
stations which produce food water and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.490 
stations which produce food water and
power<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:39.720> three<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.049> these<00:01:40.259> are

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
power and all three of these are

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.960 
power and all three of these are
presented<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> us<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> gameplay<00:01:41.729> footage

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
presented to us in the gameplay footage

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.830 
presented to us in the gameplay footage
here<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.049> crops<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.680> producing<00:01:44.189> food

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
here we have crops for producing food

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.630 
here we have crops for producing food
here<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.049> water<00:01:46.259> pump<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.460> have

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
here we have water pump and here we have

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
here we have water pump and here we have
a<00:01:47.850> generator<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:49.110> course<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.799> are

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
a generator and of course there are

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
a generator and of course there are
tourists<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.520> safety<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.259> few<00:01:52.259> other

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
tourists for safety a few other

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
tourists for safety a few other
similarities<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:53.729> between<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
similarities that I can see between the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.530 
similarities that I can see between the
two<00:01:54.540> games<00:01:54.780> include<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.890> happiness<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.549> your

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
two games include the happiness of your

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.840 
two games include the happiness of your
dwellers<00:01:58.350> or<00:01:58.590> those<00:01:59.070> living<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.640> your

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
dwellers or those living in your

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.359 
dwellers or those living in your
settlement<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.079> I'm<00:02:01.290> assuming<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:02.009> whoever

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
settlement so I'm assuming that whoever

settlement so I'm assuming that whoever
lives<00:02:02.640> within<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:03.060> settlement<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.600> die

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
lives within your settlement can die

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.139 
lives within your settlement can die
just<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> same<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:05.039> in<00:02:05.070> shelter<00:02:05.670> and

just the same as they can in shelter and

just the same as they can in shelter and
of<00:02:06.329> course<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.110> size<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:08.070> your<00:02:08.130> setting<00:02:08.640> which

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
of course the size of your setting which

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.730 
of course the size of your setting which
you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.240> see<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.600> in<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> top<00:02:10.080> right<00:02:10.440> there

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.830 
what this size limit ends up being we'll
have<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.890> see<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.370> obviously<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:15.390> makes<00:02:15.540> sense

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
have to see but obviously it makes sense

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.530 
have to see but obviously it makes sense
for<00:02:15.990> bethesda<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.830> put<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.460> size<00:02:17.820> limit

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
for bethesda to put in a size limit

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.559 
for bethesda to put in a size limit
so<00:02:19.079> through<00:02:20.040> all<00:02:20.189> this<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:21.090> I'm<00:02:21.209> basically

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
so through all this what I'm basically

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.630 
so through all this what I'm basically
trying<00:02:21.689> to<00:02:21.989> indicate<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.769> fallout

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
trying to indicate is that fallout

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.599 
trying to indicate is that fallout
shelter<00:02:24.329> acts<00:02:24.569> as<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> perfect<00:02:25.319> primer<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
shelter acts as a perfect primer to the

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.399 
shelter acts as a perfect primer to the
base<00:02:26.909> building<00:02:27.239> which<00:02:27.629> will<00:02:27.870> occur<00:02:28.140> in

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
base building which will occur in

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.429 
base building which will occur in
fallout<00:02:28.829> 4<00:02:28.859> and<00:02:29.250> if<00:02:29.969> we<00:02:30.450> can<00:02:30.629> clearly<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.409> that

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
fallout 4 and if we can clearly see that

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.800 
fallout 4 and if we can clearly see that
these<00:02:32.069> elements<00:02:32.459> fallout<00:02:33.060> shelter<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.659> been

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
these elements fallout shelter have been

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.960 
these elements fallout shelter have been
brought<00:02:34.019> into<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.709> base<00:02:34.859> building<00:02:35.159> then<00:02:35.819> we

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
brought into the base building then we

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.640 
brought into the base building then we
can<00:02:36.090> probably<00:02:36.299> infer<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:37.019> lot<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.379> other<00:02:37.530> things

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
can probably infer a lot of other things

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.740 
can probably infer a lot of other things
about<00:02:38.069> what<00:02:38.430> might<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.819> brought<00:02:39.120> into<00:02:39.450> this

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
about what might be brought into this

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.589 
about what might be brought into this
element<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.290> fallout<00:02:40.769> force<00:02:41.010> gameplay<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:42.269> for

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
element of fallout force gameplay so for

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.679 
element of fallout force gameplay so for
example<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:43.769> ability<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.549> send<00:02:44.819> out<00:02:45.090> people

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
example the ability to send out people

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.330 
example the ability to send out people
into<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.230> wasteland<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.829> gather<00:02:47.040> resources

into the wasteland to gather resources

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.440 
into the wasteland to gather resources
may<00:02:48.239> be<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.480> feature<00:02:48.810> just<00:02:49.739> as<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.579> may<00:02:50.849> even<00:02:51.180> be
