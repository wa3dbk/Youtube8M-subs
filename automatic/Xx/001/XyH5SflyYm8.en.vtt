easier<00:01:11.990> there's<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.620> pretty<00:01:12.830> sweet<00:01:14.410> i<00:01:15.410> thought

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
easier there's a pretty sweet i thought

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.740

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
still a challenge of course i think for

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.910 
still a challenge of course i think for
a<00:01:19.130> half<00:01:19.280> marathon<00:01:19.460> how<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.090> feel<00:01:20.770> it's<00:01:21.770> a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
a half marathon how you feel it's a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.320 
a half marathon how you feel it's a
tough<00:01:21.950> course<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.580> lot<00:01:22.610> healthier<00:01:22.940> than<00:01:23.120> i

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
tough course a lot healthier than i
