00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.949
 of brouard regies have little hope but 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.780
 attention to this Brest training 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.059
 also disabled with falette and the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.449
 young man hanging marsal marshall and 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.250
 moimbÃ© 100 wounded brest has arguments 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.979
 to assert with verdi in attack 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.870
 but it is well clermont who shows 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.180
 the most offensive team from the start 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.260
 at home the Auvergnats are very 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.110
 present in the repair area 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.659
 adverse 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:59.000
 free kick well got on the side 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:01:00.979
 cleared by alexis thebal a guardian 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.659
 asked Brest but who for 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:08.720
 the moment resist the assaults 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:11.240
 clermontois that your corner with this 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.520
 recovery of the head always a thebaux 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.120
 excellent to allow brest to 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.120
 stay tied 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.050
 Clermont largely dominated the first 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.240
 period but did not find the opening 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.550
 at half-time 0 to 0 between the two 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.650
 teams 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.140
 brest has won only one of its 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.770
 last eight matches the situation is 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.370
 worrying for the Breton side 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.140
 Clermont 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.120
 only one win over the last 5 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.240
 matches but a prestigious victory and 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.530
 on the previous day 2 0 on the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.180
 angers lawn that has given back 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.960
 confidence in the Clermont was seen in 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.760
 First period 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.590
 and beware of Brest in the 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.620
 second with this recovery of the head 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.110
 it's right next to the head of 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.090
 geoffrey last and the reaction 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.320
 clermontoise with this shot is saved 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.070
 by alexis thebaux for the moment 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.070
 the man of the match 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.280
 than attempts for Clermont 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.910
 but it does not smile for the team 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.580
 governed brouard 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.440
 the minutes pass and it continues to 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.819
 hit on the crossbar this 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.550
 once again this is an opportunity with this shot 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.360
 crossed right next to the pole there is to 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.970
 the enthusiasm 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.700
 there are beautiful collective movements 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.230
 but still not this reward 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.330
 watch out for this action in the heart of the game 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.980
 referee who designates the penalty spot 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.489
 test transformed by yannis salibur 89th 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.110
 minute 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.230
 it took a lot of patience to 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.690
 clermont to afford this third goal 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:53.760
 purpose of the season for dirty wall 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.549
 brest will not recover victories to 2 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.849
 clearly in extremis 1-0 against the 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.849
 brest stadium 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.290
 years 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.230
 right here
