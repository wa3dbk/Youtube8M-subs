00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 very good guys welcome 1 video 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.069
 curiosities and this time more about 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.870
 skeletons these creatures that 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.450
 surely everyone knew at least me 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.849
 I think it's the most sodium since 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.259
 has a lot of marksmanship in the last 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.049
 versions have been improved a lot the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.820
 aim at these creatures u and yes there's 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.590
 animals for wants farm well 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.449
 I keep saying it 's let 's go to the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.539
 diversity of the skeletons but it's that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.760
 there are a lot of advertisements there would be a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.320
 million but good not so many but 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.510
 it's really going to give me for several 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640
 episodes then they will be about two or 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.500
 three episodes followed by curiosities 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.450
 just about the skeletons today we're going to 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.739
 see five and to see them we have to 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.140
 catch the first and a little bit of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.260
 team since they can give us very strong 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.020
 we put on this, let's play 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.610
 but not even better just in case this for 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 here I take my head off I put the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.590
 helmet that is safer and we are going to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.390
 place here the first thing that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.059
 explain is that the skeletons when you 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 they hit you what are you doing here reveal this 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.379
 against me for god the first thing they do 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.660
 is he wants the skeletons when he 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.790
 the creature is always attached to a creature 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.690
 rebels there are some cases that I do not like 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.690
 it's the clip 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.940
 and I do not fall I think there's another one but 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.680
 that is not revealed in the writing but as 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.100
 says see now as to the writer of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.100
 disparate 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.540
 here is for me 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.490
 they should see me shoot me or is I run in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.920
 1.8 not see through its blocks that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 what happens now I do not know what happened it looks 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.370
 there was a wall in the middle but now it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.680
 they are hitting each other and until 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.090
 one of them dies and they will not stop anymore 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.070
 losing pile because it 's all during 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 the first one a crush and they get angry 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.150
 between them but good as you see has 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.870
 only one victorious petrolÃ­ remained 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.010
 upstairs you have these fences now 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.780
 seen in the secrets do not happen to 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.760
 through the fences I'm from 1.8 should 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.770
 be a little bit so nothing does not 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.750
 you worry that soon they fix it another 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.340
 cosilla are the plays have if we break 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.960
 here also to be shot because 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.780
 if you are not going to see 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.780
 for skeleton is he shoots at blaze 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.880
 written shoot me 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.119
 now venable the turn to shoot me 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.950
 skeletons alone there you are worth as 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.869
 you see they have bounced between them the place 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.800
 You will load and you look there are is 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.780
 hitting physical and element to burn 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.340
 As you can see, it is operating between them and 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.260
 happens with all the creatures 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.760
 taking out I think it's the clipper and another 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.350
 more and also go with the pigments 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.950
 with something special that I'm going to mention 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.599
 first I will teach that it works 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.989
 to see this for here we open the 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.849
 trapdoor behind the writer shoots 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.190
 but the pigment I think is how it has 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.480
 the fence does not realize if the 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.190
 skeleton that is does not reach 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.190
 skeleton to see now they are together 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.620
 there is nothing less to be revoked 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.620
 and if the bank as we will not be firm 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.800
 and bad is positive has not bounced but 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.819
 the thing that with the pigments richly 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.530
 they bounce they get against the 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.480
 skeleton only attacks the first affected 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.130
 that is, they do not call colleagues as 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.080
 us who did not go out much 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.180
 calling all the first ones that have 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.459
 close in this case it would not happen with 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.230
 skeletons does not happen that if one with 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.730
 curiosities you see that 1.8 has a couple 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.670
 of failed by the I will explain the same 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.300
 equally one of them own 1.8 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.130
 is that if we put a wolf here 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.350
 and if we put a writing here next 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.150
 As you can see the wolf is angry at once and 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.430
 if we turn to Ivan the Wolf 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.950
 a skeleton like this but this is not the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.480
 not as you see the wolf follows the written and 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.709
 is that tweeting to hide and only 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.750
 try to hide I think I do not know 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.370
 defend but let's try it again 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.920
 if he defends himself but explains if insurance 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.890
 that I do not just strap on I do not know what's 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.109
 cornered trap is defended but as 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.090
 you see nothing nothing they are loaded 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.890
 they load directly because this is new 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.269
 of 1.8 and is that the wolves attack the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.879
 skeletons I think I had already seen it in 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.069
 the video about the wolves but good 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.409
 that we have another thing again is 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.060
 that if we go here to the never go to 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.250
 create a skeleton of the sumo cne 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.799
 deny it directly and that is that now 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.060
 when we create a skeleton in any 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.510
 part of hell there is a small 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.269
 possibility that there are skeletons by 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.680
 here that they leave widder skeleton like 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.979
 You see the first exit to the first 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.239
 again they almost always come out but as 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.880
 you see also know that these normals 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.280
 Last kill or die and let me die 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.380
 that total as well as vice to the written 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.990
 normal writing your video is the same 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.729
 egg the same is pauner be here the 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.920
 general skeleton that when we're 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.650
 then generate the widgets 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.690
 but also the strengths as you have 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.620
 seen and sometimes written 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.680
 normal because they share the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.570
 same and so to speak and there is a 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.490
 priority of leaving a race 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.110
 make another one for the 4 known one that already 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.910
 you know we're going to see only five 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.200
 five more basic since afterwards it goes to 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.180
 start the straw with the following 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.640
 videos will create a bit of hype 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.320
 nothing more and is that the writings always 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.030
 we always see ourselves always 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.640
 under a tree or in a pond 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.900
 water or poetry of these because they do this 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.930
 simply because if we place a 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.120
 outdoor skeleton under the sun it 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.770
 it will press burn it can be done if it goes 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.560
 to start looking for a very fast shadow 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.690
 is moving randomly until 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.880
 you find in a radius of three or 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.380
 four blocks there is a tree in 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.310
 As long as we are not able to approach, I am going to 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.020
 do this to start reading now and 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.300
 is going to run for brito as you see this 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.560
 it also finishes detecting this motive now 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.110
 under the tree a little bit is here 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.550
 late but this colleague so if it saves 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.770
 and if they do not get into a tree because they do not 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.910
 there are going to be put in about water that 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.169
 I suppose if I put one here very close 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.999
 of the water 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.199
 prefers the tree but another of the 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:43.090
 options is to stay in the water as 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.759
 You see, I need you to relax in the water 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.460
 because in more than 16 parties start 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.169
 to climb to mode will and grace under 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.180
 tree and is a bit to everyone who is 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.189
 come and the truth is that they annoy us 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.900
 quite the existence when we passed 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:57.219
 for about a forest as dresses 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.930
 fruit that has been assembled here colleagues 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.310
 It's already getting dark and there's nothing 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.719
 like a good costume party like that 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.909
 that we are going to bring the last guest the 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:06.580
 last curiosity of the night of the day of 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:09.699
 where when you are watching it and it is that 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.499
 there is a kind of a montage of 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.580
 skeletons that looks like a rabbit is 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:15.430
 pretty popular it gets pretty 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.319
 popular this is simply a skeleton 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.999
 with another skeleton upside down has 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.740
 mounted on the first skeleton with 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.629
 a carrot in your hand as you see here 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.639
 they coincide their arms is an arm by 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.779
 on top of the other created to be used 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.120
 a little bit rounder but neither 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.319
 much has been rare stomach and the 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.950
 true that a rabbit has a 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.480
 belly pretty ugly but 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.130
 then all this if we're going to 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.140
 reverse as a rabbit but with the 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.260
 carrot down then simply 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.210
 that 5 curiosities for today tomorrow not 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.070
 but from here two days booster another video 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.080
 new with a lot more coesida day 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.720
 you know videos every Wednesday and 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.010
 every Saturday and they're all here 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.630
 writings putting pressure on you to 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.460
 let's go so we'll see each other in the 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.460
 next video trocha or dad 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.830
 very good
