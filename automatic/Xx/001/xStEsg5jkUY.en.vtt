00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
ladder to show you it in action now this

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
ladder to show you it in action now this
thing<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:27.990> very<00:00:28.170> very<00:00:28.410> fast<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.400> we

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
thing is very very fast you can see we

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.519 
thing is very very fast you can see we
are<00:00:30.029> moving<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.539> very<00:00:30.599> quickly<00:00:31.170> we're

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
are moving up very quickly we're

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.650 
are moving up very quickly we're
actually<00:00:31.710> traveling<00:00:32.430> around<00:00:32.880> 18<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
actually traveling around 18 and a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
actually traveling around 18 and a
quarter<00:00:33.870> blocks<00:00:34.829> per<00:00:35.070> second<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
quarter blocks per second so it is a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.450 
quarter blocks per second so it is a
very<00:00:36.090> fast<00:00:36.360> way<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:37.200> transport<00:00:37.590> vertically<00:00:38.280> in

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
very fast way to transport vertically in

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.530 
very fast way to transport vertically in
Minecraft<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> build<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> you're<00:00:42.390> going

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
Minecraft so to build this you're going

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
Minecraft so to build this you're going
to<00:00:42.629> need<00:00:42.750> an<00:00:42.989> area<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.440> land<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.890> five<00:00:44.250> by

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to need an area of land that is five by

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
to need an area of land that is five by
five<00:00:44.760> blocks<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.570> mainly<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.170> for

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
five blocks and that's mainly just for

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.900 
five blocks and that's mainly just for
the<00:00:46.410> cobblestone<00:00:46.920> wall<00:00:47.160> down<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> bottom

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the cobblestone wall down at the bottom

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
the cobblestone wall down at the bottom
here<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.140> doesn't<00:00:49.379> take<00:00:49.530> up

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
here as you can see it doesn't take up

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
here as you can see it doesn't take up
too<00:00:49.860> much<00:00:49.890> space<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.789> goes<00:00:50.910> upwards<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
too much space but as it goes upwards it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.170 
too much space but as it goes upwards it
also<00:00:51.809> expands<00:00:52.469> outwards<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.250> well<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.059> for

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
also expands outwards as well so for

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.209 
also expands outwards as well so for
every<00:00:54.449> 16<00:00:54.930> blocks<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> goes<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.980> it's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
every 16 blocks that it goes up it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069 
every 16 blocks that it goes up it's
going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.730> outwards<00:00:57.180> by<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.690> block<00:00:57.899> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
going to go outwards by one block in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.349 
going to go outwards by one block in
that<00:00:58.230> direction<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.579> direction<00:00:59.640> as

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that direction and that direction as

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.959 
that direction and that direction as
well<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> build<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.500> segment<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> 16<00:01:02.670> blocks

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
well so to build a segment of 16 blocks

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.429 
well so to build a segment of 16 blocks
you're<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> need<00:01:03.629> two<00:01:03.780> ender<00:01:04.019> chests

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

to show you how to build this I'm just
going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> build<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.420> in

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
going to build it as if I was in

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
going to build it as if I was in
survival<00:01:25.110> obviously<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> creative<00:01:25.950> but

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
one thing to keep in mind is that I've

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.950 
one thing to keep in mind is that I've
got<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> background<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
got this in the background as a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
got this in the background as a
reference<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.220> extremely

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
reference which is going to be extremely

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
reference which is going to be extremely
useful<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:33.180> showing<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> build

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
useful when showing you how to build

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
useful when showing you how to build
this<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.799> maybe<00:01:35.460> you'd<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.939> reference

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
this and maybe you'd want a reference

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.340 
this and maybe you'd want a reference
but<00:01:36.509> you're<00:01:36.659> probably<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> be

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
but you're probably going to be

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.920 
but you're probably going to be
following<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:38.280> video<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.570> we've

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
following this video as it is so we've

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.450 
following this video as it is so we've
got<00:01:40.020> our<00:01:40.140> basic<00:01:40.350> blocks<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.040> place<00:01:41.250> what

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
got our basic blocks here in place what

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.380 
got our basic blocks here in place what
we're<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.820> doing<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.210> we're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
we're going to be doing as we're

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
we're going to be doing as we're
building<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.110> pillar<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.159> alongside<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
building this is pillar up alongside it

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
building this is pillar up alongside it
so<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> build<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> we're<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.470> be

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so we can build it and we're going to be

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.530 
so we can build it and we're going to be
jumping<00:01:46.979> onto<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.520> place<00:01:47.729> down<00:01:47.939> blocks<00:01:48.270> as

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
jumping onto it to place down blocks as

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
jumping onto it to place down blocks as
well<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.170> we're<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.070> doing<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
well and we're also going to be doing a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
well and we're also going to be doing a
lot<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.759> placing<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> removing<00:01:51.899> blocks

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
lot of this placing and removing blocks

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.649 
lot of this placing and removing blocks
as<00:01:52.619> well<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.979> pay<00:01:53.189> attention<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.820> me<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.149> I'm

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
as well so pay attention to me as I'm

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.510 
as well so pay attention to me as I'm
doing<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.140> these<00:01:55.619> ender<00:01:55.979> chests<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
doing that these ender chests that I

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.190 
doing that these ender chests that I
just<00:01:56.790> placed<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.270> need<00:01:57.450> cobblestone<00:01:57.960> walls

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
just placed they need cobblestone walls

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
just placed they need cobblestone walls
alongside<00:01:58.680> them<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.759> thing<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.119> note

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
alongside them and one thing to note

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.630 
alongside them and one thing to note
here<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.810> we're<00:02:01.409> building<00:02:01.829> something<00:02:02.340> on

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
here is that we're building something on

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.160 
here is that we're building something on
one<00:02:02.759> side<00:02:03.060> then<00:02:03.270> we're<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.780> by<00:02:03.960> one

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
one side then we're going up by one

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.319 
one side then we're going up by one
block<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.649> mirroring<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.820> other<00:02:06.000> side

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
block and mirroring it on the other side

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.600 
block and mirroring it on the other side
and<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.659> alternates<00:02:07.140> each<00:02:07.409> time<00:02:07.770> as<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.429> up

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and it alternates each time as we go up

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.360 
and it alternates each time as we go up
so<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> next<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.470> us<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.800> build<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so the next one is for us to build the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
so the next one is for us to build the
cobblestone<00:02:11.910> ball<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.239> stretches<00:02:12.660> all<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
cobblestone ball that stretches all the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.770 
cobblestone ball that stretches all the
way<00:02:12.989> across<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.530> we

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
way across and we

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.470 
way across and we
jump<00:02:14.050> over<00:02:14.709> onto<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> side<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.240> little

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
jump over onto that side and a little

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.090 
jump over onto that side and a little
tip<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.050> hold<00:02:17.200> down<00:02:17.290> shift<00:02:17.740> when<00:02:17.980> you're

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
tip is to hold down shift when you're

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.040 
tip is to hold down shift when you're
landing<00:02:18.550> just<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.300> make<00:02:19.480> sure<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.870> don't

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
landing just so you make sure you don't

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.020 
landing just so you make sure you don't
walk<00:02:20.800> off<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.130> edge<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.550> block<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:21.970> you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
walk off the edge of the block as you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.760 
walk off the edge of the block as you
land<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:22.780> we're<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.050> mirroring<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.530> wall

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
land so we're just mirroring this wall

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.430 
land so we're just mirroring this wall
again<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:25.420> isn't<00:02:25.600> high<00:02:25.930> enough<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.319> need

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
again and that isn't high enough we need

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.710 
again and that isn't high enough we need
to<00:02:26.530> go<00:02:26.650> up<00:02:26.860> by<00:02:27.069> one<00:02:27.280> more<00:02:27.459> block<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.090> then

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
to go up by one more block and then

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.710 
to go up by one more block and then
place<00:02:28.930> our<00:02:29.230> wall<00:02:29.440> over<00:02:29.800> on<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.100> side<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
place our wall over on this side so the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.180 
place our wall over on this side so the
next<00:02:31.900> thing<00:02:32.080> after<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.530> wall<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.010> fence

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
next thing after the wall is the fence

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.130 
next thing after the wall is the fence
post<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:33.819> goes<00:02:34.000> above<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.450> cobblestone

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
post that goes above the cobblestone

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.440 
post that goes above the cobblestone
walls<00:02:35.350> down<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.850> at<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.239> height

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
walls down there so just at that height

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.479 
walls down there so just at that height
and<00:02:37.750> we're<00:02:38.290> going<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.470> need<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.770> pull<00:02:39.160> her<00:02:39.250> up<00:02:39.310> a

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
and we're going to need to pull her up a

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.860 
and we're going to need to pull her up a
little<00:02:39.520> bit<00:02:39.760> more<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.120> place<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> next<00:02:40.720> one

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
little bit more to place to the next one

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.590 
little bit more to place to the next one
like<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.100> then<00:02:42.520> we<00:02:42.640> have<00:02:42.850> our<00:02:43.060> iron<00:02:43.360> bars

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
like so and then we have our iron bars

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.009 
like so and then we have our iron bars
now<00:02:43.840> these<00:02:44.080> are<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.709> top<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:46.390> fence<00:02:46.690> post

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
now these are on top of the fence post

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.590 
now these are on top of the fence post
and<00:02:47.200> then<00:02:47.350> they<00:02:47.470> go<00:02:47.620> back<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:48.130> inwards<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:49.510> if

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
and then they go back in inwards so if

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.900 
and then they go back in inwards so if
we<00:02:49.750> hop<00:02:49.930> over<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.620> place<00:02:50.800> down<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.640> iron

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
we hop over here and place down the iron

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.940 
we hop over here and place down the iron
bars<00:02:52.120> below<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.959> then<00:02:53.140> put<00:02:53.350> another<00:02:53.530> one

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
bars below and then put another one

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.800 
bars below and then put another one
behind<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.400> like<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.820> we<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.120> hop<00:02:55.300> back<00:02:55.480> and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
behind it like that we can hop back and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.320 
behind it like that we can hop back and
remove<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:57.040> block<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.610> then<00:02:57.730> do<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.030> exact

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
remove that block and then do the exact

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.250 
remove that block and then do the exact
same<00:02:58.540> thing<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.200> side<00:02:59.500> over<00:03:00.130> here<00:03:01.260> like

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
same thing on this side over here like

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.680 
same thing on this side over here like
so<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.860> then<00:03:03.430> pop<00:03:03.700> back<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.090> that's<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.420> first

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
so and then pop back so that's the first

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.750 
so and then pop back so that's the first
set<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.900> iron<00:03:05.200> bars<00:03:05.350> these<00:03:05.980> second<00:03:06.400> ones<00:03:06.550> are

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
set of iron bars these second ones are

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.400 
set of iron bars these second ones are
going<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.060> be<00:03:07.239> pointing<00:03:07.660> away<00:03:07.959> but<00:03:08.230> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
going to be pointing away but the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.590 
going to be pointing away but the
they're<00:03:09.069> going<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.400> be<00:03:09.550> above<00:03:09.910> these<00:03:10.150> ones<00:03:10.420> so

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
they're going to be above these ones so

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.380 
they're going to be above these ones so
we're<00:03:11.050> going<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.230> come<00:03:11.440> up<00:03:11.560> here<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.239> put<00:03:13.239> one

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
we're going to come up here and put one

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.020 
we're going to come up here and put one
down<00:03:13.600> there<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.170> then<00:03:14.350> behind<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.130> then

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
down there and then behind it and then

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.170 
down there and then behind it and then
hop<00:03:16.239> back<00:03:16.980> remove<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.190> block<00:03:18.459> place<00:03:18.760> another

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
hop back remove that block place another

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.660 
hop back remove that block place another
one<00:03:19.420> on<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.630> side<00:03:19.840> jump<00:03:20.470> over<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.010> do<00:03:21.549> the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
one on that side jump over and do the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.340 
one on that side jump over and do the
same<00:03:21.700> thing<00:03:22.120> again<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.690> iron<00:03:22.900> bars<00:03:23.110> on<00:03:23.320> top

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
same thing again so the iron bars on top

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.199 
same thing again so the iron bars on top
of<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.680> block<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:24.220> one<00:03:24.430> behind<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.910> jump

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
of the block and then one behind it jump

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.600 
of the block and then one behind it jump
back<00:03:25.360> onto<00:03:25.570> this<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.829> is<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.100> next<00:03:27.370> set

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
back onto this and that is the next set

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.250 
back onto this and that is the next set
of<00:03:27.730> iron<00:03:28.000> bars<00:03:28.150> done<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.810> next<00:03:28.989> thing<00:03:29.230> for

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
of iron bars done so the next thing for

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.410 
of iron bars done so the next thing for
us<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.620> do<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.519> block<00:03:30.760> with<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.150> trap

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
us to do is the block with the trap

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.630 
us to do is the block with the trap
doors<00:03:31.690> on<00:03:31.840> front<00:03:32.049> of<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:32.320> they<00:03:32.560> are<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:33.220> top<00:03:33.430> of

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
doors on front of it they are on top of

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.120 
doors on front of it they are on top of
these<00:03:33.760> two<00:03:34.060> so<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.650> block<00:03:35.650> will<00:03:35.829> go<00:03:35.920> at<00:03:36.040> the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
these two so the block will go at the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.759 
these two so the block will go at the
back<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.910> trap<00:03:37.180> dalgo<00:03:37.660> at<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.870> front<00:03:38.170> like<00:03:38.380> so

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
back the trap dalgo at the front like so

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.210 
back the trap dalgo at the front like so
and<00:03:39.070> what<00:03:39.700> we<00:03:39.790> probably<00:03:40.060> want<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:40.360> do<00:03:40.510> here<00:03:40.870> is

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
and what we probably want to do here is

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.610 
and what we probably want to do here is
go<00:03:42.220> behind<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:43.810> so<00:03:43.900> we<00:03:43.989> can<00:03:44.140> put<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.380> lever

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
go behind just so we can put that lever

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.550 
go behind just so we can put that lever
on<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:45.070> pair<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.640> let's<00:03:45.790> do<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.060> quickly

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
on and pair it so let's do that quickly

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.190 
on and pair it so let's do that quickly
thanks<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.570> then<00:03:49.570> we<00:03:49.660> want<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.930> jump<00:03:50.140> back

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
thanks so and then we want to jump back

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.160 
thanks so and then we want to jump back
there<00:03:51.190> we<00:03:51.280> go<00:03:51.400> we<00:03:51.579> made<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.840> next<00:03:53.049> one

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
there we go we made it so the next one

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.750 
there we go we made it so the next one
is<00:03:53.260> pretty<00:03:53.440> simple<00:03:53.859> it's<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.040> ladders<00:03:54.519> let's

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
is pretty simple it's just ladders let's

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.150 
is pretty simple it's just ladders let's
go<00:03:54.940> up<00:03:55.030> by<00:03:55.180> two<00:03:55.239> on<00:03:55.570> either<00:03:55.780> side<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.410> put<00:03:57.040> the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
go up by two on either side and put the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.460 
go up by two on either side and put the
ladders<00:03:57.519> on<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.940> front<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.420> then<00:03:59.109> we<00:03:59.290> have

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
ladders on the front and then we have

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.370 
ladders on the front and then we have
the<00:03:59.650> ones<00:03:59.859> with<00:03:59.980> nothing<00:04:00.400> on<00:04:00.519> at<00:04:00.700> all<00:04:01.380> like

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
the ones with nothing on at all like

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.250 
the ones with nothing on at all like
that<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.730> now<00:04:03.940> we<00:04:04.000> are<00:04:04.269> back<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.720> where<00:04:05.049> we

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
that so now we are back to where we

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.470 
that so now we are back to where we
started<00:04:05.370> when<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:06.579> built<00:04:06.880> this<00:04:06.970> at<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.209> bottom

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
started when we built this at the bottom

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.930 
started when we built this at the bottom
we<00:04:07.570> had<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.690> fence<00:04:07.959> post<00:04:08.079> underneath<00:04:08.709> this<00:04:09.609> and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
we had a fence post underneath this and

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.910 
we had a fence post underneath this and
a<00:04:10.060> chest<00:04:10.329> that<00:04:10.630> was<00:04:10.750> there<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.230> that's<00:04:11.739> the

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
a chest that was there and that's the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.680 
a chest that was there and that's the
whole<00:04:12.070> thing<00:04:12.250> starting<00:04:12.880> over<00:04:13.090> again<00:04:13.390> so<00:04:13.540> one

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
whole thing starting over again so one

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.030 
whole thing starting over again so one
thing<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.989> notice<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.350> we've<00:04:14.470> actually<00:04:14.650> gone

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
thing to notice that we've actually gone

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.219 
thing to notice that we've actually gone
in<00:04:15.370> by<00:04:15.850> one<00:04:16.090> block<00:04:16.299> now<00:04:16.539> so<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.840> could<00:04:17.049> bring

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
in by one block now so you could bring

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.080 
in by one block now so you could bring
your<00:04:17.380> pillar<00:04:17.650> forward<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:18.190> then<00:04:18.820> just

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
your pillar forward and then just

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.279 
your pillar forward and then just
continue<00:04:19.299> building<00:04:20.229> this<00:04:20.500> thing<00:04:20.560> upwards<00:04:22.289> so

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
continue building this thing upwards so

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.110 
continue building this thing upwards so
when<00:04:23.530> you've<00:04:23.680> got<00:04:23.710> as<00:04:23.950> high<00:04:24.159> as<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.729> want<00:04:24.760> to

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
when you've got as high as you want to

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.490 
when you've got as high as you want to
go<00:04:25.330> you're<00:04:25.720> going<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.900> be<00:04:25.990> building<00:04:26.229> a

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
go you're going to be building a

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.060 
go you're going to be building a
platform

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
platform

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.830 
platform
up<00:04:27.250> at<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.430> top<00:04:27.670> here<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:28.150> wanna<00:04:28.480> hop<00:04:28.600> onto

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
up at the top here you wanna hop onto

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.360 
up at the top here you wanna hop onto
this<00:04:29.050> block<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.590> side<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.070> just<00:04:30.310> pull

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
this block on the side and just pull

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.820 
this block on the side and just pull
this<00:04:30.640> one<00:04:30.850> around<00:04:31.300> like<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.710> will

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
this one around like so and that will

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.500 
this one around like so and that will
allow<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.130> horse<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.730> move<00:04:33.940> on<00:04:34.120> top<00:04:34.300> of<00:04:34.420> this

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
allow the horse to move on top of this

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.180 
allow the horse to move on top of this
block<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:34.990> then<00:04:35.140> be<00:04:35.260> able<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.560> push<00:04:35.740> up<00:04:35.920> onto

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
block and then be able to push up onto

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.950 
block and then be able to push up onto
these<00:04:36.820> blocks<00:04:37.120> here<00:04:37.300> where<00:04:37.510> you<00:04:37.600> can<00:04:37.750> build

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
these blocks here where you can build

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.600 
these blocks here where you can build
your<00:04:38.140> platform<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.800> then<00:04:39.220> when<00:04:39.370> you're<00:04:39.490> done

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
your platform and then when you're done

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.980 
your platform and then when you're done
with<00:04:39.670> that<00:04:39.940> you've<00:04:40.090> got<00:04:40.300> all<00:04:40.420> of<00:04:40.450> these<00:04:40.660> blocks

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
with that you've got all of these blocks

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.200 
with that you've got all of these blocks
down<00:04:41.230> here<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.620> remove<00:04:41.860> going<00:04:42.190> all<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.490> way<00:04:42.520> to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
down here to remove going all the way to

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.270 
down here to remove going all the way to
the<00:04:43.330> bottom

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
the bottom

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.920 
the bottom
so<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.460> proper<00:04:45.730> thing<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:45.970> do<00:04:46.270> is<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.660> test

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
so the proper thing to do is to test

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.750 
so the proper thing to do is to test
this<00:04:47.080> one<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:47.530> we<00:04:47.620> built<00:04:47.890> in<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.190> tutorial

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
this one that we built in the tutorial

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.640 
this one that we built in the tutorial
so<00:04:48.910> let's<00:04:49.090> move<00:04:49.300> forward<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.170> can<00:04:50.350> see<00:04:50.530> we

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
so let's move forward and you can see we

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.240 
so let's move forward and you can see we
go<00:04:50.800> all<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.040> way<00:04:51.160> up<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.610> top<00:04:51.820> as<00:04:51.970> expected

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
go all the way up to the top as expected

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.200 
go all the way up to the top as expected
so<00:04:54.250> that<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.670> for<00:04:54.700> this<00:04:54.940> minecraft

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
so that is it for this minecraft

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.300 
so that is it for this minecraft
