00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
your race today was a little bit

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.710 
your race today was a little bit
difficult<00:00:15.830> yeah<00:00:17.150> definitely<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.359> say<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
difficult yeah definitely to say the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570 
difficult yeah definitely to say the
least<00:00:18.750> but<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.590> know<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:19.890> started<00:00:20.160> out<00:00:20.400> good

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
least but you know we started out good

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.759 
least but you know we started out good
yesterday<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.720> pretty<00:00:21.840> rough<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.560> showed

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
yesterday was pretty rough but we showed

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.150 
yesterday was pretty rough but we showed
up<00:00:22.949> today<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:23.789> pretty<00:00:23.880> good<00:00:24.090> pace<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
up today with some pretty good pace and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.470 
up today with some pretty good pace and
you<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> race<00:00:26.550> started<00:00:26.880> out<00:00:27.029> good<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
you know the race started out good and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.900 
you know the race started out good and
when<00:00:27.930> Nana<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.320> past<00:00:28.560> us<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.949> decided<00:00:29.429> you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
when Nana got past us we decided you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
when Nana got past us we decided you
know<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:31.050> let<00:00:31.199> him<00:00:31.320> only<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.679> three

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
know that to let him only have three

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.350 
know that to let him only have three
seconds<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.969> could<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.180> had<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
seconds and I think we could have had a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080 
seconds and I think we could have had a
race<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.960> end<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.309> then<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> engine<00:00:35.850> blew

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
race at the end and then the engine blew

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.819 
race at the end and then the engine blew
on<00:00:36.120> my<00:00:36.780> don't<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.050> through<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.500> third<00:00:37.710> or

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
on my don't know through the third or

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.920 
on my don't know through the third or
fourth<00:00:38.040> lap<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.700> our<00:00:39.090> race<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.510> over<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
fourth lap and then our race was over so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.770 
fourth lap and then our race was over so
it<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.079> pretty<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> last<00:00:41.910> race<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.420> on

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
home soil was disappointing and also a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970

friends and family and i am a crew back
at<00:00:54.690> Laguna<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:57.090> me<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.480> been

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
at Laguna but it's for me it's been

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
at Laguna but it's for me it's been
pretty<00:00:58.050> much<00:00:58.260> held<00:00:58.800> two<00:00:59.100> weeks<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.789> two

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
pretty much held two weeks or two

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.090 
pretty much held two weeks or two
weekends<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.739> been<00:01:01.920> like

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
weekends but you know it's been like

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.619 
weekends but you know it's been like
that<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.309> me<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.699> think<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> past<00:01:03.420> six

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that for me I think for the past six

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.140 
that for me I think for the past six
months<00:01:03.739> it's<00:01:04.739> we're<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
months it's we're doing what we can and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.730 
months it's we're doing what we can and
I<00:01:06.240> think<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.600> put<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> show<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> fans

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
I think we put on a show for the fans

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.010 
I think we put on a show for the fans
for<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> first<00:01:08.970> couple<00:01:09.180> laps<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.810> saw
