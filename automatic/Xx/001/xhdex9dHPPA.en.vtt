 mind bleached hair 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.300

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.550

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.179
 which even appears to you 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.269
 a good tournament did not inflict after all 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.550
 frequent washing of the head is not washed off 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.620
 gradually and here it is the yellowness 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.019
 it comes therefore easily from this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 get rid of with the help and purple 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.530
 shampoo or conditioner and such 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.800
 conditioners and shampoo are different 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.229
 brands of different brands my year for example 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.670
 by year 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.639
 but even if you do not find me 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.429
 air conditioning and a brand 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:03.350
 then I know for example in rare there is 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.299
 brand redken 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.340
 purple shampoo and conditioner for 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.400
 blondes and other brands of course 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.140
 too, so just keep yours 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.030
 eyes open and i'm sure you will find 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 the fact that war wheel collapse means 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.510
 purple hue this is just 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.120
 he is on the opposite of yellow that is for that 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.590
 to make the bummer neutral just 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.730
 we need such an easy bed 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.040
 purple shade and on 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.930
 what i want to say by the way purple 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.760
 shampoos and conditioners can also 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.610
 use brunettes those brunettes 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.280
 who want their hair to be 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 such a more neutral reflux 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.550
 since even those are reddish beautiful 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.690
 chestnut shades when washing it off 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.500
 which occurs with frequent washing 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.960
 heads 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.570
 they become such some kind of copper 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.170
 and somewhat unappealing therefore 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.400
 even if your hair is dark you too 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.050
 can use 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.960
 which means violet shampoos and 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.060
 air conditioners can use it 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.220
 owners of red hair with red 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
 shades and especially such eggplant 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.050
 new shades 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.300
 they also benefit from the fact that 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.970
 you consume them a little and these 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 shades with violet shampoos and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.680
 air conditioners 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.830
 it fights an impact on many such 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.080
 small but with regular 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.720
 use all the same here these 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.400
 purple shampoo and conditioner and they 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.390
 struggling here it's yellowing 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.820
 and such a copper tint unpleasant 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.459
 very nice next in session 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.450
 you want to get rid of such brass 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.870
 shade that arises 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.940
 mean already in more brown-haired women and brunettes 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.800
 it is best used in this 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.230
 case 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.400

 this is blue pigment and blue it just 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.769
 opposite 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.390
 orange is from copper pigment then 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.100

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.230
 toner toners 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.989
 it's just paints that don't have 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.060
 so strong ammonia in them and they 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.320
 Of course it is not washed off quickly 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.690
 permanent paint 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.940
 but they can be found everywhere in boxes and 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.579
