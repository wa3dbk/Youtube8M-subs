 his Dusseldorf gallery is an important one for many art lovers 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.480
 His network has grown over the decades 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.560
 on this day

 Maier showed his latest appraiser his most important customers but sense 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.130
 Private collectors and not the museums because the purchase is often one of them 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 lengthy process part 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.570
 Hans Maier knows the art market Sony only a few 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.850
 He is convinced that the prices will continue to rise people 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.089
 Now interested in culture and the arts 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.229
 this has become so much bigger 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.839
 but the churches of quality and pictures and the artists in the 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.639
 Able to do that 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.759
 next to not in the measure too 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.249

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.809
 Pictures she has to wait this year 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.869
 his workplace is almost a work of art 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.419
 Everything can be read 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.309
 on the wall pictures of great artists with the close cooperation 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.069
 like build and board 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.920
 if I have nothing to do then they start 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.289
 roll up 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:44.949
 but while I'm happy too I find so much work here and so on 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.939
 that the percentage 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.989
 yes great now calls here once or call the artists if that now 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.230
 is done and so 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.280
 know does 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.030
 if they put that away or Olga, of course, many of his computers 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.040
 then we are somewhere he is all gone or shelves 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.800
 disappeared 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.239
 and 4 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.970
 Actually, I know exactly why it lived 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.970
 and I know pretty well where it is not 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.579
 before the pronunciation the pictures are hung in his gallery 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.709
 to test the optimal effect it is noticeable 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.279
 here I stand 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:24.489
 these 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.370
 Form of pilot lesson complete is free 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.649
 with the values ​​with the sculpture 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.649
 and then he immediately wanted the first race 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.299
 Kneipp lives 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.409
 I did not know 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.409
 I'm waiting for the pedestal to change yet 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.559
 that should not be too 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.339
 increased 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:49.279
 For 41 years he returns too hard. Base shows modern art there 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:53.599
 He often works the other galleries we would like to have with prayer 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.449
 wearing 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.119
 Can you also give me the customers but the art market is unpredictable 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:03.639
 even Hans Maier has already missed and far too expensive shopped 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:07.839
 Watch the window 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:11.069
 it was de Kooning's picture 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.169
 where I have a lot of money 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.609
 not a few parents time if I had the time and is still today 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.239
 today 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.859
 I would have earned a lot of money 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.120
 but then he had to sell 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.170
 and how much loss did Esther have over millions 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.939
 more that already belongs 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.340
 but for him that's the exception 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.600
 his business is going well, he says and invests in new gallery space 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 opposite the Düsseldorfer Kunsthalle 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.409
 He looks past the construction site 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.319
 in preparation for yourself 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.900
 go out here 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 Picture of free and streller 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.979
 so afford 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.339
 of course wonderful 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.339
 the area is still distracted 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:06.360
 here wants the 80th 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.199
 for that keeps cathedral becomes 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.569
 and is that his grapes but he did not 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.569
 I think yes 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.110
 At the age of 72, he does not want to retire 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.379
 he enjoys the work 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.119
 He also took inspiration in the park opposite his new gallery 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.490
 a sculpture by Henry Mohr adorns it 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.159
 but this artwork 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.839
 he did not sell 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.699
 please do it anyway
