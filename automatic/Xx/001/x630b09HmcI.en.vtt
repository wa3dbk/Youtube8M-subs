00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.720
 are important for us to be able to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.500
 doing this platform migration 8.1

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.750
 like windows update 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.930
 you have to be with your updates 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.059
 ok later when you do this 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.360
 you will notice that in the right corner 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.420
 here will appear this small logo 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.969
 and windows 10 informing you that you can 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.980
 download windows 10 by clicking on it but 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.280
 for this logo to look like you have 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.170
 that is fit 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 You have to be fit for it 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.329
 appear how are you going to do 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.579
 that's good 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.370
 first you have to be with 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.329
 your updates all that press 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.900
 the start button to clear the screen 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:18.330
 initial and then you will dictate 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:22.080
 windows pulp windows update windows 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.259
 update and we will click on this option here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.409
 รณ windows the plate gives a click on 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.869
 she 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.530
 then the program will bring here the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.479
 our windows update tray however 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.100
 as mine is already able to update 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.890
 it already seems that all cute 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 would already organize to do the update 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:52.520
 clicking book but you should 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:55.610
 until the option here changes settings 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.229
 you see here and choose the option 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.350
 install updates automatically 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.780
 after doing this you kleina in this 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.610
 first option here and last you 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.610
 will click ok 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.190
 you will click here on the ok button 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.340
 That's what your system is going to do. 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.130
 updates available on the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.510
 microsoft server goes next 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.260
 cause these actions 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.340
 these updates to be downloaded 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.130
 in your computer 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.040
 after that your computer will update is 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.260
 a process a little time-consuming good logo 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.010
 beforehand I tell you not to 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.440
 methods that are not official 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.980
 as a method in which it is already available 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.540
 by means of a command point hit okay I 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.900
 it is not interesting to use these 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.790
 methods because there is already a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.280
 cool this will prevent you from having 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.230
 future problems inactivating your 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.150
 windows my windows i do not have 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.380
 no problem because it's a version 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:08.580
 original I bought but finally after 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.490
 you look like these changes and the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.530
 updates will be installed it flip 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.920
 to a new a new stage 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.840
 this step may even forget that it does not 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.570
 appears initially it may be that this 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.450
 Here O does not appear automatically 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.320
 but then you wait a little something 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.600
 than 8 hours 4 hours that they can have 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.240
 sure that after upgrades have 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.459
 been made will appear this logo 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.530
 That's what I say, then. 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.090
 use the bridge discussion command that 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.270
 It's there to do that is not interesting. 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.760
 because there is already an official method 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.459
 so after standing there in the corner 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.100
 top right 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.330
 you have a small click and the button 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.970
 even left click with the button 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.570
 left it will open a small 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.280
 The dialog window on your screen is for you 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.480
 wait while it loads 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.850
 settings 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.530
 then it will say the following as 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.140
 get windows 10 free 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.630
 book your copy for free 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.640

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.860
 update to receive notification of 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.610
 windows 10 has already been downloaded to 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.340
 you use 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.120
 enjoy windows 10 free this 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.430
 computer is compatible displays report 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.310
 O else also the issue here is 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.500
 very important 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.010
 why some computers will not 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.720
 appear initially here 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.419
 windows 10 why why 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.120
 your computer may not be 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.400
 still compatible with windows 10 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.010
 Okay, so if your computer is not 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.100
 compatible with windows 10 later 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:49.030
 after Microsoft launched in 2010 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.730
 officially now the morning of the 29th 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.600
 You can, by the way, it will start to 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.060
 release and enable this option there to download 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.430
 windows 10 in a gradual manner for the 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.919
 other computers was a process that 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.979
 Microsoft has adopted so that it does not 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.440
 end up overloading if the servers 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.290

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.750
