00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
best pair of sync maybe your hide we

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.010 
best pair of sync maybe your hide we
keep<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> icon<00:00:43.140> labels<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.620> our<00:00:43.770> own<00:00:43.890> um<00:00:45.020> and

keep the icon labels on our own um and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.910 
keep the icon labels on our own um and
you<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> scale<00:00:46.739> size<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.969> shrink<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
you have a scale size you just shrink it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.150 
you have a scale size you just shrink it
or<00:00:49.920> make<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.219> bigger<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.739> do<00:00:52.739> some<00:00:52.949> weird

combination here and what this is it's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.439 
combination here and what this is it's
up<00:00:56.870> quitting<00:00:57.870> no<00:00:58.199> scale<00:00:58.620> size<00:00:59.300> there's<00:01:00.300> also

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
up quitting no scale size there's also

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.690 
up quitting no scale size there's also
the<00:01:00.629> default<00:01:01.050> scale<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.710> want<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:04.610> some<00:01:05.610> of

transparent they're going to be about on

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
transparent they're going to be about on
fifty<00:01:12.420> percent<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.900> rotation<00:01:13.380> angle<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.640> then

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
fifty percent of rotation angle so then

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.609 
fifty percent of rotation angle so then

love you really know like rotation angle

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.430 
love you really know like rotation angle
so<00:03:41.430> I'm<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.700> turn<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.060> down<00:03:42.440> transfer

always applications in this about size

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.130 
always applications in this about size
but<00:04:08.220> too<00:04:08.459> small

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
that can be no rotation just can't add
