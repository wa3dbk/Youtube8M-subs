you're trying to complete the decks in
that<00:01:56.159> case<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.610> take<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.180> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that case just take one of them and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.520 
that case just take one of them and
really<00:01:57.420> solve<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> rest<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
really solve the rest of them and do it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.649 
really solve the rest of them and do it
that<00:01:58.680> way<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.670> PSA<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> will

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that way so that's my PSA if you will

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.260 
that way so that's my PSA if you will
hopefully<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.280> know<00:02:02.399> maybe<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> catches

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
hopefully that you know maybe it catches

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.359 
hopefully that you know maybe it catches
on<00:02:03.360> maybe<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> doesn't<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.140> hey<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> tried<00:02:05.040> I'm

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
on maybe it doesn't but hey I tried I'm

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.249 
on maybe it doesn't but hey I tried I'm
just<00:02:05.610> saying<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:06.420> gonna<00:02:06.509> try<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.750> Voltorb
