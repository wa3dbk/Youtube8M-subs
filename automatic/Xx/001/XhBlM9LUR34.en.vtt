00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
here it's in the bag this one we found

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420 
here it's in the bag this one we found
the<00:00:24.539> center<00:00:24.779> point<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> back<00:00:25.619> then<00:00:26.310> we've

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the center point of the back then we've

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.730 
the center point of the back then we've
got<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.730> more<00:00:26.939> than<00:00:27.029> half<00:00:27.119> inches<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:28.529> then

got with more than half inches we then
we're<00:00:29.250> able<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> sides<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
we're able to go to the sides here and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
we're able to go to the sides here and
I've<00:00:31.500> marked<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> five<00:00:33.420> half

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
I've marked this this is five half

I've marked this this is five half
inches<00:00:33.989> from<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.440> center<00:00:34.680> line<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.760> 1/2

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
inches from the center line and one 1/2

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.660 
inches from the center line and one 1/2
inches<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.770> you<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> same<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.520> could

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
inches up you know it's the same I could

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.610 
inches up you know it's the same I could
see<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> other<00:00:39.000> side<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.170> need<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> do

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
see on the other side so we need to do

00:00:40.620 --> 00:01:09.980 
see on the other side so we need to do
is<00:00:41.129> take<00:00:41.430> our<00:00:41.640> drill

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.080 

now<00:01:10.560> we're<00:01:10.740> ready<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.980> solve<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.120> -<00:01:12.360> spirits<00:01:14.090> so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
now we're ready to solve it - spirits so

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.910 
now we're ready to solve it - spirits so
at<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.540> point<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.530> D<00:01:16.710> hooks

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
at this point we have one of our D hooks

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.250 
at this point we have one of our D hooks
installed<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.330> needs<00:01:18.690> about<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> other<00:01:19.110> one

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
installed and needs about the other one

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.390 
installed and needs about the other one
I<00:01:19.290> figured<00:01:19.560> I'd<00:01:19.650> show<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.130> looks
