things to first point out about Mikey is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.820 
things to first point out about Mikey is
that<00:00:20.550> he<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.390> probably<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.080> easiest<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.619> pick

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
that he is probably the easiest to pick

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.529 
that he is probably the easiest to pick
up<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.130> play<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.699> he<00:00:23.880> might<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.269> one<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
up and play but he might be one of the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.679 
up and play but he might be one of the
hardest<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.990> master<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:27.060> by<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.480> is

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
hardest to master and and by that is

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.390 
hardest to master and and by that is
that<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.380> lot<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.680> people<00:00:28.890> think<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.279> can

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that a lot of people think that they can

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.420 
that a lot of people think that they can
just<00:00:29.550> hit<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> X<00:00:29.910> button<00:00:30.380> like<00:00:31.380> all<00:00:31.650> day<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
just hit the X button like all day and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.100 
just hit the X button like all day and
that's<00:00:32.669> that's<00:00:33.090> how<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.270> play<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.600> Mikey<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that's that's how you play as Mikey the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.610 
that's that's how you play as Mikey the
truth<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> Mikey's<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> combos

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.840 
truth is is Mikey's got a lot of combos
I<00:00:37.620> mean<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.100> all<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.370> about<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> same

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I mean they all have about the same

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.900 
I mean they all have about the same
number<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.210> combos<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.960> Mikey's<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.910> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
number of combos but Mikey's are the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
number of combos but Mikey's are the
longest<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:43.110> take<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.800> quite<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
longest and they take you know quite a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.560 
longest and they take you know quite a
bit<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.670> develop<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.300> you're<00:00:45.420> doing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
bit to really develop when you're doing

bit to really develop when you're doing
the<00:00:45.629> combos<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.800> let's<00:00:47.100> real<00:00:47.550> quick<00:00:47.579> talk

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the combos but let's real quick talk

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000 
the combos but let's real quick talk
about<00:00:48.239> his<00:00:48.450> strengths<00:00:48.870> Mikey<00:00:49.710> he's<00:00:49.890> probably

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
about his strengths Mikey he's probably

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.119 
about his strengths Mikey he's probably
the<00:00:50.219> fastest<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.000> quickest<00:00:51.440> amongst<00:00:52.440> his<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the fastest the quickest amongst his the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.139 
the fastest the quickest amongst his the
four<00:00:53.309> brothers<00:00:53.570> he<00:00:54.710> he<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.980> usually<00:00:56.520> his<00:00:56.969> best

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
four brothers he he can usually his best

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.520 
four brothers he he can usually his best
way<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> use<00:00:57.510> him<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.989> avoid<00:00:58.289> being

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
way to use him is to avoid being

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.799 
way to use him is to avoid being
attacked<00:00:58.850> by<00:00:59.850> evading

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
attacked by evading

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
attacked by evading
although<00:01:01.410> however<00:01:01.739> his<00:01:01.949> counter<00:01:02.609> does<00:01:03.059> seem

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
although however his counter does seem

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
although however his counter does seem
to<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> most<00:01:03.930> responsive<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to be the most responsive out of all the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.260 
to be the most responsive out of all the
other<00:01:05.610> ones<00:01:06.260> he<00:01:07.260> also<00:01:07.470> has<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.850> quickest

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
other ones he also has the quickest

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.200 
other ones he also has the quickest
combo<00:01:09.750> increase<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.590> by<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.729> mean<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
combo increase and by that I mean that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.840 
combo increase and by that I mean that
he<00:01:12.510> lands<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> most<00:01:13.290> hits<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.340> quickest<00:01:14.760> out

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
he lands the most hits the quickest out

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.570 
he lands the most hits the quickest out
of<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.450> other<00:01:15.570> four<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.170> mean<00:01:16.890> he<00:01:17.159> he<00:01:17.430> can

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of all the other four I mean he he can

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
of all the other four I mean he he can
chain<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.000> together<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.689> great<00:01:19.159> he's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
chain them together really great he's

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490

when he's hit he takes a lot of damage

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
when he's hit he takes a lot of damage
and<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.799> you're<00:01:55.920> doing<00:01:56.040> any<00:01:56.280> challenge<00:01:56.759> moats

might<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.610> really<00:01:59.850> great<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.119> racking<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
might be really great for racking up a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.289 
might be really great for racking up a
high<00:02:00.930> score<00:02:01.380> he<00:02:02.250> has<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> hard<00:02:02.670> time<00:02:02.729> finishing

high score he has a hard time finishing
off<00:02:03.570> enemies<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.530> you'll<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.710> doing<00:02:05.100> most

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
off enemies so like you'll be doing most

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310 
off enemies so like you'll be doing most
of<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:05.880> attacks<00:02:06.210> aren't<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:06.960> doing<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
of your attacks aren't really doing a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.800 
of your attacks aren't really doing a
whole<00:02:07.350> lot<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.920> damage

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
whole lot of damage

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.779 
whole lot of damage

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
meaning you're gonna be fighting guys

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.960 
meaning you're gonna be fighting guys
longer<00:02:11.630> than<00:02:11.780> you'd<00:02:11.930> like<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.580> what<00:02:13.580> happens

longer than you'd like and what happens

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.940 
longer than you'd like and what happens

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
is that you're beating up on a guy

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.620 
is that you're beating up on a guy
you're<00:02:16.310> countering<00:02:16.850> your<00:02:17.000> combo<00:02:17.300> counters

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
you're not doing it quick enough to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.460 
you're not doing it quick enough to
actually<00:02:22.790> progress<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.870> challenge<00:02:24.290> mode

I<00:03:07.989> find<00:03:08.989> Mikey<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.530> best<00:03:09.830> when<00:03:10.010> you're<00:03:10.220> playing

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
I find Mikey is best when you're playing

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.699 
I find Mikey is best when you're playing
on<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.700> outer<00:03:10.850> edge<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.269> guys<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:12.290> kind<00:03:12.620> of

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
on the outer edge of guys to kind of

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.800 
on the outer edge of guys to kind of
stay<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.100> edge<00:03:13.250> don't<00:03:14.239> let<00:03:14.450> yourself

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
stay on the edge don't let yourself

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.180 
stay on the edge don't let yourself
really<00:03:14.989> get<00:03:15.170> surrounded<00:03:15.560> with<00:03:15.709> him<00:03:15.829> because

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
really get surrounded with him because

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.699 
really get surrounded with him because
he<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.340> weak<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:17.000> tacks<00:03:17.959> come<00:03:18.200> from<00:03:18.440> every

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
he is weak and tacks come from every

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.110 
he is weak and tacks come from every
single<00:03:18.920> direction<00:03:19.160> you're<00:03:19.700> gonna<00:03:19.820> want<00:03:20.060> to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
single direction you're gonna want to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.720 
single direction you're gonna want to
really<00:03:20.450> try<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.690> avoid<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.890> that's<00:03:22.430> it

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
really try to avoid that so that's it

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.960 
really try to avoid that so that's it
for<00:03:23.000> from<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:23.959> Mikey<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:25.280> has<00:03:25.400> been<00:03:25.549> horizon
