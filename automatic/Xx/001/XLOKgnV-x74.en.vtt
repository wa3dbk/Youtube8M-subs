00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.050
 or the most here I am the guy at 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.800
 that nobody knows with a tutorial of how 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.519
 take to scales in prepa cure ok 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.199
 then they are I will explain you three ways 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.970
 the first the easiest the simplest 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.010
 in which we all want for our 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.570
 children for our grandchildren and all future 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.570
 generation would be 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.180
 take a file that has the armor 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.180
 complete 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.540
 and simply in scale put our 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.620
 stature in my case as genetics does not 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:45.309
 help me would be 1 meter 65 I put a meter 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.019
 68 3 centimeters of separation from the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.019
 shoe sole 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.800
 and it would be that simple 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.800
 it would only be to fix the parts 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.250
 the second way is for when not 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.830
 you have separate parts of the armor 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.890
 as in this case would be the chest 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.620
 look for the highest part that would be the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.880
 shoulders and the lowest part that would be 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.340
 this part of the back 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.010
 and look for an image that has the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.690
 Full body armor 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.030
 then with a rule is measured from the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.960
 highest point of the armor in the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.370
 image that would be that at five pixels 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.830
 to the lowest point in the armor 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.800
 that would be here on the sole of the foot to 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.800
 the 36 to the 367 pixels 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.160
 you look for the highest point that you already 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.230
 had agreed on the part of the shipowner 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.450
 that he does not want to find would be that 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.450
 shoulders to 44 pixels 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.090
 here 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.700
 in the lower part of the back that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.820
 it would be the 131 pixels and the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.150
 account first of the total size of the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.960
 armor 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.960
 it would 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:16.470
 367 minus 5 would be 362 pixels what 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.750
 fine total armor and from the most point 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.990
 under the part of the armor that 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.110
 we want to take 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.510
 up to the highest point that would be 87 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.360
 pixels the total size after this 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.670
 you have to apply a rule of three 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.900
 what would this be for the size of the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.810
 armor in the image 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.819
 to a size of the part in the image 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.800
 then for the actual size of the 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.380
 armor the actual size of that part 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.290
 the rule of 3 would work the actual size 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.870
 of the armor by the size of the part 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.180
 in the image divided by the size of 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.490
 the armor in the image and that would give us 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.150
 the actual size of the part then 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.300
 it would be a meter 68 what do I want 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.150
 that me to the armor x 87 that is the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.650
 breast size image divided 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.660
 between 362 which is the size of the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.610
 armor in the image there is no need 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.680
 to do no conversion always and 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.210
 when the size of the armor in the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.450
 picture the size of the part of the 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.840
 image is to have the same system this 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.840
 gives us 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:49.599
 this gives us 40 37 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:54.330
 centimeters that would be 44 centimeters 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.330
 rounded now in the file 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:03.379
 place in the size 44 centimeters 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.200
 millimeters say and have the actual size 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.060
 of the armor now when one has it 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.670
 an image like this that shows the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.670
 armor from all angles and all 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.250
 the parties will hinder this method and 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.190
 works better the third one that would be 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.739
 take a photo of yourself with a 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.680
 ruler 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.530
 they do not pay attention to my face 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.990
 outside occasions and it does not affect me and I do not 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.660
 do to me 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.139
 so I do not look for a program like 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.270
 flash photoshop or even power point or in 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.040
 my manga case study 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.260
 Y 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.260
 insert lime then 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.460
 taking 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.750
 for this case 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.800
 the one in this one 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.639
 and then you take in this case the helmet 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.370
 the armor 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.900
 you put it in the same position in the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.900
 what are you in the image 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.460
 print Screen 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.920
 now it's the program you hit 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.009
 on the screen and you're looking for control of 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.289
 opacity in the program 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.820
 you reduce it until it is transparent 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.720
 enough to see the face then 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.720
 tomÃ¡s 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.740
 and the size scales 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.750
 so that exactly in your face in this 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.630
 case my face does not have the vertical angle 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.210
 perfect of the image then I have to 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.930
 move a little 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.600
 the face then you have to put it back 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.840
 in vertical or we will leave the size 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.840
 exact 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.570
 after you have the exact size 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.770
 for the part you reposition it in 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.540
 horizontal 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.010
 and you put it in front of the rule 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.950
 and with the tool to create a figure 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:11.480
 to be 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.960
 a line you create a new layer 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.020
 Y 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:21.810
 give me from the highest point 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.810
 of the helmet armor 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:35.110
 copies you paste this same layer 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.590
 Japanese at the end at the lowest point the 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.590
 helmet 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:45.200
 and then take out the account that would be 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.200
 click 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.200
 43 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:58.629
 5 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.629
 centimeters to the top that would be 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.060
 16 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.060
 centimeters 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.510
 and it would give 27.5 which is the size that 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.300
 you want for the helmet 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:20.330
 then simply changed again 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:23.960
 reading scale 27.5 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:26.990
 it would be 275 millimeters 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.740
 and that would be the size for it to be 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.620
 same as in the image 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.530
 and that would be all three simple methods 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.480
 to draw the size of the armor without 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.290
 a lot of error range 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.290
 so 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:47.180
 do not subscribe because I do not upload videos 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:47.180
 and all god
