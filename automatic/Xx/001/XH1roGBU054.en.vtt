00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.609 
see at the moment is the markets are
trading<00:01:04.350> higher<00:01:04.830> indeed<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:07.260> it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
trading higher indeed so it but it's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.140 
trading higher indeed so it but it's
been<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:07.920> gone<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.369> quiet<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.030> them

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
been it's gone very quiet of them

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
been it's gone very quiet of them
because<00:01:09.600> I'm<00:01:10.020> looking<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> clock<00:01:10.860> it's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
because I'm looking at the clock it's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
because I'm looking at the clock it's
half<00:01:11.310> past<00:01:11.490> eleven<00:01:11.909> London<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.390> we'll<00:01:12.570> have

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
half past eleven London time we'll have

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.719 
half past eleven London time we'll have
another<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:13.920> three<00:01:14.159> hours<00:01:14.189> until

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
another for about three hours until

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
another for about three hours until
non-farm<00:01:15.270> payrolls<00:01:15.600> come<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> US<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
non-farm payrolls come out of the US so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.770 
non-farm payrolls come out of the US so
until<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> suspect<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
until then I suspect it's going to be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
until then I suspect it's going to be
relatively<00:01:19.140> quiet<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.770> nothing<00:01:20.100> happens<00:01:20.430> out

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
relatively quiet if nothing happens out

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.460 
relatively quiet if nothing happens out
of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> extractive<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> normal

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
situation in Egypt but if that stays

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.469

quiet we will have to hold off and then

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.850 
quiet we will have to hold off and then
see<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:27.869> those<00:01:28.020> numbers<00:01:28.170> come<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.560> what

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
with that so watch this space

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.720

yeah how about the oil prices because
there's<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.000> big<00:03:12.269> impact<00:03:12.690> on<00:03:12.840> oil<00:03:13.080> prices<00:03:13.349> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
there's a big impact on oil prices the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.009 
there's a big impact on oil prices the
indeed<00:03:14.580> Christ<00:03:14.819> Egypt's<00:03:15.629> yeah<00:03:15.810> we've<00:03:15.989> been

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
indeed Christ Egypt's yeah we've been

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.839 
indeed Christ Egypt's yeah we've been
keeping<00:03:16.260> an<00:03:16.530> eye<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.980> or<00:03:17.250> weekend<00:03:17.700> for

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
keeping an eye on that or weekend for

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.280 
keeping an eye on that or weekend for
very<00:03:18.000> good<00:03:18.180> reason<00:03:18.510> because<00:03:18.540> rising<00:03:19.170> oil

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
very good reason because rising oil

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.500 
very good reason because rising oil
prices<00:03:19.409> feed<00:03:20.010> into<00:03:20.310> high<00:03:20.489> inflation<00:03:20.940> and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
prices feed into high inflation and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.970 
prices feed into high inflation and
that's<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.930> problem<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.260> should<00:03:22.409> adjust<00:03:22.800> for

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
that's a problem that should adjust for

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.290 
that's a problem that should adjust for
consumers<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.700> Middle<00:03:23.909> East<00:03:24.030> but

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
consumers in the Middle East but

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.149 
consumers in the Middle East but
everywhere<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> world<00:03:25.049> also<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.799> in

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
everywhere in the world also in in
