00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello my dear today i am you 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.250
 I'll show you a little secret how you can 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.630
 process scan 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.929
 if you don't have an overlock or a zigzag or 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.380
 do you even have it all but you are somewhere 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:21.510
 ripped axis and need some kind of color 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 thread and handle 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.699
 place and you can make this chev he 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.630
 will look like an overlock 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.460
 Now we will do this for you 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.350
 beginnings 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.969
 we fix the thread take the needle literally 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:43.140
 two strings hold tail out 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.860
 loops these two strings of thread stuck 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 And now look at the bottom we sew on the bottom 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.649
 what distance do you need there 0305 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.800
 dependent on stitches of this horror and mother 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.660
 and adjusts java show large and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.969
 it turned out like this here and again 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.170
 watch we connect here now 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.200
 we connect below in the same point and 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.630
 we drag off the top 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.939
 ottyanuli now below you dress on 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.560
 same distance again loop and 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:22.619
 connect the top and so goes the chain we 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.040
 we connect alternately who the top 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.040
 down below 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.310
 look at us from the inside out it turns out 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.610
 same thing with the face 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.020
 that with calls, remember only the simple 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.890
 the rule is that you need to sew the bottom and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.979
 be sure to connect 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.780
 the top is now connected below 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.110
 connect 5 main distance from everything 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.110
 entire seam
