indicators<00:00:11.719> so<00:00:13.519> first<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.730> we're<00:00:14.910> going

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
indicators so first of all we're going

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.029 
indicators so first of all we're going
to<00:00:15.059> go<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.210> Xcode<00:00:15.839> your<00:00:16.049> file<00:00:16.260> new<00:00:16.470> project<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to go to Xcode your file new project and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.740 
to go to Xcode your file new project and
let's<00:00:17.220> create<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> view<00:00:17.670> based<00:00:17.910> application<00:00:18.539> I

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
let's create a view based application I

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.830 
let's create a view based application I
applied<00:00:19.529> its<00:00:19.740> sliders<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:21.740> progress<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:23.840> it

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
applied its sliders and progress and it

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650 
applied its sliders and progress and it
doesn't<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.230> matter<00:00:25.880> all<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.359> I'm

doesn't really matter all right so I'm
gonna<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.260> start<00:00:28.560> instead<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.429> setting<00:00:29.970> up

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
gonna in start instead of a setting up

progress view and a progress indicator
this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> progress<00:01:40.140> indicator<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.890> spinny

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
this is a progress indicator to spinny

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.420 
this is a progress indicator to spinny
thing<00:01:42.049> progress<00:01:43.049> views<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.530> loading<00:01:43.920> bar<00:01:44.100> so

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
thing progress views this loading bar so

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.819 
thing progress views this loading bar so
we're<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> one<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.439> these<00:01:46.560> I'm

continuous<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.740> checked<00:02:21.040> we're<00:02:21.730> gonna<00:02:21.880> click

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
continuous is checked we're gonna click

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.260 
continuous is checked we're gonna click
from<00:02:23.020> here<00:02:23.290> hook<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.370> or<00:02:24.550> action<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:27.270> this

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
from here hook up or action and this

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.390 
from here hook up or action and this
doesn't<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.990> won't<00:02:29.620> do<00:02:29.830> much<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:31.060> we'll<00:02:31.300> see

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
doesn't it won't do much but we'll see

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.050 
doesn't it won't do much but we'll see
when<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.700> comes<00:02:34.630> up<00:02:35.490> then<00:02:36.490> we<00:02:36.640> can<00:02:36.790> go<00:02:36.940> ahead

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
when it comes up then we can go ahead

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.940 
when it comes up then we can go ahead
and<00:02:37.360> slide<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.180> great<00:02:40.740> because<00:02:41.740> you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
and slide now this is great because you

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.530 
and slide now this is great because you
know<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.310> looks<00:02:42.340> pretty<00:02:42.610> fluid<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.300> pretty

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
know it looks pretty fluid it's pretty

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.940 
know it looks pretty fluid it's pretty
awesome<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.260> did<00:02:47.410> this<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.770> Mac

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
awesome I think I did this in a Mac

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.880 
awesome I think I did this in a Mac
programming<00:02:48.490> tutorial<00:02:48.940> as<00:02:49.000> well<00:02:49.320> anyway<00:02:50.320> so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
programming tutorial as well anyway so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.500 
programming tutorial as well anyway so
that's<00:02:51.040> basically<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.820> basics<00:02:52.000> that

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
that's basically the basics that

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.660 
that's basically the basics that
demonstrates<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:53.770> killing<00:02:54.160> two<00:02:54.190> birds<00:02:54.340> with

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
demonstrates like killing two birds with

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.210 
demonstrates like killing two birds with
one<00:02:54.760> stone<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.450> demonstrate<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.350> slider

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
one stone it demonstrate this a slider

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.720 
one stone it demonstrate this a slider
and<00:02:57.930> demonstrates<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.050> progress<00:02:59.730> indicator

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and demonstrates this progress indicator

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.310 
and demonstrates this progress indicator
so<00:03:00.970> if<00:03:01.060> we<00:03:01.180> look<00:03:01.210> in<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.570> code<00:03:01.750> once<00:03:02.020> more

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
so if we look in the code once more

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.040 
so if we look in the code once more
you're<00:03:02.980> seeing<00:03:03.160> progress<00:03:03.430> set<00:03:03.940> progress<00:03:04.450> here

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
you're seeing progress set progress here

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.330 
you're seeing progress set progress here
you're<00:03:05.200> going<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.410> want<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.620> give<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.980> float

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
you're going to want to give it a float

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.550 
you're going to want to give it a float
which<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.360> floating<00:03:07.780> point<00:03:07.960> number<00:03:08.110> that's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
which is a floating point number that's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.090 
which is a floating point number that's
like<00:03:08.710> an<00:03:08.830> int<00:03:09.070> except<00:03:09.520> it's<00:03:09.670> goat<00:03:10.000> instead<00:03:10.390> and

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
like an int except it's goat instead and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.890 
like an int except it's goat instead and
to<00:03:12.100> do<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.640> get<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.970> value<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.600> slider

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
to do that we get the value of slider

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.050 
to do that we get the value of slider
one<00:03:14.200> which<00:03:14.620> returns<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.250> float<00:03:15.490> they'd<00:03:15.970> it

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
one which returns a float they'd it

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.810 
one which returns a float they'd it
makes<00:03:16.240> sense<00:03:16.390> we<00:03:16.600> can<00:03:16.750> make<00:03:16.900> this<00:03:17.550> zero<00:03:18.550> point

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
makes sense we can make this zero point

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.620 
makes sense we can make this zero point
two<00:03:18.880> or<00:03:19.450> one<00:03:19.900> whatever<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:21.270> it'll<00:03:22.270> just<00:03:22.300> set

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
two or one whatever and it'll just set

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.600 
two or one whatever and it'll just set
the<00:03:22.720> progress<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.260> 0.1<00:03:23.830> whatever<00:03:24.130> we<00:03:24.340> slide

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
the progress to 0.1 whatever we slide

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.900 
the progress to 0.1 whatever we slide
this<00:03:24.850> we<00:03:25.630> can<00:03:25.870> say<00:03:28.020> slider<00:03:29.020> one<00:03:29.380> set<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.280> this

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
this we can say slider one set and this

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.550 
this we can say slider one set and this
is<00:03:31.090> sort<00:03:31.240> of<00:03:31.360> useless<00:03:31.720> because<00:03:32.250> yes<00:03:33.330> 0.4<00:03:34.560> so

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
is sort of useless because yes 0.4 so

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.400 
is sort of useless because yes 0.4 so
this<00:03:35.770> will<00:03:35.950> be<00:03:36.100> kind<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.520> weird<00:03:36.730> as<00:03:37.140> you'll<00:03:38.140> see

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
this will be kind of weird as you'll see

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.660 
this will be kind of weird as you'll see
because<00:03:42.330> it's<00:03:43.330> going<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.630> not<00:03:43.840> slide<00:03:44.490> so<00:03:45.490> we're

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
because it's going to not slide so we're

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.580 
because it's going to not slide so we're
going<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:46.060> be<00:03:46.180> able<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.450> slide<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:47.170> slider

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
going to be able to slide this slider

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.650 
going to be able to slide this slider
and<00:03:48.370> it's<00:03:48.459> not<00:03:48.730> going<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.000> change<00:03:49.060> us<00:03:49.480> the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
and it's not going to change us the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.060 
and it's not going to change us the
thing<00:03:49.840> under<00:03:49.990> it's<00:03:50.260> going<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.500> change<00:03:50.530> it's

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
thing under it's going to change it's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.310 
thing under it's going to change it's
quite<00:03:51.280> weird<00:03:51.490> it<00:03:52.270> is<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:54.670> yeah<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.959> that's<00:03:56.170> like

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
quite weird it is so yeah so that's like

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.560 
quite weird it is so yeah so that's like
a<00:03:56.380> demonstration<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.130> how<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.310> do<00:03:57.520> stuff<00:03:57.580> so

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
a demonstration of how to do stuff so

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.030 
a demonstration of how to do stuff so
now<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.750> might<00:03:58.990> be<00:03:59.140> wondering<00:03:59.170> well<00:03:59.709> how<00:03:59.860> do<00:03:59.920> I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
now you might be wondering well how do I

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.520 
now you might be wondering well how do I
make<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.280> progress<00:04:00.640> progress<00:04:01.600> bar<00:04:02.020> you<00:04:02.470> know

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
make a progress progress bar you know

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.190 
make a progress progress bar you know
measure<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:04.030> loading<00:04:04.480> progress<00:04:04.959> of<00:04:05.140> a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
measure the the loading progress of a

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.500 
measure the the loading progress of a
web<00:04:05.380> page<00:04:05.620> or<00:04:05.860> whatever<00:04:05.980> well<00:04:06.910> that's

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
web page or whatever well that's

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.510 
web page or whatever well that's
different<00:04:07.750> all<00:04:08.320> you<00:04:08.590> do<00:04:08.740> is<00:04:08.770> you<00:04:09.130> set<00:04:09.400> the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
different all you do is you set the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.390 
different all you do is you set the
progress<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.360> too<00:04:10.600> however<00:04:11.410> prestamo<00:04:12.070> more

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
progress of it too however prestamo more

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.490 
progress of it too however prestamo more
much<00:04:12.520> percent<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.150> process<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:13.810> complete

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
much percent that process is complete

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.440 
much percent that process is complete
and<00:04:14.709> you<00:04:15.190> have<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.459> do<00:04:15.610> that<00:04:15.760> figure<00:04:16.270> that<00:04:16.420> out

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
and you have to do that figure that out

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.560 
and you have to do that figure that out
yourself<00:04:17.850> so<00:04:18.850> maybe<00:04:19.000> I'll<00:04:19.209> go<00:04:19.330> into<00:04:19.479> that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
yourself so maybe I'll go into that

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.420 
yourself so maybe I'll go into that
later<00:04:19.900> when<00:04:20.169> I<00:04:20.200> start<00:04:20.560> doing<00:04:20.830> network<00:04:21.130> stuff

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
later when I start doing network stuff

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.600 
later when I start doing network stuff
and<00:04:21.700> stuff<00:04:21.970> with<00:04:22.180> servers<00:04:22.600> um

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
and stuff with servers um

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.719 
and stuff with servers um
so<00:04:25.240> now<00:04:25.389> we're<00:04:25.990> going<00:04:26.139> to<00:04:26.199> make<00:04:26.349> it<00:04:26.560> i'll<00:04:27.340> make

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
so now we're going to make it i'll make

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.420 
so now we're going to make it i'll make
a<00:04:27.759> little<00:04:28.150> sort<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.080> i<00:04:29.319> don't<00:04:29.860> know<00:04:30.159> if<00:04:30.310> i<00:04:30.400> can

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
a little sort of i don't know if i can

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.600 
a little sort of i don't know if i can
call<00:04:30.729> a<00:04:30.759> game<00:04:31.060> but<00:04:31.180> i'll<00:04:31.330> say<00:04:31.740> value<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.370> i'll

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
call a game but i'll say value and i'll

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.260 
call a game but i'll say value and i'll
make<00:04:34.169> another<00:04:36.120> increase<00:04:37.120> value<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:40.120> i'll

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
make another increase value and i'll

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.330 
make another increase value and i'll
just<00:04:40.419> make<00:04:40.629> this<00:04:40.840> say<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:41.860> know<00:04:41.919> i<00:04:41.979> don't<00:04:42.129> even

just make this say you know i don't even

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.580 
just make this say you know i don't even
need<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.789> so<00:04:43.750> what<00:04:43.930> we're<00:04:44.050> gonna<00:04:44.139> do<00:04:44.409> now<00:04:44.560> is

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
need this so what we're gonna do now is

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.040 
need this so what we're gonna do now is
we're<00:04:44.949> going<00:04:45.069> to<00:04:45.159> make<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.340> button<00:04:45.789> that<00:04:46.050> moves

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
we're going to make a button that moves

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.770 
we're going to make a button that moves
up<00:04:47.289> both<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.680> these<00:04:47.830> values<00:04:48.389> so<00:04:49.389> it's<00:04:49.539> just

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
up both of these values so it's just

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.990 
up both of these values so it's just
making<00:04:50.169> button<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:50.650> says<00:04:51.719> increase<00:04:57.000> let's

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
making button that says increase let's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.050 
making button that says increase let's
just<00:04:58.090> drag<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.449> here<00:04:58.779> and<00:04:59.460> now<00:05:00.460> in<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.759> code

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
just drag it here and now in the code

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.499 
just drag it here and now in the code
for<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.650> we're<00:05:02.650> gonna<00:05:02.740> be<00:05:03.389> increasing<00:05:04.389> the

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
for this we're gonna be increasing the

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.230 
for this we're gonna be increasing the
value<00:05:04.659> of<00:05:05.550> progress<00:05:06.550> one<00:05:06.789> so<00:05:06.939> we're<00:05:07.060> going<00:05:07.150> to

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
value of progress one so we're going to

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.179 
value of progress one so we're going to
say<00:05:07.389> progress<00:05:07.810> one<00:05:09.689> set<00:05:10.689> progress<00:05:11.259> progress

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.189 
say progress one set progress progress

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.080 
say progress one set progress progress
one<00:05:12.610> progress<00:05:13.409> plus<00:05:14.409> one<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.889> i<00:05:15.789> know<00:05:15.849> there

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
one progress plus one and i know there

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.580 
one progress plus one and i know there
are<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.180> lot<00:05:16.270> of<00:05:16.300> ones<00:05:16.599> and<00:05:16.779> progress<00:05:17.199> is<00:05:17.409> in

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
are a lot of ones and progress is in

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.790 
are a lot of ones and progress is in
that<00:05:17.969> that's<00:05:18.969> pretty<00:05:19.150> funny<00:05:19.419> and<00:05:19.689> we're<00:05:20.650> going

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
that that's pretty funny and we're going

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.149 
that that's pretty funny and we're going
to<00:05:20.830> say<00:05:20.979> slider<00:05:21.250> one<00:05:21.490> set<00:05:21.939> value<00:05:22.689> slider<00:05:23.650> one

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
to say slider one set value slider one

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:30.629 
to say slider one set value slider one
value<00:05:25.259> plus<00:05:26.259> one<00:05:26.500> and<00:05:27.120> yeah<00:05:28.379> so<00:05:29.379> now<00:05:29.560> when<00:05:30.520> we

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
value plus one and yeah so now when we

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.450 
value plus one and yeah so now when we
click<00:05:30.669> this<00:05:31.000> button<00:05:31.319> both<00:05:32.319> the<00:05:32.770> slider<00:05:33.099> and

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
click this button both the slider and

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.670 
click this button both the slider and
the<00:05:33.610> progress<00:05:33.849> bar<00:05:34.240> i'm<00:05:34.960> going<00:05:35.259> to<00:05:35.409> increase

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
the progress bar i'm going to increase

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.760 
the progress bar i'm going to increase
so<00:05:35.830> let's<00:05:35.949> drag<00:05:36.129> them<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.339> the<00:05:36.460> beginning<00:05:37.210> and

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
so let's drag them to the beginning and

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.159 
so let's drag them to the beginning and
they<00:05:38.770> add<00:05:38.919> one<00:05:39.310> and<00:05:39.520> they<00:05:40.210> go<00:05:40.389> to<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.599> top<00:05:40.810> no

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
they add one and they go to the top no

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.890 
they add one and they go to the top no
matter<00:05:41.349> what<00:05:41.620> because<00:05:42.460> they're<00:05:42.909> being<00:05:43.419> added

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
matter what because they're being added

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:52.559 
matter what because they're being added
to<00:05:44.020> one<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:44.979> now<00:05:45.099> let's<00:05:45.339> make<00:05:45.490> it<00:05:45.550> add<00:05:46.620> 0.1<00:05:51.569> if

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 
to one so now let's make it add 0.1 if

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:54.809 
to one so now let's make it add 0.1 if
we<00:05:52.900> do<00:05:53.050> this<00:05:53.259> now<00:05:53.500> it'll<00:05:53.800> take<00:05:54.039> us<00:05:54.189> 10<00:05:54.430> button

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
we do this now it'll take us 10 button

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:56.700 
we do this now it'll take us 10 button
presses<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.419> get<00:05:55.569> there<00:05:55.719> two<00:05:55.839> one<00:05:56.080> two<00:05:56.349> three

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
presses to get there two one two three

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.390 
presses to get there two one two three
four<00:05:56.979> five<00:05:57.009> six<00:05:57.310> seven<00:05:57.849> eight<00:05:58.150> nine<00:05:58.330> ten<00:05:59.400> got

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
four five six seven eight nine ten got

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.360 
four five six seven eight nine ten got
that<00:06:00.639> and<00:06:01.110> we<00:06:02.110> can<00:06:02.319> make<00:06:02.439> the<00:06:02.620> same<00:06:02.860> the<00:06:03.339> same

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
that and we can make the same the same

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.149 
that and we can make the same the same
method<00:06:04.029> where<00:06:04.210> we'd<00:06:04.419> subtract<00:06:04.900> one<00:06:05.199> to<00:06:05.860> make

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
method where we'd subtract one to make

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.480 
method where we'd subtract one to make
them<00:06:06.339> move<00:06:06.490> back<00:06:06.789> one<00:06:07.680> so<00:06:08.680> this<00:06:08.979> is<00:06:09.159> just<00:06:09.310> a

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
them move back one so this is just a

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.550 
them move back one so this is just a
simple<00:06:09.819> demo<00:06:10.180> to<00:06:10.360> demonstrate<00:06:10.960> how<00:06:11.199> progress

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
simple demo to demonstrate how progress

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.300 
simple demo to demonstrate how progress
bars<00:06:12.039> and<00:06:12.339> sliders<00:06:12.819> work<00:06:13.259> i<00:06:14.259> know<00:06:14.830> i<00:06:14.949> went<00:06:15.189> a

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
bars and sliders work i know i went a

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.369 
bars and sliders work i know i went a
little<00:06:15.490> fast<00:06:15.789> in<00:06:16.150> this<00:06:16.270> video<00:06:16.599> so<00:06:16.960> if<00:06:17.139> you're

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
little fast in this video so if you're

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
having trouble understanding any of this
