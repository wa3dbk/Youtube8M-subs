00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.660
 hello people I came back with one more tip for 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.150
 write to today I want to talk about 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.070
 psychography that has to do with 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.560
 literature with writing 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.029
 sometimes we are reading a text or 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 because it's starting because there's a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.300
 little lost and do not know what your poop is 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.240
 This dynamic everything you sometimes think 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.750
 that I'll keep working on that phrase 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.340
 the screen looks perfect super cool 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.930
 It turns out that this is a job for 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 then the first thing is beautiful 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.750
 rafa and write everything that our head 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.660
 this game he has to go to paper for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.140
 the computer screen to be on the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.570
 napkin in a bag of bread for any 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.090
 place you have to write everything in 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.930
 our head why you lose you stay 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.730
 there to work but it's not good to just use 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:05.400
 lean is better to use secco had the idea 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.340
 I'm going to sit down and write. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.080
 until August 17 was violent going-goes 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:17.310
 when you get there it 's separate rests 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.979
 tries to finish either via text or 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.500
 the entire book and tries to end it 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.670
 then you said think of the phrase thinking 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.350
 in every word 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 think how you will structure the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 paragraphs are important things because 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.939
 You'll make the versions, will you? 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 working every other part forward 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.560
 I explain how we can dedicate ourselves 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.100
 each part so for that more work 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.600
 in yesterday's edition did with this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.850
 try then tells me how was that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 experience worked out did not work 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.890
 for you for me it's something that always 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.670
 I work, I work very well. 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.549
 way 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.930

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.640
