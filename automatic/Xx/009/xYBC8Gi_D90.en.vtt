00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
basically this is an oil banner for the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
basically this is an oil banner for the
heating<00:00:11.870> which<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.080> what<00:00:13.349> they<00:00:13.440> call<00:00:13.679> a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
heating which is what they call a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.779 
heating which is what they call a
high-low<00:00:14.759> fire<00:00:15.089> basically<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:17.340> low<00:00:17.490> fire

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
high-low fire basically the low fire

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.929 
high-low fire basically the low fire
keeps<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.170> heat<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> main<00:00:19.800> eater<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
keeps it the heat of the main eater and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.670 
keeps it the heat of the main eater and
when<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.180> reaches<00:00:21.600> temperature<00:00:22.020> then<00:00:22.230> off<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
when it reaches temperature then off the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.939 
when it reaches temperature then off the
Holly<00:00:23.070> both<00:00:23.760> flames<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:24.840> come<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.830> when

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
Holly both flames all come on and when

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.320 
Holly both flames all come on and when
it<00:00:26.039> reaches<00:00:26.340> an<00:00:26.400> end<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.609> temperature<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> low

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
it reaches an end of temperature the low

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.750 
it reaches an end of temperature the low
flame<00:00:27.630> will<00:00:27.869> drop<00:00:28.080> off<00:00:28.460> basically<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
flame will drop off basically all it is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.759 
flame will drop off basically all it is
it's<00:00:30.029> two<00:00:30.480> oil<00:00:30.660> pipes<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> bayonet<00:00:31.619> with

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
it's two oil pipes in the bayonet with

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.040 
it's two oil pipes in the bayonet with
an<00:00:31.890> ignition<00:00:32.040> system<00:00:34.070> lights<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> flame<00:00:36.050> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
an ignition system lights the flame a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
an ignition system lights the flame a
lot<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.710> probe<00:00:37.980> takes<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.489> photograph<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.090> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
lot of probe takes a photograph of it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.500 
lot of probe takes a photograph of it
I'll<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.510> show<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.640> which<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> faulty<00:00:42.270> cell

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I'll just show it which is a faulty cell

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
I'll just show it which is a faulty cell
there<00:00:43.430> which<00:00:44.430> looks<00:00:44.670> at<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> flame<00:00:46.160> that's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
there which looks at the flame that's

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.560 
there which looks at the flame that's
your<00:00:47.340> safety<00:00:47.670> device<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.120> make<00:00:48.210> sure<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
your safety device to make sure that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.869 
your safety device to make sure that
obviously<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.079> fire<00:00:49.289> before<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.829> puts<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
obviously it's fire before it puts the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.990 
obviously it's fire before it puts the
following<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.719> yeah<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.739> say<00:00:53.730> I've<00:00:53.850> just

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
following on to it yeah I say I've just

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.779 
following on to it yeah I say I've just
rebuilt<00:00:54.480> these<00:00:54.660> well<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.469> them<00:00:55.670> put<00:00:56.670> new

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
rebuilt these well one of them put new

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
rebuilt these well one of them put new
nozzles<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> math<00:00:57.570> I'll<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.109> show<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
nozzles on the math I'll just show you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.580 
nozzles on the math I'll just show you
that<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> way<00:00:58.710> basically<00:01:00.140> these<00:01:01.140> boilers

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
that the way basically these boilers

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.859 
that the way basically these boilers
about<00:01:02.070> 300<00:01:02.640> kilowatt<00:01:03.449> each<00:01:05.600> which<00:01:06.600> I've

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
about 300 kilowatt each which I've

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
about 300 kilowatt each which I've
worked<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> manufactures<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
worked out with the manufactures you

worked out with the manufactures you
make<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> banners<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:11.570> four<00:01:12.570> gallon

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
make the banners for it it's four gallon

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.070 
make the banners for it it's four gallon
an<00:01:13.170> hour<00:01:13.760> basically<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.299> I'll<00:01:16.020> just

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
an hour basically what it is I'll just

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.039 
an hour basically what it is I'll just
show<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.409> these<00:01:16.500> easier<00:01:16.979> muscles<00:01:17.840> but<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049

show you these easier muscles but just
play<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> pan<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.740> oil<00:01:19.830> into<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> banner<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
play a pan of oil into the banner as it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.950 
play a pan of oil into the banner as it
likes<00:01:21.409> basically<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:23.100> biggest<00:01:23.310> nozzle

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
likes basically your biggest nozzle

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.289 
likes basically your biggest nozzle
which<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:26.060> 12.75

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
which is a 12.75

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.899 
which is a 12.75
which<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> low<00:01:28.350> you've<00:01:29.130> got<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.549> point<00:01:29.759> two

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
which is low you've got a one point two

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.520 
which is low you've got a one point two
five<00:01:30.650> which<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.680> high<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.869> plays<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> mist

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
five which is high and it's plays a mist

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.819 
five which is high and it's plays a mist
which<00:01:35.130> lights<00:01:36.380> both<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.040> combustion

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
which lights both the combustion

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
which lights both the combustion
obviously<00:01:40.829> mimics<00:01:41.460> it'll<00:01:41.729> change<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.659> what

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
obviously mimics it'll change so what

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
obviously mimics it'll change so what
happens<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.200> I've<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> new<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.700> on

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
happens is I've just put a new one on

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.020 
happens is I've just put a new one on
this<00:01:45.020> basically<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.350> fires<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.220> set<00:01:47.820> air

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
this basically it fires on a set air

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.490 
this basically it fires on a set air
mixture<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.810> low<00:01:48.869> fire<00:01:49.829> which<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.220> two<00:01:50.460> points

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
mixture on low fire which is two points

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.319 
mixture on low fire which is two points
2.75<00:01:52.500> gallon<00:01:52.950> an<00:01:53.070> hour<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.210> your

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
2.75 gallon an hour then when your

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.120 
2.75 gallon an hour then when your
thermostat<00:01:54.840> calls<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.380> more<00:01:55.500> heat<00:01:55.770> say<00:01:56.009> it's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
thermostat calls for more heat say it's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.219 
thermostat calls for more heat say it's
cold<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.439> what<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.530> does<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.040> opens<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.460> little

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
cold and what it does it opens a little

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.580 
cold and what it does it opens a little
hydraulic<00:02:01.229> damper<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:01.950> yeah<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.439> put

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
hydraulic damper there yeah you just put

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.819 
hydraulic damper there yeah you just put
on

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
on

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.530 
on
and<00:02:04.920> there's<00:02:05.790> your<00:02:05.909> there<00:02:06.060> makes<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.360> there

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and there's your there makes you there

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.770 
and there's your there makes you there
it's<00:02:06.780> set<00:02:07.020> low<00:02:07.229> flame<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.860> five

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it's set low flame at five

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:21.310 
it's set low flame at five
50<00:02:10.229> percent<00:02:11.690> sorry<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:13.140> over<00:02:13.350> 40%<00:02:13.800> 45%<00:02:20.180> so

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
50 percent sorry just over 40% 45% so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.380 
50 percent sorry just over 40% 45% so
there<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.440> go

I'll<00:03:38.650> drop<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:38.980> back<00:03:39.069> off

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.170 

see<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.400> round<00:03:45.610> moves<00:03:46.140> again

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
see the round moves again

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.720 
see the round moves again
this<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.629> like<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:49.079> is<00:03:49.590> right<00:03:49.950> in<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.159> 1.35

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
this is like this is right in the 1.35

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.510 
this is like this is right in the 1.35
muzzle

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
muzzle

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.790 
muzzle
so<00:03:53.640> with<00:03:53.850> full<00:03:54.090> gallon<00:03:54.540> an<00:03:55.140> hour

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.160 

us<00:03:58.490> balance<00:03:58.910> by<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.120> way

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.070 

basically<00:04:05.830> all<00:04:06.010> juicers<00:04:06.640> I'll<00:04:07.570> just<00:04:07.780> explain

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
basically all juicers I'll just explain

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.949 
basically all juicers I'll just explain
here<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.470> two<00:04:08.680> thermostats

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.949 

right<00:04:12.829> number<00:04:13.219> one<00:04:13.370> thermostat

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
right number one thermostat

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.729 
right number one thermostat
which<00:04:15.079> controls<00:04:15.620> your<00:04:15.980> loan<00:04:16.310> fire<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.530> your

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
which controls your loan fire and your

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.969 
which controls your loan fire and your
high<00:04:18.859> fire<00:04:19.299> which<00:04:20.299> then<00:04:20.600> link<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.560> these<00:04:21.769> one

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
high fire which then link to these one

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.700 
high fire which then link to these one
and<00:04:22.100> two<00:04:22.310> solenoid<00:04:23.150> valves<00:04:23.539> it

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.920 

so<00:04:28.160> as<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.370> terms<00:04:28.610> that's<00:04:28.880> Colin<00:04:29.449> but

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
so as you terms that's Colin but

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.030 
so as you terms that's Colin but
basically<00:04:30.320> that's<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.620> differential

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
basically that's the differential

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.129 
basically that's the differential
thermostats<00:04:31.790> so<00:04:32.389> obviously<00:04:32.660> one<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:32.960> them

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
thermostats so obviously one of them

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.279 
thermostats so obviously one of them
will<00:04:33.229> be<00:04:33.380> on<00:04:33.410> number<00:04:34.220> one<00:04:34.520> will<00:04:34.699> be<00:04:34.850> on<00:04:34.970> about

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
will be on number one will be on about

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.930 
will be on number one will be on about
seventy-five<00:04:36.289> degrees<00:04:36.500> C<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.490> if<00:04:37.639> you<00:04:37.699> drop

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
seventy-five degrees C and if you drop

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.360 
seventy-five degrees C and if you drop
your<00:04:37.970> other<00:04:38.270> one<00:04:38.419> about<00:04:38.770> seventy<00:04:39.770> degrees<00:04:40.130> C

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
your other one about seventy degrees C

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.420 
your other one about seventy degrees C
as<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.570> as<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.840> leaks<00:04:42.229> nil<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.650> temperature<00:04:43.160> the

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
as it as it leaks nil of temperature the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.760 
as it as it leaks nil of temperature the
second<00:04:43.729> step<00:04:43.940> kicks<00:04:44.240> in<00:04:44.479> and<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.320> will<00:04:45.410> drop<00:04:45.560> it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
second step kicks in and it will drop it

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.279 
second step kicks in and it will drop it
back<00:04:45.949> down

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
back down

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.409 
back down
to<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.770> lower<00:04:47.949> nozzle<00:04:48.399> so<00:04:48.639> just<00:04:48.909> tickles<00:04:49.300> the

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
to the lower nozzle so just tickles the

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.950 
to the lower nozzle so just tickles the

kilowatts<00:05:54.570> off<00:05:54.720> for<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:54.930> boiler<00:05:55.260> so

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
kilowatts off for the boiler so

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.690 
kilowatts off for the boiler so
obviously<00:05:55.830> these<00:05:56.010> boilers<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.400> kick

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
obviously these boilers to kick

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.790 
obviously these boilers to kick
something<00:05:57.060> about<00:05:58.070> 290<00:05:59.070> kilowatts<00:05:59.550> so

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
something about 290 kilowatts so

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.750 
something about 290 kilowatts so
obviously<00:06:01.800> you've<00:06:01.980> got<00:06:02.010> a<00:06:02.160> message<00:06:02.400> with<00:06:02.639> the

obviously you've got a message with the

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.659 
obviously you've got a message with the
kilowatts<00:06:03.450> of<00:06:03.540> the<00:06:03.720> bear<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.370> let<00:06:05.370> me<00:06:05.520> show

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
kilowatts of the bear that let me show

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.280 
kilowatts of the bear that let me show
you<00:06:05.730> the<00:06:05.850> combustion<00:06:06.360> of<00:06:06.450> the<00:06:06.510> sámi<00:06:06.780> computer

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
you the combustion of the sámi computer

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.720 
you the combustion of the sámi computer
which<00:06:07.410> got<00:06:07.680> cooked<00:06:07.950> in<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.160> back<00:06:08.280> of<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.460> flow

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
which got cooked in the back of the flow

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.190 
which got cooked in the back of the flow
and<00:06:09.210> the<00:06:09.330> chimbley<00:06:09.630> silicide<00:06:10.169> there<00:06:11.990> is<00:06:12.990> my

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
and the chimbley silicide there is my

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.190 
and the chimbley silicide there is my
machine

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:26.190 

no<00:06:17.200> garnish<00:06:17.650> Wyatt

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200

you<00:06:26.560> see<00:06:26.710> that<00:06:26.860> number<00:06:27.010> dropping<00:06:27.340> down<00:06:27.610> to<00:06:27.640> CL

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
you see that number dropping down to CL

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.010 
you see that number dropping down to CL
parts<00:06:28.510> per<00:06:28.630> million

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.260 

that's<00:06:34.590> good<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:34.980> initial<00:06:35.370> fire<00:06:35.640> it<00:06:35.880> sends<00:06:36.180> it

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
that's good the initial fire it sends it

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.720 
that's good the initial fire it sends it
off<00:06:36.420> but<00:06:37.050> then<00:06:37.260> watches<00:06:37.950> the<00:06:38.490> flame

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730 
off but then watches the flame

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.780 
off but then watches the flame
stabilizes<00:06:39.570> it<00:06:39.690> will<00:06:39.840> drop<00:06:40.020> down

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.360 

yeah<00:06:43.300> it's<00:06:43.450> still<00:06:43.660> dropping

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
yeah it's still dropping

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.280 
yeah it's still dropping
let<00:06:45.550> me<00:06:45.639> show<00:06:45.820> the<00:06:45.970> efficiency<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.750> parts

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
let me show the efficiency the parts

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.820 
let me show the efficiency the parts
gone<00:06:47.500> off<00:06:47.730> got<00:06:48.730> off<00:06:48.820> on<00:06:49.000> there<00:06:49.620> the<00:06:50.620> time

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
gone off got off on there the time

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.540 
gone off got off on there the time
overridden<00:06:51.610> that<00:06:51.790> you<00:06:51.850> see<00:06:52.979> yep

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
overridden that you see yep

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.460 
overridden that you see yep
so<00:06:54.760> there<00:06:54.940> you<00:06:54.970> go<00:06:55.210> that's<00:06:55.540> roughly<00:06:55.960> how<00:06:56.199> oil

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
so there you go that's roughly how oil

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.820 
so there you go that's roughly how oil
boiler<00:06:56.830> works<00:06:57.240> hope<00:06:58.240> you<00:06:58.419> find<00:06:58.540> this

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
boiler works hope you find this

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:06.090 
boiler works hope you find this
information<00:06:59.830> useful<00:07:00.310> and<00:07:02.820> bye<00:07:03.820> for<00:07:03.880> now
