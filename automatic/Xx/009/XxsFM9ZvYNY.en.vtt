00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.660
 we will have high pressure and drink to pass 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.760
 of cold fronts 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.200
 even today the cold front can reach and it is 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.019
 exactly what we can see 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.660
 on this map of the next 15 days 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.340
 accumulated rainfall for the whole of Brazil to 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.470
 people can see that in southern areas 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
 from brazil the trend is a little more 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 rain due to the passage of the fronts 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.800
 the fronts and 10 can move forward. 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.820
 by areas from the south to the center 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.439
 south of são paulo 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.900
 organizing instabilities and bringing 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.030
 rain even on areas of the river of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 January is forecast to rain 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.200
 during this period the directions of rain 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 can reach up to 70 millimeters 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 accumulated but only looks at areas of the center 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.469
 south of são paulo took in the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.239
 river catching the valley of the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.760
 areas of the capital nor in the eastern 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.770
 we have conditions for rain volumes of 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 up to 100 mm accumulated during 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.809
 this period in areas also of parana and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.270
 areas of the west of Santa Catarina and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.649
 of the east center of the rio grande do sul 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.539
 large volumes of rain are also 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 expected until the 4th 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.140
 we must have an even condition of an air 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 driest over central areas of Brazil 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.310
 the predominance of the over-hosting system 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.229
 high atmospheric pressure marking 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.600
 presence in preventing the formation of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.460
 large clouds loaded after the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.890
 the cold front 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.290
 cooling on areas of the southern region 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.840
 Why should I have polar air? 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.729
 entering with greater facility 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.259
 favoring the temperature drop then 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.540
 we can see that the temperatures 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.939
 will rise a little higher for 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.220
 girls slightly lower expected 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.110
 until the end of this week 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.460
 all because of the popular high 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.159
 is advancing to the region 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.439
 however this high polar will stay 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 blocked to areas of the southeast region 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.670
 She will not be able to move forward. 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.799
 we have a retention of this whole cold 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 areas of the southern region of Brazil in the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.810
 However, the southeast region should not feel 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.880
 both the effects of polar air because 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.920
 tendency is the persistence of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.820
 maintenance of air in the average levels 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.820
 atmospheric
