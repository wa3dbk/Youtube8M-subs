00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:09.059
 then salvation today I wanted to show 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.690
 just a tutorial to install 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.790
 set the emulator for 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.630
 playstation or on your mobile 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.310
 Android 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.970
 then basically the programs that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.350
 I seem to be is psi xvi than the others 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 our masonry en ecm for droid that not 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.510
 is nothing but a converter to make the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.059
 ecm point in bing point file that then 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:39.140
 will be read by our emulator and a 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.030
 any program that manages to 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 manage zippo stitch files 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.309
 I recommend z chimera for whom 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.780
 just as it is free and serves 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.579
 also from excellent file manager e 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.070
 in my opinion and in my opinion the best 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.820
 then once these three have been downloaded 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.449
 programs 12 and then any 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.610
 program to develop and indeed seems 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.490
 we go on the web in particular 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.670
 let's go to amy paradise and click 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.420
 on the bios files section here but for 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.399
 download the file the bios file of 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.369
 nosta of our emulator or this 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:24.080
 here psx bios scp h100 1.0 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.740
 once downloaded I do not redeem it 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.810
 koper that is already downloaded we will go into 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.009
 download and you say click on the cc 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.929
 will be asked to complete 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.009
 action with one of the programs that 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:43.700
 can read the zip and I have gods 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.640
 Japanese larcher once used 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.350
 the dark per will show you just the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.960
 its content its content this 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.210
 file stitch bim this file then it 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.520
 we're going to move into a folder that 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.460
 you believe 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.579
 inside your microsd or 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.799
 yours of your card 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:09.070
 that is, your internal memory card 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:13.160
 a card read not on the file manager 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.170
 opens directly so I created it 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.920
 a microsd me is equal to installments of 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.709
 I generally believe a toms folder and one 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.329
 folder then bios and here is to put 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:30.440
 this file you just extracted 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:35.180
 or see storage ex ex ex sd card 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.489
 psi bios and there is to put this file 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.180
 raw time did this go on yours 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.180
 walls 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 and even on preferences here it comes out 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.920
 written bios file where you have to put 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.780
 precisely yours is the path of the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.629
 your of your portfolio just 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.579
 created with the bios point file 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.239
 file once done this is an emulator 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.629
 ready for i is going to run new 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.579
 games 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.409
 here we see firm paradise can not 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.970
 download any rom inside 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.970
 of the site 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.519
 let's go to roms isos and games e 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.269
 download any on 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.739
 I don't drain because it is just for psx io 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.049
 I don't unload just for those who already have it 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:39.560
 and then once unloaded we go to the 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:39.560
 download download 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:48.569
 then let's see if I can find here 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.380
 here you see this here crash bandicoot 3 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.019
 mar for point 07 this file 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.269
 practically a file that must be 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.810
 prior, therefore, then managed again 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.609
 like z hardware then we click 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.290
 so he said we see display 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.440
 you see that there is a point file inside 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.799
 since this file then sends fed 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:16.470
 distracting extracts we are going to extract 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:18.739
 in a folder of the folder where it is 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.930
 also the bios 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:27.720
 so here where we are rom know where it is 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.729
 find roms maestra cream another 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.130
 roms folder inside roms 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.500
 follow another psx l extreme folder 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.050
 in here 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.860
 we wait for it to be extracted to finish 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.860
 precisely ours 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:05:02.870
 to complete the creation of this 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:05:05.210
 point of the game has long been 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.860
 also downloaded tomb raider 3 and everything 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:13.310
 serves well enough 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:18.410
 certainly they are a little uncomfortable commands though 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:21.320
 however with a bit of habit one can 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.910
 let's play old games without 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.910
 without great difficulty 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.720
 another ten seconds among other things vi 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.430
 I recommend downloading this z arches 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.170
 I see why in my opinion it is one of the 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.180
 best file manager in addition to managing 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.730
 izip present on the market 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.690
 then once downloaded to ours 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:03.360
 precisely here we are in roms here is the 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.220
 bios here 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.860
 we believe that this will remain psx with 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.540
 di.bi but you see that the file that mine 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.970
 zipped little girl is an ecm point then 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.040
 this makes the ecm point will not be elected 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.780
 from our emulated flight the emulator does not 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.460
 will see it pro because the masonry wants a 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.370
 file point b then what we will go to 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.610
 simply click on it 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:30.120
 if you consider also for will come precisely 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.950
 managed opened and a real one will be made 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.630
 miss but the list of all the apps 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.500
 applications that can try to 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.240
 open it 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:42.200
 you have it with an ecm for droid 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.200
 click above 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.850
 once opened it will tell you must 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.020
 wait just 5 20 minutes for this 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.640
 operation 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.990
 you want to continue you will click on yes 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.120
 you will wait these minutes and they would come 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.560
 hd point b was a click because of it 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.420
 the point bing already heaven and therefore 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.220
 would give me an error then a small but 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.750
 you have to click on once exactly 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.660
 done this procedure 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.490
 you will have a point ecm a point that bean 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.580
 this one crash bandicoot is the same 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:19.680
 name except the score 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.820
 once you've done all of them 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.680
 everything is needed to start the 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:28.420
 game and just go to the real game via 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.730
 it will take the directory directly 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.480
 where your a tobin e are present 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.480
 click on the game 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:42.040
 well I certainly have already saved 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:43.510
 so it's the game works at 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.990
 perfection sees here marry i 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:54.130
 keys I hope you enjoyed this
