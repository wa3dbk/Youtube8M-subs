00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.130
 good afternoon friends from youtube makes a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.750
 I made a video with the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.549
 effects of the toner with the images 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.710
 now let's be commenting a bit that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.050
 is the symptom and why they occur 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 these effects first of all we are going to 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.590
 start by saying that when there is a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 excessively muscular body that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.750
 surely have seen in many photos or 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.670
 videos with biceps so disproportionate 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.349
 they have had a little bit way 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.030
 natural and we're probably going too 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.640
 of a person who has used the sector 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.380
 but that the symptom does not many times 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.850
 people are confused even all the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.850
 principle of confused thinking that the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.219
 symptom is a steroid but not the one without 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.489
 Sun is not a steroid if you do not have a 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.780
 oil and it's not even a medication 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.850
 basically the belt is an oil that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.280
 It is mainly composed of acids 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.860
 fatty and to a lesser extent alcohol 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.739
 benzyl and lidocaine how are we 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.359
 seeing in the photos above in the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.000
 effect that the belt has ex them 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.589
 nice to the eye so this acid 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.720
 which is the single was developed by 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.700
 crytek clark 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.380
 I was wrong in the 80s with the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.990
 intention that bodybuilders the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.480
 Bodybuilders could fix their 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.510
 muscle defects in search of the 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 perfect symmetry without mainly being 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.960
 use on the arms and when these are 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.910
 deny say to grow by effect of already 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.210
 be for little exercise and also people 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.550
 the oil that is the belt is injected and 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.040
 allows the muscle to expand and in 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.890
 consequence increase the volume what 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.510
 yes many people today 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.400
 abuse in this oil that can 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.080
 produce an aesthetic body brings as 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.610
 result a ridiculous body like 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.460
 we are seeing in the photo above with 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.390
 completely unnatural ways only 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.030
 you have to do a google search 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.729
 images with the words zinc all 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.830
 the sector of the belt to realize 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.440
 that the other effects are 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.360
 completely negative in the body and 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.520
 what if the tuning offers results 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.619
 instantaneous without the need to train 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.330
 the problem is that it is completely 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.100
 unnatural and as I told you 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.140
 previously unattractive as they are 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.420
 seeing in the photos above 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.240
 it is something completely unpleasant as 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.390
 I told him before to do the idea with which 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.370
 was created the belt is so that when 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.930
 a muscle can not grow by various 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.450
 reasons why you go to the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.100
 gym and train every day there 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.020
 muscles that some people do not 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.480
 grows that's why six is ​​five for 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.550
 that for example is killed in the gym and 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.440
 you have a giant arm but here back 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.840
 you have a muscle that does not grow good 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.640
 and if he's made for that so he can 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.530
 try there is more or less than the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.989
 harmony with the rest of the arm but what 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.540
 happened today everyone wants the 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.060
 easy way and you are using it without a 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.310
 every hour and at all times which 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.400
 they basically look like michelin dolls 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.250
 or it looks like hot air balloons that can 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.530
 approach a needle and they will explode by 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.239
 that is that in this day there is so much 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.220
 problem for the sector because even 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.320
 there are people who just spend the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.269
 belt and then they explode the muscles not 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.650
 I'm going to put pictures of people who 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.810
 muscles exploded because it's 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.760
 quite unpleasant because I 've seen it 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.549
 of them watched videos 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.019
 and be the recommendation that any 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.579
 person will give you is that they never use 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.250
 without all the less that they have the 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.019
 need for obligation to be 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.209
 bodybuilders and have to 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.900
 just compensate some muscle that 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.909
 does not grow but as we continue to see in the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.040
 photo as I told you for the third time is 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.310
 completely unnatural and unpleasant 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.610
 the effect of 5 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.989
 and at least that's the information I'm going 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.400
 to provide for now the belt will 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.560
 call ahead we will be seeing 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.480
 some aspects more we are also going to 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.739
 be talking about steroids and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.720
 also of steroid abuse 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.090
 just because the steroid for more 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.700
 that is not bad as the sintrom also 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.650
 it has its negative side like everything there is 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.050
 fast road to success as always 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.790
 they say and that was it for the video of 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.800
 now if they liked it they put me like and 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.430
 subscribe and if they want me to send them 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.470
 regards 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.760
 put me down to send you greetings 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.110
 that when we have five thousand 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.780
 subscribers I will be doing a 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.220
 special video as a compiled 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.709
 sending greetings to all those who 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.390
 have left and that was all for now if 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.660
 They liked it, they know how they put it, I like it 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.660
 coffee
