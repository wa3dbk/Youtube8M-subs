00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.229 

I<00:00:44.290> thought<00:00:45.070> our<00:00:45.130> workouts<00:00:45.670> I<00:00:45.760> wanted<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.090> win

I thought our workouts I wanted to win

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.950 
I thought our workouts I wanted to win
and<00:00:46.450> then<00:00:46.600> I<00:00:47.579> wanted<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.640> be<00:00:48.700> consistent<00:00:49.270> but<00:00:49.570> I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
and then I wanted to be consistent but I

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.619 
and then I wanted to be consistent but I
think<00:00:50.890> my<00:00:50.980> main<00:00:51.129> aim<00:00:51.309> was<00:00:51.340> just<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:51.910> know<00:00:51.970> time

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
think my main aim was just you know time

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.840 
think my main aim was just you know time
winsome<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.770> know<00:00:53.890> if<00:00:54.100> I<00:00:54.220> crashed<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:54.670> some

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
winsome you know if I crashed in some

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.540 
winsome you know if I crashed in some
resource<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.360> it's<00:00:55.449> alright<00:00:55.660> but<00:00:55.900> -<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:57.040> stay

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
resource and it's alright but - to stay

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.190 

didn't<00:01:06.880> change<00:01:07.150> anything<00:01:07.420> massively<00:01:07.869> just

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
didn't change anything massively just

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.570 
didn't change anything massively just
like<00:01:08.350> improved<00:01:08.770> on<00:01:08.860> everything<00:01:09.160> I<00:01:09.220> was<00:01:09.340> doing

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
like improved on everything I was doing

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.890 
like improved on everything I was doing
my<00:01:09.700> tried<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.060> make<00:01:10.180> everything<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.630> little<00:01:10.750> bit

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
my tried to make everything a little bit

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.770 
my tried to make everything a little bit
faster<00:01:11.770> more<00:01:11.920> effective<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.970> got<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.509> slightly

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
faster more effective and got a slightly

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.510 
faster more effective and got a slightly
big<00:01:13.990> bike<00:01:14.259> which<00:01:14.619> I<00:01:14.710> think<00:01:14.890> it's<00:01:14.979> helped<00:01:15.250> like

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
big bike which I think it's helped like

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.920 
big bike which I think it's helped like
for<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.759> new<00:01:15.940> fast<00:01:16.180> World<00:01:16.390> Cup<00:01:16.539> tracks<00:01:16.750> these

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
for the new fast World Cup tracks these

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.740 
for the new fast World Cup tracks these
days<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.700> kind<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.759> feels<00:01:18.970> more<00:01:19.030> stable<00:01:19.330> it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
days and kind of feels more stable it's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.719 
days and kind of feels more stable it's
just<00:01:20.200> easy<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.680> go<00:01:20.800> faster<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.220> everything's

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
just easy to go faster and everything's

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.719 
just easy to go faster and everything's
good<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:22.330> good<00:01:22.509> yeah<00:01:23.020> good<00:01:23.890> softer<00:01:24.220> my<00:01:24.550> power

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
good it's good yeah good softer my power

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.609 
good it's good yeah good softer my power
improved<00:01:25.180> BAE<00:01:25.360> it's<00:01:25.600> has<00:01:25.840> done<00:01:26.080> every<00:01:26.289> year<00:01:26.320> I

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
improved BAE it's has done every year I

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.020 
improved BAE it's has done every year I
guess<00:01:26.979> I'm<00:01:27.130> getting<00:01:27.220> older<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.670> each<00:01:27.789> year<00:01:27.970> I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
guess I'm getting older to each year I

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.830 
guess I'm getting older to each year I
get<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.240> bit<00:01:28.360> stronger<00:01:30.300> but<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:31.360> think<00:01:31.660> more<00:01:31.780> than

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
get a bit stronger but I think more than

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240 
get a bit stronger but I think more than
anything<00:01:32.080> like<00:01:32.380> trying<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.649> chase<00:01:32.890> Matt<00:01:33.130> and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
anything like trying to chase Matt and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.600 
anything like trying to chase Matt and
Sam<00:01:33.369> down<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.890> yeah<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:35.920> think<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.340> every<00:01:36.520> year

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
Sam down and yeah I think so every year

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.859 
Sam down and yeah I think so every year
you<00:01:36.670> learn<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.910> little<00:01:37.030> bit<00:01:37.210> more<00:01:37.360> like<00:01:37.630> even

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
you learn a little bit more like even

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.120 
you learn a little bit more like even
this<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.110> have<00:01:38.200> learned<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.530> much<00:01:38.649> each<00:01:38.860> will

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
this you have learned so much each will

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.859 
this you have learned so much each will
kind<00:01:39.610> of<00:01:39.640> try<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.210> remember<00:01:40.360> what<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.660> need<00:01:40.780> to

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
kind of try to remember what I need to

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.150 
kind of try to remember what I need to
know<00:01:40.929> for<00:01:41.229> this<00:01:41.320> went<00:01:41.530> again<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:41.860> improve

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
know for this went again to improve

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.759 
know for this went again to improve
again<00:01:42.429> next<00:01:42.610> year
