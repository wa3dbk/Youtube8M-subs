00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
it farther first let's talk about

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.119 
it farther first let's talk about
tension<00:00:46.840> tension<00:00:47.379> is<00:00:47.680> something<00:00:48.010> that

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
tension tension is something that

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.549 
tension tension is something that
restricts<00:00:48.579> speed<00:00:48.850> if<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.719> winds<00:00:49.930> blowin<00:00:50.379> or

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
restricts speed if the winds blowin or

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.200 
restricts speed if the winds blowin or
if<00:00:50.800> we're<00:00:50.950> trying<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.250> hit<00:00:51.399> it<00:00:51.550> farther<00:00:51.820> the

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
if we're trying to hit it farther the

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.939 
if we're trying to hit it farther the
majority<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.690> my<00:00:52.840> players<00:00:53.140> tend<00:00:53.559> to<00:00:53.620> grip<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:53.920> a

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
majority of my players tend to grip it a

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.290 
majority of my players tend to grip it a
little<00:00:54.160> tighter<00:00:54.370> swing<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.059> little<00:00:55.149> harder

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
little tighter swing a little harder

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.029 
little tighter swing a little harder
with<00:00:55.629> tension<00:00:55.930> that<00:00:56.230> actually<00:00:56.590> restricts

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
with tension that actually restricts

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.160 
with tension that actually restricts
speed<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.820> I<00:00:57.850> need<00:00:58.090> you<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:58.300> take<00:00:58.539> a<00:00:58.570> quality

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
speed so I need you to take a quality

speed on the through side that'll

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.920 
speed on the through side that'll
definitely<00:01:56.470> allow<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.070> hit<00:01:57.189> it<00:01:57.220> further
