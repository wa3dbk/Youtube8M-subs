00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
was wondering how I was going to be able

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.860 
was wondering how I was going to be able
to<00:00:56.190> play<00:00:56.340> without<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.210> finger<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
to play without the finger you know I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.049 
to play without the finger you know I
mean<00:00:58.230> without<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.620> particular<00:00:58.949> finger<00:00:59.489> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
mean without that particular finger it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.700 
mean without that particular finger it
doesn't<00:01:00.359> seem<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> make<00:01:00.780> much<00:01:00.840> difference<00:01:01.350> I

doesn't seem to make much difference I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.380 
doesn't seem to make much difference I
guess<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.219> matter<00:01:02.430> too<00:01:02.730> much<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:03.239> your
