00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.240 
so this is starting to look pretty good
right<00:03:32.960> now

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.620 

smell<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.340> once<00:03:37.490> I<00:03:37.670> can<00:03:37.700> smell<00:03:38.000> those<00:03:38.210> pecans

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
smell it once I can smell those pecans

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.360 
smell it once I can smell those pecans
it's<00:03:38.900> got<00:03:39.020> a<00:03:39.050> very<00:03:39.260> sweet<00:03:39.620> soft<00:03:40.010> nutty

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
it's got a very sweet soft nutty

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.730 
it's got a very sweet soft nutty
aromatic<00:03:40.850> flavor<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.300> it<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.620> we're<00:03:42.710> just

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
aromatic flavor to it so we're just

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.690 
aromatic flavor to it so we're just
gonna<00:03:42.890> add<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.370> juice<00:03:43.520> of<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:44.660> lemon<00:03:44.780> here<00:03:45.700> and

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
gonna add the juice of a lemon here and

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.950 
gonna add the juice of a lemon here and
you<00:03:46.820> can<00:03:46.910> see<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.210> bubbles<00:03:47.510> are<00:03:47.660> starting<00:03:47.750> to

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
you can see the bubbles are starting to

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.020 
you can see the bubbles are starting to
die

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.060 

depending<00:03:54.780> on<00:03:54.870> how<00:03:55.260> acidic<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.770> want<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
depending on how acidic you want the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.590 
depending on how acidic you want the
sauce<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.400> think<00:03:56.640> about<00:03:56.820> two<00:03:57.060> pieces<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.510> lemon

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
sauce I think about two pieces of lemon

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.060 
sauce I think about two pieces of lemon
like<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:57.990> is<00:03:58.170> good<00:03:58.350> enough<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:58.560> maybe<00:03:58.860> up<00:03:59.040> to

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
like that is good enough for maybe up to

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.580 
like that is good enough for maybe up to
about<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.400> half<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.760> lemon<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:01.140> at<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.350> point

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
about a half a lemon so at this point

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.500 
about a half a lemon so at this point
we're<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.460> transfer<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.060> sauce<00:04:03.240> over

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
we're going to transfer the sauce over

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:23.020 
we're going to transfer the sauce over
to<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> blender

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.370 

from<00:04:23.510> here<00:04:23.660> we're<00:04:23.810> probably<00:04:23.900> gonna<00:04:24.140> have<00:04:24.230> to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
from here we're probably gonna have to

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.430 
from here we're probably gonna have to
add<00:04:24.650> maybe<00:04:25.430> about<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:25.850> half<00:04:26.390> cup<00:04:26.840> or<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:27.410> of

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
add maybe about a half cup or so of

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.790 
add maybe about a half cup or so of
water<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:28.580> enable<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.180> turn<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.680> can

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
water to enable it to turn so you can

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.160 
water to enable it to turn so you can
take<00:04:30.980> your<00:04:31.130> water<00:04:31.540> get<00:04:32.540> out<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.840> last<00:04:32.870> little

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
take your water get out the last little

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.810 
take your water get out the last little
bits<00:04:33.500> from<00:04:33.680> your<00:04:33.800> pan<00:04:35.140> add<00:04:36.140> your<00:04:36.290> water<00:04:36.440> in<00:04:36.820> see

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
bits from your pan add your water in see

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.130 
bits from your pan add your water in see
if<00:04:37.910> something<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.240> looks<00:04:38.390> about<00:04:38.480> like<00:04:38.600> that

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
if something that looks about like that

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.410 
if something that looks about like that
now<00:04:39.350> we're<00:04:39.470> gonna<00:04:39.590> period<00:04:39.920> that<00:04:40.240> now<00:04:41.240> with

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
now we're gonna period that now with

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.450 
now we're gonna period that now with
everything<00:04:41.750> in<00:04:42.020> cooking<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.310> add

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
everything in cooking you have to add

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.550 
everything in cooking you have to add
salt<00:04:43.790> it's<00:04:44.360> not<00:04:44.510> enough<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.990> solve<00:04:45.170> just<00:04:45.380> one

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
salt it's not enough to solve just one

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.300 
salt it's not enough to solve just one
part<00:04:45.980> of<00:04:46.070> your<00:04:46.190> dish<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:48.040> we're<00:04:49.040> gonna<00:04:49.130> add

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
part of your dish so we're gonna add

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.370 
part of your dish so we're gonna add
some<00:04:49.340> salt<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.790> this<00:04:50.000> before<00:04:50.240> we<00:04:50.540> begin<00:04:50.780> this

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
some salt to this before we begin this

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.130 
some salt to this before we begin this
is<00:04:51.590> kosher<00:04:51.830> salt<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.060> what<00:04:53.240> most<00:04:53.870> chefs

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
is kosher salt this is what most chefs

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.810 
is kosher salt this is what most chefs
use<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.980> season<00:04:55.600> meaning<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:58.340> season<00:04:58.700> with

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
use to season meaning to season with

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.540 
use to season meaning to season with
before<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.450> cooking<00:04:59.750> process<00:04:59.930> begins<00:05:00.560> so

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
before the cooking process begins so

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.510 
before the cooking process begins so
we'll<00:05:01.669> add<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:02.740> kosher<00:05:03.740> salt<00:05:03.980> in<00:05:04.070> here<00:05:04.220> and

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
we'll add the kosher salt in here and

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.800 
we'll add the kosher salt in here and
we'll<00:05:04.910> take<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.150> over<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.419> blender<00:05:05.570> and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
we'll take it over to the blender and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.180 
we'll take it over to the blender and
we'll<00:05:05.900> finish<00:05:06.050> it<00:05:06.260> up<00:05:06.350> now<00:05:06.890> when<00:05:07.070> you're

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
we'll finish it up now when you're

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.770 
we'll finish it up now when you're
blending<00:05:07.400> something<00:05:08.120> that's<00:05:08.240> hot<00:05:08.480> it's

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
blending something that's hot it's

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.510 
blending something that's hot it's
important<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.530> do<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.680> on<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.860> very<00:05:10.070> low<00:05:10.280> speed

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
important to do it on a very low speed

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.900 
important to do it on a very low speed
and<00:05:10.850> gradually<00:05:11.270> add<00:05:11.830> rpms<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.460> put<00:05:13.669> this<00:05:13.760> on

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
and gradually add rpms so put this on

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.280 
and gradually add rpms so put this on
the<00:05:14.000> blender<00:05:14.240> here<00:05:14.270> make<00:05:14.720> sure<00:05:14.930> we<00:05:15.050> have<00:05:15.169> our

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
the blender here make sure we have our

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.400 
the blender here make sure we have our
top<00:05:15.470> on<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:17.330> that's<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.570> top<00:05:17.750> is<00:05:17.930> covered<00:05:18.080> so

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
top on and that's the top is covered so

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.900 
top on and that's the top is covered so
it's<00:05:19.130> on<00:05:19.250> low<00:05:19.400> speed

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
it's on low speed

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.840 
it's on low speed
sorry<00:05:20.240> long

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.400 

gradually<00:05:23.720> increasing

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
gradually increasing

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.680 
gradually increasing
you<00:05:26.890> seem<00:05:27.310> kind<00:05:27.610> of<00:05:27.670> thin<00:05:27.910> right<00:05:28.150> now<00:05:28.300> but<00:05:28.540> as

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
you seem kind of thin right now but as

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.050 
you seem kind of thin right now but as
we<00:05:28.720> go<00:05:29.100> we've<00:05:30.100> gotten<00:05:30.310> thicker<00:05:30.460> as<00:05:30.730> more<00:05:30.970> of

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
we go we've gotten thicker as more of

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.170 
we go we've gotten thicker as more of
that

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.400 

okay<00:05:40.180> now<00:05:40.390> once<00:05:40.600> it's<00:05:40.840> smooth<00:05:41.080> we're<00:05:41.320> gonna

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
okay now once it's smooth we're gonna

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.840 
okay now once it's smooth we're gonna
have<00:05:41.620> to<00:05:41.710> add<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:41.950> last<00:05:42.160> component<00:05:42.520> of<00:05:42.730> the

dish of the sauce which is gonna be the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.860 
dish of the sauce which is gonna be the
maple<00:05:45.010> syrup<00:05:45.160> now<00:05:45.940> I<00:05:45.970> add<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:46.390> last<00:05:46.600> because

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
maple syrup now I add this last because

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.020 
maple syrup now I add this last because
I<00:05:47.080> want<00:05:47.260> to<00:05:47.290> make<00:05:47.440> sure<00:05:47.680> that<00:05:48.430> we're<00:05:48.610> seasoning

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
I want to make sure that we're seasoning

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.900 
I want to make sure that we're seasoning
it<00:05:49.120> properly<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:50.890> lemons<00:05:51.250> could<00:05:51.460> be<00:05:51.580> sweeter

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
it properly the lemons could be sweeter

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.700 
it properly the lemons could be sweeter
than<00:05:52.000> some<00:05:52.360> other<00:05:52.480> lemons<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.020> pecans<00:05:53.380> could

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
than some other lemons the pecans could

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.690 
than some other lemons the pecans could
be<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.830> little<00:05:54.010> sweeter<00:05:54.250> as<00:05:54.400> well<00:05:54.550> as<00:05:54.610> the

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.550 
be a little sweeter as well as the
onions<00:05:55.030> so<00:05:55.480> I<00:05:55.510> don't<00:05:55.720> know<00:05:55.810> exactly<00:05:55.960> how<00:05:56.440> much

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
onions so I don't know exactly how much

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.560 
onions so I don't know exactly how much
to<00:05:56.890> add<00:05:56.920> so<00:05:57.790> we're<00:05:57.910> just<00:05:57.940> going<00:05:58.180> to<00:05:58.210> taste<00:05:58.420> our

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
to add so we're just going to taste our

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:05.100 
to add so we're just going to taste our

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
sauce now this is fairly sweet so I'm

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.390 
sauce now this is fairly sweet so I'm
not<00:06:05.200> going<00:06:05.350> to<00:06:05.410> add<00:06:05.500> a<00:06:05.530> whole<00:06:05.740> lot<00:06:05.890> of<00:06:05.920> maple<00:06:06.130> to

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
not going to add a whole lot of maple to

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.950 
not going to add a whole lot of maple to
it<00:06:06.490> because<00:06:06.940> we<00:06:07.090> don't<00:06:07.180> want<00:06:07.270> a<00:06:07.420> sweet<00:06:07.690> candy

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.910 
it because we don't want a sweet candy
like<00:06:08.290> sauce<00:06:08.560> this<00:06:09.430> is<00:06:09.610> a<00:06:09.640> great<00:06:09.910> a<00:06:09.940> maple<00:06:10.450> syrup
