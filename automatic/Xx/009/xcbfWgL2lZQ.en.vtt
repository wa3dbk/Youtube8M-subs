front-facing<00:01:58.100> campaign<00:01:58.549> which<00:01:59.090> usually<00:01:59.420> is

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
front-facing campaign which usually is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.830 
front-facing campaign which usually is
not<00:02:00.289> even<00:02:00.649> available<00:02:00.770> on<00:02:01.190> lumia<00:02:01.459> 630<00:02:01.840> so

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
not even available on lumia 630 so

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.260 
not even available on lumia 630 so
obviously<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.679> would<00:02:03.830> not<00:02:03.979> be<00:02:04.159> under<00:02:04.429> 532<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
obviously it would not be under 532 and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.340 
obviously it would not be under 532 and
525<00:02:05.840> 525<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.490> something<00:02:07.700> which<00:02:08.269> is<00:02:08.720> one

all the Nokia built or Nokia quality

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.160 
all the Nokia built or Nokia quality
okay<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:12.739> now<00:03:12.980> let<00:03:13.280> us<00:03:13.480> try<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.510> power<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.049> on

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
okay so now let us try to power it on

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:29.780 
okay so now let us try to power it on
and<00:03:15.230> see<00:03:15.500> how<00:03:15.530> how<00:03:16.370> how<00:03:16.579> would<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.760> looks<00:03:17.060> like

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.630 

so<00:03:30.959> coming<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:31.989> various<00:03:32.859> slots<00:03:33.129> so<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:33.519> a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
so coming to various slots so it's a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.500 
so coming to various slots so it's a
dual-sim<00:03:33.969> device

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
dual-sim device

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.780 
dual-sim device
so<00:03:34.900> here<00:03:35.079> are<00:03:35.260> two<00:03:35.290> slots<00:03:35.560> he<00:03:35.980> says<00:03:36.159> in<00:03:36.370> one<00:03:36.400> and

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
so here are two slots he says in one and

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.360 
so here are two slots he says in one and
his<00:03:37.780> team<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.170> slot<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.769> my<00:03:38.920> crusty

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
his team to slot and this is my crusty

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.479 
his team to slot and this is my crusty
so<00:03:40.150> we<00:03:40.299> will<00:03:40.450> not<00:03:40.959> put<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.319> sim<00:03:41.500> now<00:03:41.829> but<00:03:42.129> we

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
so we will not put the sim now but we

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.979 
so we will not put the sim now but we
will<00:03:42.609> just<00:03:42.849> try<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.090> power<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.599> on<00:03:43.659> the<00:03:43.840> device

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
will just try to power it on the device

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.330 
will just try to power it on the device
and<00:03:44.230> see<00:03:44.379> how<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.750> mean<00:03:46.959> we<00:03:47.829> just<00:03:47.920> share<00:03:48.189> our

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
and see how the I mean we just share our

and see how the I mean we just share our
first<00:03:48.549> impression<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:58.739> here<00:03:59.739> comes<00:03:59.980> -

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129

hello

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.570 

so<00:04:09.570> another<00:04:10.470> good<00:04:10.740> thing<00:04:10.770> about<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.220> device

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
so another good thing about this device

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.140 
so another good thing about this device
is<00:04:12.300> not<00:04:12.930> only<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.770> very<00:04:14.010> much<00:04:14.280> improved<00:04:14.790> over

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
is not only it's very much improved over

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.740 
is not only it's very much improved over
its<00:04:15.980> reducers<00:04:16.980> Inoki<00:04:17.489> exchange<00:04:17.910> as<00:04:18.090> we<00:04:18.570> have

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
its reducers Inoki exchange as we have

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.360 
its reducers Inoki exchange as we have
said<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.230> if<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.590> compare<00:04:19.980> different<00:04:20.010> to

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
said that if you compare different to

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.660 
said that if you compare different to
the<00:04:20.489> Lumia<00:04:20.790> low-end<00:04:21.420> range<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.620> usually<00:04:23.400> I

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
the Lumia low-end range so it usually I

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.810 
the Lumia low-end range so it usually I
mean<00:04:24.540> that's<00:04:25.200> my<00:04:25.380> opinion<00:04:25.740> because<00:04:26.100> if<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.700> go

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
mean that's my opinion because if you go

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.910 
mean that's my opinion because if you go
through<00:04:27.030> this<00:04:27.150> vixen<00:04:27.540> check<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.080> usually

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
through this vixen check it so usually

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.270 
through this vixen check it so usually
it<00:04:29.190> gives<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.850> very<00:04:30.000> good<00:04:30.420> fight<00:04:31.140> or<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:31.920> I

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
it gives a very good fight or really I

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.820 
it gives a very good fight or really I
mean<00:04:32.790> it<00:04:32.940> in<00:04:33.330> some<00:04:33.540> way<00:04:33.720> is<00:04:34.170> when<00:04:34.440> better<00:04:34.620> than

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
mean it in some way is when better than

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.670 
mean it in some way is when better than
Lumia<00:04:35.100> 630<00:04:35.520> which<00:04:36.480> is<00:04:36.600> obviously<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.260> a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
Lumia 630 which is obviously a a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.430 
Lumia 630 which is obviously a a
higher-end<00:04:38.630> device<00:04:39.630> if<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.900> talk<00:04:40.050> about<00:04:40.170> the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
higher-end device if you talk about the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.409 
higher-end device if you talk about the
you<00:04:40.530> know<00:04:40.560> range<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.190> hierarchy<00:04:41.669> or<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
you know range of hierarchy or the

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.450 
you know range of hierarchy or the
product<00:04:42.690> hierarchy<00:04:42.890> etcetera<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:47.190> not

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
product hierarchy etcetera so so not

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.210 
product hierarchy etcetera so so not
only<00:04:47.610> now<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.300> can<00:04:48.480> see<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.980> design<00:04:49.980> in<00:04:50.130> a

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
only now you can see the design in a

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.680 
only now you can see the design in a
better<00:04:50.430> way<00:04:50.669> so<00:04:51.890> not<00:04:52.890> only<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.220> design<00:04:53.430> but

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
better way so not only the design but

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.900 
better way so not only the design but
even<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:55.770> know<00:04:55.919> different<00:04:56.430> things<00:04:56.669> like
