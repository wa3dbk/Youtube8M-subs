the dial button that's always bothered

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:27.199 
the dial button that's always bothered
you<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:21.200> anyway<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.920> what<00:02:26.250> happens<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.940> that

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
you but anyway so what happens is that

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.140 
you but anyway so what happens is that
part<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.170> our<00:02:28.260> brain<00:02:28.409> is<00:02:28.650> activated<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.489> it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
part of our brain is activated and it

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.479 
part of our brain is activated and it
takes<00:02:30.360> over<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:31.739> part<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.069> our<00:02:32.159> brain<00:02:32.250> says

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
takes over that part of our brain says

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.460 
takes over that part of our brain says
you<00:02:32.640> better<00:02:32.879> not<00:02:33.299> raise<00:02:33.629> your<00:02:33.810> hand<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.140> ask<00:02:34.290> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
question because people might laugh at

you<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.750> part<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.140> your<00:02:37.200> brain<00:02:37.379> says<00:02:37.590> I'm

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
you that part of your brain says I'm

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.250 
and do it just like it says in the book
because<00:02:41.760> then<00:02:42.150> no<00:02:42.360> one<00:02:42.510> will<00:02:42.659> be<00:02:42.780> able<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.049> tell

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
because then no one will be able to tell

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.559 
because then no one will be able to tell
me<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.409> left<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.980> part<00:02:44.280> out<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:45.150> part<00:02:45.450> of

and sabotage the work and we sabotage
the<00:03:41.819> work<00:03:42.000> because<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.660> safer<00:03:43.169> to<00:03:43.379> fail

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
small it's safer to say if I could just

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.390 
small it's safer to say if I could just
get<00:03:47.340> funded<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.419> I'd<00:03:48.629> succeed<00:03:49.260> than<00:03:50.129> it<00:03:50.280> is
