00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:11.330
 the sun 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.330
 hey, the sun goes to hell 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.900
 Hi, how are you? This is Murilo. 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.580
 As you already noticed, I decided to change the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.470
 Camera angle I think it stays here 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.199
 better to stay a little more dynamic than 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.970
 than sitting there in the restricted space 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.279
 I can move a little more I can 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.250
 do some interesting things 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.980
 I can speak here , here or here one 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.829
 problem that only today takes care of everything 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.980
 This is where I feel in the middle of the field. 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.530
 talking in the sun heat and curse I know 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 that is in the summer is not masking because it has 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.770
 that make so much sun so much heat here in 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.690
 curitiba 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.820
 the problem is not so much heat the problem 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 is that in the morning I feel in Africa and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.379
 25th night on the flake is unbelievable 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.230
 you wake up in the morning, in the cold, you wear 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.210
 a blouse will work after two 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.909
 You 're dying of heat because you 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.580
 rose to a temperature of 200 degrees you 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.830
 the sweater is sweating a little 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.280
 and at night the cold starts to rain again 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.380
 made work end the world not this week 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.140
 still to help me in the work of 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.650
 place of three blocks from here that arrived 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.180
 in two minutes to 300 blocks 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.610
 now that one has changed to almost another 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.829
 city I have to there is the last bus 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.320
 problem is bus plus the heat 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.570
 damn it takes longer than 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.400
 if it speaks, at least the heat is less 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.590
 worse than it was raining two 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.439
 weeks is raining every 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.600
 days and the capacity of the rain is incredible 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.270
 to happen at the worst possible moment 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.700
 it was always the time that it was coming out of the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.950
 I'm going to college at six. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:02:01.290
 My afternoon sky god deluge down 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:07.380
 what happens as broken umbrella 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:13.110
 Remember now you need a guard. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.730
 Rain I'm not cutting my hair people 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.950
 It makes a couple of months and I do not agree 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.180
 Way this crap is, man, I 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 I'm too lazy to cut hair 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.650
 it's here on the side 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.870
 I left where I live, I give three 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.390
 steps and it's incredible to have a lot of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.040
 track of doing it otherwise and the worst is that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.500
 my hair hates me the problem is that 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.540
 market is not smooth is not curly of 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.120
 more expensive, anything, anything 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.000
 in my hair, anything in the hair 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.160
 and the broom is the same thing 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.870
 practically a space my hair but it is 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.709
 sad because I got tired of people me 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.600
 confused with an ex-convict 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.950
 Good guess I 'll stay around here I have 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.680
 to fix this crap all over here and 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.140
 I still cut my hair and I know how to kill 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.030
 that sun where maybe good if you liked 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.800
 of the video do not forget they are no longer 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.690
 why this helps a lot 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.060
 channel grows and if you want to 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.750
 look at another video was the pilot is well 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.570
 short 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.230
 But I think you'll like it and it's worth it. 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.230
 to the next 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.720
