00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 welcome to sugar with love i am with 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.080
 chin and today I'm going to teach you how to prepare 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.649
 some whole grain crackers with oats and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.649
 Pumpkin seeds 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.650
 these wholemeal crackers are the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 cookies that I usually prepare when 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.520
 I come from training to recover strength 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.020
 more quickly the ingredients that 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.349
 we will need to prepare the 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.840
 cookies are the following 225 grams 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.840
 of whole wheat flour 100 grams 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.690
 of unsalted butter 125 grams of 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.110
 Brown sugar 50 grams of flakes 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.690
 oat a large egg and 30 grams of 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.550
 pumpkin nuggets like this recipe is 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.500
 very quick to prepare we will use 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.030
 our hand blender 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.239
 we started putting the butter in the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.239
 bowl 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.140
 now we add 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.140
 brown sugar 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 we add the egg 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.720
 we check first that it is in good 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.720
 state 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.049
 if we keep beating 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.530
 now we add the flour 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.000
 we will integrate the speed more slowly 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.430
 we already have it, let's stop it 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.320
 the three ingredients we will introduce 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.620
 with manually we remove the mass from the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.620
 rods 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.020
 we will introduce into the mass the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.610
 flakes and pumpkin seeds 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.610
 we started with the flakes 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.819
 with the help of the spatula we integrate 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.819
 all right 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.430
 and finally we add the nuggets of 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.430
 pumpkin 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.170
 we put the vegetal paper on the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.360
 baking sheet and let's start 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.290
 form the cookies the oven I have it 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.360
 preheated to 180 degrees lame 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.260
 a ball of dough in shape more or less 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.500
 the size of a walnut 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.500
 and I'm putting it in the tray 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.350
 when we have all the balls in the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.240
 the tray 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.750
 we give them the round shape of the 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.490
 cookie we fill with fingers 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.420
 it does not matter if an aspect like that remains 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.420
 according 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.240
 and now we take the oven 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.660
 bake we have at 180 degrees for 12 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.660
 minutes 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.190
 we let them cool on the grid with 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.730
 this recipe will approximately give you 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.630
 for about 20 22 24 cookies according to 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.630
