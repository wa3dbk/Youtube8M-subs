absolutely tilt oops the tilt is shorter
than<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> Azula<00:01:16.350> yet<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.490> much<00:01:17.759> larger<00:01:18.060> in

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
than the Azula yet it's much larger in

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.480 
than the Azula yet it's much larger in
the<00:01:18.600> open<00:01:18.869> position<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.680> obviously<00:01:20.130> it

only like 30 bucks you're getting a hand
ground<00:01:49.110> blade<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.750> that'll<00:01:52.049> cut<00:01:52.259> really

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
ground blade you know that'll cut really

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.950 
ground blade you know that'll cut really
well<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> carbon<00:01:53.220> steel<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:54.630> other<00:01:54.750> thing

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
well out of carbon steel the other thing

well out of carbon steel the other thing
with<00:01:55.079> fixed<00:01:55.320> blades<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> compared<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> folders

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
with fixed blades is compared to folders

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.609 
with fixed blades is compared to folders
most<00:01:57.149> folders<00:01:57.630> don't<00:01:57.930> come<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.259> carbon<00:01:58.590> steel

most folders don't come in carbon steel
I<00:01:59.100> mean<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.149> some<00:02:00.450> traditional<00:02:00.899> knives

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
I mean there are some traditional knives

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.590 
I mean there are some traditional knives

bulk<00:02:46.829> factor<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.370> their<00:02:47.579> price<00:02:48.510> they're<00:02:48.750> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
bulk factor is their price they're I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.649 
bulk factor is their price they're I
mean<00:02:48.900> they're<00:02:49.139> cheap<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.620> mean<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.359> could

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.949 
carry a fixed blade with no worry of the
law<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.799> probably<00:02:56.040> would<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.840> for<00:02:57.840> me

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959
