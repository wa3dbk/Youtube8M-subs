00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.279
 dear asus friends my name serious and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.400
 this is a little win for 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.400
 you 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.750
 and that it is time the asus for 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.250
 chest gaming headset to win 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.039
 That's a three and a half millimeter 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 Latch headset where you choose 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.150
 could also take off the microphone and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 the whole example on the smartphone 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.670
 joins in a bit 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.199
 the area to traipse with yours 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.210
 girlfriend talking on the phone listening to music 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.309
 or what I do not still know everything 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 and what do you have to do about it 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.320
 I would have to find a servus headset 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.820
 like three hashtags of you know 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.680
 not what a hashtag is what is going on 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.809
 with you so we want that once 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.969
 I would like to have hashtag asus 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.129
 the hashtag sirius and then that 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.050
 hashtag give away and if you have the three 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.520
 hashtags then you are 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.780
 pretty much on the safe side 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.850
 otherwise you can also like 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.969
 we want to win the good part 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.020
 I want and then the whole thing goes around me 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.520
 we would say let's do it the whole way 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.660
 about 14 days running in the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.640
 In the meantime I will be the good piece 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.589
 unpack for you and then in 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.060
 present an unboxing video with it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.189
 you also see a little better what it is 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.150
 Video was not too short for you 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.189
