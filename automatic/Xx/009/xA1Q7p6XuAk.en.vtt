00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the firmware and then there's some that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.560 
the firmware and then there's some that
are<00:00:58.219> looking<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.399> they're<00:00:59.430> maybe<00:00:59.910> corruptor

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
are looking like they're maybe corruptor

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
are looking like they're maybe corruptor
kinda<00:01:00.930> showing<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.500> screen<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:01.980> not

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
doing anything else so it's that it's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.899 
doing anything else so it's that it's
kind<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> interesting<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.760> many

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
kind of interesting if you get so many

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.390 
kind of interesting if you get so many
different<00:01:06.119> types<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.780> these<00:01:07.369> flash<00:01:08.369> cards

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
different types of these flash cards

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.060 
different types of these flash cards
here<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.909> gold<00:01:11.909> colored<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:13.070> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
here so like a gold colored one here and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
here so like a gold colored one here and
you<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:14.549> some<00:01:15.830> official<00:01:16.830> ones<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.450> think<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you get some official ones I think that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.770 
you get some official ones I think that
are<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> original<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.479> Nintendo<00:01:21.479> DSi

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
are for was the original a Nintendo DSi

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.190 
are for was the original a Nintendo DSi
a<00:01:22.049> shot<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:23.400> people<00:01:24.390> started<00:01:24.900> cloning

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
a shot and then people started cloning

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840 
a shot and then people started cloning
them<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.860> people<00:01:26.130> started<00:01:26.490> making

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
them and then people started making

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
them and then people started making
clones<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.299> clones<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.900> yeah<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.799> really

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
clones of clones and yeah I get really

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.880 
clones of clones and yeah I get really
confusing<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.259> an<00:01:31.439> official

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
confusing so I think this is an official

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649 
confusing so I think this is an official
one<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.700> quite<00:01:33.000> difficult<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.420> tell

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
one here it's quite difficult to tell

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.280 
one here it's quite difficult to tell
but<00:01:34.820> it's<00:01:35.820> got<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> collector<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> back<00:01:37.020> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
but it's got a collector in the back and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.920 
but it's got a collector in the back and
the<00:01:38.040> official<00:01:38.490> ones<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.329> bump<00:01:39.720> in

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the official ones don't have a a bump in

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.399 
the official ones don't have a a bump in
the<00:01:39.990> middle<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.369> make<00:01:41.610> these<00:01:41.850> ones<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the middle and make these ones which and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.630 
the middle and make these ones which and
oh<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.799> make<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> I've<00:01:44.250> there's<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
oh if you can make that I've there's a

oh if you can make that I've there's a
chemical<00:01:44.939> raised<00:01:45.570> section<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> middle

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
chemical raised section in the middle

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.719 
chemical raised section in the middle
and<00:01:47.390> that's<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.810> there's<00:01:49.170> an<00:01:49.549> one<00:01:50.549> here

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.649 
to show yeah that's because there's a
memory<00:01:54.750> chip<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.229> flash<00:01:56.070> chip<00:01:56.340> whatever<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.509> in

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
memory chip a flash chip whatever but in

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
memory chip a flash chip whatever but in
the<00:01:57.840> label<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.560> which<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.100> official<00:01:59.700> ones

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the label there which the official ones

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.539 
the label there which the official ones
don't<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.600> yeah<00:02:01.560> tons<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.250> tons<00:02:02.280> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
don't have but yeah tons and tons of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.169 
don't have but yeah tons and tons of
different<00:02:02.640> types<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.740> come<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:06.530> T<00:02:07.530> TDs<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
different types here come on T TDs and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.149 
different types here come on T TDs and
the<00:02:09.750> STT<00:02:10.519> rat<00:02:11.519> sculled<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.150> got<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.689> flat<00:02:13.159> our

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
the STT rat sculled and got a flat our

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.190 
the STT rat sculled and got a flat our
four<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.579> think<00:02:14.879> that's<00:02:15.030> another<00:02:15.269> official<00:02:15.840> one

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
four I think that's another official one

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.289 
four I think that's another official one
doesn't<00:02:16.739> have<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.860> raised<00:02:18.079> section<00:02:19.079> on<00:02:19.409> it

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
doesn't have the raised section on it

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.589 
doesn't have the raised section on it
yeah

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
yeah

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.509 
yeah
just<00:02:22.409> went<00:02:22.590> through<00:02:22.709> all<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> these<00:02:23.129> one<00:02:23.340> by

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
just went through all of these one by

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.849 
just went through all of these one by
one<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.909> I<00:02:24.540> have<00:02:24.720> managed<00:02:25.079> to<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.530> few<00:02:25.799> of

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
one and I have managed to get a few of

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.530 
one and I have managed to get a few of
them<00:02:26.040> working<00:02:26.370> against<00:02:26.609> a<00:02:26.760> little<00:02:26.909> pile<00:02:27.329> over

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
them working against a little pile over

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.920 
them working against a little pile over
here

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
here

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.339 
here
so<00:02:28.079> so<00:02:28.500> far<00:02:28.739> ago<00:02:29.159> I<00:02:29.400> mean<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.849> live<00:02:30.359> sex

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
so so far ago I mean it was a live sex

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.289 
so so far ago I mean it was a live sex
of<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.590> marking<00:02:31.980> which<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.579> that<00:02:32.790> pretty<00:02:32.970> good

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
of the marking which is that pretty good

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.099 
of the marking which is that pretty good
I've<00:02:34.140> got<00:02:34.290> two<00:02:34.439> of<00:02:34.560> these<00:02:34.709> unofficial<00:02:35.489> ones

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
I've got two of these unofficial ones

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:41.509 
I've got two of these unofficial ones
running<00:02:37.109> again<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.409> of<00:02:40.530> these<00:02:40.859> which

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
running again and and one of these which

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.430 
running again and and one of these which
is<00:02:41.670> again<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.420> think<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.629> is<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> special<00:02:43.319> one

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
is again I think this is a special one

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.990 
is again I think this is a special one
it<00:02:43.829> seems<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.159> work<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.549> official

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
it seems to work with the official

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.800 
it seems to work with the official
firmware<00:02:45.750> side<00:02:46.560> Wi-Fi<00:02:47.250> are<00:02:47.579> four<00:02:47.970> it's

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
firmware side Wi-Fi are four it's

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.629 
firmware side Wi-Fi are four it's
apparently<00:02:49.260> watched<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:50.040> much<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
apparently watched it's much of the

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.910 
apparently watched it's much of the
versions<00:02:51.359> des<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.379> I<00:02:52.440> thought<00:02:52.590> you'd<00:02:52.769> really

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
versions des and I thought you'd really

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.740 
versions des and I thought you'd really
early<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:54.329> official<00:02:55.319> r4<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.099> here<00:02:56.340> as<00:02:56.489> well

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
early and official r4 is here as well

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.670 
early and official r4 is here as well
sort<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.840> Italy<00:02:58.200> thing<00:02:58.409> goes<00:02:58.560> okay<00:02:59.250> doc<00:03:00.680> yeah

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
sort of Italy thing goes okay doc yeah

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.440 
sort of Italy thing goes okay doc yeah
so<00:03:02.370> put<00:03:02.489> three<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.760> these<00:03:02.939> running<00:03:03.209> as<00:03:03.420> well

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
so put three of these running as well

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.899 
so put three of these running as well
and<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.650> basically<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.489> case<00:03:05.639> of

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
and it was just basically a case of

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.789 
and it was just basically a case of
cleaning<00:03:06.239> them<00:03:06.359> up<00:03:06.450> unsigned<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.349> right

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
cleaning them up unsigned in the right

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.069 
cleaning them up unsigned in the right
farm<00:03:08.099> where<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:09.000> put<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.299> these<00:03:09.389> to<00:03:09.540> get<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.930> run

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
farm where to put on these to get to run

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.800 
farm where to put on these to get to run
so<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:11.459> problem<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:11.909> of<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.269> many<00:03:12.389> different

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
so the problem is of so many different

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.550 
so the problem is of so many different
versions<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:14.459> these<00:03:14.819> flashcards<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:16.319> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
versions and of these flashcards that I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.619 
versions and of these flashcards that I
mean<00:03:17.430> there's<00:03:17.579> like<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.030> official<00:03:18.449> ones

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
mean there's like the official ones

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.140 
mean there's like the official ones
which<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.280> clones<00:03:20.280> there's<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.790> clients

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
which is the clones there's the clients

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.270 
which is the clones there's the clients
of<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> clones<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:22.980> gets<00:03:23.160> really

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
of the clones and it just gets really

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.309 
of the clones and it just gets really
confusing<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:24.000> find<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.419> correct<00:03:25.109> firmware

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
confusing to find that correct firmware

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.759 
confusing to find that correct firmware
that<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.709> need<00:03:25.859> for<00:03:26.069> them<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:26.870> yeah<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.199> think

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
that you need for them but yeah I think

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.379 
that you need for them but yeah I think
some<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.220> these<00:03:29.370> probably<00:03:29.790> just<00:03:30.000> need<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.269> get

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
some of these probably just need to get

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.229 
some of these probably just need to get
the<00:03:30.569> correct<00:03:31.139> firmware<00:03:31.349> but<00:03:31.709> it's<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.889> case<00:03:32.099> of

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
the correct firmware but it's a case of

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.089 
the correct firmware but it's a case of
finding<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.359> quite<00:03:33.569> light<00:03:34.139> as<00:03:34.349> in<00:03:34.530> trial<00:03:34.919> and

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
finding it quite light as in trial and

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.390 
finding it quite light as in trial and
error

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
error

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.610 
error
another<00:03:35.940> cool<00:03:36.419> thing<00:03:36.449> was<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.199> one<00:03:37.409> of<00:03:37.440> these

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
another cool thing was that one of these

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.719 
another cool thing was that one of these
cards<00:03:37.919> actually<00:03:38.310> came<00:03:38.549> with<00:03:38.729> a<00:03:38.760> local<00:03:39.150> M<00:03:40.729> call

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
cards actually came with a local M call

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.009 
cards actually came with a local M call
this<00:03:41.849> everyone<00:03:42.299> home<00:03:42.540> here

I<00:03:44.180> had<00:03:45.180> just<00:03:45.629> dropped<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.949> over<00:03:47.250> one<00:03:47.849> of<00:03:48.000> them

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
I had just dropped in over one of them

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.479 
I had just dropped in over one of them
actually<00:03:48.209> came<00:03:48.599> with<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.900> coil<00:03:49.139> this<00:03:50.129> with<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
actually came with a coil this with the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.619 
actually came with a coil this with the
focus<00:03:51.530> for<00:03:52.530> gigabyte<00:03:53.010> flash<00:03:53.220> cards<00:03:53.729> so<00:03:53.940> our<00:03:54.180> SD

of<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.560> clones<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.370> all<00:05:23.580> sorts<00:05:24.030> but<00:05:24.270> I'm

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
of the clones and and all sorts but I'm

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.150 
of the clones and and all sorts but I'm
not<00:05:25.289> too<00:05:25.440> sure<00:05:25.470> what<00:05:25.650> I'm<00:05:25.800> going<00:05:25.919> to<00:05:25.950> do<00:05:26.039> with
