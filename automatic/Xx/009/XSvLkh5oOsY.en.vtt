transplants right into the compost after

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520 
transplants right into the compost after
doing<00:01:18.510> it<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.869> number<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> years<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
doing it for a number of years that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.850 
doing it for a number of years that
we've<00:01:19.799> seen<00:01:20.070> less<00:01:20.580> weed<00:01:20.850> pressure<00:01:21.140> we<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
we've seen less weed pressure we have a

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.770 
we've seen less weed pressure we have a
lot<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.400> free<00:01:23.610> time<00:01:23.640> during<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.299> summer<00:01:24.479> we

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
lot more free time during the summer we

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.149 
lot more free time during the summer we
end<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.110> spending<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> our<00:01:25.950> time

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
end up spending more of our time

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.300 
end up spending more of our time
actually<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:27.119> harvesting<00:01:27.689> than<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.110> do

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
actually just harvesting than we do

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
actually just harvesting than we do
trying<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> deal<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.939> weeds<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:31.590> lot<00:01:31.830> more

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
trying to deal with weeds and a lot more

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.580 
trying to deal with weeds and a lot more
relaxed<00:01:32.549> environment<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> first<00:01:34.170> section<00:01:34.470> of

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
relaxed environment the first section of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.230 
relaxed environment the first section of
the<00:01:34.650> garden<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.100> converted<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.700> raised<00:01:35.939> beds

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the garden we converted to raised beds

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.030 
the garden we converted to raised beds
we<00:01:36.509> did<00:01:36.689> sort<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> backyard<00:01:37.470> garden<00:01:37.950> way

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
we did sort of the backyard garden way

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.410 
we did sort of the backyard garden way
using<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> shovel

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
using a shovel

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.510 
using a shovel
after<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.650> figured<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> way<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> use<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
after that we figured a way to use a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
after that we figured a way to use a
tractor<00:01:42.240> mounted<00:01:42.720> adjustable<00:01:43.350> back<00:01:43.619> blade

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
tractor mounted adjustable back blade

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.819 
tractor mounted adjustable back blade
that<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.299> able<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.780> convert<00:01:46.290> large

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
that then was able to convert large

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
that then was able to convert large
parts<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> garden<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.570> know<00:01:48.659> acres<00:01:49.110> at

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
parts of the garden on you know acres at

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.770 
parts of the garden on you know acres at
a<00:01:49.290> time<00:01:49.590> into<00:01:50.189> raised<00:01:50.400> beds<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.570> has

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a time into raised beds and that has

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
a time into raised beds and that has
allowed<00:01:52.049> us<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.320> convert<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> four

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
allowed us to convert you know a four

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.719 
allowed us to convert you know a four
acre<00:01:53.700> garden<00:01:54.180> into<00:01:54.390> permanent<00:01:54.899> raised<00:01:55.259> beds

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
acre garden into permanent raised beds

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.460 
acre garden into permanent raised beds
coming<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.060> conventional<00:01:57.780> background<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
coming from a conventional background I

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.679 
coming from a conventional background I
had<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> hard<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.189> adjusting<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> idea

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
had a hard time adjusting to the idea

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.870 
had a hard time adjusting to the idea
that<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.290> don't<00:02:01.560> need<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> tilt<00:02:02.250> every<00:02:02.610> year

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that we don't need to tilt every year

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.910 
that we don't need to tilt every year
but<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.689> long<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> don't<00:02:04.380> walk<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
but as long as you don't walk on the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.709 
but as long as you don't walk on the
soil<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.520> don't<00:02:05.700> drive<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> tractor<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.600> the

horse manure that I bring in from
another<00:03:25.489> farm<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.120> cow<00:03:26.629> manure<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:27.079> just<00:03:27.290> a

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
another farm the cow manure is just a

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.280 
another farm the cow manure is just a
little<00:03:27.620> too<00:03:27.829> heavy<00:03:28.069> a<00:03:28.159> little<00:03:28.310> too<00:03:28.609> wet<00:03:28.819> to<00:03:29.479> get

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
little too heavy a little too wet to get

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.920 
little too heavy a little too wet to get
generating<00:03:30.889> any<00:03:31.010> heat<00:03:31.099> so<00:03:31.939> the<00:03:32.180> mixing<00:03:32.780> it

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
generating any heat so the mixing it

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.800 
generating any heat so the mixing it
with<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.280> horse<00:03:34.280> manure<00:03:34.639> will<00:03:34.849> give<00:03:35.449> us<00:03:35.599> that

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
with the horse manure will give us that

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.020 
with the horse manure will give us that
heat<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.049> we're<00:03:36.379> looking<00:03:36.680> for<00:03:36.949> this<00:03:37.849> is<00:03:38.000> a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
heat that we're looking for this is a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.809

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
pile I made a couple of weeks ago we can

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.490 
pile I made a couple of weeks ago we can
just<00:03:41.030> put<00:03:41.180> this<00:03:41.299> thermometer<00:03:41.659> right<00:03:42.109> on<00:03:42.290> in

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
just put this thermometer right on in

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.069 
just put this thermometer right on in
here<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.889> check<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.370> temperature<00:03:44.079> something

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
here and check the temperature something

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.110 
here and check the temperature something
I<00:03:45.229> do<00:03:45.290> every<00:03:45.409> day<00:03:45.859> just<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.489> monitor<00:03:46.939> the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
I do every day just to monitor the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.379 
I do every day just to monitor the
temperature<00:03:47.829> after<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:49.250> manure<00:03:50.090> has<00:03:50.239> been
