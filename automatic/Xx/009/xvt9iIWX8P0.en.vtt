00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.690
 if nothing 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.590
 hello how about youtube friends x friends 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 digital a dvd for you and this time 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.500
 is the second chapter of this series that 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.740
 it's called a design for your house and I 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.330
 slow to make this video as it does not 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.660
 I have a lot of time in my week and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.669
 as you already know when editing a video to 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.080
 rendering it or uploading it takes a lot 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.129
 but here I bring the second 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.829
 chapter and this time it's a house design 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.510
 modern so I would say to them where 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.140
 we can see that the outer structure 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.899
 It is 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.600
 of iron blocks that looks great 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.960
 in a house like this and the truth 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.800
 for me I like light colors in 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.290
 a modern and good box here out of 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.820
 the door 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.820
 we have two ponds that are very 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.410
 well lit and we also have these 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.890
 small bushes that look great 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.920
 out here and here we have also a 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.840
 small brick walkway 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.600
 inferior the first thing that I love you 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.570
 show when you enter this house is the flat 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.869
 since it is made of bricks of the world 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.690
 lower luminous stone and above the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.140
 crystal and the truth is very well to me 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.479
 I really liked how it was and the illuminated 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 very well what is this part of the house 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.860
 which is the first floor 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.710
 with here we have a small room 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.250
 that looks great is very father together 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.659
 to a fireplace that I also liked and 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.569
 our record player 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.420
 then we also have a small ones 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.929
 small shelves where we have 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.079
 our enchantment tables and here 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.939
 there are some small chairs to sit 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.860
 to read one of the books that we have 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.780
 here 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.960
 and that's a very fatherly detail the truth 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.440
 to me what I like most of the houses 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.250
 are the details and well here is a 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.740
 a small table a dining room where the tables 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.680
 the chairs are made with fences 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.090
 wood and the table is made with pistons 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.910
 normal 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.459
 then here we have a small bar in 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.120
 where we have these chairs for 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.810
 sit down to drink something with our 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.879
 bartender who is practicing parkour and the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.950
 a villager there is very good 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.769
 how armand that is one of the teeth 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.750
 that count here we have a small 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.849
 they are still quoted I would gather a TV to see 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.230
 our favorite shows and for 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.299
 go up to what would be the second floor 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.599
 we have these brick stairs 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.090
 lower block of the lower world to 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.920
 combine with this floor 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.430
 as you come up this we go to 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.019
 find with a fourth floor of wool and 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.400
 this is one of the very details that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.280
 they look great in a house that does not 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.490
 agrees with this the roof of the first 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.310
 floor 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.310
 here we have one of one confuse her with 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.320
 one because it looks like nothing but it's ok 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.910
 it looks very good you can put your initial 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.810
 for example 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.300
 here we also have this in our 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.370
 bed together with our chest for 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.940
 save our things and a small 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.490
 Here we also have another TV 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.040
 to see here lying in the camera the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.310
 tele after here we will enter 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.580
 our little bathroom is a small bathroom 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:45.750
 where we have our toilet 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.720
 sink and a tub to relax 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.180
 after a hard day here we have the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.390
 hot water faucet and cold 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.670
 hot sorry and it's one of the details 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.380
 that also look great here 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.840
 coming out of the bathroom we found our 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.510
 Lava lamp that looks great 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.180
 very father and as you see illuminates a large part 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.130
 from this room also here we have 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.050
 a small room with our little table 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.270
 Illuminated center that looks great 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.100
 also and finally we have this 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.880
 window that goes to the part of the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.880
 terrace where I do not know why a cow 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.440
 but good here we have our pool 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.120
 and when there are more songs of the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.490
 pool we can go out to get 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.700
 these extended sizes that is also 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.650

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.570

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:39.480
 in these chairs with some tables for 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.970
 practice with friends or something 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.580
 we also have here an umbrella for 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.890
 that the sun is not so strong that it has 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.750
 been very strong these days and 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.720
 also some of the details that more 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.780
 I liked this is that when it has 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.460
 given something like this we can ask the 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.320
 bartender to get something up and upload it as 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.700
 come is a very fatherly detail and it is very 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.700
 good with any type of house 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.310
