00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
then again you know sometimes change is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980

good<00:01:25.590> new<00:01:26.250> voices<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> chance<00:01:27.720> to

hear<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.229> us<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.340> think<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
hear from us more so I think it's just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.640 
hear from us more so I think it's just
the<00:01:30.060> combination<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.930> new<00:01:31.049> voice<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.560> then

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the combination of a new voice and then

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.109 
the combination of a new voice and then
just<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.860> fact<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.220> they<00:01:32.610> got<00:01:32.790> comes<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
just the fact that they got comes to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.530 
just the fact that they got comes to

all you know can we put the planning
here

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
here

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.780 
here
when<00:03:20.190> how<00:03:20.250> much<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.610> challenge<00:03:20.819> this<00:03:22.790> pretty

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
when how much of a challenge this pretty

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.420 
when how much of a challenge this pretty
stone<00:03:24.060> from<00:03:24.660> oh<00:03:25.160> it's<00:03:26.160> going<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> be<00:03:26.400> a

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
stone from oh it's going to be a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.100 
stone from oh it's going to be a
challenge<00:03:26.879> but<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.120> great<00:03:27.300> thing<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.569> they

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
challenge but the great thing is they

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.809 
challenge but the great thing is they
get<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.349> practice<00:03:28.709> against<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.489> know<00:03:29.550> part<00:03:29.790> of

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
get to practice against you know part of

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.130 
get to practice against you know part of
the<00:03:29.910> best<00:03:30.090> friend<00:03:30.360> in<00:03:30.480> all<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:31.019> college

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the best friend in all of college

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.330 
the best friend in all of college
football<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:32.099> that<00:03:32.580> they<00:03:33.060> won't<00:03:33.239> see<00:03:33.510> a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
football so that they won't see a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.680 
football so that they won't see a
different<00:03:35.340> speed<00:03:35.580> now<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.090> scheme<00:03:36.420> will<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.660> a

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
different speed now the scheme will be a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.449 
different speed now the scheme will be a
little<00:03:36.900> bit<00:03:37.019> different<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.799> obviously<00:03:38.190> we<00:03:38.340> got

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
little bit different so obviously we got

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.130 
little bit different so obviously we got
to<00:03:38.580> continue<00:03:38.879> to<00:03:38.910> work<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:39.599> in<00:03:39.720> terms<00:03:39.959> of

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
to continue to work that but in terms of

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.320 
to continue to work that but in terms of
the<00:03:40.290> types<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.890> players<00:03:41.069> this<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.310> Oklahoma<00:03:41.610> so

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
the types of players this is Oklahoma so

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.280 
the types of players this is Oklahoma so
it's<00:03:42.450> going<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.599> be<00:03:42.660> very<00:03:42.720> similar<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.200> what

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
it's going to be very similar to what

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.809 
it's going to be very similar to what
this<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.680> other<00:03:43.799> day<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.220> practice<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:47.640> and

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
this the other day in practice you and

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.150 
this the other day in practice you and
Jeff<00:03:48.000> sharing<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.540> role<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:49.160> those

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
Jeff sharing the role of those

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.500 
Jeff sharing the role of those
responsibilities<00:03:50.880> how<00:03:50.940> they<00:03:51.090> break<00:03:51.269> down<00:03:51.299> or

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
responsibilities how they break down or

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.729 
responsibilities how they break down or
what's<00:03:51.720> been<00:03:51.930> your<00:03:51.959> chemistry<00:03:52.410> like<00:03:52.620> the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
what's been your chemistry like the

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.589 
what's been your chemistry like the
first<00:03:52.950> few<00:03:53.040> days<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.430> practice<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.360> been

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
first few days in practice it's been

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.479 
first few days in practice it's been
great<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.049> know<00:03:55.079> we<00:03:55.349> put<00:03:55.799> together<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:56.130> plan<00:03:56.340> of

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
great you know we put together a plan of

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.039 
great you know we put together a plan of
how<00:03:56.519> we<00:03:56.640> want<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.030> actually<00:03:57.150> implement<00:03:57.750> in

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
how we want to actually implement in

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.930 
how we want to actually implement in
practice<00:03:58.079> but<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:58.950> terms<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.310> off<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.640> up<00:03:59.790> the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
practice but in terms of off to up the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.220 
practice but in terms of off to up the
field<00:04:00.120> has<00:04:00.239> been<00:04:00.269> very<00:04:00.569> similar<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.079> we

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
field has been very similar to what we

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.960 
field has been very similar to what we
did<00:04:01.260> no<00:04:02.010> because<00:04:02.160> Mars<00:04:02.519> was<00:04:02.670> here<00:04:02.819> because

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
did no because Mars was here because

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.030 
did no because Mars was here because
again<00:04:03.329> as<00:04:03.510> as<00:04:03.690> we<00:04:04.260> got<00:04:04.620> through<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:04.799> first

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
again as as we got through that first

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.289 
again as as we got through that first
year<00:04:05.250> we<00:04:05.370> started<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.819> give<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.090> up<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
year we started to give you up the

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.119 
year we started to give you up the
responsibility<00:04:06.650> again<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:07.769> didn't<00:04:07.920> want<00:04:08.069> to

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
responsibility again we didn't want to

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.830 
responsibility again we didn't want to
go<00:04:08.220> back<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.640> change<00:04:08.760> everything<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.720> know

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
go back and change everything you know

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.140

we got the foundation of the program

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.860 
we got the foundation of the program
where<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:00.790> needs<00:05:00.940> to<00:05:01.030> be<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.390> take<00:05:01.510> that<00:05:01.690> next

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
where it needs to be to take that next

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.330 
where it needs to be to take that next
step<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.440> got<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.650> go<00:05:02.740> out<00:05:02.890> and<00:05:03.010> win<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.160> game

step you got to go out and win a game

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.520 
step you got to go out and win a game
like<00:05:03.550> this<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.090> like<00:05:04.240> i<00:05:04.450> said<00:05:04.510> before<00:05:04.750> before

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
like this and like i said before before

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.310 
like this and like i said before before
Cole<00:05:06.010> stepped<00:05:06.280> in<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.720> when<00:05:07.720> DeSean<00:05:07.840> was<00:05:08.170> hurt

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
Cole stepped in and when DeSean was hurt

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.050 
Cole stepped in and when DeSean was hurt
and<00:05:08.590> he<00:05:08.740> won<00:05:08.950> football<00:05:09.160> games<00:05:09.580> for<00:05:09.790> us<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:09.970> he

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
and he won football games for us so he

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.700 
and he won football games for us so he
knows<00:05:10.210> how<00:05:10.390> to<00:05:10.450> win<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:11.140> biggest<00:05:11.260> thing<00:05:11.590> is

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
knows how to win the biggest thing is

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.050 
knows how to win the biggest thing is
just<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:12.040> know<00:05:12.130> building<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.580> confidence

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
just you know building that confidence

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.670 
just you know building that confidence
back<00:05:13.210> up<00:05:13.240> but<00:05:13.540> I<00:05:13.600> think<00:05:13.840> with<00:05:14.290> him<00:05:14.470> knowing

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
back up but I think with him knowing

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.200 
back up but I think with him knowing
that<00:05:14.830> this<00:05:15.040> is<00:05:15.100> this<00:05:15.370> show<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:15.970> know<00:05:16.060> he's

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
that this is this show you know he's

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.820 
that this is this show you know he's
taken<00:05:16.510> ownership<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:17.080> then<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:17.320> guys<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.710> can

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
taken ownership and then the guys I can

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.200 
taken ownership and then the guys I can
see<00:05:17.920> that<00:05:18.040> that<00:05:18.100> new<00:05:18.400> energy<00:05:18.820> that

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
see that that new energy that

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.180 
see that that new energy that
rejuvenation<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.170> guys<00:05:20.350> are<00:05:20.620> falling<00:05:20.890> around

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
rejuvenation the guys are falling around

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.310 
rejuvenation the guys are falling around
and<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:22.030> I<00:05:22.450> think<00:05:22.690> that's<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.140> combination

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
and so I think that's the combination

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.200 
and so I think that's the combination
that's<00:05:23.770> going<00:05:23.980> to<00:05:24.070> propel<00:05:24.580> him<00:05:24.730> forward<00:05:24.760> to<00:05:25.090> go

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
that's going to propel him forward to go

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.640 
that's going to propel him forward to go
out<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.390> play<00:05:25.450> with<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:26.050> way<00:05:26.200> their<00:05:26.410> front

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
out and play with the way their front

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.860 
out and play with the way their front
seven
