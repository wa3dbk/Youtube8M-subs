 This subtitle is provided by the PLoT subtitle group 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.020
 Crystal Empire reappears 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.350
 Crystal Empire? 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.120
 The crystal empire is not an empire in the true sense 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.360
 Attention, Celastia 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.490
 You should read it before signing it. 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.430
 blue eyes 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.560
 Yellow eyes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.630
 It reappears 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.040
 a horse with "it" in the absence of context 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.140
 How many times will you be curious? 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.670
 Celastia, it reappears 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.740
 Crystal Empire? 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410
 No, it is the smell that floats out of the toilet. 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.270
 theme song 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.940
 I am imitating a pigeon 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.540
 - Fan of the vibrato - book 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.840
 Just like Enterplay 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.150
 These cards are not enough 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.550
 Almost no pony remembers its existence 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.450
 Even the screenwriter doesn’t know 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.320
 Bondage 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.050
 You know, this is for kids! 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.420
 And was exiled to the ice of the northern polar 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.860
 Also called 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 Canada 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.930
 But it has already cursed the entire empire 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.860
 There is no curse at all. 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.680
 Serrasia casts black magic 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.500
 Just for a 10-second, meaningless drama performance 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.770
 Instead of preparing for her upcoming trip 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.440
 I am more willing to sing how unprepared I am. 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 The square root of 546 is 23.36666666... ​​(23.36664289109585) 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.240
 Too coincident 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.810
 This is your nightmare tonight. 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.480
 We are going to the Crystal Empire soon. 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.820
 This episode is sponsored by the MLP Crystal Empire Suite. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.660
 The worst opponent of a cartoon character is the wind. 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.890
 Rubbing the surface area of ​​their eyes 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 Lens glare 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.199
 Are they doing that? 

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:23.200
 They better do that... 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.733
 Great! 

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:24.434
 I mean- 

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:25.730
 Again this stupid song 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.438
 But my shield magic was countered by Black Crystal King. 

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:30.407
 That was less than a minute ago. 

00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:31.174
 According to everything he knows 

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.610
 Those crystals fall off with a single blow. 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.645
 Crystal Pony! 

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:39.883
 This episode is sponsored by the MLP Crystal Empire Suite. 

00:01:39.883 --> 00:01:41.017
 Post-traumatic stress disorder 

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:42.786
 You know, this is for kids! 

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:44.721
 Useless statement... 

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.325
 It must be the magic of Black Crystal King that makes their fur no longer... crystal clear? 

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:52.262
 The details of the details we are eager to know are not stated at the end. 

00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:53.430
 Correct 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.933
 This is equivalent to going to a third world country to do charity 

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:00.604
 I’ve been complaining about how much you want a hamburger. 

00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:02.839
 Pingqi's Xiaodie cosplay 

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:04.307
 Ping Qi jumps really high 

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:07.611
 Bright flags are flying 

00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:08.545
 One kind 

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:09.412
 One color 

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:12.249
 Crystal raspberry made of hard candy 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.718
 They must have a large amount of dental insurance 

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:16.586
 Kocho is the only one singing 

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:18.855
 But every pony is on her mouth. 

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:21.525
 I didn’t use her horn to let the book float in the air. 

00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:23.793
 I don’t know what to do without you. 

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:25.762
 Fortunately, you have this 

00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:29.766
 Silver Sparkle found a way to fix his horn 

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:31.268
 But only worked for one shot 

00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:33.503
 Rhythm and silver armor disappeared 

00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:35.205
 The tree was cut in half 

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:37.274
 These ponies are standing still 

00:02:37.274 --> 00:02:39.643
 At the same time these pony are sliding 

00:02:39.643 --> 00:02:43.613
 These factions are placed farthest out of the corner, so they must be floating 

00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:43.747
 One of these pony is not a crystal pony. 

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:44.114
 In fact there are two 

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:46.183
 One of these pony is not a crystal pony. 

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:47.617
 Damn tourists! 

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:49.186
 One page is gone 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.200
 Apparently, Black Crystal Wang carefully tore off this special page. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.891
 Then put the book back safely back to the bookshelf 

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:56.393
 Nothing, oh 

00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:58.528
 Ridiculous old saying 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.300
 I want to take a look at this so far. 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.433
 Almost only the big bad guys mentioned in the statement? 

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.135
 It’s a pity, maybe next time. 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.200
 Flash card! I should do some flash cards
