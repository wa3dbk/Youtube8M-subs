over the map he's got a pretty good unit
mix<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.739> wasn't<00:00:35.160> too<00:00:35.280> confident<00:00:35.700> about<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to smoke these roaches pretty easily but

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.260 
to smoke these roaches pretty easily but
all<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.440> rest<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> hydraulics<00:00:47.940> and

speedlings<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> mix<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.600> just

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
speedlings in the mix will be just

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.080 
speedlings in the mix will be just
detrimental<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> Jimmy's<00:00:53.640> chances

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
handful of otters are the flavor of this

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.709 
handful of otters are the flavor of this
is<00:00:59.879> Jimmy's<00:01:01.010> composition<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.719> always

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
finally he's getting a raven out now to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
finally he's getting a raven out now to
detect<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.210> burrowing<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> ich<00:01:07.260> is

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
detect all this burrowing that ich is

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.590 
detect all this burrowing that ich is
doing<00:01:07.830> look<00:01:08.280> at<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> burrowed<00:01:09.060> hydraulics

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
doing look at of the burrowed hydraulics

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
doing look at of the burrowed hydraulics
or<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.869> second<00:01:10.200> look<00:01:10.320> how<00:01:10.439> goofy<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.100> looks

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
or a second look how goofy that looks

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
or a second look how goofy that looks
it's<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> top<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> his<00:01:12.630> head<00:01:13.130> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
it's just like the top of his head you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.530 
it's just like the top of his head you
know<00:01:14.250> circlings<00:01:14.790> actually<00:01:15.119> look<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.270> they

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
know circlings actually look like they

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.690 
know circlings actually look like they
tuck<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.409> bit<00:01:16.619> roaches<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:17.640> of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
tuck in a little bit roaches kind of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.890 
tuck in a little bit roaches kind of
tucked<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.299> bit<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.540> hydros

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
tucked in a little bit but hydros

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
tucked in a little bit but hydros
actually<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.500> stupid<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.340> they're

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
actually look really stupid when they're

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.330 
actually look really stupid when they're
burrowed<00:01:21.320> maybe<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.530> me<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.250> know

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
burrowed maybe it's just me I don't know

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
burrowed maybe it's just me I don't know
I<00:01:23.549> don't<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> animation<00:01:24.570> very<00:01:24.750> much<00:01:24.900> I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
I don't like the animation very much I

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710 
I don't like the animation very much I
kind<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> wish<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.890> dot<00:01:26.159> again<00:01:26.720> but

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
kind of wish it was just a dot again but

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.539 
kind of wish it was just a dot again but
um<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> raven<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.009> now<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.430> he

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
um you know the raven is out now if he

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.640 
um you know the raven is out now if he
moved<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> over<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.540> ever<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.079> slightly<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
moved it over just ever so slightly to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.170 
moved it over just ever so slightly to
the<00:01:31.680> south<00:01:32.040> he<00:01:32.280> would<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.610> these<00:01:32.790> burrowed

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the south he would see these burrowed

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.569 
the south he would see these burrowed
units<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:34.320> um<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:35.009> he's<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.340> out<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
units but um you know he's just out of

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.749 
units but um you know he's just out of
position<00:01:35.759> here<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.650> lot<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.799> SUVs<00:01:38.280> tagging

all<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> way<00:02:16.430> up<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.730> front<00:02:16.910> lines<00:02:17.239> got<00:02:17.569> to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
all the way up to the front lines got to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.119 
all the way up to the front lines got to
do<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.049> with<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.349> roaches<00:02:18.709> since<00:02:18.920> they<00:02:19.010> have

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
do that with the roaches since they have

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.289 
do that with the roaches since they have
such<00:02:19.310> short<00:02:19.549> range<00:02:19.730> he<00:02:19.819> actually<00:02:19.940> needs<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
such short range he actually needs a

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.690 
such short range he actually needs a
moving<00:02:20.599> again<00:02:20.900> do<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.470> same<00:02:21.769> thing<00:02:22.040> sweep<00:02:22.489> on

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
moving again do the same thing sweep on

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.970 
moving again do the same thing sweep on
in<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.420> know<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.660> range<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:24.200> these<00:02:24.470> hydralisk

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
in you know the range on these hydralisk

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.979 
in you know the range on these hydralisk
is<00:02:25.160> pretty<00:02:25.459> good<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.209> they<00:02:26.540> are<00:02:26.720> going<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.930> be

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
is pretty good so they are going to be

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.360 
is pretty good so they are going to be
able<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.170> pick<00:02:27.290> up<00:02:27.410> units<00:02:27.769> from<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.099> sides

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
able to pick up units from the sides

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.280 
able to pick up units from the sides
pretty<00:02:29.150> effectively<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:29.750> all<00:02:29.900> these<00:02:30.049> roaches

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
pretty effectively but all these roaches

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.080 
pretty effectively but all these roaches
you<00:02:30.799> know<00:02:30.890> coming<00:02:31.190> in<00:02:31.340> from<00:02:31.519> behind<00:02:31.610> not<00:02:31.940> able

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
you know coming in from behind not able

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.090 
you know coming in from behind not able
to<00:02:32.269> do<00:02:32.390> any

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100

the<00:02:33.490> investor<00:02:33.880> comes<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.270> now<00:02:34.420> at<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.660> great

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
the investor comes in now at a great

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.350 
the investor comes in now at a great
fungal<00:02:35.350> growth<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.700> Jimmy<00:02:36.970> just<00:02:37.210> has

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
fungal growth but this is Jimmy just has

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.750 
fungal growth but this is Jimmy just has
way<00:02:37.690> too<00:02:37.750> many<00:02:38.290> forces<00:02:38.830> for<00:02:39.130> ich<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> handle<00:02:39.700> at

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
way too many forces for ich to handle at

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.640 
way too many forces for ich to handle at
this<00:02:39.910> moment<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.450> he<00:02:40.750> makes<00:02:40.930> his<00:02:41.140> counter<00:02:41.440> push

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
this moment if he makes his counter push

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.960 
this moment if he makes his counter push
right<00:02:41.920> now<00:02:42.160> he's<00:02:42.430> going<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.790> really

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
right now he's going to be in really

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.590 
right now he's going to be in really
good<00:02:43.060> position<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:44.620> as<00:02:45.210> equally<00:02:46.210> ER<00:02:46.240> but<00:02:46.420> ich

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
good position just as equally ER but ich

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.240 
good position just as equally ER but ich
was<00:02:46.750> held<00:02:46.930> off<00:02:47.050> by<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.320> planetary<00:02:47.770> fortress

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
was held off by that planetary fortress

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.250 
was held off by that planetary fortress
and<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:49.210> is<00:02:49.360> Jimmy<00:02:49.660> would<00:02:49.810> be<00:02:49.930> held<00:02:50.110> off

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
and this is Jimmy would be held off

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.110 
and this is Jimmy would be held off
basically<00:02:50.530> only<00:02:51.010> by<00:02:51.190> two<00:02:51.250> queens<00:02:51.820> at<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
basically only by two queens at the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.390 
basically only by two queens at the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
moment so you know in a position of

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.340 
moment so you know in a position of
power<00:02:54.460> but<00:02:54.940> he<00:02:55.000> doesn't<00:02:55.390> quite<00:02:55.600> realize<00:02:56.110> it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
power but he doesn't quite realize it

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.920 
power but he doesn't quite realize it
eek<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.310> know<00:02:57.430> getting<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:57.880> huge<00:02:58.390> mineral

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
eek you know getting this huge mineral

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.120 
eek you know getting this huge mineral
um<00:03:00.150> advantage<00:03:01.150> she's<00:03:01.450> got<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:02.380> eight

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
um advantage she's got just eight

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.770 
um advantage she's got just eight
hundred<00:03:03.580> more<00:03:03.760> minerals<00:03:04.090> per<00:03:04.240> second<00:03:04.660> and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
hundred more minerals per second and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.300 
hundred more minerals per second and
double<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.470> gas<00:03:05.680> coming<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:08.470> yeah<00:03:09.040> this

all these Marauders not really paying

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.170 
all these Marauders not really paying
attention<00:03:14.350> they<00:03:14.830> need<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.100> move<00:03:15.280> closer<00:03:15.970> to

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
did kill that layer and eek does not

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.659 
did kill that layer and eek does not
have<00:04:52.850> another<00:04:53.060> layer<00:04:53.330> out<00:04:53.539> on<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.810> field<00:04:54.080> so

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
have another layer out on the field so

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.800 
have another layer out on the field so
at<00:04:55.669> this<00:04:55.789> point<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.150> doesn't<00:04:56.449> matter<00:04:56.750> that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
at this point it doesn't matter that

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.330 
at this point it doesn't matter that
much<00:04:56.990> because<00:04:57.169> he<00:04:57.440> did<00:04:57.710> get<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.919> lot<00:04:58.100> of<00:04:58.160> the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
much because he did get a lot of the

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.159 
much because he did get a lot of the
layer<00:04:58.580> buildings<00:04:59.150> down<00:04:59.389> already<00:04:59.750> he's

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
layer buildings down already he's

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.610 
layer buildings down already he's
building<00:05:00.470> another<00:05:00.560> Roach<00:05:01.100> warrant<00:05:02.260> why<00:05:03.260> is<00:05:03.320> he

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
building another Roach warrant why is he

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.159 
building another Roach warrant why is he
building<00:05:03.830> another<00:05:04.130> in<00:05:05.030> case<00:05:05.300> his<00:05:05.660> main<00:05:05.930> gets

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
building another in case his main gets

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.830 
building another in case his main gets
swept<00:05:06.740> he's<00:05:07.310> gonna<00:05:07.610> be<00:05:07.970> safe<00:05:08.539> with<00:05:08.810> that

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
swept he's gonna be safe with that

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.330 
swept he's gonna be safe with that
second<00:05:09.410> Roach<00:05:09.560> Warren<00:05:09.919> you<00:05:10.010> know<00:05:10.100> if<00:05:10.220> he's

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
second Roach Warren you know if he's

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.310 
second Roach Warren you know if he's
gonna<00:05:10.490> rebuild<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.150> he<00:05:11.690> may<00:05:11.960> as<00:05:12.110> well

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
gonna rebuild that he may as well

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.040 
gonna rebuild that he may as well
rebuild<00:05:12.800> everything<00:05:13.190> else<00:05:13.520> too<00:05:13.960> he<00:05:14.960> is

getting<00:05:15.289> a<00:05:15.380> bit<00:05:15.560> behind<00:05:15.740> on<00:05:16.010> gas<00:05:16.310> now<00:05:16.810> after

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
getting a bit behind on gas now after

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.420 
getting a bit behind on gas now after
building<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.229> few<00:05:18.470> high<00:05:18.620> jealous<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.250> mule

escs but this is Jimmy sittin pretty I
actually<00:05:22.610> like<00:05:23.000> his<00:05:23.210> position<00:05:23.630> a<00:05:23.690> lot<00:05:23.870> now

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
actually like his position a lot now

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.610 
actually like his position a lot now
let's<00:05:24.740> check<00:05:24.949> out<00:05:25.130> his<00:05:25.280> income<00:05:26.259> he's<00:05:27.259> still

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
let's check out his income he's still

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.860 
let's check out his income he's still
pretty<00:05:28.130> far<00:05:28.370> behind<00:05:28.550> in<00:05:29.300> both<00:05:29.570> gas<00:05:29.840> and

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
pretty far behind in both gas and

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.129 
pretty far behind in both gas and
minerals<00:05:30.500> he's<00:05:30.860> 17<00:05:31.400> harvesters<00:05:32.000> ahead<00:05:32.780> though

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
minerals he's 17 harvesters ahead though

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.430 
minerals he's 17 harvesters ahead though
he's<00:05:33.919> got<00:05:34.099> more<00:05:34.520> harvesters<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.150> lesson<00:05:35.840> wow

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
he's got more harvesters and lesson wow

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.320 
he's got more harvesters and lesson wow
it's<00:05:36.919> because<00:05:37.220> of<00:05:37.250> that<00:05:37.430> high<00:05:37.610> yield<00:05:37.970> really

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
it's because of that high yield really

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.629 
it's because of that high yield really
making<00:05:38.570> a<00:05:38.630> huge<00:05:38.870> difference<00:05:39.139> and<00:05:39.620> I'm<00:05:40.430> not

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
making a huge difference and I'm not

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.219 
making a huge difference and I'm not
sure<00:05:40.849> if<00:05:41.030> he's<00:05:41.060> mining<00:05:41.630> all<00:05:41.780> his<00:05:41.960> gas

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
sure if he's mining all his gas

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.070 
sure if he's mining all his gas
efficiently<00:05:43.070> yeah<00:05:43.430> he<00:05:43.699> is<00:05:43.820> still<00:05:44.180> getting<00:05:44.960> his

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
efficiently yeah he is still getting his

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.469 
efficiently yeah he is still getting his
gasps<00:05:45.320> oh<00:05:45.650> no<00:05:45.949> it's<00:05:46.340> not<00:05:46.550> that<00:05:46.610> efficient<00:05:47.300> look

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
gasps oh no it's not that efficient look

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.439 
gasps oh no it's not that efficient look
at<00:05:47.630> all<00:05:47.840> these<00:05:47.990> SUVs<00:05:48.729> distance<00:05:49.729> mining<00:05:50.120> gasps

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
at all these SUVs distance mining gasps

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.480 
at all these SUVs distance mining gasps
and<00:05:50.870> now<00:05:50.900> all<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.470> minerals<00:05:51.650> just<00:05:52.130> ran<00:05:52.310> out

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
and now all the minerals just ran out

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.330 
and now all the minerals just ran out
