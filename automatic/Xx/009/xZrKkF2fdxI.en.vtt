 hello today plays will tell 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.240
 to you about the board game 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.490
 unita four regions of Helvetia are fighting 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.980
 for independence and you have to 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.520
 head one of these freedom loving 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.910
 peoples 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.670
 not one step back in a big box under 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 field four groups of original cubes 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.160
 and some other dependency components 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.830
 from the number of players the game is played on one 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 from both sides of the field when playing together 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.070
 each will lead two factions at once 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.510
 each player receives 3 territory tiles 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.489
 3 power cards and all the cubes of your color 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.719
 each player rolls one dice with 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.219
 maximum numbers of 5 4 and 3 and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.280
 throws them until everyone is 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.320
 the number is indicated starting from the first square 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.199
 in his field and moving towards 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.809
 to the center he places his tiles 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.290
 areas in the closed in the distance 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.770
 equal to one of the numbers thrown away then 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.270
 all cubes are returned to players and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.909
 overturned by maximum numbers 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.490
 up starting from the first player and 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.159
 clockwise each one exposes 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.549
 any two of their dice empty cells 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.009
 on the cells with color numbers of the fraction 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.670
 as soon as the last player set two 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.220
 dice 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.259
 He puts two more since now 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.170
 the alignment will go in reverse 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.720
 direction and order will change 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.079
 until every player puts 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.689
 all 16 of their cubes each cube 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.720
 symbolizes a platoon and four 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.460
 cubes form a company in one company not 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.070
 maybe two fives 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.710
 and the rest is no limit now 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.100
 the game itself begins in your turn player 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.649
 has three movement points each 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.600
 of which you can spend one step 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.360
 forward by any of your company 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.090
 however, entry to that location will require 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.030
 two points and jump along the way others 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.820
 mouth and forbidden player need to lead 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.850
 your mouth and to center field saving as 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.940
 possible life points how many points 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.740
 It was on the cubes and the arch of so many victorious 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.020
 points will get player a 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.050
 why the mouth movement ends 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.870
 side by side with the enemy company happening 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.840
 battle compare meanings but 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.320
 contiguous dice and fewer of them 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.810
 lose one in the case of a draw where 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.500
 the value of the advanced platoons is added 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.390
 the meaning of those that stand behind them 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.760
 then the front rows of dice change 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.810
 places with the rear and in this battle 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.080
 ends if the platoon loses the last 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.260
 unit of force he turns over the coat of arms 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.920
 up more power he can't lose 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.200
 Well, the victory points will not bring on 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.930
 the field has singular permutation squares 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.600
 on which the player can change the formation 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.060
 his company as well as special tiles 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.610
 which players placed at the beginning of the game 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.200
 to take advantage of their properties their 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.710
 need to flip 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.440
 Mountains give a bonus to the protection of the forest to attack and 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.530
 each faction also has a special 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.330
 unique locations also to players 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.280
 three power cards are available 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.490
 one of which they can play 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.250
 the process of the party and get a significant bonus 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.600
 let a large number of cubes in this 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.360
 the game does not bother you 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.120
 they have the very real strategy in 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.490
 which is no place for chance but to win 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.670
 only the best strategist can 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.670
 tactician
