paying for with this salt here guys I
don't<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:14.659> as<00:01:15.659> long<00:01:15.720> as<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.080> doing<00:01:16.260> water

gallon water change every two weeks on

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
gallon water change every two weeks on
my<00:01:21.120> forty<00:01:21.420> gallon<00:01:21.690> tank<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.010> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
my forty gallon tank I don't have to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.070 
my forty gallon tank I don't have to
dose<00:01:23.370> any<00:01:23.640> calcium<00:01:24.150> magnesium<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.840> anything

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
dose any calcium magnesium or anything

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.520 
dose any calcium magnesium or anything
like<00:01:25.260> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
like that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.490 
like that
all<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.520> those<00:01:26.640> trace<00:01:27.000> elements<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.690> when<00:01:28.380> are

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
all of those trace elements and when are

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.390 
all of those trace elements and when are
in<00:01:29.190> this<00:01:29.549> salted<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.180> they're<00:01:30.270> actually

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
in this salted and they're actually

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.570 
in this salted and they're actually
boosted<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> bit<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.570> well<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> basically

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
boosted up a bit as well so basically

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.399 
boosted up a bit as well so basically
what<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.150> show<00:01:36.510> is<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.780> product<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.200> it's

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
what they show is in product is it's

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.670 
what they show is in product is it's
made<00:01:37.830> by<00:01:38.040> solar<00:01:38.340> evaporation<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:40.440> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
made by solar evaporation and it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.660 
made by solar evaporation and it
produces<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.400> natural<00:01:42.380> salt<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:44.490> their

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
produces a natural salt and all their

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.270 
produces a natural salt and all their
trace<00:01:44.880> elements<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.420> still<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
trace elements are still in there and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.120 
trace elements are still in there and
balanced<00:01:47.820> properly<00:01:48.150> as<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.860> normal<00:01:49.860> saw<00:01:49.979> would

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
balanced properly as as normal saw would

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.370 
balanced properly as as normal saw would
be<00:01:50.220> most<00:01:50.670> salts<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.150> find<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:52.290> know

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
be most salts that you find you know

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050 
be most salts that you find you know
they<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.650> lot<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.860> chemicals<00:01:53.400> in<00:01:53.580> them<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
they have a lot of chemicals in them to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.690 
they have a lot of chemicals in them to
compensate<00:01:54.900> for<00:01:56.810> what<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:59.430> not

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
compensate for what the you know for not

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.560 
compensate for what the you know for not
using<00:01:59.939> natural<00:02:00.630> sea<00:02:00.869> sea<00:02:01.530> water<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.670> these

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
using natural sea sea water so these

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
using natural sea sea water so these
here<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.920> very<00:02:05.159> very<00:02:05.549> pure<00:02:06.650> salt<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:08.670> have

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
here it's a very very pure salt you have

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.449 
here it's a very very pure salt you have
to<00:02:08.909> worry<00:02:09.030> about<00:02:09.239> chemicals<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.159> and<00:02:11.159> all<00:02:11.310> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
to worry about chemicals and and all of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.130 
to worry about chemicals and and all of
that<00:02:11.489> nonsense<00:02:11.819> or<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:13.200> know<00:02:13.319> like

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
that nonsense or you know like

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.520 
that nonsense or you know like
Taman<00:02:14.500> nations<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.310> whatnot<00:02:16.270> our<00:02:16.530> higher

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
salt that from when they've tested it so

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.050 
salt that from when they've tested it so
basically<00:02:34.170> most<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.410> reef<00:02:35.650> reef<00:02:36.610> salts

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
basically most of your reef reef salts

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.820 
basically most of your reef reef salts
will<00:02:37.330> come<00:02:37.570> with<00:02:37.810> some<00:02:38.200> calcium<00:02:38.560> and

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
will come with some calcium and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.150 
will come with some calcium and
magnesium<00:02:39.690> but<00:02:40.690> most<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.989> them<00:02:41.230> focus<00:02:41.500> more<00:02:42.130> on

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
magnesium but most of them focus more on

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
magnesium but most of them focus more on
the<00:02:42.430> calcium<00:02:42.940> level<00:02:44.100> than<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.580> magnesium<00:02:45.910> so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
the calcium level than the magnesium so

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.590 
the calcium level than the magnesium so
they<00:02:46.300> lack<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> magnesium<00:02:47.140> area<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.920> they

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
they lack in the magnesium area and they

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.270 
they lack in the magnesium area and they
you<00:02:49.600> know<00:02:49.660> they<00:02:49.720> they're<00:02:50.440> normal<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.040> calcium

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
you know they they're normal and calcium

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
be able to compete with the calcium so

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.530 
be able to compete with the calcium so

those<00:03:25.570> levels<00:03:26.130> they<00:03:27.130> also<00:03:27.280> suggest<00:03:27.820> using<00:03:28.030> RO

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
those levels they also suggest using RO

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
deionization stage at the end you don't

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.140 
deionization stage at the end you don't
want<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.630> use<00:03:37.720> tap<00:03:37.959> water<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.440> reef<00:03:39.150> because

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
want to use tap water in a reef because

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.640 
want to use tap water in a reef because
you'll<00:03:40.299> get<00:03:40.510> all<00:03:40.660> kinds<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.140> problems<00:03:41.410> with

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
you'll get all kinds of problems with

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.789 
you'll get all kinds of problems with
allergies<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.610> just<00:03:43.600> deaths<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.350> your<00:03:44.470> tank

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
allergies and just deaths and your tank

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.310 
allergies and just deaths and your tank
your<00:03:45.070> tank<00:03:45.280> will<00:03:45.459> crash<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.450> burn

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
your tank will crash and and burn

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.000 
your tank will crash and and burn
basically<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.840> if<00:03:50.170> you're<00:03:50.410> investing<00:03:50.890> all

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
basically so if you're investing all

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.880 
basically so if you're investing all
this<00:03:51.160> money<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:52.390> know<00:03:52.510> into<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.440> salt<00:03:53.709> and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
this money you know into the salt and

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.180 
this money you know into the salt and
your<00:03:54.579> corals<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.150> your<00:03:55.269> fish<00:03:55.680> use<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.860> proper

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
your corals and your fish use the proper

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.420 
your corals and your fish use the proper
water<00:03:57.430> as<00:03:57.670> well<00:03:58.500> best<00:03:59.500> advice<00:03:59.829> I<00:04:00.010> can<00:04:00.070> give<00:04:00.310> on

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
water as well best advice I can give on

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.240 
water as well best advice I can give on
that<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.900> they<00:04:01.989> just<00:04:02.170> recommend<00:04:02.620> using<00:04:02.799> this

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
that but they just recommend using this

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.140 
that but they just recommend using this
is<00:04:03.489> like<00:04:03.700> mate<00:04:04.180> for<00:04:04.750> use<00:04:04.900> with<00:04:05.110> RO<00:04:05.320> water

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
is like mate for use with RO water

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.789 
is like mate for use with RO water
because<00:04:07.150> it's<00:04:07.540> it's<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:08.019> lot<00:04:08.140> song<00:04:08.530> it's<00:04:08.709> a

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
because it's it's a lot song it's a

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.569 
because it's it's a lot song it's a
softer<00:04:09.280> water<00:04:09.519> with<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.209> lower<00:04:10.480> calcium<00:04:10.989> level

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
softer water with a lower calcium level

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.099 
softer water with a lower calcium level
and<00:04:12.579> because<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.299> calcium<00:04:13.660> levels<00:04:13.930> aren't

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
and because the calcium levels aren't

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.909 
and because the calcium levels aren't
pretty<00:04:14.470> high<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.130> stuff<00:04:15.370> here<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.989> it

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
pretty high in this stuff here and it

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.909 
pretty high in this stuff here and it
also<00:04:18.070> again<00:04:18.669> removes<00:04:19.630> undesirable<00:04:20.260> ions<00:04:20.590> and

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
also again removes undesirable ions and

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.830 
also again removes undesirable ions and
phosphates<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.700> nitrates<00:04:22.060> from<00:04:22.270> from<00:04:22.630> tap

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
phosphates and nitrates from from tap

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.950 
phosphates and nitrates from from tap
water

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.730 

so<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:27.419> way<00:04:27.539> I<00:04:27.569> look<00:04:27.840> at<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.080> if<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.289> use<00:04:28.470> in<00:04:28.620> RO

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
so the way I look at is if you use in RO

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.499 
so the way I look at is if you use in RO
do<00:04:28.979> you<00:04:29.220> have<00:04:29.370> total<00:04:29.580> control<00:04:29.880> over<00:04:30.090> your

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
do you have total control over your

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.760 
do you have total control over your
water<00:04:30.840> quality<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:33.240> know<00:04:33.330> if<00:04:33.509> you're

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
water quality so you know if you're

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.800 
water quality so you know if you're
you're<00:04:34.770> buying<00:04:34.949> from<00:04:35.099> a<00:04:35.250> store<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:36.449> bottled

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
you're buying from a store the bottled

unless<00:04:38.340> you're<00:04:38.520> testing<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.569> water<00:04:39.780> your<00:04:39.930> you

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
unless you're testing the water your you

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.570
