00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.590
 good in this video I wanted to show you the 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.619
 wireless screen operation 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.829
 that you may have seen in settings 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:16.080
 screen this option appears in all 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:20.099
 those terminals that have android 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.560
 42 in this case we can find it in 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.949
 those there are three crosses in which 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.150
 there are urgent three turbo crossover in either 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.180
 of which there is a g4 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.270
 this option what allows us is 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.550
 connect our phone to a receiver 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.320
 or to a device by the protocol look 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.620
 cast 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.239
 to be able to visualize everything 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.900
 we have on our screen 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:50.630
 phone on that other device 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.750
 there are don girls in the market 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.460
 for this protocol with which then 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.800
 well they are directly connected to 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.810
 hdmi port of the TV or monitor 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.780
 and once from the phone we 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.980
 we connect good as we would be or 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 would directly show the image in 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.410
 said monitor or on said television the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.640
 tablets depending on the model too 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.890
 they have this option 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.550
 with which we can see our 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 phone on the screen of the tablet and 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.780
 if it is in turn has output hdmi 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.740
 we could be seeing in our 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.990
 phone on the monitor or on the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.310
 good television without needing 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.880
 acquire that extra dongle to do 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.880
 this operation 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.220
 in this case I will use a g4 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.690
 advance 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.180
 if we go to screen settings at the end 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.670
 we see the screen option 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.220
 wireless to perform this operation 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.150
 it is necessary to have connected or activated 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.920
 the wifi and that both devices are 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.580
 connected to the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.580
 to wifi 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.540
 once at this point in this case as 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.030
 he commented he was going to be through a 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.220
 tablet on the tablet that this is the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.159
 software that even the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.650
 dongle they do not stop being an android 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.650
 also that is the wifi display 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.590
 once active 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.580
 if in our terminal we click on 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.640
 wireless screen and activate it 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.510
 we see that he finds in this case the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.510
 device we click and start to 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.510
 connect and as we can see 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.790
 we have the image all everything that is 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:00.280
 show on our phone what we have 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.680
 on the tablet the truth is that the 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.989
 response is quite fast at the time 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.969
 to play a good video because it's not going 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.990
 to have or not we will find any 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.870
 type of lag 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:16.300
 in this case, like this tablet 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.300
 allows hdmi output 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.300
 connecting said tablet 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.069
 to a television hdmi we can see 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.660
 as 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:38.900
 this phone content 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.900
 we have it also on the television 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.620
 and little more I hope you liked it and 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.240
 to keep up with all the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.240
 news about and continue to be connected to
