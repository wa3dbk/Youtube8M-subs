00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.000
 I just got a very strange back 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.919
 Do you see this weird area in front? 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 sing display error when i am 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.179
 then move that moves white 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.679
 small area also high heat less 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.980
 if I will come back in the near 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.980
 so again smaller but to do the height 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 It can also be very, I think again 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 okay so everyone lost to the next episode 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.440
 five things in minecraft like you've 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.489
 Did not know I have a few 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.050
 things picked out 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.579
 you are welcome to also new things 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.219
 Send in and also in the next 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.350
 video in there if the stuff because good 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.969
 have always been asked I do that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 always following the videos 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 I'll look at the facts and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.879
 Accordingly, pick five things 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.399
 I as important or as interesting 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.110
 feel there are so many now 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.399
 in retrospect thank you for that too 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 he really runs the whole format 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.489
 thanks that not everyone can read this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.199
 that is to say only if no consequence 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.530
 Produced so long by snappy enough 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.299
 The post office box in the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 a little at the moment I restructure 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.150
 the video manager finds it can be that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.979
 the youtube team have to 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.299
 find a little alternative again 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.799
 to which have already sent what 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.340
 but what is not shown yet or 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.350
 something similar 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.479
 if we have to change, you have to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.740
 to send it again because they will 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.299
 I do not have in my head anymore because of me 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.509
 it logically it when the time comes 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.200
 8763 messages are still online 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.020
 in my mailbox 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.220
 Not so little then I would 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.079
 say it again 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.600
 how much did you know from her? 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.939
 these five against 15:25 three out of five 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.689
 instead of the comments and after what 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.729
 longer introduction Let's go the first one 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.500
 The thing is from the ex gamer family and he 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.390
 Write if you have a bucket of water 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.520
 Placed and a water head on the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.890
 The water does not go away 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.200
 okay that's just we times with 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 map a waterbed stems 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.290
 you see here is the source of water 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.360
 and then it flowed on the water 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.219
 setup okay if i stay here now 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.619
 blog site and displace the water 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.659
 then it disappears when logically 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.869
 But now I do the same thing 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.069
 a water head then the water remains 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.800
 there though, the water actually 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.330
 would have to be displaced as well as with 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.680
 the grass is blocked 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.720
 if I see you there again now 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.470
 away but also disappears for so long 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.400
 is it still there ok go is 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.430
 surely not the next thing is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.320
 from german would sign if you 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.630
 snowballs hitting each other 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.220
 he loses his life 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.240
 ok as it looks like you can too 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.580
 similar places in endermann countries 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.530
 To inflict harm inflicting him 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.780
 with snowballs from the sax helps 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.220
 of course the extent to which it will hurt 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.710
 it was not like that now 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.040
 strong weapons marc schneeberger holds 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.740
 he'll look at it exactly 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.850
 gets a pity and the display above 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.790
 actually goes bye bye 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.160
 you could theoretically yourself 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.290
 settles and countries push with 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.730
 snow balls kill okay the next 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.160
 thing is from jan parcours and he 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.020
 writes means you knew that lava in 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.240
 never flows faster than in the 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.680
 normal world so a kind of change of 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.970
 It can flow with water 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.190
 not do because what his hell 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.780
 is clear but I want it can 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.080
 you really look so good 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.970
 over 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:31.970
 So a normal one wants to be real in 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.970
 real normal world 23 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.130
 So the speed is easy 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.130
 my head is now hell again 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.519
 of course , is still one 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.080
 In addition, the radius of the lava in 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.160
 the hell as it looks like I stood 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.930
 but that's what it really is 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.670
 what belongs to mention but with 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.080
 that has to be one before that 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.890
 higher need to go on but 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.959
 more quickly 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.570
 it does not have to be like that now 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.260
 water about or a bit slow 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.090
 Look at you wonder form of togolese 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.650
 lava endures is one last episode 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.060
 and if we ever here to the problem 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.060
 the whole thing will be in the end 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.799
 the next thing is from pro versus co 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.210
 and he attributes my snowman 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.590
 must always build first the 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.150
 put snowflake when first 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.860
 placed the pumpkin and then only 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.290
 put under Schneble everything remains 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.970
 normal and no snowman pont okay 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.990
 Normally, that's what we are 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.729
 I build my way 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.669
 Snowball from two blocks of snowman 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.990
 Two blocks of snow in a pumpkin 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.030
 but hardly on the order 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.430
 a video that is an example of course 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.190
 Although snow a pumpkin snow wool 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.979
 the other way around snow for example 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.160
 now a sequence so pumpkin here 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.350
 snow and snow and nothing happened 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.030
 which contents now decrease again 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.820
 Then it becomes snow became 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.900
 ok with iron coal is it then 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.669
 Logically, incidentally the same 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:07.250
 be and the last thing for today is 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.690
 by gangl player and he writes chicken 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.669
 and he still believes to be at the pug 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.220
 not crushed by slopes 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.570
 yes that's right so far there is one 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.820
 small exception I is there the same times 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.410
 Tried and chicken 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.510
 imprisoned in the small cages 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.490
 piss the supervisor ice cold times 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.190
 crushes main does not work as it does 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.000
 looks zeta slopes icy cold through the 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.110
 chicken through the air 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.760
 however, if we have the following now 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:37.700
 make sure you ski on these slopes 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.419
 replace glass on chicken again 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.210
 lock up 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.389
 there is on it and if we now that 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.130
 nothing happens that the 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:50.000
 Runs through the chicken first 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.770
 by but the retreat is the 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.780
 no longer in a chicken 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.590
 but long runs in the 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.530
 stone block thereby withdrawn with 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.260
 and of course we crushed that ok 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.210
 that has already been known of this 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.900
 Follow five-fingered minecraft again 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.760
 did not know it could be that people 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.160
 I have many people already 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.889
 It may be that the complaints are 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.750
 some of them are not so 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.880
 Comparison of the Bernese are so things the 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.070
 you or 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.570
 a sent it is because of me 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.210
 Seeking if I follow you, making it easy 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.860
 the latest things out or the 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.200
 the five best things i got from it first 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.300
 take out among the thousands 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.710
 by mails meanwhile already five 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.540
 community have come together 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.890
 a little screenshot is my whole one 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.210
 Postfach I think 3000 I had 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.190
 before since the series started 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.370
 actually sunday partly come to that 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.320
 up to 200 mails i can not do all of them 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.190
 I read 200 mails a day 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.530
 would work and one minute each 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.660
 need around less than a minute 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.760
 mails or the idea of ​​15 community 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.540
 to try that out to see if that 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.270
 correct is 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.920
 you have to spend a minute per profile in the 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.450
 think because I also try many outside 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.080
 Watching what goes what was written there 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.760
 which does not work 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.040
 for example, that you have to go ahead too 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.450
 test Germany eighth three hours 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.590
 sit on it and I can do that effectively 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.390
 that does not mean I'm looking for when I'm 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.100
 a video shoot like before things out but 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.570
 I can not read all if 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.830
 really bomb things are there 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.270
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.670
 In any case, that's when 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.970
 nobody knows their stuff 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.050
 and things are even better now 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.640
 as those who have already come to it 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.380
 They will definitely be 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.910
 It can take a while 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.860
 worked through me so far 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.970
 and there are also new ones with ryan 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.950
 should not be angry about it 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.320
 who still has some of course 

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.550
 send in the better and better 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.260
 the better the chance that in the next 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.820
 video in there since I mean for 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.470
 like to watch pure like 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.240
 many of the things he knew three from 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.580
 five maybe even all this time it 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.750
 I think that was not too hard 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.000
 I'm a feast to look, we see 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.320
