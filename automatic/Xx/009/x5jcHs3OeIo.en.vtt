00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.550
 and then personal beauty rafael here all 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.200
 evidence and that 24 essential and not 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.150
 I want to talk about some things that 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.989
 are happening here on ct and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.730
 banfield 

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:20.109
 Good, I'm just walking away. 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.029
 even because I 'm having a lot of time 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.789
 to play but is the following galera 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.249
 many good changes seem to be 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.349
 arriving there will come from here some 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.970
 times to the beautiful end of four then 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.980
 there was Angelina Pro 2010 for those 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.350
 is playing too and is following 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.450
 ensures that our voice is now on the screen 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.620
 A turkey shirt came to you. 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.650
 the end of a shirt with the phrase my 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.090
 son of that store and l4 pistol and me 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.650
 sent then if you want to 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.480
 Waiting 10 shirt has a link in the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.730
 registration you can access their store 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.410
 and take a look cesare there that code 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.720
 Lets have them there, there's a coupon 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.329
 You get 30% off then 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.680
 men count among the crowd and let's go 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.079
 so next guys 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.970
 one of the changes that I believe 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.670
 to be the most major changes in 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.499
 truth is two new ones dedicated today already 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.960
 I was testing the net with 60 hertz 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.710
 which for those who do not know was 4 started 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.289
 to 10 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.960
 now it's 30 reais in the current version 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.020
 him and they are testing 60 Hz of 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.380
 the green hornet code of the game and beyond 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.149
 they are also testing 120 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.770
 heads the net code or a type 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.729
 I just noticed that I'm incredible. 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.149
 thinking over there 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.700
 only there is a big problem if you 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.829
 knows an educated channel video and bear 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.689
 or not sense that it is an English channel without 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.219
 need to have made great videos in 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.289
 magnetic format or game because nobody 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.709
 understood I recommend 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.600
 they have there, let's say, forget that 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.420
 did and the net where it actually stayed 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.369
 very good guy looks like it stayed until 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.380
 shorter the time of a recorded bullet than 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.020
 cs go who has a speech too 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.420
 Great when you play at being 2 128 20 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.889
 88 tim reid also they have it there only 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.599
 here in the neighborhood already 120 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:05.859
 Only the guys have a big problem. 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:08.590
 these servers there with 120 has it right 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:12.220
 first child of four are servers 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.850
 only for 10 people because mine is 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.100
 very complex 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.170
 when you put a server with 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.970
 these updates because you no longer have 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.380
 for those who do not know 127 means that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.430
 game will update 120 times per second 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.070
 You will give sending and receiving 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 server information and this is very 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.570
 currently 30 times per second 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.700
 So it's my idea to have a 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.930
 a fucking machine from a server to 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.090
 Can you do that with a gentleman? 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.880
 of 64 thing also imagine the price that 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.520
 will leave a server of 64 countries there with 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.590
 with this client already if a server 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.950
 can be against because it is already extremely 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.290
 expensive with a dollar was expensive with 10 and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.050
 now it 's each one with 30 harry imagine 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.270
 to 60 network that my changes a lot that 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.650
 it involves kind have to have very much 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.270
 more internet for this is much more 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.310
 downloads much more uploads you 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.480
 able to maintain a server so you 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.950
 get to play 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.840
 obviously they will make a way where 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.190
 you can choose such server and such 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.820
 What are you going to want to play with the net? 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.960
 digital 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.630
 I do not know if they will not have 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.670
 servers where more than 60 tikrit and 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.740
 saw the rivals and thirty and such 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.440
 and who knows what I expect them to 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.810
 make the staff competitive and maintain 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.480
 an option there for servers and only 10 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.430
 players so you can put 120 rands 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.960
 cane and now obviously correctly 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.850
 the atmosphere place the company server 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.350
 but I hope they do it because 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.630
 because this is very important and 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.460
 competitive advantage is to reduce the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.310
 time for you to fall in the fight against 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.080
 front will reduce the exchange of shots of 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.000
 warns that the shots do not kill exchanges 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.500
 dude it will be great if they 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.420
 can do that then I 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.680
 I really hope they do it and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.510
 Let's see how each one is going to be. 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.520
 future number 24 has a lot of good stuff 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.810
 arriving and to close there and also 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.460
 coming to these same changes because 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.890
 send the changes are being made 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.900
 by the team of the si and the team 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.090
 davie brown also that they are modifying 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.160
 a neckline to get better every time 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.140
 Good, I believe this network will be 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.220
 possible for us to play and even with 64 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.400
 poetry let's see how it's going to be 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.440
 thing when you leave at least 32 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.300
 I'm sure if you have to be 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.760
 practically had practice is not well 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.930
 possible we have been 24 in front 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.299
 So, this folks are touching 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.920
 liked it if you liked that 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.570
 relacÃ§Ãµes beautiful and it is not there 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.570
 a hug even more and spoke ah
