00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 all 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.970
 for 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.929
 make sure you have added a thermal bearing on the bottom of the 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:15.959
 heatsink 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.919
 Remove from the protective layer of the lower part of the heat sink 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.660
 make sure that the thermal continent is completely exposed 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.749
 when installing the heatsink they do not understand it and tighten it on the 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.149
 processor any force applied to the end of the core can cause damage 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.770
 and fissures in this one 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.380
 To carry out the installation correctly the heatsink must 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.340
 be centered on the bearings of coma 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.580
 be careful with the edge at the base of the heatsink this edge makes 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.160
 that the heatsink does not come into contact with the connector when it is 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.210
 connected 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.690
 hold the heatsink in place to insert the clip in the first 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.760
 plastic tab of the connector make sure the other end of the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 clip is aligned with the second tab of the connector 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.500
 Use a suitable tool such as a flat-blade screwdriver to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.950
 connect the retaining clip presses the clip but not the heat sink 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.790
 press and lightly push the clip towards the outside of the connector so that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.120
 lace on the tab 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.040
 finally press and push inwards to fix the clip on the tab 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.220
 check that the pip is perfectly placed on both tabs 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.010
 After connecting the heatsink, insert the power cord of the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.009
 fan in the power connector on the motherboard 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.430
 before turning on your pc make sure that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.710
 the heatsink is centered on the processor and is not in contact with the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.900
 shock 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.410
 all the layers of the heatsink base have been removed the clip of 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.090
 retention is perfectly connected to the tabs on both sides of the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 connector the heat sink fan is connected to the connector 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.150
 suitable when the system is turned on for the first time the fan of the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.590
 heatsink turns quickly 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.350
