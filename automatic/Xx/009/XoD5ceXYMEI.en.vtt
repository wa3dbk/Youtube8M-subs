00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
 [Music] 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.309
 [Music] 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.560
 but that they are and I'm going to 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.840
 show the three simple and beautiful 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.460
 what to do for Christmas or for year 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.439
 new although it can also occupy us 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.960
 for any other occasion really 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.340
 They are very nice and they are super easy and 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.349
 obviously it's not like that 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.300
 too much production its messages that 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.640
 they make your hair look different and 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.790
 not always like this 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.790
 loose I do not know when three days 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.079
 I hope you like the ideas and also 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.930
 convert below what is the hairstyle 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.930
 favorite of those who show them and yes 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.710
 the first hairstyle that I am going to show you 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.360
 is this is the simplest to do and it 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.530
 Look nice the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 is to divide our hair into two 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.580
 sessions in this part of our head 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.890
 three small or large sections this 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.660
 It depends on your taste and we will separate it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.430
 in two it is not a braid they are only 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.590
 two sections that we are going to cross 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270
 with each other so more or less that they remain that way 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.740
 and now the only thing we're going to do is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.630
 that we are going to put them very carefully 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.880
 in the back of our head and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.370
 with a small group we are going to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.350
 hold super super well 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.240
 [Music] 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.680
 and obviously so you do not see the league 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.960
 we have to cover with a little bit of 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.690
 our hair and put a pin and that 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.479
 it's all less than two minutes super easy 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.790
 and in that state it looks super cute right 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.700
 now let's go with the hairstyle number 2 is 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.040
 a little more production but still 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.360
 that 's how a little messy we go 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.890
 to take with a section of our 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.020
 very small hair and especially that 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.940
 come from the back my color of 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.830
 hair the dots is clearer and that 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.390
 there is no problem and what we are going to 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.280
 do is a half tail you can do it 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 messy or very well backwards I 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.720
 I left some hair and I will use 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.940
 these stil phil I do not know if they have seen them 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.850
 I love them because simply with two 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.530
 of these holds or any chongo 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.630
 any queue and you do not need so many 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.729
 pins are very practical that yes they are worth 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.070
 like 70 pesos but in truth they are 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.230
 I highly recommend I bought're like 34 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.450
 weeks and I love them and the only thing that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.280
 we have to do it is to put them in 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.739
 our hair and spin here you do not see 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.650
 very well as you applied them but if you want 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.650
 a video something tell me I did 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.900
 see here and elsewhere since no 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.590
 I have to apply as 10 pins that 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.180
 be super easy now we go with the 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.939
 part that I told them to keep going to 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.769
 make a super small braid and the 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.720
 let's go through the company part of 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.030
 our head and let's put some 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.200
 pins for it to hold and for 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.720
 preference that you will not see the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.400
 pins and that's all it's just 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.859
 a detail that braid so that it is not 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.400
 a so simple half tail gives a touch 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:03:00.360
 special and that's all 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.310
 [Music] 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.690
 and you can also add any much 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.360
 that you want to put or some little detail 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.200
 extra and it looks super beautiful just like me 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.200
 love as usual 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.080
 and finally I'm going to show you the see 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.030
 being combed and last hairstyle is a 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.190
 little more production 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.500
 I'm going to make a braid like on this side 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.420
 it is a normal braid nothing complicated 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.180
 You can make it as thick as you 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.070
 want preferably not be as 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.900
 thin because if you are not going to see very 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.360
 little and preferably little be so 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.460
 so thick I made a little braid 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.740
 thinner than the other side because 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.560
 if I made it a little bit serious and logical that 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.880
 we have to do is take it and put it 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
 very carefully in the back 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.220
 of our head and secure it or put 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.900
 of pins I put the spin ping 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.910
 because it 's just I know it's going to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.070
 last all night they will not fall and 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.750
 he says it feels super good the horse 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.150
 obviously do not forget to remove the 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:00.930
 league that you put to stop the braid 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.540
 [Music] 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.340
 and I'm already combed a little bit more 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.439
 production but also very very easy 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.420
 I hope you liked all the 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.240
 hairstyles see you soon there is happy 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.020

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.020
