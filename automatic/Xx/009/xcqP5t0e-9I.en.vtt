00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
 and otherwise 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.720
 I do not really understand 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.100
 shall we 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.179
 the purely with a train 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.179
 Dennis goes on to say that she's at her full 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.929
 The tablet market makes him the trends are the label today 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.809
 but if the doors indicate that it will safely move in the water 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 So we wanted to speak that direction 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.229
 look how many policemen will surprise us yet 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.909
 I'm a bit quieter now I do not print 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.180
 because there will certainly be policemen again 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 certainly 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.210
 that he has a very interesting windings what the game show development 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420
 as far as the percent gameplay is concerned 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.790
 I still have to 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.820
 KlÃ¤hn killing members in cold blood from behind 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.470
 and now we do this with structures to hunt down policemen 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.760
 is 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.000
 an amazing twist 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.100
 You should be able to walk along here 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.650
 Class I just pass 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.930
 Billions of costs do not necessarily mean a shoot-out 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.220
 I do not want I do not want 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.470
 therefore 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 like this one through 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.960
 and I just heard a phone ring 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.360
 here is also the phone 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.460
 where on earth is that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 Now the EU wants to bet the phone 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.280
 I'm looking for the phone the telephone Giersch march is 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.630
 here 4 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.630
 Helmut Lehnert 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.060
 I understand I'm not going 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.810
 that's right the corresponding report as worthless because not 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.470
 recall 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 Franconia 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.579
 now he stops at the bus stop big already expect me 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:19.980
 to let 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.980
 those who are not ready the combo before 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.889
 Of course Dalloul Tiers need memory 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.979
 they have two opponents here 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.089
 now cold-blooded of 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:36.009
 Become Kefer 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.169
 That's it 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.119
 Borken 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.729
 further prices 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.729
 Get out of the game 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.310
 4 but may ask 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.780
 the duty to give a shopping cart us I do not know why what that 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.599
 should 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.139
 somebody has everything against us is their desire to shake more 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.239
 here 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.520
 Well 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.050
 how ready I have so every damaged one two thick markings 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.149
 3 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:10.649
 but fact 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.619
 they suddenly surprised me 4 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:18.049
 That's why Lidl and her team up with everything in FIFA 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.919
 you like it again 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.919
 why was that different? 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.109
 Sometimes I would say we just lure them and percent 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.809
 Bells are under where we have the clear advantage 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.109
 more than 80 percent 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.459
 but now it can come down to believe it 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.309
 dpa 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:46.849
 There were bad jokes 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.349
 Voltwerk free kick was the completion discolored 4 5 and 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.229
 Countries struggled 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:58.259
 from the same height I myself briefly one here all open from there under 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.529
 would quite like to play the do not come under these not stupid 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.229
 always careful on the pole at the police school 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.099
 So just shot not sexy but sometimes down 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.059
 and like so many 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.069
 Painkiller 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.069
 young boy i missed the analgesic departure 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.239
 They also lost me in discoveries 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.340
 the first of the build 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.189
 Come around the corner then I can easily kill you 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.990
 The UCI theme may be that they are really better 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.349
 here I am 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.349
 dpa 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.349
 that comes from showed WAZ should drive there 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.059
 There are also discoveries 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.540
 you already are young 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.309
 the Romans 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.789
 whether he is using the UCI it is much easier 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.789
 Unfortunately, they no longer have ammunition for UBS here 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:06.089
 only automatic pistols and six round revolvers 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.860
 which is certainly positive 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.860
 so have some time 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.830
 the most important is anyone who did not want to see me 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.210
 Carefully spit up more ammo here, it sure helps painkillers somewhere 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.620
 No we do not need 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.080
 can the cool Jost 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.659
 makes and without 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.680
 Sor Iris Menn 7 I do not like this without it 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.659
 I am a colleague here 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.409
 Koch does not seem to want her 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.800
 "Serenade me 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.069
 that also not exactly whether the now her plans are blemishes 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.680
 he should certainly be even if it was pretty close and here I am 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.080
 he spits again 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.849
 Ing is not positive that they still have two opponents on 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.150
 I do not know for sure we should attract her 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.869
 what should - just wait 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.659
 I'm still here 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.780
 on the one hand the good room I have no heating no bed and no 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:17.729
 TV though 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.800
 who quantity Domat ass 40 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.930
 Act 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.800
 Koch also cared for Martin 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.839
 the other 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.839
 King comes kinda good lure we took 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.439
 here I am that can still St 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.009
 He does not want to come then 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:36.529
 not stupid at all the boy 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.869
 not at all call maybe with the bottle 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.189
 neither 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:45.189
 Maunz will swallow two shots 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:48.619
 let's do it that way 

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:50.849
 Erlau Chocolat 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.279
 dapd if he was not a super shot of me super 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.879
 the right time smashed the chest 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:00.699
 third dapd ammunition again 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.069
 TuS changes here but we already want it 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.039
 We do not want the Walldorfer in the first legal system of smugglers 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.499
 wait us 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:13.499
 there will be as well as later sacrifices 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.669
 Nat and that's it 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:25.150
 the ammo is pretty close to the guests who had the kill 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.080
 more and more ammunition than the police who take me up to 100 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.919
 but not tragic is the appointment judge of Oscar 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.339
 too much 

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:38.529
 Not 15 minutes Martin 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:41.689
 This sees cleared shootings they are hiding game 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.229
 but otherwise it all fits around 20 police officers killed Euro Cal 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.500
 a three stars for this the dots i dont know why probably because 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.659
 I gave so many Hatcher ZKE 

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:58.209
 what's appointed to the case of this episode last Okuma we'll see each other then 

00:07:58.209 --> 00:07:59.409
 Joos next time
