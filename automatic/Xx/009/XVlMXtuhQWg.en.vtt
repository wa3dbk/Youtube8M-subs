to go over today is what I think are

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.580 
to go over today is what I think are
some<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.179> best<00:00:09.360> ways<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.690> practice<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
some of the best ways to practice the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.490 
some of the best ways to practice the
guitar<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.950> kind<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.759> advance<00:00:12.000> your<00:00:12.179> plane

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
guitar to kind of advance your plane

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.660 
guitar to kind of advance your plane
I've<00:00:13.500> said<00:00:13.740> before<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.219> biggest<00:00:14.519> problem

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
I've said before the biggest problem

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.109 
I've said before the biggest problem
you'll<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.240> at<00:00:15.450> first<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:17.000> getting<00:00:18.000> your

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
you'll have at first is getting your

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450 
you'll have at first is getting your
fingers<00:00:18.449> hard<00:00:18.750> enough<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.350> actual<00:00:19.920> plane<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
fingers hard enough to actual plane the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.779 
fingers hard enough to actual plane the
individual<00:00:20.939> strings<00:00:21.470> first<00:00:22.470> then<00:00:23.250> knowing

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
individual strings first then knowing

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.490 
individual strings first then knowing
which<00:00:24.119> strings<00:00:24.510> depressed<00:00:24.960> knowing<00:00:25.350> your

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
which strings depressed knowing your

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.599 
which strings depressed knowing your
chord<00:00:25.769> changes<00:00:26.269> free<00:00:27.269> no<00:00:27.990> there<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
chord changes free no there and then the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.170 
chord changes free no there and then the
third<00:00:29.640> thing<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.269> strumming<00:00:30.900> pattern<00:00:31.260> so

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
third thing is strumming pattern so

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.479 
third thing is strumming pattern so
putting<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.390> filing<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> right<00:00:34.350> chords<00:00:34.829> know

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
putting the filing the right chords know

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.549 
putting the filing the right chords know
when<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.850> change<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> chords<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.930> then

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
when to change the chords and then

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.630 
when to change the chords and then
knowing<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> strumming<00:00:38.160> pattern<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.489> going

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
knowing the strumming pattern is going

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
knowing the strumming pattern is going
to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.760> your<00:00:38.879> biggest<00:00:39.059> challenges<00:00:39.980> when

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to be your biggest challenges when

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
to be your biggest challenges when
you're<00:00:41.129> practicing<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:42.360> thing<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.660> would<00:00:42.719> work

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you're practicing one thing I would work

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.700 
you're practicing one thing I would work
on<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.800> work<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:45.090> thing<00:00:45.329> at<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> time

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
on is just work on one thing at a time

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.670 
on is just work on one thing at a time
so<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.980> example<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.450> try<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:49.050> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so for example if you try if you're just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
so for example if you try if you're just
beginning<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.160> play<00:00:50.340> guitar<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.059> flex

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
beginning to play guitar you don't flex

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.270 
beginning to play guitar you don't flex
your<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.809> advance<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.710> you're<00:00:52.829> trying<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
your really advance if you're trying to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.000 
your really advance if you're trying to
learn<00:00:53.489> new<00:00:53.789> chords<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.930> new<00:00:55.079> song<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.770> your

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
strumming pattern that's three things

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.689 
strumming pattern that's three things
you're<00:00:58.079> working<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> you

strumming pattern you're really you the
better<00:02:03.400> question<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:04.000> say<00:02:04.180> what<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.570> the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
better question to say what is the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.880 
better question to say what is the
rhythm<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.680> fast<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.490> slow<00:02:07.290> because<00:02:08.290> if<00:02:08.770> I

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
rhythm is a fast and slow because if I

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.790 
rhythm is a fast and slow because if I
see<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:10.149> all<00:02:10.360> struggling<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.500> all<00:02:11.590> about

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
see is all struggling is all about

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.559 
see is all struggling is all about
timing<00:02:12.190> not<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.850> selling<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.480> or<00:02:13.630> down

so I'll do the first two down strums and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.690 
so I'll do the first two down strums and
they<00:02:30.530> went<00:02:30.740> up<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:30.950> down<00:02:31.040> into<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.490> court
