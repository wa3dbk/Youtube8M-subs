as I go get in it so your coatings are
put<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.490> at<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> substance<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:26.130> come<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
put on at the substance you come to the

put on at the substance you come to the
wall<00:01:29.060> apply<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.119> up

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.290 

now<00:01:40.870> we'll<00:01:41.080> even<00:01:41.320> have<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.880> aggregate<00:01:42.880> so

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
now we'll even have the aggregate so

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.690 
now we'll even have the aggregate so
that<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.660> uniform<00:01:44.320> coverage<00:01:44.550> this<00:01:45.550> is

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
that it's a uniform coverage this is

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.810 
that it's a uniform coverage this is
done<00:01:45.940> by<00:01:46.930> noticing<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:48.340> size<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.730> the

done by noticing the size of the
aggregate<00:01:48.910> heads<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:49.660> down<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.020> poked

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
aggregate heads just down and poked

00:01:50.229 --> 00:02:04.890 
aggregate heads just down and poked
through<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.530> top<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.800> texture<00:02:03.690> now<00:02:04.690> that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
through the top of the texture now that

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.140 
through the top of the texture now that
you've<00:02:05.020> got<00:02:05.200> your<00:02:05.229> coding<00:02:05.880> evenly<00:02:06.880> spread

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
you've got your coding evenly spread

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.870 
you've got your coding evenly spread
across<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.600> section<00:02:08.550> we're<00:02:09.550> going<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> use

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
surface off this will act like a razor

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.100 
surface off this will act like a razor
blade<00:02:14.770> so<00:02:15.370> if<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.670> your<00:02:16.270> texture<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.750> too<00:02:16.959> high

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.560 
blade so if it your texture is too high
in<00:02:17.170> some<00:02:17.440> areas<00:02:17.739> it'll<00:02:18.130> shave<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.570> excess

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
in some areas it'll shave the excess

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:48.220 
in some areas it'll shave the excess
material<00:02:19.989> off

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.400

you're<00:03:28.819> putting<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.180> on<00:03:29.269> as<00:03:29.420> thick<00:03:29.450> as<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
you're putting it on as thick as the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.289 
you're putting it on as thick as the
aggregate<00:03:30.280> until<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.400> aggregate<00:03:31.790> hits<00:03:31.970> show

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
aggregate until the aggregate hits show

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.539 
aggregate until the aggregate hits show
through<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.629> top<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.989> coating<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:33.549> then

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
through the top of the coating and then

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:45.550 
through the top of the coating and then
you<00:03:34.670> start<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.150> finish<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.510> off<00:03:44.230> again<00:03:45.230> once

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
you start to finish it off again once

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.869 
you start to finish it off again once
you<00:03:45.620> start<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:45.980> see<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.340> size<00:03:46.579> of<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
you start to see the size of the

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.420 
you start to see the size of the
aggregates<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:48.260> know<00:03:48.440> you're<00:03:48.590> at<00:03:49.129> the<00:03:49.160> right

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
aggregates you know you're at the right

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.910 
aggregates you know you're at the right
depth<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.930> other<00:03:51.079> thing<00:03:51.290> you'll<00:03:51.440> notice<00:03:51.470> is

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
depth the other thing you'll notice is

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.979 
depth the other thing you'll notice is
that<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.310> because<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.329> aggregate<00:03:53.750> the

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
that the because of the aggregate the

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.920 
that the because of the aggregate the
trail<00:03:54.590> rides<00:03:54.920> over<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.489> top<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.930> the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
trail rides over the top of the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.839 
trail rides over the top of the
aggregate<00:03:57.260> giving<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:58.220> shudder<00:03:58.459> marks

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
aggregate giving the the shudder marks

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.880 
aggregate giving the the shudder marks
though<00:03:59.510> very<00:03:59.810> hard<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:00.170> get<00:04:00.290> out<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.590> the

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
though very hard to get out of the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.920 
though very hard to get out of the
finish<00:04:01.299> when<00:04:02.299> you're<00:04:02.450> finishing<00:04:02.720> it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
finish when you're finishing it

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.140 
finish when you're finishing it
vertically<00:04:03.260> but<00:04:03.500> with<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.680> simple<00:04:04.040> move<00:04:04.250> from

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
vertically but with a simple move from

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.289 
vertically but with a simple move from
left<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.510> right<00:04:06.250> those<00:04:07.250> striations<00:04:08.120> will

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
left to right those striations will

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:32.150 
left to right those striations will
actually<00:04:08.690> form<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.500> way<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.829> trail<00:04:10.069> is<00:04:10.159> going

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.340 

okay<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:32.910> now<00:04:33.120> we've<00:04:33.300> removed<00:04:33.660> most<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
okay so now we've removed most of the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.430 
okay so now we've removed most of the
excess<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:36.240> then<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.900> know<00:04:37.050> you're<00:04:37.230> at<00:04:37.320> the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
excess so then you know you're at the

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.000 
excess so then you know you're at the
right<00:04:37.620> depth

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
right depth

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.180 
right depth
so<00:04:38.700> then<00:04:38.880> you<00:04:39.110> take<00:04:40.110> your<00:04:40.140> polystyrene<00:04:40.830> flow

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
so then you take your polystyrene flow

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.140 
so then you take your polystyrene flow
and<00:04:41.490> right<00:04:42.210> over<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.600> top<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:44.150> create

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
and right over the top of it to create

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:58.850 
and right over the top of it to create
the<00:04:45.780> scratches<00:04:57.230> it's<00:04:58.230> important<00:04:58.650> with<00:04:58.740> this

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
the scratches it's important with this

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.450 
the scratches it's important with this
finish<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.430> keep<00:04:59.610> your<00:04:59.730> trail<00:04:59.970> clean

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
finish that you keep your trail clean

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.890 
finish that you keep your trail clean
all<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.700> time<00:05:02.850> so<00:05:03.210> after<00:05:03.300> every<00:05:03.600> three<00:05:03.810> or

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
all the time so after every three or

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.120 
all the time so after every three or
four<00:05:04.080> watch<00:05:04.260> you'll<00:05:04.440> need<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.710> clean<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:04.980> face

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
four watch you'll need to clean the face

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:22.850 
four watch you'll need to clean the face
of<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.760> avoid<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.510> build-up<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:07.140> to<00:05:07.230> get<00:05:21.860> it

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
of it to avoid the build-up it to get it

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.350 
of it to avoid the build-up it to get it
is<00:05:22.980> important<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.670> stand<00:05:23.910> in<00:05:24.030> front<00:05:24.060> of

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
is important that you stand in front of

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.000 
is important that you stand in front of
where<00:05:24.570> you're<00:05:24.690> working<00:05:24.840> so<00:05:25.710> that<00:05:25.740> your

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
where you're working so that your

00:05:26.010 --> 00:06:41.100 
where you're working so that your
