00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.400
 but according to jessica August 27 also badly I would be in angers to go 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
 to see them stop always wanting that will not change anything 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.820
 what is caress 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 alain spied meaning that is not going very well from this day 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 while it was the raspy tongue we doubt 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
 but do not look like simple 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.420
 here I want telephony that will also delay the handset m but what 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.640
 is the concern for you 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 we go to the match apartment 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.410
 five stars that persist 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.860
 for halo reach is like me the moment 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.850
 and see he still ended up breaking down insurmountable for that 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.850
 see someone who loved the waltz apartment upside down 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.650
 surely not a coincidence 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.280
 you think the murderer knew his way 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.560
 I even suppose that I was looking for something very closely what 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.510
 would provide savings case stay in the apartment two weeks ago 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.110
 he took a large sum of money 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.340
 a neighbor said there was even a parking space for her car 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.510
 cilina busy 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.730
 are you going to launch a search notice for the car no it avoids the 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.730
 soccer 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.020
 how is he 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.540
 not very well yes hello me and explain to them this violence of the storm 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 the big blond of lome 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.349
 l 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.609
 this is really a delicate attention 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.689
 it is necessary to control the entourage of valÃ©rie lemercier to have done all this 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.989
 I was doing lately 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.130
 and especially who were the people attending 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.930
 all that I know 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.330
 it was that he had treated friendship 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.869
 he was a great loner 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.809
 m he had to realize that in his entry attention was 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.199
 an alcoholic is not a criminal 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.709
 I understand that they want to defend only we can not dismiss 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.909
 the hypothesis that he was able to spin a bad cotton after his suspension 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.499
 the man would not be the first time a policeman live dangerously from 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.619
 ill-being not to certainly not pass him 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.619
 I hope you are right 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
 to listen to it we will continue to malaga 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.999
 a horde of wolves 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.859
 stan ocloo of the country year I already feel the first
