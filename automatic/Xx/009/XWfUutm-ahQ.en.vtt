 so consciences register 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.069

 we opt for the free formula 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.310

 and we click on the link he provides here that 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.780
 the authentication went well 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.380
 so we will now go back to the site of 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 cathy of a common point 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080
 and we will identify here with our image 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.650
 and the password that we had bedridden 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.780
 connected 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.420

 the operation takes a little while 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 so we see that the memory that is available to us and of 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.180
 friendliness 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.700
 so much more than enough to host a lot of audio files 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.920
 the file must be in the music folder 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.000
 we can simply right click on this file with the button 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.540

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.170
 published 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.680

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.360
 still here 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.320

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.739
 when we are going to select it with the mouse 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.689
 we do not copy 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.689
 and then we go in a blog post for example 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.389
 here we will place ourselves in html mode 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.909
 we stick 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.899
 in e the code 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.899
 and we publish message 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.179

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.179
 so we have a reader 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.089
 it allows to advance 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:57.739
 clean 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.049
