00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.250
 You know my name is Scarlett and I 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.139
 also has a channel here on youtube that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.049
 It's hos and Scarlett's 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.930
 I am part of the magazine el mundo and today 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.430
 Deleted a really cool video for you 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.029
 on my channel you found videos 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 make-up tutorials and hairstyles 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.990
 of various hair tips 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 mainly about blonde hair as 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.590
 I did to get on that rope and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:41.040
 very cool coming in that there is a touch 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.530
 different for him 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.719
 so I hope you like it 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 easy even though it does not look like when you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.350
 look at the photo but I'm sure 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.610
 I'll do 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.610
 so just keep going 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.650
 Good girls, are you going to need some? 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.490
 thing to give the format in the coke voice 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.070
 qin 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.200
 This one is for herself and for you. 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.080
 find on some sites to sell 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.780
 but if you do not have or do not want 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.190
 you can do these 15 giving 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.960
 a half 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.270
 It's just you get a sock 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.580
 we will not use and cut with a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.490
 scissors in this part where the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.550
 fingers and then it 's just you rolling 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.860
 that way until you make a donut 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.800
 the larger the thicker it was 6 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.020
 will you get your coke to start the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.050
 then just make a tail of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.500
 horse where you will want the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.310
 your coke will get the donut and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.220
 I spend all her hair in the middle of it 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.830
 This way, now, just separate the whole 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.680
 ponytail hair in three parts 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.759
 vertical leaving the middle wick 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.810
 separate 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.509
 for this is just a clamp to hold 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.670
 made the other two wicks to 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.670
 cover as little as possible of the little face 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.090
 then take a rubber band and part by 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.820
 her so that she could learn and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.650
 to give the format of donut only with the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.570
 be careful to leave this stain 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.800
 We had separated out 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.490
 now we are going to use this stain 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.500
 the middle one 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.010
 so just split while the wicks 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.650
 You want me to separate 4 and from 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.020
 of these four marches is to divide each one 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.340
 in three other strands and making 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.410
 braids 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.410
 so I stayed with four kids 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.030
 but you can do as many as you want 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.090
 The more braids you can do 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.100
 your hair better 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.040
 everything will also depend on the quantity 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.950
 of hair you have to learn the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.910
 the transparent elastic bands 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.640
 to be very discreet 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.950
 Just get another rubber band 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.690
 the thinner the logic is the better 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.140
 because it will be easier said with good 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.150
 more discreet will be easy and clean in 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.989
 the coke in the same way as the other 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.550
 Now, it's time to finish the hairstyle. 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.090
 So all that hair that's left in 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.519
 down it's just you winding it did not have 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.930
 because it messes around coke 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.689
 and fastening with clips 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.329
 do not forget to also fixing her 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:35.560
 hair over the donut so she 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.560
 stay on land covered 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.989
 put how much clips you find 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.520
 necessary to ensure the hair more 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.060
 take care that they are well 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.060
 The end result is this. 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.810
 there is a very different touch and at the same 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.030
 time is super easy to do 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.050
 So that's it, folks, I hope you 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.700
