 hello youtube kids I hope that 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.450
 are very very very well today we are in a 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.719
 new video today is not going to be a videoblog 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.849
 normal is going to be an experiment this 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.009
 experiment is called fireballs 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:19.120
 cool the materials that we're going to 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:22.750
 need to be cotton 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.780
 and what is 100% cotton or if not 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.930
 they are going to melt something to cut the 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.930
 thread 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.450
 a lighter a glass of water in case the 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.120
 experiment they get to go out with 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.500
 alcohol and finally something to 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.290
 protect your hands 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.440
 the first step is to make a little ball 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.440
 of cotton roll it up with thread like this 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.030
 rolling the ball 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.280
 let's do 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.970
 a ball with the thread 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.970
 of cotton 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.160
 remember that the thread has to be 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.160
 100% cotton 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.380
 we will cut finer 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 and we will continue winding 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.329
 whatever 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.329
 they will have something like that 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.220
 so this stuffing with the thread 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.420
 the next thing we're going to do is 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.410
 make sure the ball looks good 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.410
 bathed in agreement 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.970
 i 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.990
 once our cotton ball already 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.340
 be well covered with alcohol the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.420
 we will put on a surface 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.200
 then we will wear gloves 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.200
 the protection 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.760
 and we will start 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.770
 Always remember to have the water in case 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.340
 he gets 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.069
 so 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.480
 let's put the lighter 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.920
 and we will tell you 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.430
 and we will have our little ball 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.430
 we will see 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.190
 and if we buy him to pay we will only do 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.190
 this 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.170
 we support it 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.719
 Y 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.140
