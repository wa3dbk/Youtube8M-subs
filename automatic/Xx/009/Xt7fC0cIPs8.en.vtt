 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:12.750
 video tutorial of the magic series to a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.279
 couple of clicks of the blog here come the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.900
 clouds photography in this new video 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.330
 tutorial what we're going to do is create 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.760
 a collage and many of you do not 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.470
 you asked how you can create a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.759
 collage in photoshop and the truth is that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.249
 it's quite simple there are several 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.470
 ways to do it this is not the only 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.220
 there are several ways to do it but let's go 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.810
 to see this because it seems easy to me 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.880
 so let's do it like this here I have 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.800
 open four photographs of these 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.200
 three little boats nothing is a very 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.050
 simple four photographs of tests of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.520
 look depth of field 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.470
 well with these four pictures 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.990
 let's make a collage for example 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.670
 for our blog you are seeing that 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.340
 I have open the four files of 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.980
 the four photographs what are we going to 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.680
 do the first thing I'm going to do is to 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.700
 make my life easier I will see in the menu 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.060
 image in image size to see what 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.580
 size has my photography has a 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.320
 width of 800 pixels and a height of 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:21.460
 530 I know that the body of my blog has 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.500
 a width of 800 pixels and is the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.300
 maximum width I want the maximum width 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 what do I want to put in place for a 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.910
 photography so how do I know I 'm going to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.270
 put these four pictures in a 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.460
 collage in two columns and two rows by 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.750
 what I'm going to do is decrease the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.610
 I'm going to convert it to 400 pixels 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.070
 there it is, I tell you, ok 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.020
 there it is and we go now with the next 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.390
 Photography to do exactly the same 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 I go to the menu image image size 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 400 pixels varies the height also as 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.980
 you are watching because this is here 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.170
 chained I tell him ok and he's already 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.210
 well I will do the same with the other 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.860
 two photographs that I have left and when 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.720
 I have done it to not bore you like 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.420
 you have already seen how it is done so 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.830
 bore them then I'll come back so 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.950
 let's start to assemble it to our collage 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.060
 that you will see that it is simple not 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.650
 very good, I'm back already 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.790
 I have changed the size of all my 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.550
 images here you have them you see we are going to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.220
 do one thing let's open a new 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.650
 document and the first thing we're going to do 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.690
 of course is to tell photoshop the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.930
 measures that you have to have I know that it's going to 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.330
 have 800 pixels in width and height 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.210
 I'm going to put a pretty high 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.700
 big I'm going to do it square 800 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.230
 height pixels also why then 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.000
 because then I'm going to cut back if I 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.620
 There is a lot of room for if I'm sure they're going 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.070
 to fit well all the photos 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.350
 resolution forgiveness 72 pixels per inch 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.270
 because for a screen I do not 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.140
 I do not need anything else for the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.920
 screen of my computer and I already tell 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.170
 photoshop that I created the new document 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.390
 here you are seeing it good because no 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.030
 I have nothing more to bring me 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.160
 photographs that I had open these 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.990
 four that are up here already 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.820
 you know of the different depths of 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.460
 field of the different openings of 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.400
 diaphragm this test then bring me these 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.099
 Photographs 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.140
 take me to the new document that does not 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.879
 we have put a good name is called 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.610
 Without a title, I have not named 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.930
 gone as I do I have selected 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.150
 my tool move which is this 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.250
 little arrow here or if you have 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.590
 another one selected for example this one yes 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.450
 you press the letter v of your keyboard is 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.909
 a keyboard shortcut and has been selected 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.640
 the tool move because I'm going to catch 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.770
 this photograph and 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.069
 Skewer with the tool move in it 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.260
 I'm going to drag it to the new one 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.080
 document that puts without title up to here 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.760
 until this top tab you see it 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.740
 where he puts the name has not yet 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.170
 released the pen that I am using 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.140
 ok with the graphics card I have not 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.580
 released once the new one opens 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.310
 document where I want to put that 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.460
 new photograph under my little arrow up 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.820
 the new document and already loose 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.610
 you are seeing I have only to relocate 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.990
 in the space that I have, as I do 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.350
 want let's go with the next 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:26.360
 photography I will do the same 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.210
 I spike with the tool move me the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.560
 took up the tab where he puts the 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.290
 name of my document and loose is already 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.880
 it's very simple 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.130
 I think there's good no matter what we 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.120
 there is a line a little bit 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.040
 white 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.420
 there is to look at each of the 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.480
 documents each of the photographs 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.140
 that I am opening, they are appearing as 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.910
 new layers you are seeing if I 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.070
 I would like for example to decrease the size 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.430
 from this photograph I can do it now 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.040
 I can do it myself look at me pulse in my 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.890
 keyboard the shift key I put here in 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.720
 the corner and varies the size as I 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.210
 want to be worth in this case because I do not 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.650
 interesting and I want it to have that size 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.390
 original so that all the photographs 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.540
 I think it leaves a little smaller 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.490
 but hey it does not matter and nothing happens 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.400
 you have seen how it is done we go to the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.800
 next picture I do the same 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.580
 my tool move here selected 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.250
 I take it to the tab with the name 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.830
 of the new document dragged again the 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.979
 photography I know you do not see it but 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.580
 is here punctured by and the loose one already 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.620
 is now placed like this if you want 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.720
 move a little bit inside your for 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.880
 place with precision your yours 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.139
 You can picture it moved away with 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.090
 arrows and right now yes with the 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.669
 arrows from my computer as moving 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.830
 a little bit the image so that I stay 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.130
 exactly as it is we are already going by the 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.320
 last picture do the same same 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.550
 process 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.780
 let's put it well 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.180
 the second milestone that has gone away I think 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.729
 even a little bit more here we are going to 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.550
 watch 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.999
 a little bit above a little bit to see 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.479
 let's see a little hello let's see if 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:19.550
 let's see if you want to adjust a 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:23.240
 little bit more then you do not have more than 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.729
 click on the layer that has to 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.210
 contains that image and move it a little bit 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:31.990
 for example here let's see I'm going another 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.990
 time to the last 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.550
 and you want to make it even easier 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.259
 you have to adjust a little bit of this but 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.419
 come on let's do it let's do it 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.970
 let's do it to make it look good there 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.650
 I think that we are going to see, I think 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.710
 that there would be perfectly good 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.539
 you already have the collage done, it's like that 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.699
 of simple the only thing that we would have 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.970
 well you can use this space to 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:58.600
 put a text if you want or take 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.400
 this tool cut out 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.490
 and you start remembering it's true that 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.169
 are the proportions imposed and by 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.969
 that 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:11.489
 it is not removed 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:11.489
 let's adjust it you calculate on itself 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.800
 Nicolae occupies me 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.100
 and that's what I say to photoshop yes 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.930
 and I have already made the collage so 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.910
 easy is later if you want you can open 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.560
 more layers to put text in each 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.570
 of your photos whatever you want 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.520
 but we have already done the collage and so 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.430
 of simple we would only have to export it 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.430
 and use in our blog well 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:41.110
 I hope you liked it and you know 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:44.449
 that we have I have a lot more of 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.610
