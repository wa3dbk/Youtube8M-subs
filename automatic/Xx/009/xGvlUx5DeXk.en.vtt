like<00:01:09.630> two<00:01:10.380> years<00:01:10.710> ago<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> was<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> long

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600 
like two years ago like it was a long
time<00:01:11.939> ago<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:13.110> think<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.100> Instagram

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
time ago I think that's when Instagram

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.730 
time ago I think that's when Instagram
was<00:01:14.790> new<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.570> all<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.810> weird<00:01:16.110> but

like my point was basically that iPhones
would<00:01:21.390> become<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.900> popular<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.159> would

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
would become so popular that there would

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
would become so popular that there would
be<00:01:23.310> no<00:01:23.549> competitors<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.869> even<00:01:25.049> back
