00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.190 
us to do something a lot of guitars you
know<00:02:08.000> they<00:02:08.179> don't<00:02:08.270> really<00:02:08.509> necessarily<00:02:08.720> like

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
know they don't really necessarily like

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.540 
know they don't really necessarily like
the<00:02:09.320> sound<00:02:09.530> because<00:02:09.710> it's<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.890> solid<00:02:10.070> state<00:02:10.520> but

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
the sound because it's a solid state but

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.220 
the sound because it's a solid state but
for<00:02:10.880> bass<00:02:11.090> players<00:02:11.240> it's<00:02:11.780> actually<00:02:12.020> kind<00:02:12.200> of

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
for bass players it's actually kind of

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.960 
for bass players it's actually kind of
Awesome<00:02:12.410> it's<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.070> lower<00:02:13.220> wattage<00:02:13.460> amp<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:13.880> it

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
Awesome it's a lower wattage amp so it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.820 
Awesome it's a lower wattage amp so it
sounds<00:02:14.240> mostly<00:02:14.630> good<00:02:14.870> for<00:02:15.110> recording<00:02:15.410> or<00:02:15.740> in

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
sounds mostly good for recording or in
