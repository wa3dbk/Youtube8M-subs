00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
thought that is it that's where I'm

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.420 
thought that is it that's where I'm
going<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.150> be<00:01:02.090> here's<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.240> huge<00:01:04.100> industry<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
going to be here's this huge industry it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160 
going to be here's this huge industry it
just<00:01:05.640> has<00:01:05.730> a<00:01:05.760> massive<00:01:06.120> impact<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.810> people

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
just has a massive impact on people

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.960 
just has a massive impact on people
whether<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.530> want<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.160> or<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.880> really

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
whether they want it to or not it really

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
whether they want it to or not it really
does<00:01:09.330> shape<00:01:09.570> our<00:01:09.750> values<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:12.500> think<00:01:13.500> there

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
does shape our values that I think there

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
does shape our values that I think there
are<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> ethical<00:01:14.940> issues<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
are a lot of ethical issues with in the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.830 
are a lot of ethical issues with in the
fashion<00:01:16.020> industry<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.970> college<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.540> very

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
fashion industry and the college is very

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.660 
fashion industry and the college is very
concerned<00:01:19.410> about<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.280> think<00:01:20.310> that's

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
concerned about that and I think that's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.280 
concerned about that and I think that's
why<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.090> wanted<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> bring<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.260> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
why they wanted to bring me in as a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.320 
why they wanted to bring me in as a
chaplain<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.460> address<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.150> those

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
chaplain to address some of those

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.350 
chaplain to address some of those
ethical<00:01:24.840> issues<00:01:25.200> within<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.910> student<00:01:26.910> body

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.700 

it's<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.479> interesting<00:01:30.810> angle<00:01:31.350> for<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it's a really interesting angle for the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.320 
it's a really interesting angle for the
college<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.160> report<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.700> when<00:01:32.910> we<00:01:33.060> were<00:01:33.180> told
