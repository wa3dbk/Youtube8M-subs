all<00:00:06.680> right<00:00:06.890> here's<00:00:07.850> the<00:00:07.970> drive<00:00:08.870> mechanism

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
all right here's the drive mechanism

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.570 
all right here's the drive mechanism
finally<00:00:09.980> arrived

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
finally arrived

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.359 
finally arrived
I'm<00:00:10.730> very<00:00:11.120> very<00:00:11.450> excited<00:00:11.629> about<00:00:12.110> this<00:00:12.559> this<00:00:13.309> is

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369 
I'm very very excited about this this is

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.050 
I'm very very excited about this this is
a<00:00:13.629> frigging<00:00:14.629> automations<00:00:15.850> standard<00:00:16.850> than

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
a frigging automations standard than

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.970 
a frigging automations standard than
you're<00:00:17.270> actually<00:00:17.480> heard<00:00:17.900> it's<00:00:18.109> toppled<00:00:18.680> and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
you're actually heard it's toppled and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.179 
you're actually heard it's toppled and
the<00:00:22.000> model<00:00:23.000> that<00:00:23.029> I<00:00:23.210> picked<00:00:23.509> has<00:00:23.810> 150<00:00:24.769> pounds

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
the model that I picked has 150 pounds

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.370 
the model that I picked has 150 pounds
force<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:26.029> read<00:00:26.449> the<00:00:26.599> real<00:00:26.749> the<00:00:26.929> only<00:00:27.140> reason

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
force and read the real the only reason

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.710 
force and read the real the only reason
why<00:00:27.499> I<00:00:27.529> picked<00:00:27.800> that<00:00:27.949> is<00:00:28.220> because<00:00:28.699> it<00:00:29.300> travels

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
why I picked that is because it travels

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.660 
why I picked that is because it travels
at<00:00:30.669> half<00:00:31.669> an<00:00:31.849> inch<00:00:31.999> per<00:00:32.240> second<00:00:32.630> which<00:00:32.780> is<00:00:33.670> like

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
at half an inch per second which is like

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.660 
at half an inch per second which is like
that<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.630> anyway<00:00:35.989> it<00:00:36.380> rolls<00:00:37.070> pretty<00:00:37.280> smooth

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
that and anyway it rolls pretty smooth

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.690 
that and anyway it rolls pretty smooth
and<00:00:37.910> just<00:00:38.360> quickly<00:00:39.320> going<00:00:39.650> straight<00:00:40.070> I<00:00:42.700> don't

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
and just quickly going straight I don't

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.760 
and just quickly going straight I don't
know<00:00:43.940> I'm<00:00:44.000> just<00:00:44.120> gonna<00:00:44.960> back<00:00:45.140> up<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.470> I<00:00:45.590> will

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
know I'm just gonna back up and I will

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.470 
know I'm just gonna back up and I will
be<00:00:48.250> British<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:49.850> that's<00:00:50.090> oh<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:53.000> it's<00:00:53.150> easier

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
be British so that's oh so it's easier

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.390 
be British so that's oh so it's easier
to<00:00:53.510> operate<00:00:54.020> but<00:00:54.350> anyways<00:00:55.090> this<00:00:56.090> is<00:00:56.300> kind<00:00:56.570> of<00:00:56.660> a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
to operate but anyways this is kind of a

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.610 
to operate but anyways this is kind of a
this<00:00:58.400> is<00:00:58.580> about<00:00:58.910> 16<00:00:59.420> inches<00:00:59.450> long<00:01:00.020> it's<00:01:00.560> a

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
this is about 16 inches long it's a

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.850 
this is about 16 inches long it's a
little<00:01:00.860> too<00:01:01.040> too<00:01:01.520> long<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.780> I'm<00:01:03.410> going<00:01:03.560> to<00:01:03.590> I'm

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
little too too long so I'm going to I'm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.340 
little too too long so I'm going to I'm
going<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.100> mount<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.850> angle<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:06.140> that

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
going to mount it in the angle so that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.560 
going to mount it in the angle so that
as<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.560> big<00:01:06.799> stand<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:07.310> can<00:01:07.549> pivot<00:01:07.970> like<00:01:08.299> that

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
as a big stand this can pivot like that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.770 
as a big stand this can pivot like that
and<00:01:08.840> push<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.200> drawer<00:01:09.439> out<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:10.820> needed<00:01:11.299> for<00:01:11.659> it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
and push the drawer out I needed for it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.959 
and push the drawer out I needed for it
to<00:01:11.840> be<00:01:12.079> able<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.409> go<00:01:12.829> out<00:01:13.990> about<00:01:14.990> 14<00:01:15.560> inches

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
to be able to go out about 14 inches

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:23.639 
to be able to go out about 14 inches
like<00:01:16.969> that<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:19.869> actuator<00:01:20.869> actually<00:01:22.270> I

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
like that and this actuator actually I

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.840 
like that and this actuator actually I
did<00:01:24.649> some<00:01:24.829> calculations<00:01:25.579> and<00:01:27.369> it's<00:01:28.369> gonna<00:01:28.609> use

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
did some calculations and it's gonna use

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.389 
did some calculations and it's gonna use
the<00:01:29.450> geometry<00:01:29.659> works<00:01:30.229> out<00:01:30.469> it's<00:01:30.710> gonna<00:01:30.950> when

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
the geometry works out it's gonna when

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.739 
the geometry works out it's gonna when
it's<00:01:31.520> fully<00:01:31.700> extended<00:01:31.969> is<00:01:32.270> going<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.509> give<00:01:32.630> me

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
it's fully extended is going to give me

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:38.469 
it's fully extended is going to give me
about<00:01:32.979> 14<00:01:33.979> inches<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:35.920> extension<00:01:36.920> song<00:01:37.389> so<00:01:38.389> I'm

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
about 14 inches of extension song so I'm

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.300 
about 14 inches of extension song so I'm
going<00:01:38.659> to<00:01:38.689> be<00:01:38.780> mounting<00:01:39.560> this<00:01:39.710> under<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
going to be mounting this under the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.239 
going to be mounting this under the
floor<00:01:41.469> and<00:01:42.469> as<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.340> said<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.969> ends<00:01:44.210> like<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.249> and

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
floor and as I said it ends like so and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:53.469 
floor and as I said it ends like so and
I<00:01:46.759> can't<00:01:47.090> wait<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.329> get<00:01:47.569> started<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:52.299> that's<00:01:53.299> it

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
I can't wait to get started so that's it

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.999 
I can't wait to get started so that's it
for<00:01:53.630> now

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
for now

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.219 
for now
okay<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.159> actuator<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.939> now<00:01:56.149> in<00:01:56.420> place<00:01:56.719> let<00:01:57.139> me

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
okay the actuator is now in place let me

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.520 
okay the actuator is now in place let me
show<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.439> how<00:01:57.799> I<00:01:57.859> mounted<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.990> as<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.319> can<00:02:00.469> see

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
show you how I mounted it as you can see

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.010 
show you how I mounted it as you can see
it's<00:02:00.950> an<00:02:01.159> angle<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:03.829> it<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.329> calculations

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
it's an angle and it it the calculations

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.320 
it's an angle and it it the calculations
were<00:02:06.200> right<00:02:06.469> it<00:02:07.130> actually<00:02:07.549> does<00:02:07.729> extend<00:02:08.209> to

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
were right it actually does extend to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.899 
were right it actually does extend to
the<00:02:10.480> amount<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.780> need<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.430> added<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:13.610> lip

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
the amount that I need I added this lip

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.530 
the amount that I need I added this lip
here<00:02:13.939> to<00:02:14.900> mount<00:02:15.110> this

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
here to mount this

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.670 

bracket<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> actuator<00:02:20.280> hooks<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.850> -

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
bracket that the actuator hooks on -

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.650 
bracket that the actuator hooks on -
this<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.860> kind<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.190> unsightly<00:02:23.940> but<00:02:24.420> there's

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
this is kind of unsightly but there's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.600 
this is kind of unsightly but there's
maybe<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.080> fake<00:02:27.920> I'm<00:02:28.920> going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> cover<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
maybe a fake I'm going to cover the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.450 
maybe a fake I'm going to cover the
front<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.470> something<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.620> looks<00:02:31.830> nicer<00:02:32.250> so

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
front but something that looks nicer so

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.000 
front but something that looks nicer so
it's<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.910> problem<00:02:33.350> well<00:02:34.350> anyway<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.800> goes

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
it's not a problem well anyway it goes

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.120 
it's not a problem well anyway it goes
down<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.550> my<00:02:35.670> power<00:02:35.910> supply<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.130> it's

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
down to my power supply here and it's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.590 
down to my power supply here and it's
working<00:02:38.520> pretty<00:02:38.940> well<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.170> know<00:02:40.470> what

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
working pretty well and you know what

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.350 
working pretty well and you know what
the<00:02:42.600> scammer<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.290> place<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:44.730> give<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.090> guys<00:02:45.330> a

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the scammer in place can give you guys a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.780 
the scammer in place can give you guys a
peek<00:02:45.890> but<00:02:46.890> home<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:48.030> works<00:02:49.370> like<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.430> some
