 you skira tor and this is my 74th edition 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.289
 of cards in minecraft already on November 2 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.529
 me at the moment part of the night 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.339
 motre basically today at 400 but people 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:32.180
 there will be a meeting on my server so 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.670
 shorter join play with 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.289

 Moscow time will be a meeting on 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.770
 server that's the principle with this we 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.570
 figured out let's take a look now 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.269
 our updates 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.809
 well here's the principle still release i 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.870
 built more precisely I have not planted not even me 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.609
 built here is a layer of impact milling cutter so 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.219
 that fritz do us well done 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.559
 car wash on the stand I'm parking here 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.339
 just built and while i'm there of and 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.460
 touched 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.350
 trace we built a car wash well, well 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.020
 I did not have time to get the server later 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.479
 we cut down in response only ticketing 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.329
 ticket date and everything else he built 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.880
 so what we say thanks to him link to 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.820
 you can subscribe in the description here 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.140
 so our car wash looks like this 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.840
 but did not tell me 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.750
 tell about it well here so basically i 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.320
 washing here legends here and interesting 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.250
 in a variety of ways here's the code not 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.490
 interesting image as well here we have 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.670
 Well, the machine here are those on he portrayed 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.360
 the type of machine is always like an icon 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.719
 car wash 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.969
 here I did add an ax for the glasses 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.520
 reliability, we are here with us probably all the same 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.329
 the car drives in like here started 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.230
 and spray it gets wet here 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.900
 car or let us 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.530
 forgot how to brush that brush here that is 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.690
 the car 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.660
 dry or what to do with it 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.350
 I know that the car comes on and here I am 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.600
 on sangamitta 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.000
 I also don't know what they are doing to her 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.090
 he set the funnels here to drop or 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.580
 more precisely well here and maybe I still have to listen 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.980
 I don't even know what the fret can do to her 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.140
 car to drive happy and and to 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.980
 we need to pay to come here this 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.230
 braid 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.180
 here that we have here the director and 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.100
 car wash sits we we of course 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.100
 we pay it all includes there 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.680
 different mechanisms well this principle or 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 first update in my city and to 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.780
 to diversify the issue and in principle 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.640
 built a new zheka forest mountains like this 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.430
 principle to look our new to 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.710
 i'm not even going to copy 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.870
 because he has why when i'm here 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.030
 I have some lags just like 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.830
 uzam canoes native tape well this 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.490
 Of course, there are a lot of pieces of frames and so 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.830
 further here is the principle of such 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.450
 25-story huge building that is 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.140
 probably the tallest residential building in 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.700
 my city 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.560
 Well, by the way, I took the idea from Moscow 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.930
 Jack Sparrow Hills even the name 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.940
 It seems that I wanted the same principle 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.650
 but I did a little wrong there 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.170
 imagination had to do a little bit 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.530
 another well here's a bit like base 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.110
 also there take thy blue-white style and the roof 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.420
 a little different he has a cabin 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.540
 rounded so tidy well here we are 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.790
 I decided not to melt that is in any other already 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.950
 I will do it this way as you see 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.970
 such a jack on the 25 storey 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.110
 here we have four apartments inside 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.060
 Well, by the way the building looks like this 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.640
 not bad and don't write down in the comments on 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.130
 sleep built it good or bad 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.560
 Here we have a blue and white helmets and 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.020
 these are my two favorite colors of their combination 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.490
 the best seems to me a little come on 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.750
 Now let's go inside and see what 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.650
 we have there layouts in each apartment 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.600
 own planning here since our huge 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.700
 the corridor that is, there are two elevators that is 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.120
 one spare break set broken 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.370
 lexion nut do not get into the second spare 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.650
 here we are such windows still have a balcony and where is my 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.110
 there is no situation to see the species 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.450
 I can not smoke against smoking in the city 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.239
 Well, I think you are also against your knees and 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.250
 so well done that's what 's here for you 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.390
 we are from the studio room studied 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.480
 we have a kitchen 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.269
 there is a combined room 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.359

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.669
 bathroom with toilet here us Tubzik himself 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.460

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:30.030
 let's see the next apartment here it is 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.010

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.460
 next apartment to apartment apartment 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.720
 here it is so spacious at least 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.660
 there is only one room 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.820
 Studio pretty spacious but from 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.919
 us kitchen this part of the kitchen can of course 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.710
 stenochku do allow udalat 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.330
 the landlord will do it themselves 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.970
 we are hiding a chair bed dan 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.360
 Basically here we have a bath too 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.820

 turned out with a toilet 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.320
 Well, in principle, and now let 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.900
 let's go up on the roof see what's wrong there 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.790
 how would I have an open roof that is 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.320
 there is a lift well here dolgovato 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.440
 to climb after you type speed 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.330
 elevators although such very fast yes not 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.480
 used seems to me too fast 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:59.590
 lift so okay principle we fly up already 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.970
 here that is such a free exit to 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.100
 you can just admire the roof 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.670
 the kinds of that look these kinds of there 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.640
