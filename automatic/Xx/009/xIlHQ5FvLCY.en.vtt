00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
belts the main thing the first thing our

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.859 
belts the main thing the first thing our
waist<00:00:20.570> built<00:00:23.470> goes<00:00:24.470> down<00:00:24.680> here<00:00:24.860> to<00:00:25.869> relieve

waist built goes down here to relieve

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.390 
waist built goes down here to relieve
pressure<00:00:27.199> from<00:00:27.680> your<00:00:27.860> arms<00:00:30.190> focus<00:00:31.190> on

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
pressure from your arms focus on

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.290 
pressure from your arms focus on
focusing<00:00:32.029> instead<00:00:32.510> of<00:00:32.930> carrying<00:00:33.290> your<00:00:33.620> rig<00:00:34.300> so

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
focusing instead of carrying your rig so

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.680 
focusing instead of carrying your rig so
you<00:00:35.390> should<00:00:35.570> be<00:00:35.780> able<00:00:36.559> to<00:00:36.860> work<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.690> also

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
you should be able to work and also

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.170 
you should be able to work and also
carry<00:00:39.079> that's<00:00:39.950> why<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:40.190> also<00:00:40.550> have<00:00:40.790> these<00:00:40.940> band

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
carry that's why we also have these band

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.170 
carry that's why we also have these band

focus<00:00:44.390> belts<00:00:45.100> we've<00:00:46.100> chosen<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.850> technique

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
focus belts we've chosen the technique

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.740 
focus belts we've chosen the technique
where<00:00:47.510> we<00:00:47.660> use<00:00:48.309> Accord<00:00:49.309> that<00:00:49.579> we<00:00:50.300> put<00:00:50.450> over<00:00:50.570> the

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
where we use Accord that we put over the

lens<00:00:54.200> this<00:00:55.190> rig<00:00:55.430> is<00:00:55.579> seems<00:00:56.090> unique<00:00:56.270> in<00:00:56.629> that<00:00:56.660> it

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
lens this rig is seems unique in that it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.650 
lens this rig is seems unique in that it
has<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:57.290> follow<00:00:57.530> focus<00:00:57.770> units<00:00:58.480> most<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.600> the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
has to follow focus units most of the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.910 
has to follow focus units most of the
others<00:00:59.840> in<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.079> market<00:01:00.410> only<00:01:00.590> have<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.739> single

others in the market only have a single

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.459 
others in the market only have a single
one<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:01.219> can<00:01:01.610> you<00:01:01.670> tell<00:01:01.820> us<00:01:01.850> why<00:01:02.210> that<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.570> yeah

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
well you can either work with a follow

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.900 
well you can either work with a follow
focus<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.200> do<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.530> zooming<00:01:07.460> where<00:01:07.580> your<00:01:07.700> hand

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
focus and do the zooming where your hand

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.100 
focus and do the zooming where your hand
I<00:01:08.210> prefer<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.960> have<00:01:09.229> another<00:01:09.410> one<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:10.250> side

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
I prefer to have another one this side

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.650 
I prefer to have another one this side
and<00:01:12.110> work<00:01:12.979> with<00:01:13.130> them<00:01:13.220> simultaneously<00:01:13.660> what's

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
and work with them simultaneously what's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.719 
and work with them simultaneously what's
the<00:01:14.869> extra<00:01:15.170> bit<00:01:15.319> of<00:01:15.350> metal<00:01:15.619> for<00:01:15.950> does<00:01:16.399> that<00:01:16.550> is

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
the extra bit of metal for does that is

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.960 
the extra bit of metal for does that is
that<00:01:16.910> part<00:01:17.209> of<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.420> rig<00:01:18.069> well<00:01:19.069> here<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.729> have<00:01:19.940> a

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
that part of the rig well here we have a

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.260 
that part of the rig well here we have a
solution<00:01:20.240> for<00:01:20.450> low<00:01:20.690> mount<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:23.830> filled<00:01:24.830> about

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
solution for low mount and filled about

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.109 
solution for low mount and filled about
work<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.599> in<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.990> chameleon<00:01:27.410> way<00:01:27.910> but<00:01:28.910> if

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
work with it in the chameleon way but if

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.300 
work with it in the chameleon way but if
you<00:01:29.270> want<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.660> have<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.929> camera<00:01:30.349> mounted

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
you want to have the camera mounted

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.630 
you want to have the camera mounted
lower<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.959> work<00:01:32.959> with<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.229> monitor<00:01:33.550> you<00:01:34.550> can

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
lower and work with the monitor you can

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.180 
lower and work with the monitor you can
just<00:01:34.910> easily<00:01:35.240> adjust<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.110> height<00:01:36.369> way<00:01:37.369> and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
just easily adjust the height way and

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.370 
just easily adjust the height way and
also<00:01:40.190> direction<00:01:40.640> we<00:01:40.910> won't<00:01:41.149> have<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:41.479> can<00:01:42.259> you

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380

between<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.450> older<00:01:44.750> version<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.200> this<00:01:45.259> new

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
between the older version and this new

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.100 
between the older version and this new
one<00:01:45.709> well<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:46.819> version<00:01:47.209> it's<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.569> bit<00:01:47.720> heavier

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
one well this version it's a bit heavier

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.469 
one well this version it's a bit heavier
but<00:01:49.509> we<00:01:50.509> made<00:01:50.660> it<00:01:50.690> much<00:01:51.380> more<00:01:51.410> steady<00:01:52.479> we've

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
but we made it much more steady we've

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.540 
but we made it much more steady we've
taken<00:01:53.720> away<00:01:53.959> some<00:01:54.289> parts<00:01:54.679> just<00:01:55.099> to<00:01:55.220> make<00:01:55.369> it

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
taken away some parts just to make it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.900 
taken away some parts just to make it
really<00:01:56.619> hold<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.920> mean<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.099> some<00:01:58.459> of<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.700> some

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
really hold I mean a some of that some

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.630 
really hold I mean a some of that some
of<00:01:59.030> our<00:01:59.420> competitors<00:01:59.690> out<00:02:00.229> there<00:02:00.259> they<00:02:01.039> tend

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
of our competitors out there they tend

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.870 
of our competitors out there they tend
to<00:02:01.819> give<00:02:02.300> away<00:02:02.920> but<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.130> we<00:02:04.190> have<00:02:04.399> done<00:02:04.700> them

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
to give away but now we have done them

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.779 
to give away but now we have done them
off<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.229> if<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:06.890> tighten<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.429> it's

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
off so that if you tighten that it's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.630 
off so that if you tighten that it's
really<00:02:08.390> stiff<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:09.709> new<00:02:09.890> metal<00:02:10.190> plate<00:02:10.399> looks
