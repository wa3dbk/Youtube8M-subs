the<00:04:08.220> other<00:04:08.370> thing<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.790> really<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.870> really

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
the other thing I really like and really

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.140 
the other thing I really like and really
quick<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.500> sounds<00:04:11.100> like<00:04:11.250> he<00:04:11.640> didn't<00:04:11.910> go<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.090> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
quick it sounds like he didn't go to a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.970 
quick it sounds like he didn't go to a
seamstress<00:04:12.480> or<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.900> tailor<00:04:13.230> he<00:04:13.560> actually

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
seamstress or a tailor he actually

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.550 
seamstress or a tailor he actually
started<00:04:14.910> sewing<00:04:15.209> some<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:15.810> his<00:04:15.959> own<00:04:16.140> clothing

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
started sewing some of his own clothing

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.960 
started sewing some of his own clothing
which<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:16.980> lot<00:04:17.160> of<00:04:17.250> people<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.700> know<00:04:17.790> they

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
which a lot of people you know they

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.610 
which a lot of people you know they
think<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.450> almost<00:04:18.870> impossible<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.470> it's

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
think is almost impossible but it's

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.770 
think is almost impossible but it's
really<00:04:20.010> not<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:20.940> difficult<00:04:21.150> so<00:04:21.479> if<00:04:21.600> you're

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
really not that difficult so if you're

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.150 
really not that difficult so if you're
out<00:04:21.900> there<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.200> don't<00:04:22.410> have<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.680> whole<00:04:22.950> lot<00:04:23.130> of

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
out there you don't have a whole lot of

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.850 
out there you don't have a whole lot of
money<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.210> always<00:04:24.780> an<00:04:24.960> option<00:04:25.289> just<00:04:25.680> buy

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
money that is always an option just buy

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.030 
money that is always an option just buy
something<00:04:26.250> cheap<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.610> practice

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
something cheap and practice

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.580 
something cheap and practice
on<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:28.000> other<00:04:28.150> thing<00:04:28.480> I<00:04:28.690> think<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:29.050> one<00:04:29.350> is

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
on the other thing I think that one is

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.490 
on the other thing I think that one is
really<00:04:30.400> learning<00:04:30.580> is<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:31.090> every<00:04:31.630> journey<00:04:32.020> of

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
really learning is that every journey of

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.680 
really learning is that every journey of
a<00:04:33.130> thousand<00:04:33.730> miles<00:04:33.850> begins<00:04:34.180> with<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.600> single

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
a thousand miles begins with a single

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.040 
a thousand miles begins with a single
step<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.850> he<00:04:37.240> is<00:04:37.390> building<00:04:37.630> up<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
step and so he is building up the

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.470 
step and so he is building up the
self-confidence<00:04:38.740> at<00:04:39.160> home<00:04:39.430> it's<00:04:39.970> helping<00:04:40.330> him

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
self-confidence at home it's helping him

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.060 
self-confidence at home it's helping him
with<00:04:40.660> his<00:04:40.690> relationships<00:04:41.530> with<00:04:41.650> others

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
with his relationships with others

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.520 
with his relationships with others
others<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:42.940> when<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.480> can<00:04:43.690> do<00:04:43.870> this<00:04:44.080> when<00:04:44.260> you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
others and when you can do this when you

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.250 
others and when you can do this when you
start<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:45.100> feel<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.970> self-confidence<00:04:46.870> all

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
start to feel this self-confidence all

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.410 
start to feel this self-confidence all
of<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.500> sudden<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:47.980> walk<00:04:48.280> differently<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:48.940> it

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
of a sudden you walk differently and it

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.850 
of a sudden you walk differently and it
affects<00:04:49.810> so<00:04:50.050> many<00:04:50.230> other<00:04:50.380> parts<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:50.770> your

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
affects so many other parts of your

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
lives and I'm really excited for one

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.870 
lives and I'm really excited for one
because<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.080> think<00:04:53.140> this<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.890> great<00:04:54.550> skill<00:04:54.820> to

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
because I think this is a great skill to

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.670 
because I think this is a great skill to
have<00:04:54.970> in<00:04:55.090> an<00:04:55.300> early<00:04:55.690> point<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:56.230> mean<00:04:56.470> look<00:04:56.620> how
