this glider so just north you run up

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.849 
this glider so just north you run up
this<00:00:57.239> ramp<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.710> come<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.280> Ram<00:01:00.829> take<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
this ramp as you come to this Ram take a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.730 
this ramp as you come to this Ram take a
left<00:01:08.180> cross<00:01:09.180> over<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.810> stream

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
left cross over this stream

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.830 
left cross over this stream
and<00:01:12.189> we<00:01:12.340> see<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.850> ramp<00:01:13.090> here<00:01:13.360> right<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.570> front

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
and we see the ramp here right in front

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:23.899 
and we see the ramp here right in front
of<00:01:13.930> us<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.380> go<00:01:14.500> back<00:01:14.649> up<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:15.070> our<00:01:15.189> right

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.440 

as<00:01:24.539> we<00:01:24.810> come<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.320> ramp<00:01:25.590> you'll<00:01:25.950> see<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:27.179> on

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
as we come up this ramp you'll see up on

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.459 
as we come up this ramp you'll see up on
the<00:01:27.569> hill<00:01:27.719> in<00:01:28.109> front<00:01:28.319> of<00:01:28.469> us<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.880> glider<00:01:30.469> so

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
the hill in front of us is the glider so

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.870 
the hill in front of us is the glider so
I'm<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> cross<00:01:31.950> over<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.399> little<00:01:32.640> land

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
I'm going to cross over this little land

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.050 
I'm going to cross over this little land
bridge<00:01:33.179> and<00:01:34.039> go<00:01:35.039> up<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> our<00:01:35.340> left<00:01:35.609> and<00:01:35.759> run<00:01:35.939> up

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
bridge and go up to our left and run up

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:51.050 
bridge and go up to our left and run up
on<00:01:36.179> the<00:01:36.299> rock<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.530> our<00:01:49.560> flags<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.399> later

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
on the rock and see our flags and later

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370 
on the rock and see our flags and later
on<00:01:51.240> walks<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.719> running<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.109> from<00:01:52.289> this

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
on walks will be running up from this

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.469 
on walks will be running up from this
different<00:01:52.950> direction<00:01:53.369> based<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.179> where<00:01:54.390> we

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
different direction based on where we

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.709 
different direction based on where we
end<00:01:54.599> up<00:01:54.689> landing<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.539> at<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
end up landing so here we are at the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.929 
end up landing so here we are at the
glider<00:01:58.909> and<00:02:00.319> the<00:02:01.319> first<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.860> we're<00:02:02.789> going<00:02:02.879> to

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
glider and the first one we're going to

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.830 
glider and the first one we're going to
go<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:04.909> on<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.239> little<00:02:06.299> island<00:02:06.539> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
go for is just on a little island you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.839 
go for is just on a little island you
can<00:02:07.020> actually<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.349> the<00:02:07.649> glider<00:02:07.890> hanging<00:02:08.729> out

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
can actually see the glider hanging out

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:23.300 
can actually see the glider hanging out
there<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:10.470> steam<00:02:10.799> little<00:02:11.039> supplies<00:02:22.160> here<00:02:23.160> we

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
there so steam little supplies here we

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.410 
there so steam little supplies here we
go

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.970 

so<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.840> easy<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.739> you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
so that's the easy one and you

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.759 
so that's the easy one and you
essentially<00:02:29.569> if<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.750> grab<00:02:31.019> this<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.530> can

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
essentially if you grab this you can

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.100 
essentially if you grab this you can
jump<00:02:32.430> off<00:02:32.640> into<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.060> water<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.629> I'll<00:02:33.900> be

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
jump off into the water and I'll be

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:51.470 
jump off into the water and I'll be
running<00:02:34.319> up<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:36.480> left<00:02:36.810> there<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:51.030> not<00:02:51.330> up

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
running up to the left there and not up

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.660 
running up to the left there and not up
we<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.049> our<00:02:52.170> flag<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.739> that's<00:02:52.860> how<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.099> can

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
we see our flag and that's how we can

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
we see our flag and that's how we can
run<00:02:53.849> back<00:02:54.030> up<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.390> our<00:02:54.510> glider<00:02:55.879> okay<00:02:56.879> now<00:02:57.299> we're

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
run back up to our glider okay now we're

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.780 
run back up to our glider okay now we're
going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.870> actually<00:02:58.049> go<00:02:58.440> get<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.010> elite<00:02:59.459> that

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
going to actually go get the elite that

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.280 
going to actually go get the elite that
on<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> map<00:03:00.180> was<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> right<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.080> us

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
on the map was just to the right of us

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.390 
on the map was just to the right of us
these<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.640> entrance<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:04.400> underneath

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
these the entrance to it is underneath

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.130 
these the entrance to it is underneath
the<00:03:05.459> waterfall<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.390> can<00:03:06.510> only<00:03:06.569> get<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.989> it

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the waterfall but you can only get to it

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.140 
the waterfall but you can only get to it
using<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> glider<00:03:07.950> essentially<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.060> to

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
using the glider essentially going to

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.120 
using the glider essentially going to
lose<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.360> little<00:03:09.569> bit<00:03:09.720> altitude<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.980> can

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
lose a little bit altitude and you can

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.250 
lose a little bit altitude and you can
see<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.310> cave<00:03:11.670> entrance<00:03:12.120> there's<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.170> little

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
see the cave entrance there's a little

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.890

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.960 

okay<00:04:23.420> back<00:04:23.690> at<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.930> glider<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:25.520> tree

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
okay back at the glider and this tree

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.480 
okay back at the glider and this tree
directly<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.630> front<00:04:26.660> of<00:04:26.990> us<00:04:27.170> is<00:04:27.380> actually<00:04:27.980> what

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
directly in front of us is actually what

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.930 
directly in front of us is actually what
contains<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.900> hidden<00:04:30.230> stash<00:04:30.760> hiding<00:04:31.760> up<00:04:31.850> in

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
contains the hidden stash hiding up in

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.230 
contains the hidden stash hiding up in
the<00:04:32.060> tree<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:33.260> one's<00:04:33.500> quite<00:04:33.920> a<00:04:33.980> pain<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:35.090> get

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
the tree this one's quite a pain to get

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.490 
the tree this one's quite a pain to get
to<00:04:35.480> took<00:04:35.750> me<00:04:35.900> several<00:04:36.170> tries<00:04:38.500> essentially

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
to took me several tries essentially

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.870 
to took me several tries essentially
have<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.740> lose<00:04:39.890> enough<00:04:40.100> altitude<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.790> you

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
have to lose enough altitude and you

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.370 
have to lose enough altitude and you
need<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.120> come<00:04:41.330> at<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.630> from<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.960> opposite

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
need to come at it from the opposite

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.420 
need to come at it from the opposite
direction<00:04:42.500> that<00:04:42.950> we<00:04:43.040> started<00:04:43.400> at<00:04:43.580> and

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
direction that we started at and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.390 
direction that we started at and
essentially<00:04:46.430> try<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.880> land<00:04:47.090> in<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.390> tree<00:04:48.400> and

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
essentially try to land in the tree and

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.850 
essentially try to land in the tree and
there<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.640> can<00:04:49.700> see<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.970> hidden<00:04:50.180> stash<00:04:50.860> so

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
there you can see the hidden stash so

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.140 
there you can see the hidden stash so
that's<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.160> for<00:04:52.190> all<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.580> treasures<00:04:52.760> and

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
that's it for all the treasures and

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.060 
that's it for all the treasures and
elites<00:04:53.390> for<00:04:53.630> this<00:04:53.750> glider<00:04:54.050> check<00:04:54.800> out<00:04:54.950> my

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
elites for this glider check out my
