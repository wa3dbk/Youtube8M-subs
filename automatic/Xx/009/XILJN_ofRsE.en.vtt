driving<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.780> our<00:00:33.870> way<00:00:34.020> from<00:00:34.050> Marin<00:00:34.590> Cilic<00:00:34.860> off

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
driving on our way from Marin Cilic off

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.400 
driving on our way from Marin Cilic off
school<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.730> came<00:00:35.940> across<00:00:36.090> shame<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.110> shrines

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
school we came across shame and shrines

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.580 
school we came across shame and shrines
which<00:00:38.220> is<00:00:38.490> a<00:00:38.550> traditional<00:00:39.060> culture<00:00:39.600> yeah<00:00:39.840> they

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
which is a traditional culture yeah they

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.229 
which is a traditional culture yeah they
believe<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.220> walk<00:00:41.400> around<00:00:41.580> a<00:00:41.790> three<00:00:41.970> times

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
believe if you walk around a three times

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.380 
believe if you walk around a three times
and<00:00:43.160> put<00:00:44.160> something<00:00:44.580> on<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> shrine<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.060> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and put something on the shrine that you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.120 
and put something on the shrine that you
will<00:00:45.630> it<00:00:45.870> will<00:00:46.080> bring<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.350> luck<00:00:46.380> and<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> will

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
will it will bring you luck and it will

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.940 
will it will bring you luck and it will
solve<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.430> problems

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.530 

we<00:00:51.950> stopped<00:00:52.220> at<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.399> lake<00:00:52.640> along<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:53.030> way<00:00:53.180> and

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
we stopped at a lake along the way and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.500 
we stopped at a lake along the way and
we<00:00:54.290> had<00:00:54.380> lunch<00:00:54.559> there<00:00:54.950> and<00:00:55.220> we<00:00:55.399> saw<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.910> huge

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
we had lunch there and we saw this huge

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.990 
we had lunch there and we saw this huge
food<00:00:56.989> of<00:00:57.170> horses<00:00:57.590> more<00:00:58.160> than<00:00:58.340> any<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.699> us<00:00:58.790> had

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
food of horses more than any of us had

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.670 
food of horses more than any of us had
ever<00:00:59.150> seen<00:00:59.329> before<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.470> that<00:01:00.650> was

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
ever seen before so that was

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.500 
ever seen before so that was
breathtaking<00:01:01.070> like<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:01.970> then<00:01:02.210> they<00:01:02.300> can't

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
breathtaking like and then they can't

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.119 
breathtaking like and then they can't
string<00:01:02.780> for<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.050> water<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:03.470> we<00:01:03.559> got<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.920> look

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
string for the water and we got to look

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:27.760 
string for the water and we got to look
at<00:01:04.250> them<00:01:04.400> watch<00:01:05.119> them<00:01:05.330> play<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:05.659> everything

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.130 

after<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.579> really<00:01:28.820> tested<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:29.750> water<00:01:29.960> in

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
after that really tested the water in

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.370 
after that really tested the water in
the<00:01:30.259> lake<00:01:31.060> I'm<00:01:32.060> measuring<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.600> pH<00:01:32.869> of<00:01:33.020> his

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
the lake I'm measuring the pH of his

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.190 
the lake I'm measuring the pH of his
lake<00:01:33.729> most<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.030> lies<00:01:35.210> can<00:01:35.540> survive<00:01:35.869> only

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
lake most of the lies can survive only

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.289 
lake most of the lies can survive only
at<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.830> PHS<00:01:37.250> between<00:01:38.140> 6.9<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.470> 8.2<00:01:40.100> we<00:01:40.820> found

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
at the PHS between 6.9 and 8.2 we found

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.719 
at the PHS between 6.9 and 8.2 we found
that<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.659> pH<00:01:41.990> was<00:01:42.289> nine<00:01:42.740> point<00:01:43.039> four<00:01:43.340> which<00:01:43.520> is

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
that the pH was nine point four which is

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.240 
that the pH was nine point four which is
quite<00:01:44.000> alkaline<00:01:44.509> we<00:01:45.320> also<00:01:45.500> tested<00:01:45.979> for<00:01:46.039> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
quite alkaline we also tested for the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.399 
quite alkaline we also tested for the
conductivity<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:47.330> we<00:01:47.750> found<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.259> was

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
conductivity and we found that it was

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.700 
conductivity and we found that it was
very<00:01:48.560> salty<00:01:48.920> we<00:01:49.880> should<00:01:50.179> measure<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.750> pH<00:01:51.350> of

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
very salty we should measure the pH of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.070 
very salty we should measure the pH of
the<00:01:52.039> lake<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.909> we're<00:01:53.270> missing<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.630> salt<00:01:53.869> and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
the lake and we're missing the salt and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.340 
the lake and we're missing the salt and
the<00:01:54.140> conductivity<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.039> then<00:01:55.700> we're<00:01:55.850> going<00:01:56.030> to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
the conductivity and then we're going to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.450 
the conductivity and then we're going to
talk<00:01:57.350> about<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:57.830> see<00:01:58.070> how<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.280> affects

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
talk about it and see how that affects

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.830 
talk about it and see how that affects
environments<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.600> life<00:01:59.780> on<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> lake<00:02:04.840> so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
environments and in life on the lake so

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.169 
environments and in life on the lake so
after<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.140> few<00:02:06.229> more<00:02:06.590> hours<00:02:06.799> drive<00:02:07.190> we<00:02:07.850> arrived

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
after a few more hours drive we arrived

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.570 
after a few more hours drive we arrived
at<00:02:08.390> Lake<00:02:08.630> Hoffs<00:02:08.959> code<00:02:09.229> which<00:02:09.799> was<00:02:09.979> absolutely

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
at Lake Hoffs code which was absolutely

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.400 
at Lake Hoffs code which was absolutely
breathtaking<00:02:10.959> coming<00:02:11.959> from<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> terrain

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
breathtaking coming from the terrain

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.559 
breathtaking coming from the terrain
we've<00:02:12.680> been<00:02:12.799> driving<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.489> to<00:02:14.060> arrive<00:02:14.330> and

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
we've been driving in and to arrive and

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.050 
we've been driving in and to arrive and
it's<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.799> amazingly<00:02:16.459> fast<00:02:16.760> like

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
it's like this is amazingly fast like

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.390 
it's like this is amazingly fast like
coveted<00:02:17.510> forest<00:02:17.900> which<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.440> incredible<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.250> we

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
coveted forest which is incredible so we

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.479 
coveted forest which is incredible so we
met<00:02:19.970> our<00:02:20.090> horses<00:02:20.390> late<00:02:21.019> evening<00:02:21.410> we<00:02:22.190> all<00:02:22.280> came

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
met our horses late evening we all came

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.920 
met our horses late evening we all came
from<00:02:22.700> different<00:02:22.790> parts<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.450> world<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.870> we

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
from different parts of the world and we

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.050 
from different parts of the world and we
were<00:02:24.019> very<00:02:24.380> excited<00:02:24.769> to<00:02:24.890> see<00:02:25.069> this<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.430> we

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
were very excited to see this and we

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.789 
were very excited to see this and we
found<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.360> incredible<00:02:26.959> view<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:27.650> just

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
found this incredible view it's just

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.160 
found this incredible view it's just
like<00:02:27.950> gigantic<00:02:28.670> mess<00:02:28.819> with<00:02:29.000> water<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.420> it's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
like gigantic mess with water and it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.160 
like gigantic mess with water and it's
like<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.709> mirror<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.840> can't<00:02:33.019> make

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
like a mirror and you can you can't make

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.360 
like a mirror and you can you can't make
a<00:02:33.200> difference<00:02:33.560> within<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.920> sky<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.310> the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
a difference within the sky and the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.600 
a difference within the sky and the
water<00:02:34.489> it's<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.150> amazing
