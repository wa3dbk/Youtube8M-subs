00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.120
 well i'm going to be a popular one again 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.200
 tests show that 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.050
 take an exam 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.180
 take it 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:23.590
 soon everyone will know this piece of road 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.590
 If you already have lessons 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.110
 we are going later 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.390
 after the bridge turn right to the bridge 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.390
 right to the center 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.520
 very good so it is wise to have them in time 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.390
 go back to the right everything on the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 bridge to the right must be too late 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.800
 he already sees the center signs 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.090
 to show up 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.450
 You stay faster that it's good 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.829
 So keep 70 continue to drive 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.829
 our time afterwards 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.040
 when do you go with 70 each 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.640
 well that really is a bend were good 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.030
 for brakes and back to his crit 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030
 have to go 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.050
 well it's about the piece that we 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.100
 drive back but just very much 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.650
 pay attention 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.710
 I'll show you soon 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.600
 you go left and the examiner goes often 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.050
 left to get there somewhere and assignments 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 do so with you so the reverse assignment 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.430
 often you are often going to see it on the right or 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.800
 left and will need to be more Christ 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.880
 said nothing we are going left here 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.430
 of course you equate an equivalent 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.840
 cross that you should pay attention to 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.100
 if you go right then you have you 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.000
 the cycle path rai of course also whole 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.770
 well i need operation in this case 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.259
 turn left 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.729
 he sees that here is a dead end so she will 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.539
 you here the reverse command in this 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.369
 to get to the street 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.300
 well you may also do the reverse assignments 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.920
 going to do 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.430
 moment 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.260
 well and then in various options 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.240
 look especially on the left 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.220
 where the possibilities are 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.460
 they are everywhere from rides where you can 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.460
 turn around 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.790
 now it is also a very good one 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.010
 left and right in reverse to 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.610
 right out if you still twisted 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.440
 to make 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.990
 of course always go there preferred 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.569
 looking forward to dance and this is also a big one 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.670
 good possibility 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.409
 continue to look around you frequently 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.409
 both left and right and behind 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.330
 and we'll run it for a while before you 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.170
 drive away also look around you first 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.550
 out 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.220
 also the right side for cyclists who 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.890
 could catch up here and then we go 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.590
 away and possibly with direction 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.150
 increase know 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.190
 to the point I want to leave you 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.660
 which is very important to it 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.720
 exam 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.280
 to the cells they usually go right 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.580
 here comes the point where I experience it 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.600
 no about level or good to show 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.770
 naturally beautiful overview on here 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.819
 line can be seen on the road tasty 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.620
 roll it with that good that plate here 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.330
 you can actually already see two about this 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.209
 one hundred meters and motorway 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.560
 son very careful to this 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.960
 are motorways of course with a 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.840
 lane when you go away on a car 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.690
 but in this case well i will leave that 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.370
 see 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.050
 extra days the sign seems to be of priority 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.360
 therefore give no influence at all 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.830
 flows so it's super dangerous 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.980
 so here a really quiet must go 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.360
 put in advance good look 9 of the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.100
 10 times a million stops 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.520
 a few times you can drive on once 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.220
 yes it needs a lot of space there and then 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.710
 indeed going as a tasty man 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.480
 by pulling and do of course must 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.590
 you after checking gentlemen 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.590
 I look where those cars are 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.100
 and then we turn left 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.660
 do not be seduced by the same 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.730
 left lane because here 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.850
 his two lanes to the left look 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.740
 but on the plates 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.360
 unless you have a truck or a 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.910
 very long line of cars child and places the 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.230
 take the left lane and then the 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.700
 narina the traffic light back to 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.300
 go right 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.849
 yes important look this back 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.019
 often back for your exam because you 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.570
 company operating regularly 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.570
 copy thorium 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.570
 good luck
