00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.240
 the process that led to this 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.100
 exposure it was to do the most 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.790
 big video game show and 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.750
 especially an exhibition with two 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.750
 different steps 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.960
 a step for the real players 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.930
 real gamers give them nostalgia 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.830
 with a retro gaming party is a 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.960
 approach a little generalization and 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.730
 of democratization of the game world 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.780
 video for the general public for those who 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.199
 do not necessarily know 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.580
 this world there so they start with the 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.949
 first video game console that alas 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.320
 magnavox odyssey that was invented 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.390
 by an absolute genius who will be called lbp 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.760
 am then so we have pretty much in 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.699
 this area there in the past part we have 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.350
 about 350 playable machines so that's 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.180
 not at all intellectual it's just on 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.970
 try games like that in advance we 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.250
 time and then we go into the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.810
 future area will have a glimpse of what 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.860
 can be the future with the glasses 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.540
 virtual reality 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.360
 it's a very big exhibition with 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.030
 4800 square meters which is the most 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.940
 big exhibition 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.940
 of the type of the story for now 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.820
 yes so I'm here a little to replay 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.369
 rediscover some games so I'm 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.770
 stumbled upon I fell on a love 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.430
 of childhood so pes6 I came for 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.540
 schmidt for all three sides I think 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.610
 even if I am a little bit more 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.289
 attracted by the talk by the future 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.060
 speaks through the games that are who are going 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.810
 to do the techno that will come and the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.230
 games that will happen 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.010
 I think 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.990
 it's still a good time 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.850
 share with the pals the retro lots 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.900
 it's like we started the advice 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.270
 we had when we were younger 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.560
 so that's something that is who and who 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.990
 We always takes guts yet 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.160
 when we see each other at the start, they tell me 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.410
 given carte blanche 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.660
 I made my list and then we saw 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.660
 who is is findable or not knowing 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.510
 that vp as it is not the first expo 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.870
 they do on the video game 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.290
 there has already been an exhibition especially at 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.519
 big palace 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.390
 in the context of paradisio cinema and 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.219
 vpcom has a long history 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.500
 of a day really worked on 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.810
 the video game history we already have a 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.909
 announcing who can be done is 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.430
 we will have the final fantasy creator 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:51.969
 sakaguchi who will come on July 4th to 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.030
 we will meet the public will not have 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.500
 badly of big Japanese creators who 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.840
 will pass for the duration of the exhibition 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.900
 we will preview some very games 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.950
 important that are going to be so it's a 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.540
 little later unfortunately I can 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.920
 not say it but orange dish is present 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.439
 so to the video game story of course for 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.639
 accompany this cultural event 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.170
 the idea is that we ordered in the 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.730
 future area we wanted to show a 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.290
 little this use that is happening 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.519
 including playstation is in the process of 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.620
 get started with the playstation home 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.090
 we already started to make the cloud 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.470
 gaming at two so today you 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.299
 can start your party on TV 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.430
 there continue on your pc or your mac 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.780
 it's already life here and soon 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.609
 with 4g or she went on 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.720
 the tablet and the mobile we show it 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.329
 already on the stand you can come 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.129
 test old games ps3 games 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.329
 of ps4 pc games that turns 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.069
 today in the cloud at home in 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.900
 normandy so store the biggest 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.579
 datacenter of rock and you can 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.260
 so also play all these games in 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.549
 multi player obviously I have not had 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.319
 the younger opportunity to play on 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.000
 arcade terminals or very very little 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.439
 there we still find games on 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.300
 which we played we scoured a 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.560
 little bit younger but 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.540
 No, I have not had the time yet 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.610
 to really go around and ask me 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.350
 more on the terminals 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.400
 there are plenty of games 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.850
 there are plenty of games we want 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.640
 try 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.890
 we still have time for that so of this 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.410
 side there it's going to be a big party 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.530
 a big living room with a lot of things to 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.530
 see 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.290
 the agent already knew a big heritage 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.750
 then down it's simple what's missing 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.750
 we were to find him in places 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.940
 where there are old games either 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.759
 game cash with whom we have a partnership 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.970
 whether it decides to sell it either 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.280
 we finally followed the step that 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.289
 can have any passionate and 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.180
 any game collectors 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.479
 video already i hope that's going theirs 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.330
 please 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.639
 they will appreciate a lot and say it 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.139
 you 2 feel like it looks 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.130
 to please for now according to the 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.900
 first testimonials 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.479
 for now we are stuck it's hard 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.620
 to advance when there is so much game here 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.389
 I think everyone is moving forward and we 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.680
 is alone to have stayed but no one is going 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.100
 continue we will see them what is there 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.050
 the other side 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.000
 for a first edition really needs 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.940
 must really come to discover the games 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.190
 video really video game youth 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.510
 I hope they will come sufficiently 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.880
 many to make one more 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.940
 bigger and bigger the year 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.070
 next 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.410
 and here I hope especially that people 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.370
 are going to be happy to come happy to 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.370
