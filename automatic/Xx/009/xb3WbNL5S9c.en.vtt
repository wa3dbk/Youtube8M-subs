00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.050 

okay<00:00:00.840> so<00:00:00.900> when<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.650> first<00:00:02.040> moved<00:00:02.250> in<00:00:02.460> here<00:00:02.490> it

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay so when I first moved in here it

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.390 
okay so when I first moved in here it
had<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> standard<00:00:03.810> Honeywell<00:00:04.529> programmable

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
had a standard Honeywell programmable

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.800 
had a standard Honeywell programmable
thermostat<00:00:05.940> you've<00:00:06.120> probably<00:00:06.330> seen<00:00:06.629> this

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
thermostat you've probably seen this

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.690 
thermostat you've probably seen this
before<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.200> set<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.589> time<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:08.370> set<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
before you set the time you set the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.370 
before you set the time you set the
temperature<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.389> then<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.019> leave<00:00:10.320> it

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
temperature and then you leave it

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.830 
temperature and then you leave it
problem<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.519> don't<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.210> very<00:00:12.480> regular

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
problem is I don't have a very regular

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.810 
problem is I don't have a very regular
schedule<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.830> heat<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.099> coming<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.490> many

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
schedule so the heat was coming on many

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.550 
schedule so the heat was coming on many
times<00:00:15.059> when<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> wasn't<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.289> was<00:00:16.410> off

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
times when I wasn't here and it was off

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
times when I wasn't here and it was off
and<00:00:16.740> off<00:00:16.890> when<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> wanted<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.609> be<00:00:17.760> warm<00:00:17.970> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and off when I wanted to be warm I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.570 
and off when I wanted to be warm I
replaced<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> Honeywell<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.520> is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
replaced the Honeywell with this this is

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.439 
replaced the Honeywell with this this is
the<00:00:21.180> nest<00:00:22.220> programmable<00:00:23.240> thermostat<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the nest programmable thermostat and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.330 
the nest programmable thermostat and
this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.080> fantastic<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.890> first<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.250> all<00:00:26.279> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
this is fantastic now first of all I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
this is fantastic now first of all I
have<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.550> tell<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.970> am<00:00:27.449> no<00:00:27.720> handyman<00:00:28.410> but

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
have to tell you I am no handyman but

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.259 
have to tell you I am no handyman but
the<00:00:28.920> nest<00:00:29.160> comes<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.609> everything<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.240> need

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the nest comes with everything you need

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.250 
the nest comes with everything you need
to<00:00:30.720> transfer<00:00:31.650> from<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.630> nest<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to transfer from this to the nest and in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.870 
to transfer from this to the nest and in
fact<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.649> very<00:00:34.860> easy<00:00:35.130> there's<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> few

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
fact it's very easy there's just a few

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.420 
fact it's very easy there's just a few
wires<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.750> most<00:00:37.079> cases<00:00:37.440> thermostats<00:00:38.280> are

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
wires in most cases thermostats are

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400 
wires in most cases thermostats are
low-power<00:00:38.940> devices<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.989> don't<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
low-power devices so you don't have to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
low-power devices so you don't have to
worry<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:40.649> electrocuting<00:00:41.340> yourself<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
worry about electrocuting yourself and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.369 
worry about electrocuting yourself and
it's<00:00:42.149> pretty<00:00:42.329> easy<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> wires<00:00:43.230> just

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it's pretty easy to get the wires just

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.889 
it's pretty easy to get the wires just
right<00:00:43.739> nest<00:00:44.190> makes<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.579> extra<00:00:45.000> easy<00:00:45.180> though<00:00:45.570> by

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
right nest makes it extra easy though by

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.600 
right nest makes it extra easy though by
giving<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.320> installation<00:00:46.860> kit<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.460> not

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
giving you an installation kit that not

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
giving you an installation kit that not
only<00:00:47.730> has<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.450> screws<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.140> parts<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
only has all the screws and parts you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.830 
only has all the screws and parts you
need<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.129> even<00:00:50.309> has<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> screw<00:00:51.059> driver<00:00:51.270> with

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
need it even has a screw driver with

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.150 
need it even has a screw driver with
four<00:00:52.140> different<00:00:52.469> bits<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.100> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
four different bits it's kind of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.410 
four different bits it's kind of
something<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> might<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> keep<00:00:54.239> around

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
something you might want to keep around

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
something you might want to keep around
they<00:00:55.020> also<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.469> labels<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.010> stick<00:00:56.309> on

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
they also have labels you can stick on

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.939 
they also have labels you can stick on
the<00:00:56.550> wire<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.570> color<00:00:57.949> for

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the wire so you get the right color for

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.220 
the wire so you get the right color for
each<00:00:59.160> wire<00:00:59.489> it<00:01:00.059> couldn't<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.629> easier<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
each wire it couldn't be easier to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
each wire it couldn't be easier to
install<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> nest<00:01:01.949> once<00:01:02.460> you've<00:01:02.609> installed

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
install the nest once you've installed

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
install the nest once you've installed
it<00:01:03.239> you'll<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> plate<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.229> looks<00:01:04.530> kind

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it you'll have a plate that looks kind

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.010 
it you'll have a plate that looks kind
of<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.700> these<00:01:06.210> are<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.510> different

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
of like this these are the different

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.960 
of like this these are the different
colored<00:01:07.290> wires<00:01:07.590> nest<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.430> capable<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
colored wires nest is capable of

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.399 
colored wires nest is capable of
handling<00:01:09.150> both<00:01:09.420> air<00:01:09.659> conditioning<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
handling both air conditioning and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.469 
handling both air conditioning and
heating<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.549> heating<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.119> so

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
heating I just have heating here so

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
heating I just have heating here so
they're<00:01:12.630> fewer<00:01:12.930> wires<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.770> very<00:01:14.070> simple

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
they're fewer wires it's very simple

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.390 
they're fewer wires it's very simple
notice<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.180> nest<00:01:15.450> base<00:01:16.409> plate<00:01:16.770> has<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> level

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
notice the nest base plate has a level

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
notice the nest base plate has a level
built<00:01:17.790> into<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.270> makes<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> easy<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.110> get

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
built into it which makes it easy to get

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
built into it which makes it easy to get
it<00:01:19.409> level<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:20.130> also<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.030> don't

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it level and they also have you don't

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.520 
it level and they also have you don't
have<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> use<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.080> did<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:22.470> case

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
have to use this I did in my case

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.100 
have to use this I did in my case
because<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> large<00:01:23.790> plate<00:01:24.450> behind<00:01:24.689> my

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
because I have a large plate behind my

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.800 
because I have a large plate behind my
old<00:01:25.470> thermostat<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.369> larger<00:01:27.060> plate<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> cover

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
old thermostat a larger plate to cover

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.899 
old thermostat a larger plate to cover
that<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> nice<00:01:28.920> installation<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that up so it's a nice installation the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.359 
that up so it's a nice installation the
nest<00:01:30.119> itself<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.439> beautiful<00:01:31.740> thin

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
nest itself is just this beautiful thin

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.300 
nest itself is just this beautiful thin
little<00:01:32.850> device<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.420> plug<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.259> right<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.130> it

interesting things on setup the first

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
interesting things on setup the first
thing<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.479> attach<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> nest<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.470> your

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
thing you do is attach the nest to your

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.460 
thing you do is attach the nest to your
Wi-Fi<00:01:44.250> network<00:01:44.310> yes<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.299> has<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.720> built-in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470

Wi-Fi network yes it has a built-in
Wi-Fi<00:01:46.799> receiver<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.090> nest<00:01:48.329> uses<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
Wi-Fi receiver the nest uses that to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.530 
Wi-Fi receiver the nest uses that to
communicate<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.180> find<00:01:51.420> out

communicate with you and to find out
what<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> local<00:01:52.140> weather<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
what the local weather is so that it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340 
what the local weather is so that it
doesn't<00:01:53.820> turn<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.119> heat<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.659> hot<00:01:54.899> day<00:01:55.140> or

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
doesn't turn the heat on on a hot day or

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.679 
doesn't turn the heat on on a hot day or
the<00:01:55.710> air<00:01:55.829> conditioning<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> cold<00:01:57.149> day<00:01:57.420> it

the air conditioning on on a cold day it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.780 
the air conditioning on on a cold day it
actually<00:01:58.049> knows<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.799> temperature<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
actually knows what temperature it is it

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
actually knows what temperature it is it
also<00:02:00.000> has<00:02:00.299> motion<00:02:00.750> sensors<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> knows<00:02:01.680> when

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
also has motion sensors so it knows when

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
work here for a while so it knows some

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.119 
work here for a while so it knows some
things<00:02:21.330> about<00:02:21.480> my<00:02:21.750> habits<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.890> for

instance knows that it's going to turn
the<00:02:25.260> heat<00:02:25.440> down<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:26.159> 10:30<00:02:26.700> when<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.269> bed

and I want to turn it up before I get
home<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.889> can<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.489> as<00:03:29.669> well

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
home I can do that as well

building a new home even that's still
more<00:04:11.519> expensive<00:04:11.910> than<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.090> regular<00:04:12.120> thermostat

it's a lot of money money you probably

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.979 
it's a lot of money money you probably
won't<00:04:19.079> make<00:04:19.320> up<00:04:20.239> except<00:04:21.239> maybe<00:04:21.449> over<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.719> few

won't make up except maybe over a few

but it does it is really cool the design
is<00:04:26.669> beautiful
