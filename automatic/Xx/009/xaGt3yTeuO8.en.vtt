00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.769
 hi everyone is falling apart i hope 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.199
 that you're fine 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.340
 for me it's going great I'm not 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.660
 not in the company of natsu for this 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.050
 video because he does not even know that I 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.099
 let's do it as you know 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.439
 I am a Call of Duty player 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.320
 so I obviously buy black 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.360
 ops 2 and I found with a friend mathieu 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.220
 already sealed mathieu we found a 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.870
 spot a little spot kick both launched 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.850
 for 20 tomahawk and now we 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.589
 learn to this omoc pact on ay jacked in 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.510
 R &amp; D which obviously walking on 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.710
 other game modes so I had just 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.600
 want to share with you that so we 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.989
 will already first look at how one 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.230
 so we place ourselves 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.649
 this side we are going in the corner 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.460
 just in this blog in the corner 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.609
 then I will show you a little 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.390
 a little bit as we launch how 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.910
 lens the tomahawk 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.800
 so you see so I put a line 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.630
 red to show that we have to put 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.240
 the Moroccan auto as to the decline to the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.250
 tomahawk sign made right in the middle 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.259
 at the middle level of the window 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.830
 worried that is embedded that the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.259
 arrows so you ride with the round 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.570
 blue there I tell you in this 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.780
 species of black clouds so there is 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.070
 pierced the breakthroughs here are some 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.630
 places we can see the blue sky 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.400
 behind and so has the blue round 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.740
 indicates a place we see blue sky 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.880
 that is, it's a hole in 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.189
 holes in the cloud 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.200
 this will be your landmark face and 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.689
 mine anyway so you go you 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.899
 put your tomahawk lair in it 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.850
 in this corner in will be there so you and 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.350
 still put a red line 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.090
 on the left we would count red 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.259
 horizontal to give you pretty much 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.900
 an idea of ​​the height compared to 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.490
 the antenna that is on the mark so 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.680
 it's simple once you have 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.360
 do that you run your tomahawk 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.090
 so me I raise those second who 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.890
 will touch and so you're going to have to in 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.580
 have right now what thomas is doing 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.080
 convoy that passes over the boat and 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.420
 he arrives in a corner so he arrives 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.340
 left side disunited who as a corner 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.170
 who is really really busy so 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.280
 I 'm going to throw a little rock 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.050
 two enemies are past but I want 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.600
 to say if we manage to launch quickly the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.550
 tomahawks one can I think years returned 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.410
 two so it's a spot that is really 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.670
 super interesting that I hope that 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.940

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.360
