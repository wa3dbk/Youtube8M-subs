00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
whose heart beats and then my mom and my

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.650 
whose heart beats and then my mom and my
sisters<00:00:50.860> got<00:00:51.070> into<00:00:51.430> making<00:00:51.730> necklaces<00:00:52.420> so

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
sisters got into making necklaces so

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.640 
sisters got into making necklaces so
they<00:00:52.810> had<00:00:52.990> a<00:00:53.020> lot<00:00:53.200> of<00:00:53.230> beads<00:00:53.530> -<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:56.079> beads

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
they had a lot of beads - like beads

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.840 
they had a lot of beads - like beads
like<00:00:56.860> this<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:59.050> if<00:00:59.290> you<00:00:59.620> don't<00:00:59.920> have<00:01:00.160> any<00:01:00.489> beads

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
like this so if you don't have any beads

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.450 
like this so if you don't have any beads
then<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.870> would<00:01:02.050> look<00:01:02.200> for<00:01:02.530> plastic<00:01:03.220> beads

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
then I would look for plastic beads

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.710 
then I would look for plastic beads
because<00:01:03.640> they're<00:01:03.910> going<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.150> be<00:01:04.269> cheaper

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
because they're going to be cheaper

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.340 
because they're going to be cheaper
different<00:01:05.590> shapes<00:01:05.860> in<00:01:06.869> different<00:01:07.869> colors<00:01:08.200> it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.780 
to the green heart and this bangle and
then<00:02:44.230> there's<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.560> one<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:44.980> guy<00:02:45.250> that

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
then there's this one that guy that

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.990 
then there's this one that guy that
starts<00:02:46.090> with<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.270> pink<00:02:46.510> heart<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.310> goes<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
green bean with the blue bangle so then

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.620 
green bean with the blue bangle so then
I<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:52.690> tied<00:02:53.050> them<00:02:53.200> together

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.520 

and<00:02:59.410> then<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.040> got<00:03:00.250> another<00:03:00.850> one<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.530> another

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and then I got another one and another

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.370 
and then I got another one and another
one<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.220> had<00:03:03.460> four<00:03:03.730> total<00:03:04.150> I'm<00:03:04.840> not<00:03:04.990> sure<00:03:05.200> how

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
one so I had four total I'm not sure how

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.410 
one so I had four total I'm not sure how
long<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.860> ends<00:03:06.220> up<00:03:06.280> being<00:03:06.580> maybe<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:10.090> six

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
long it ends up being maybe like six

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.110 
long it ends up being maybe like six
feet<00:03:10.720> maybe<00:03:11.050> because<00:03:12.040> it's<00:03:12.190> taller<00:03:12.430> than<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.700> am

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
feet maybe because it's taller than I am

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.570 
feet maybe because it's taller than I am
you're<00:03:13.750> going<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.960> want<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.200> get<00:03:14.380> about<00:03:14.980> six<00:03:15.400> of

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
you're going to want to get about six of

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:23.040 
you're going to want to get about six of
them<00:03:15.790> or<00:03:16.830> maybe<00:03:17.830> more

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.690 

so<00:03:24.050> before<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.530> tied<00:03:24.980> them<00:03:25.130> together<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.610> just

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
so before I tied them together I just

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.530 
so before I tied them together I just
kept<00:03:26.120> them<00:03:26.300> as<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.860> put<00:03:28.040> them<00:03:28.220> across

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
kept them as this and I put them across

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.300 
kept them as this and I put them across
the<00:03:29.540> bed<00:03:29.750> because<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.170> had<00:03:30.500> bunk<00:03:30.800> beds<00:03:31.040> with<00:03:31.190> my

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
the bed because I had bunk beds with my

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.370 
the bed because I had bunk beds with my
roommate<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.510> just<00:03:32.660> put<00:03:32.810> them<00:03:32.900> across<00:03:33.020> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
roommate so I just put them across the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.540 
roommate so I just put them across the
bed

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.200 

but<00:03:38.240> then<00:03:38.590> when<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.620> didn't<00:03:39.920> have<00:03:40.100> bunk<00:03:40.550> beds<00:03:40.700> I

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
but then when I didn't have bunk beds I

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
but then when I didn't have bunk beds I
cut<00:03:41.600> them<00:03:41.810> on<00:03:41.840> my<00:03:42.170> door<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:43.280> this

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.199 

so<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.260> tied<00:03:52.590> them<00:03:52.799> together<00:03:52.980> if<00:03:53.489> they're<00:03:53.969> six

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
so I tied them together if they're six

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.569 
so I tied them together if they're six
feet<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:55.290> would<00:03:55.560> fit<00:03:55.980> most<00:03:56.810> fit<00:03:57.810> into<00:03:58.019> most

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
feet that would fit most fit into most

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.789 
feet that would fit most fit into most
doorways<00:03:59.579> and<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.659> think<00:04:00.840> most<00:04:01.019> doorways<00:04:01.290> are

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
doorways and I think most doorways are

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.369 
doorways and I think most doorways are
at<00:04:01.890> eight<00:04:02.519> feet<00:04:02.819> tall<00:04:03.060> maybe<00:04:03.719> ten<00:04:04.019> I'm<00:04:04.260> not

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
at eight feet tall maybe ten I'm not

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.849 
at eight feet tall maybe ten I'm not
sure<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:06.329> then<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.930> want<00:04:07.109> them<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.409> be<00:04:07.560> able<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
sure so then you want them to be able to

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.949 
sure so then you want them to be able to
move<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.879> don't<00:04:09.060> want<00:04:09.180> them<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.510> be<00:04:09.629> dragging

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
move you don't want them to be dragging

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.729 
move you don't want them to be dragging
on<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.109> floor<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:11.099> these<00:04:11.310> little<00:04:11.609> hooks

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
on the floor I have these little hooks

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.310 
on the floor I have these little hooks
there<00:04:13.739> from<00:04:14.010> 3m<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:15.720> got<00:04:15.900> them<00:04:16.109> from

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
there from 3m and I got them from

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.760 
there from 3m and I got them from
Michael's<00:04:16.829> also<00:04:17.509> so<00:04:18.509> you<00:04:18.539> just<00:04:18.900> on<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.250> top<00:04:20.250> of

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
the Strand just make a loop like that

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:37.480 
the Strand just make a loop like that
and<00:04:29.330> then<00:04:30.330> just

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.090 

hook<00:04:38.030> it<00:04:38.150> on

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
hook it on

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.360 
hook it on
and<00:04:40.190> then<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:41.000> can<00:04:41.320> get<00:04:42.320> double-sided<00:04:43.010> tape

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
and then you can get double-sided tape

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.510 
and then you can get double-sided tape
and<00:04:43.610> it'll<00:04:44.150> come<00:04:44.360> with<00:04:44.480> the<00:04:44.630> hooks<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.130> get

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
and it'll come with the hooks so you get

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.110 
and it'll come with the hooks so you get
double-sided<00:04:47.120> tape<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:47.750> just<00:04:48.850> stick<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:50.030> on

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
double-sided tape and just stick it on

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.410 
double-sided tape and just stick it on
