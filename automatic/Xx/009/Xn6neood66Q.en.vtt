open and all the ones that I have and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.170 
open and all the ones that I have and
most<00:01:23.259> noticeably<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:24.280> think<00:01:24.700> you'll<00:01:24.850> find<00:01:25.060> that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
most noticeably I think you'll find that

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.380 
most noticeably I think you'll find that
a<00:01:25.299> lot<00:01:25.359> of<00:01:25.719> them<00:01:25.869> come<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.320> this<00:01:26.500> silver<00:01:26.829> and

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
black screen printed on silver design so

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.219 
black screen printed on silver design so
it's<00:01:31.030> like<00:01:31.180> black<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.450> white<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.960> don't<00:01:32.140> get

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229
