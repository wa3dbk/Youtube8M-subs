when I got this Bluetooth headset it was
only<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.200> cable<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:17.770> you're<00:02:17.890> gonna<00:02:17.980> have<00:02:18.160> to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
only the cable so you're gonna have to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.660 
only the cable so you're gonna have to
supply<00:02:18.550> your<00:02:18.610> own<00:02:18.930> power<00:02:19.930> break<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.550> it's

supply your own power break but it's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.160 
supply your own power break but it's
pretty<00:02:21.790> simple<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.360> just<00:02:22.510> plugs<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.930> small

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
pretty simple it just plugs in the small

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.440 
pretty simple it just plugs in the small
hole<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.670> bottom<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> Bluetooth

hole on the bottom of the Bluetooth
headset<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:27.250> takes<00:02:27.430> about<00:02:27.550> two<00:02:27.850> hours<00:02:27.880> to

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.180 
headset and it takes about two hours to
charge<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.290> not<00:02:29.470> too<00:02:29.620> bad<00:02:29.770> for<00:02:30.130> how

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
that the Jabra is easier to talk on

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.759 
that the Jabra is easier to talk on
because<00:02:48.189> the<00:02:48.280> mic<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.670> closer<00:02:48.939> to<00:02:49.060> your<00:02:49.269> mouth
