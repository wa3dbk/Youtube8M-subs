00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.109
 hello look if you want to send bubbles to 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.929
 aquarium background 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.629
 you do not need bubble bomb with the 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.599
 pump with the purifying pump or it serves 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:20.710
 You take a tube and graffiti pinholes 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:25.470
 here you see it like this 200 holes in the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.470
 I found the shape of the handle 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.670
 to the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.420
 to figure 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.420
 in water 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.160
 around here take a breath 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.579
 and transforms it into bubbles 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.810
 you are going to see it you see it go down so that you see 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:50.510
 down the effect that makes 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.629
 of the bubbles the tube 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.190
 down to the bottom of the aquarium not 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.190
 I need bubble bomb 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 there you see them 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.080
 is going to bring us a little 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.210
 there you see them 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.210
 at the bottom of the aquarium 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.530
 that way gorrÃ¡iz light and the bomb of 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.479
 bubbles because I once one and it 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.640
 damaged and on top is enough light and 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.220
 this form took advantage of the strength of the water 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.770
 of the treatment plant 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.340
 with the tube doing as I've seen two 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.470
 drills in the curve and that way they are 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.210
 of 15 millimeters the study for this 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.100
 for this tube size if it's more 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.360
 fat the tube so fatter the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.570
 holes if you can put on the elbow 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.310
 a stopcock to put the air 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.190
 you want that way you can graduate 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.730
 and send the maximum bubbles to the bottom 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.730
 of the aquarium 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.120
 see you later
