 Internal memory is how you can 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.369
 realize it takes up a bit more than three 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.520
 gigabytes 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:57.700

 time of use that marks enough of 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.830

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.900

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.170
 treating brings none is a problem 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.260

 looks that the entrance to the card does not 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.549
