hair<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.429> three<00:00:29.760> times<00:00:30.090> before<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:31.050> came<00:00:31.289> even

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
hair for three times before it came even

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.240 
hair for three times before it came even
as<00:00:32.630> light<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.989> my<00:00:34.050> eyebrows<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.040> mean<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
as light as my eyebrows I mean I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.880 
as light as my eyebrows I mean I
literally<00:00:35.640> did<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:37.350> layer

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
literally did not think one like layer

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.860 
literally did not think one like layer
of<00:00:38.250> bleach<00:00:38.760> would<00:00:40.160> get<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.250> hair<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.550> light

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
of bleach would get my hair this light

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.510 
of bleach would get my hair this light
but<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.020> did<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.730> why<00:00:46.520> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
but it did so that is kind of why it
