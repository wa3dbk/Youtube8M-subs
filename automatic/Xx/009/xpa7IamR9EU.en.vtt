that<00:03:31.799> with<00:03:31.890> formula<00:03:32.310> too<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:33.359> mean<00:03:33.510> water

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
that with formula too and I mean water

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.289 
that with formula too and I mean water
is<00:03:33.840> fine<00:03:33.989> i<00:03:34.049> used<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.530> towards<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.920> end<00:03:35.070> but

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
is fine i used it towards the end but

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.599 
is fine i used it towards the end but
like<00:03:36.299> well<00:03:36.660> obviously<00:03:36.989> now<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.609> okay

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
don't even carry anything but um like

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.949 
don't even carry anything but um like
formula<00:03:42.209> i<00:03:42.239> don't<00:03:42.420> know<00:03:42.480> if<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.600> can<00:03:42.720> freeze

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
formula i don't know if you can freeze

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.710 
formula i don't know if you can freeze
formula<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.040> can<00:03:44.280> then<00:03:44.760> there<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.570> go

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
formula but if you can then there you go

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.330 
formula but if you can then there you go
or<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.500> could<00:03:46.620> just<00:03:46.650> make<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:46.890> really<00:03:47.010> thick

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
or you could just make it really thick

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.620 
or you could just make it really thick
and<00:03:47.549> dilute<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.910> with<00:03:47.940> formula<00:03:48.420> or<00:03:48.600> breast

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
and dilute it with formula or breast

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.050 
and dilute it with formula or breast
milk<00:03:49.079> when<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.320> go<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.470> feed<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.060> what's

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
milk when you go to feed it so what's

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.420 
milk when you go to feed it so what's
another<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.480> big<00:03:51.690> reason<00:03:52.079> why

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
another really big reason why

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.240 
another really big reason why
