00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
a headphone port on the bottom I'm

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.479 
a headphone port on the bottom I'm
guessing<00:02:20.910> there's<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:21.390> small<00:02:21.690> hole

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
guessing there's just that small hole

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.460 
guessing there's just that small hole
for<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.519> microphone<00:02:24.120> then<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.319> see

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
for a microphone then if you can see

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.610 
for a microphone then if you can see
that<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:27.620> Samsung<00:02:29.299> Galaxy<00:02:30.299> S<00:02:30.420> has<00:02:31.049> only<00:02:31.379> one
