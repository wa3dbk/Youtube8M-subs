00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.900
 hello people mac g4 from mcnabb studios 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.449
 I warmly welcome you to one 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.750
 new hardware review today is about 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.190
 the razer deathadder gaming mouse that is 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.590
 a mouse has been doing this a long time 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.960
 Successful on the market, this is here 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.260
 the 20 13 versions so the whole new 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.670
 version compared to the old version 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.609
 razer the dpi number almost doubles up 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:41.750
 insane 6400 dpi the mouse comes with 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.760
 five freely assignable buttons and me 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.680
 grab the mouse now I like it 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.530
 the design is very good there as a consistent 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.320
 For one thing, there are keys 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.000
 the player does not play the mouse as planned 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.440
 hand lying on it but rather the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.200
 mouse claws have the synonymous there 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.309
 which can also relax and use 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.690
 Japan again from what everything is in it 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.089
 I will take care of the design 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.080
 I like the team 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.430
 packed again 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.330
 Yes 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.330
 the out 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.369
 look what's in it 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.310
 and who might not unpack 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.009
 few data the mouse weighs about 105 grams 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.640
 need two meters ten usb mouse cable 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.310
 appropriate 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.229
 You can see the lighting available 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.539
 is regulate 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.079
 So off on then there are from 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.700
 razer own driver who does not 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.490
 only for mice is responsible and for 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.259
 keyboards et cetera and in this one 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.140
 you can just razer the whole razer 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.880
 Devices that one has control and that it 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.319
 also an advantage of everything 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.000
 Under one roof if you just gamer 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.000
 Here is the guide 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.670
 I like that very much 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.939
 is made very valuable 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.259
 here you can see the cable first I was 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.060
 the first times very surprised how 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.429
 that on tight I thought it would be the same 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.709
 a standard issue is extremely easy 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.720
 and that's just because it just 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.310
 there is no normal copper cable 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.680
 just a fiber optic cable for the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.470
 data transmission is used and just 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.850
 also should be faster 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.090
 Both then we will do the mouse here 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.090
 Out 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.459
 kind of coat with something like that 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.459
 a kind of fabric 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.460
 and that in the edition hardly live 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.950
 has its own weight, it also pulls the 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.870
 Do not wonder if that's any problem 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.990
 desks walking direction pcs 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.090
 cable and yes that's out of that are 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.319
 the two sides feel the one for the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.719
 thumb has 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.920
 a funny area here 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:59.560
 really extremely long feels very good 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.359
 in that latching mouse wheel here you can 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.700
 the hand nice hang up relatively large 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.709
 Hands of the designer I am very much 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.129
 is done like it very much stands 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.329
 also the economic downside like 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:15.129
 said is optical sensor infrared and 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.739
 yes I install it now, too 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.000
 and take a look at the software and 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.040
 shows you what you are there 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.700
 can adjust and then I still do 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.660
 a little rio with pleasure to do so 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.790
 that's what the mouse says who sees here 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.980
 you can find different profiles here 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.630
 choose to save with the lot 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.910
 You can also do that with the game 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.350
 can connect with the exe-file like that 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.100
 the button assignment accordingly 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.020
 can change 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.070
 Here you can see the mouse speed 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.750
 choose the x-axis and that helps for the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.300
 Turn off the lights 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.580
 and if you have a house with you can 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.690
 that you set razer mouse place 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.070
 can with their own profile 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.960
 be selected 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.810
 and yes you can also markus 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.190
 program for the keys and 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.770
 different processes just on one button 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.430
 lay down and record on each and that 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.320
 you get them here 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.450
 cc very nice off can be wonderful 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.130
 adjust to the needs 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.780
 update yourself and here you can 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.260
 play out more travel products 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.260
 choose 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.700
 this is the mouse, finally 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.650
 connected with the pulsating 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.660
 Snakes are on it and I give it 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.700
 only from my colleagues tim alias throw 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.810
 the battlefield 3 with the razer 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.810
 deathadder has played 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.129
 what is your first impression of that? 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.220
 The mouse is lying and radial of the hand 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:47.650
 No 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:51.570
 always to grab the keys are but 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.570
 she moves is extremely narrow 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.590
 or obstacle spreads the waves ok 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.020
 and so from a hand size okay 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.420
 So perfect for my hand 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.430
 in hand can hang beautifully the 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.270
 index fingers are showing and middle finger 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.270
 that perfect 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.120
 so and also my colleague dominik aka 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.860
 be either the mouse keys he probably 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.080
 already owner is one of the culprits 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.100
 from razer and he also likes it 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.240
 will also be a few 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.919
 words to say 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.460
 and then I'll be right back 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:43.350
 a final conclusion for mouse with it almost 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.650
 what do you think you yourself possess 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:51.030
 a list of the mouse razer that jezt 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:55.460
 tracker from you are pleased I very 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.300
 recommend on the optical mouse 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.419
 attitudes that you can stop 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.780
 very diverse for us actually 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.800
 to earn 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.510
 Son, I can not only do that 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.380

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.850
 all concerned 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.590
 the one that really is highly 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.940
 Precisely because I'm not just sugar 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.580
 but now also now 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.590
 cut my videos with it and my 3d 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.540
 animations prepared et cetera das 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.760
 whole can be wonderful and fast 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.150
 operate and also the software has me 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.550
 totally convinced and big plus point is 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.900
 just the ingenious cable the it 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.450
 made is really great 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.100
 So I'm excited about the mouse and 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.780
