00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
played in those songs and which are the
chords<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> could<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.140> played<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.680> which

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
chords you could have played and which

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.770 
chords you could have played and which
of<00:01:41.520> course<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.909> couldn't<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.360> played<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
of course you couldn't have played and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.630 
of course you couldn't have played and
things<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.140> hopefully<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:44.399> find

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
things like that hopefully you will find

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.249 
things like that hopefully you will find
these<00:01:44.759> lessons<00:01:45.149> interesting<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.049> go

these lessons interesting and as we go

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.230 
these lessons interesting and as we go
along<00:01:46.350> I'll<00:01:46.740> post<00:01:47.310> more<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:47.880> lessons

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
along I'll post more and more lessons

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.899 
along I'll post more and more lessons
based<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.689> suggestions<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.350> feedback

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
based on your suggestions and feedback

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.899 
based on your suggestions and feedback
so<00:01:50.909> coming<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.799> basic<00:01:53.220> rules<00:01:53.460> now

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
so coming now to the basic rules now

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.959 
so coming now to the basic rules now
there<00:01:54.899> are<00:01:54.990> three<00:01:55.259> rules<00:01:55.470> which<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
there are three rules which I think you

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.380 
there are three rules which I think you
should<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.780> aware<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.820> in<00:01:59.820> order<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.299> able

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
should be aware of in order to be able

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.770 
should be aware of in order to be able
to<00:02:00.540> pick<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:00.869> course<00:02:01.200> easily<00:02:02.420> even<00:02:03.420> without

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
to pick up course easily even without

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
to pick up course easily even without
these<00:02:04.110> rules<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.710> still<00:02:04.950> manage<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.250> do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
these rules you can still manage to do

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980 
these rules you can still manage to do
it<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> lot<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.090> practice<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.869> know

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it with a lot of practice and you know

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.510 
it with a lot of practice and you know
training<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.530> year<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.369> so

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
training your year and so on and so

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.630 
training your year and so on and so
forth<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.539> will<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.750> nice<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> can

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
forth but it will be nice if you can

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.490 
forth but it will be nice if you can
and<00:02:10.819> these<00:02:10.970> rules<00:02:11.440> they<00:02:12.440> were

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
and these rules they were

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.410 
and these rules they were
straightforward<00:02:12.950> first<00:02:13.790> thing<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.240> must

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
straightforward first thing is you must

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.390 
straightforward first thing is you must
know<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.680> key<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> song<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.250> not

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
know the key of the song and this is not

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.210 
know the key of the song and this is not
easy<00:02:19.730> for<00:02:20.150> beginners<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.530> once<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.860> start

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
easy for beginners but once you start

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.610 
easy for beginners but once you start
getting<00:02:22.550> used<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.990> playing<00:02:23.990> cards<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
getting used to playing cards and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.120 
getting used to playing cards and
playing<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.160> songs<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:26.150> know<00:02:26.180> by<00:02:27.140> year<00:02:27.560> what

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
playing with songs you know by year what

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.100 
playing with songs you know by year what
is<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.340> key<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.480> don't<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.959> know<00:02:30.050> you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
is the key and if you don't you know you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.320 
is the key and if you don't you know you
can<00:02:30.350> always<00:02:30.470> check<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.790> internet<00:02:32.150> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
can always check and on the internet and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.030 
can always check and on the internet and
do<00:02:32.420> research<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.020> be<00:02:33.140> able<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.380> find<00:02:33.650> out<00:02:33.830> at

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
do research and be able to find out at

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.580 
do research and be able to find out at
least<00:02:34.459> initially<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.200> know<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.350> get

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
least initially so that you know you get

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.990 
least initially so that you know you get
used<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.890> those<00:02:37.070> different<00:02:37.430> patterns<00:02:37.550> and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
used to those different patterns and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.630 
used to those different patterns and
then<00:02:38.540> going<00:02:38.750> forward<00:02:39.200> once<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.220> listen<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.550> a

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
then going forward once you listen to a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.800 
then going forward once you listen to a
song<00:02:40.880> even<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:41.330> you've<00:02:41.450> never<00:02:41.600> heard<00:02:41.750> it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
song even if you've never heard it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.430 
song even if you've never heard it
before

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
before

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.720 
before
you<00:02:42.770> would<00:02:42.920> find<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.280> you'll<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.520> able<00:02:43.610> to

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
you would find that you'll be able to

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.699 
you would find that you'll be able to
pick<00:02:43.850> up<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.060> key<00:02:44.209> very<00:02:44.390> easily<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:45.290> by<00:02:45.440> key<00:02:45.680> I

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
pick up the key very easily so by key I

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.150 
pick up the key very easily so by key I
mean<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.640> first<00:02:46.940> note<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.810> scale<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
mean the first note of the scale so the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.250 
mean the first note of the scale so the
song<00:02:49.340> could<00:02:49.519> be<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:49.820> seed<00:02:50.209> could<00:02:50.570> be<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.720> c-sharp

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
song could be in seed could be a c-sharp

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.750 
song could be in seed could be a c-sharp
it<00:02:51.500> could<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.769> in<00:02:51.890> tea<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.400> on<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.640> so

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
it could be in tea and so on and so

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.860 
it could be in tea and so on and so
forth<00:02:52.970> as<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.180> know<00:02:53.269> there<00:02:53.390> are<00:02:53.480> twelve<00:02:53.690> notes

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
forth as you know there are twelve notes

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.190 
forth as you know there are twelve notes
so<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.120> know<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.420> key<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.780> song<00:02:56.989> it

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
so if you know the key of the song it

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.590 
so if you know the key of the song it
will<00:02:57.290> make<00:02:57.440> things<00:02:57.650> much<00:02:57.920> more<00:02:58.190> easier<00:02:58.600> the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
will make things much more easier the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.270 
will make things much more easier the
second<00:03:00.230> thing<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.500> need<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.860> know<00:03:01.040> is

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
second thing that you need to know is

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.060 
second thing that you need to know is
the<00:03:01.580> scale<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.450> by<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.440> key<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.800> scale

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
the scale so by so the key and the scale

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.910 
the scale so by so the key and the scale
are<00:03:04.190> frequently<00:03:04.580> used<00:03:05.739> interchangeably<00:03:06.739> but

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
are frequently used interchangeably but

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.890 
are frequently used interchangeably but
they're<00:03:07.070> not<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.310> same<00:03:07.489> things<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.570> scale

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
they're not the same things so the scale

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.530 
they're not the same things so the scale
is<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:10.010> series<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.519> notes<00:03:10.850> which<00:03:11.150> are

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
is the the series of notes which are

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.009 
is the the series of notes which are
used<00:03:11.930> for<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.800> song<00:03:13.209> typically<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.420> song<00:03:14.750> has

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
used for that song typically a song has

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.550 
used for that song typically a song has
a<00:03:15.470> scale<00:03:16.040> has<00:03:16.310> seven<00:03:16.940> notes<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:18.410> most

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
a scale has seven notes and the most

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.130 
a scale has seven notes and the most
common<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.100> major<00:03:19.280> scale<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.000> if<00:03:20.959> you're

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140

they always known as sorry comma pad on
e<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:42.440> need<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:42.890> know<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.160> scale<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.579> the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
e so you need to know the scale of the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.370 
e so you need to know the scale of the
song<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.150> there<00:03:44.329> are<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:44.810> many<00:03:44.930> types<00:03:45.200> of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
song and there are so many types of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.840 
song and there are so many types of
scales<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.739> most<00:03:45.920> commonly<00:03:46.280> used<00:03:46.370> skills<00:03:46.700> are

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
scales the most commonly used skills are

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.400 
scales the most commonly used skills are
the<00:03:46.910> major<00:03:47.090> scales<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.810> natural<00:03:48.200> minor

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
the major scales and the natural minor

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.390 
the major scales and the natural minor
scales<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.840> for<00:03:50.959> example<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.500> minor<00:03:51.860> would

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
scales and so for example a minor would

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.640 
scales and so for example a minor would
have<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.670> same<00:03:52.940> notes<00:03:53.209> as<00:03:53.420> C<00:03:53.630> major<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.230> the

have the same notes as C major and the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.810 
have the same notes as C major and the
notes<00:03:54.860> are<00:03:55.160> a<00:03:55.430> b<00:03:55.700> c<00:03:55.730> d<00:03:56.120> e<00:03:56.510> f<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.560> g<00:03:57.769> if<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.549> are

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 
scales which are commonly used in

scales which are commonly used in
Bollywood<00:04:28.020> songs<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:29.000> but<00:04:30.000> but<00:04:30.090> we<00:04:30.240> will

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
Bollywood songs and but but we will

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.580 
Bollywood songs and but but we will
start<00:04:30.629> off<00:04:30.750> with<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.990> major<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.440> minor

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
start off with the major and minor

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.920 
start off with the major and minor
scales<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.250> we<00:04:32.699> use<00:04:32.879> very<00:04:33.090> simple<00:04:33.389> examples

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
scales and we use very simple examples

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.740 
scales and we use very simple examples
where<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:35.340> nodes<00:04:35.610> which<00:04:36.030> are<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.479> song

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
where the nodes which are in the song

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.930 
where the nodes which are in the song
are<00:04:37.110> only<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.680> ones<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:38.039> that<00:04:38.069> scale<00:04:38.550> so<00:04:38.789> for

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
are only the ones in that scale so for

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.309 
are only the ones in that scale so for
example<00:04:39.300> if<00:04:39.389> you<00:04:39.449> are<00:04:39.479> playing<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.870> scale<00:04:40.199> of

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
example if you are playing the scale of

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.129 
example if you are playing the scale of
C<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.490> song<00:04:41.699> would<00:04:41.819> people<00:04:42.000> typically<00:04:42.599> be

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
C and the song would people typically be

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.350 
C and the song would people typically be
using<00:04:43.409> only<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.680> note<00:04:43.830> c<00:04:44.190> d<00:04:44.370> e<00:04:44.400> f<00:04:44.610> G<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.210> B

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
using only the note c d e f G a and B

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.300 
using only the note c d e f G a and B
there<00:04:46.169> would<00:04:46.319> be<00:04:46.349> songs<00:04:46.710> where<00:04:46.979> you<00:04:47.099> have

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
there would be songs where you have

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.339 
there would be songs where you have
notes<00:04:47.550> outside<00:04:47.909> of<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.120> scale<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.690> we'll

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
notes outside of the scale and we'll

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.200 
notes outside of the scale and we'll
take<00:04:49.560> those<00:04:49.710> examples<00:04:50.250> as<00:04:50.370> well<00:04:50.580> sometimes

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
take those examples as well sometimes

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.730 
take those examples as well sometimes
they<00:04:51.509> are<00:04:51.599> intentional<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.259> they<00:04:52.319> stay<00:04:52.590> for

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
they are intentional and they stay for

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.779 
they are intentional and they stay for
the<00:04:52.830> entire<00:04:52.860> duration<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.550> song

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
the entire duration of the song

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.730 
the entire duration of the song
sometimes<00:04:54.449> they<00:04:54.810> are<00:04:54.900> accidental<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.650> they

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
sometimes they are accidental and they

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.279 
sometimes they are accidental and they
come<00:04:55.949> just<00:04:56.250> for<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.430> short<00:04:56.580> moment<00:04:56.930> so<00:04:57.930> we'll

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
come just for a short moment so we'll

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.170 
come just for a short moment so we'll
come<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.620> those<00:04:58.770> examples<00:04:59.129> but<00:04:59.520> for<00:04:59.729> now<00:04:59.879> let's

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
come to those examples but for now let's

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.020 
come to those examples but for now let's
go<00:05:00.330> back<00:05:00.509> to<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.780> rules<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.110> was<00:05:01.229> talking<00:05:01.560> about

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
go back to the rules I was talking about

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.339 
go back to the rules I was talking about
the<00:05:03.030> two<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.719> two<00:05:03.840> rules<00:05:04.050> have<00:05:04.199> just

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
the two the two rules have just

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.809 
the two the two rules have just
discussed<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.919> two<00:05:05.039> concepts<00:05:05.490> have<00:05:05.639> just

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
discussed the two concepts have just

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.659 
discussed the two concepts have just
discussed<00:05:06.150> is<00:05:06.419> aa<00:05:06.740> number<00:05:07.740> one<00:05:08.069> knowing<00:05:08.430> the

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
discussed is aa number one knowing the

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.180 
discussed is aa number one knowing the
key<00:05:09.090> of<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.330> song<00:05:09.360> number<00:05:10.259> two<00:05:10.560> is<00:05:10.860> knowing

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
key of the song number two is knowing

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.040 
key of the song number two is knowing
the<00:05:11.340> scale<00:05:11.729> of<00:05:11.879> the<00:05:11.969> song<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:12.419> you<00:05:12.750> should<00:05:12.900> know

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
the scale of the song so you should know

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.749 
the scale of the song so you should know
whether<00:05:13.229> song<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.740> in<00:05:13.889> let's<00:05:14.129> say<00:05:14.250> for<00:05:14.340> example

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
whether song is in let's say for example

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.070 
whether song is in let's say for example
C<00:05:15.419> major<00:05:15.659> or<00:05:16.080> is<00:05:16.349> d<00:05:16.889> minor<00:05:17.129> or<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.639> it<00:05:17.759> in<00:05:18.080> G

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
C major or is d minor or is it in G

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.589 
C major or is d minor or is it in G
minor<00:05:19.289> and<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:19.710> on<00:05:19.909> once<00:05:20.909> you<00:05:21.090> know<00:05:21.210> these<00:05:21.360> two

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
minor and so on once you know these two

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:22.999 
minor and so on once you know these two
things<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:22.080> course<00:05:22.319> the<00:05:22.500> third<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:22.889> most

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
things of course the third and most

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.339 
things of course the third and most
important<00:05:23.580> thing<00:05:23.729> is<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.719> should<00:05:24.960> be<00:05:25.110> able<00:05:25.199> to

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
important thing is you should be able to

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.080 
important thing is you should be able to
pick<00:05:25.590> up<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.860> notes<00:05:26.099> of<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.430> song<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.940> the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
at that point in time so it doesn't

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.540 
at that point in time so it doesn't
really<00:05:37.229> matter<00:05:37.469> if<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:37.860> are<00:05:38.039> not<00:05:38.219> able<00:05:38.370> to

for<00:06:05.819> any<00:06:06.000> song<00:06:07.039> now<00:06:08.039> we<00:06:08.099> start<00:06:08.430> with<00:06:08.490> some

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
for any song now we start with some

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.749 
for any song now we start with some
basic<00:06:09.120> examples<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:10.190> before<00:06:11.190> we<00:06:11.340> go<00:06:11.490> on<00:06:11.610> to

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
basic examples and before we go on to

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.809 
basic examples and before we go on to
that<00:06:12.440> I'll<00:06:13.440> be<00:06:13.830> taking<00:06:13.949> an<00:06:14.159> example<00:06:14.550> from<00:06:14.669> a

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
that I'll be taking an example from a

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.420 
that I'll be taking an example from a
major<00:06:15.000> scale<00:06:15.330> today<00:06:15.710> so<00:06:16.710> before<00:06:17.009> we<00:06:17.129> go<00:06:17.279> into

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
major scale today so before we go into

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.050 
major scale today so before we go into
that<00:06:17.669> a<00:06:18.509> couple<00:06:19.139> of<00:06:19.289> more<00:06:19.529> things<00:06:20.000> when<00:06:21.000> you

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
that a couple of more things when you

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.990 
that a couple of more things when you
want<00:06:21.210> to<00:06:21.240> play<00:06:21.389> chords<00:06:21.750> in<00:06:21.960> a<00:06:22.050> song<00:06:22.669> I'm<00:06:23.669> hoping

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
want to play chords in a song I'm hoping

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.089 
want to play chords in a song I'm hoping
you<00:06:24.180> understand<00:06:24.659> the<00:06:25.080> rhythm<00:06:25.349> patterns<00:06:25.949> which

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
you understand the rhythm patterns which

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.439 
you understand the rhythm patterns which
are<00:06:26.190> very<00:06:26.400> commonly<00:06:26.789> used<00:06:26.879> so<00:06:27.150> you<00:06:27.240> have

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
are very commonly used so you have

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.379 
are very commonly used so you have
patterns<00:06:28.169> like<00:06:28.349> 4<00:06:28.620> 4<00:06:28.919> &amp;<00:06:29.129> 3<00:06:29.159> for<00:06:29.580> most<00:06:30.210> of<00:06:30.330> the

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
patterns like 4 4 &amp; 3 for most of the

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.300 
patterns like 4 4 &amp; 3 for most of the
songs<00:06:30.629> we'll<00:06:31.259> be<00:06:31.440> selecting<00:06:31.620> are<00:06:32.009> the<00:06:32.130> ones

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
songs we'll be selecting are the ones

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.769 
songs we'll be selecting are the ones
which<00:06:32.460> have<00:06:32.639> 4<00:06:32.880> 4<00:06:33.089> or<00:06:33.210> 3<00:06:33.240> 4

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:33.779 
which have 4 4 or 3 4

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.240 
which have 4 4 or 3 4
we<00:06:34.229> might<00:06:34.440> select<00:06:34.740> some<00:06:34.979> which

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
we might select some which

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.810 
we might select some which
more<00:06:35.640> exotic<00:06:36.050> time<00:06:37.050> signatures<00:06:37.860> but<00:06:38.610> let's

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
more exotic time signatures but let's

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.400 
more exotic time signatures but let's
take<00:06:39.030> an<00:06:39.180> example<00:06:39.270> of<00:06:39.660> a<00:06:39.750> song<00:06:39.930> which<00:06:40.140> is<00:06:40.260> in

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
take an example of a song which is in

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.180 
take an example of a song which is in
4/4

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
4/4

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.180 
4/4
typically<00:06:42.140> you<00:06:43.140> would<00:06:43.290> be<00:06:43.410> playing<00:06:43.650> quad<00:06:43.980> in

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
typically you would be playing quad in

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.610 
typically you would be playing quad in
the<00:06:44.280> beginning<00:06:44.640> of<00:06:44.760> each<00:06:45.000> bar<00:06:45.330> so<00:06:46.290> you<00:06:46.320> would

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
the beginning of each bar so you would

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.460 
the beginning of each bar so you would
not<00:06:46.740> be<00:06:46.890> changing<00:06:47.340> chords<00:06:47.910> for<00:06:48.030> every<00:06:48.540> beat<00:06:49.320> in

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
not be changing chords for every beat in

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.080 
not be changing chords for every beat in
the<00:06:49.590> bar<00:06:49.740> so<00:06:49.950> there<00:06:50.130> are<00:06:50.220> four<00:06:50.400> beats<00:06:50.550> in<00:06:50.790> a<00:06:50.880> bar

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
the bar so there are four beats in a bar

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.240 
the bar so there are four beats in a bar
you<00:06:51.720> could<00:06:51.930> theoretically<00:06:52.080> play<00:06:52.560> four<00:06:52.830> chords

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
you could theoretically play four chords

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.730 
you could theoretically play four chords
inside<00:06:54.030> the<00:06:54.240> bar<00:06:54.630> but<00:06:54.930> it<00:06:55.110> would<00:06:55.260> not<00:06:55.470> sound

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
inside the bar but it would not sound

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.220 
inside the bar but it would not sound
too<00:06:56.340> nice<00:06:56.580> there<00:06:57.300> are<00:06:57.330> songs<00:06:57.660> where<00:06:57.900> you<00:06:58.020> have

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
too nice there are songs where you have

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.930 
too nice there are songs where you have
two<00:06:58.530> chords<00:06:58.980> maybe<00:06:59.190> three<00:06:59.490> maybe<00:06:59.640> even<00:06:59.760> four

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
two chords maybe three maybe even four

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.740 
two chords maybe three maybe even four
in<00:07:00.690> the<00:07:00.810> same<00:07:01.020> bar<00:07:01.530> but<00:07:02.370> typically<00:07:03.300> the<00:07:03.510> songs

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
in the same bar but typically the songs

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.610 
in the same bar but typically the songs
are<00:07:03.990> composed<00:07:04.200> in<00:07:04.620> such<00:07:04.770> a<00:07:04.800> way<00:07:05.070> that<00:07:05.310> the

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
are composed in such a way that the

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.530 
are composed in such a way that the
harmonies<00:07:07.620> and<00:07:07.860> the<00:07:07.950> chord<00:07:08.220> rain<00:07:08.490> events<00:07:08.730> are

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540 
harmonies and the chord rain events are

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.190 
harmonies and the chord rain events are
such<00:07:09.840> that<00:07:10.080> you<00:07:10.230> don't<00:07:10.260> need<00:07:10.680> to<00:07:10.740> change

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.200 
such that you don't need to change

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.170 
such that you don't need to change
chords<00:07:13.200> more<00:07:13.410> than<00:07:13.590> once<00:07:13.830> in<00:07:14.190> a<00:07:14.280> bar<00:07:14.490> but<00:07:14.970> there

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
chords more than once in a bar but there

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.670 
chords more than once in a bar but there
are<00:07:15.330> exceptions<00:07:15.870> and<00:07:16.020> there<00:07:16.140> are<00:07:16.230> songs<00:07:16.440> in

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
are exceptions and there are songs in

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.800 
are exceptions and there are songs in
which<00:07:16.770> you<00:07:16.950> have<00:07:17.190> cores<00:07:18.150> changing<00:07:18.630> in<00:07:18.720> the

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
which you have cores changing in the

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.600 
which you have cores changing in the
middle<00:07:19.050> of<00:07:19.170> a<00:07:19.320> bar<00:07:19.470> and<00:07:19.680> things<00:07:20.280> like<00:07:20.430> then

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
middle of a bar and things like then

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.550 
middle of a bar and things like then
take<00:07:20.760> an<00:07:20.850> example<00:07:21.240> of<00:07:21.330> a<00:07:21.420> song<00:07:21.630> where<00:07:21.930> the

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
take an example of a song where the

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.010 
take an example of a song where the
chord<00:07:23.130> change<00:07:23.490> is<00:07:23.810> very<00:07:24.810> very

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
chord change is very very

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.980 
chord change is very very
straightforward
