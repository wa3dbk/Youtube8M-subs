00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.500
 hey people here he is at games and 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.990
 Today I show you in a first 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:27.200
 right video we on a windows 8 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.110
 the volume higher turns the sound 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.300
 the output tone gets louder 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.520
 and you go up here on this 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.690
 on this little speaker here 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.059
 do you go on replay then see 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.220
 Here is your standard playback device 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:52.660
 there is then on properties 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:55.850
 then there is improvement above 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.790
 sure the advisor there you go 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.489
 have you then go to the cop or 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.620
 so I can show you how it works 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.040
 normal annett with black lewis as 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.040
 example 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.840
 and now once with the improved 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.840
 version 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.380
 Then you go to eco as I said 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.229
 quieter and then rock, for example 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.700
 then you could do that one more thing 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.470
 change a bit so that was just 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.460
 my modified version can be active 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.229
 changed versions show one 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.170
 modified version of the sounds 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.509
 then as I said a bit louder 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.220
 and I hope I helped 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.140
 I would be glad if you see me 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.960
 Subscribe would give me a light 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.530

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.530
