00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.130
 already 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.149
 hello welcome to a new chapter of 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.830
 let's do it 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.660
 I am a seminar and in this 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.599
 opportunity I will teach you how to manufacture 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.280
 this practical tool holder 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.820
 using the following materials and 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.820
 tools 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.330
 as tools we are going to use a 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.360
 Drill a drill of diameter of 3 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.210
 millimeters 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.990
 an automatic or manual screwdriver 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.660
 a huincha 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.850
 a ruler and a pencil 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.770
 and as materials we will work with 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.600
 an iron radiata pine of 18 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.630
 millimeters of thickness cut from the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.250
 following measurements 2 of 50 x 100 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:53.379
 centimeters 3 of 50 x 60 centimeters and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.379
 one of 80 x 50 centimeters 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.129
 four metal squads with their 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.129
 screws 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.330
 12 screws of 6 centimeters 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.800
 4 garruchas 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.760
 and as a finish we will use a lacquer 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.920
 transparent 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.550
 with his mask and his gloves for 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550
 protect them 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.960
 two 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.360
 step number one is to have our 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.880
 ready woods and for that you can 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.649
 come buy your board and cut them 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.750
 yourselves yet I will 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.549
 I recommend sending them to the cutting area 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.970
 yes I am mixtures cut the pieces and 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.520
 have them ready to assemble the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.350
 next step is to make some marks in 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.840
 the sideboards the boards 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.689
 side are the ones that I in 100 x 50 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.610
 centimeters the first measure will be to 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:02.290
 25 centimeters from the edge the second one goes to 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.220
 be at 60 centimeters 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.290
 and the third one is going to be 91 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.270
 remember do this at both ends 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.120
 so that when back on the line that 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.640
 completely straight one that have those 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.580
 brands we can trace the guides where 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.440
 let's put our shelves and it's for 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.080
 that we 're going to measure a centimeter 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.410
 above the marl we have done 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.740
 let's move on to make the hole with the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.740
 drill 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.370
 once we have the two boards of 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.680
 100 already marked and perforated is to put 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.790
 the shelves and for that we are going to use 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.020
 our 50 x 60 boards when you're 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.090
 aligned we will use our 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.790
 6 cm long screws 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.210
 let's put the first one in the part 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.210
 higher 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.990
 when I finish putting these three 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.730
 next we are going to do exactly what 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.220
 same with the board on the other side we're going 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.860
 to lift this part of the structure and 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.290
 put our 80 x 50 board in the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.540
 bottom to square we're going to 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.760
 leave eight inches on this side and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.280
 eight centimeters from the other side we're going to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.770
 use the metal brackets leaving 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.770
 five centimeters from the ends 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.730
 varnish and let's hope very well that 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.830
 dry before putting the wrinkles we are going to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.709
 make a mark at 4 centimeters from 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.630
 back edge and 8 centimeters from 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.700
 lateral edge 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.190
 and obviously you are going to put the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.310
 screws on all four sides and in addition 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.200
 they will finish putting the other 3 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.510
 when they are done with that 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.460
 can turn the furniture and put the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.020
 side accessories accessories 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.940
 laterals can be this kind of 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.160
 basket is in its imac or 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.020
 even door handles for hanging 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.670
 any kind of tools I hope 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.620
 that you liked this project and if 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.210
 They want to continue to see more like this not 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.370
 forget to follow us in the hands of the 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.890
 work I am from the seminary and is objected 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.520
 over here 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.520
 i 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520
