00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
pretty much what we're going to do is

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.740 
pretty much what we're going to do is
set<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> scam<00:02:35.640> villain<00:02:36.060> background<00:02:36.540> first

set the scam villain background first

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.520 
set the scam villain background first
and<00:02:38.420> what<00:02:39.420> we're<00:02:39.540> doing<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.019> we're<00:02:40.319> pretty

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
and what we're doing is we're pretty

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.869 
and what we're doing is we're pretty
much<00:02:40.680> freezing<00:02:41.189> that<00:02:41.639> timer<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.510> never

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
much freezing that timer so it never

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.690 
much freezing that timer so it never
times<00:02:44.879> out<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:46.109> never<00:02:46.530> started<00:02:47.189> so<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
times out it's never started so it

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.539 
times out it's never started so it
thinks<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.389> own<00:02:48.540> game<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.310> by<00:02:50.310> doing
