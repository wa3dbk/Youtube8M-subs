00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.750
 hi to all and all these atomium 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.980
 welcome to this new preview 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.099
 today we will see together 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.769
 fawer sided fantasy a game that is made 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.299
 by the developer of perspectives 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.670
 remember at the time of already scarcely 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.109
 all this a free game in which we 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.300
 had puzzles actually doing business under 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.340
 form of platform game we had to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.840
 play with the prospects frozen screen 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.910
 in one point to be able to pass 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.410
 some areas and that's it there 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.550
 he puts the cover back with a little bit of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.990
 same kind of principle but seen 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.030
 differently you will see that it is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 a game that in itself is quite interesting 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
 so we'll start a game in one 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.980
 player it's a demo that you can 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.239
 find on an imac if you 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.070
 so do not hesitate 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.510
 honestly be curious we could 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.620
 believe that any bug but actually no 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.239
 it's because the developer really 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.399
 insists on this side a little glitch 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.110
 and we will say in his universe as 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.399
 you will see the 2d that is used 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 and his own so it's pretty empty 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.360
 in itself but it does not agree too much 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.949
 too bad with the theme then you see 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 here we learn a little tight the game is 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.809
 ahead we jump and the aa holds there that 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.390
 it's weird see how I can 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.610
 move to infinity so ok let's admit 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 why not and here we actually learn 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 that the edges are not really 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.000
 edges and so each time actually one 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.350
 will be able to use that a little 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.360
 as if there were number portals 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.549
 of portal on each of the overflows thus to the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.780
 bottom and left and right and so you 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.119
 will be able to teleport you like that 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.869
 from one side to the other 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.790
 so far ok everything is fine except that we're going 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.320
 to realize in fact that we 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.450
 is going to have two modes so here it is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.500
 ludoland of the gentleman's studio who was 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.780
 perspectives and so of the blow that made 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.680
 this game is so with arte actually what 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.650
 will happen is that we go like this 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.460
 here is frozen the screen is actually the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.070
 scrolling does not dare 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.600
 but if ever we decide to sit and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.220
 well there and hop you see that suddenly 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.509
 I was able to get through and so that's 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.579
 that way there that I can continue 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.990
 so we have like that a kind of you 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.119
 of travel we will say that we are 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.920
 counted our listening and suggest it's a 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.689
 little bit thinner than it looks and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.189
 there for example that's actually we're going 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.380
 have the names of the characters that have 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.969
 working on it will appear what is true 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.079
 that it's done soon enough 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.240
 fine so again we say to ourselves 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.040
 how are I going to do 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.619
 and well we will block what makes that 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.119
 so hop I go back and bone and so 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.289
 we will be able to continue like this because 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.480
 that beer unless I fall into the water 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.010
 I die the job we jump we say 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.750
 it's weird then given I do that 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.370
 not walk then that's how it says 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.560
 no foot still not so maybe 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.090
 like that super complicated I do not know no 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.120
 it does not work and in fact it's all stupid 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.849
 we blast and look hop there and we go 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.080
 find the same and hop there and so 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.090
 this way we will be able to continue 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.069
 so it's not necessarily the kind of 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.290
 concept that will make you dream a lot of 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.400
 world but these being already on the one hand 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.190
 had to have the idea in addition it's 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.660
 funny because we really find the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.460
 that's what could possibly 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.190
 please at the base in the game perspective 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.450
 but interpreted differently with 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.550
 moves for the rather unique shot 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.320
 and successful a game that I found 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.550
 still rather interesting so there in 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.080
 done we will be brought to recover the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.330
 things that is to say that I grabbed a 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.220
 kind of yellow order and here I'm going to grab 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.260
 a blue orb finally a blind and so 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.690
 having recovered both up see that 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.540
 so it canceled the thing that I 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.310
 have to recover here is the thing that 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.260
 is down there you and you see in 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.800
 yellow we say to ourselves but how is 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
 what I want to do 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.680
 and in fact it's very simple 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.400
 do this and hop there and the envoy of the coup 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.650
 I was able to retrieve it 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.790
 so we got one now we're going 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.530
 have to play a second because 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.270
 actually we have areas in 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.040
 which one is going to be frozen like that 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.120
 who is present right here at the level of 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.440
 the right see it I can not do anything 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.810
 faires see I can not press the 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.640
 trigger or what so I'm stuck there 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.260
 I still need a blue orb while 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.050
 you also find impossible or is it 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.700
 that he is we look a little bit and there 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.140
 we say we're good and if I freeze and hold 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.850
 to do that for example 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.310
 and then if I refused to do that 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.810
 and there if I continued in the same 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.459
 lineage to do something a little bit 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.800
 different I want to do that hop there 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.450
 and well, it works and there 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.520
 we just have to go back downstairs 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.010
 what are we going to do that like that then we 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.989
 do like this and here going here hop 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.330
 that's all canceling and so again a 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.560
 time we go to the other side and we can 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.060
 move to the next level 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.020
 so that was a little bit the game 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.880
 I wanted to introduce you today 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.050
 so it was fixed a few years ago 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.150
 months when same time it's even a 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.620
 little moment but on the other hand if I you 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.670
 he talks about it because he 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.800
 little bit in the tank as it does not 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.269
 should not be too late to actually go out 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.470
 and so it's true that it can 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.820
 to be interesting enough so be 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.380
 Curiously frankly do not hesitate I 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.060
 think that's the kind of game that has 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.430
 largely all the arguments for 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.620
 to be able to seduce a large audience 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.609
 to say and it's true that the up 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.130
 typically see that too it's pretty 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.600
 Funny there is something to do about 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.080
 level design the concept is really 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.000
 all stupid but 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.229
 I know it goes something we will 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.720
 to say that when I have it happen something 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.979
 and therefore the coup bah voila I wanted 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.409
 absolutely tell you about it I hope in 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.909
 Anyway bah that interested you 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.379
 simply and tuba do not hesitate to 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.060
 do the demo yourself even frankly 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.250
 because here you see there is 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.169
 what to do you find it on the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.000
 game card on an imac so from 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.580
 faouar sided fantasy as it is written 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.629
 at the top left of the screen and so eh 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.530
 well still remember you are here 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.300
 it is a game that is currently rare 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.490
 in alpha and so who is still 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.759
 likely to be improved by so 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.990
 there is still work but in 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.849
 anyway what is certain is that already 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.289
 seen like that it's pretty committed one 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.030
 once again saw a problem enough 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.919
 funny what I have to do is jump 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.259
 in fact to be able to like that hop 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.680
 access to the suite alas continues see 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:14.360
 good the funny side of the little thing I 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.250
 stop there and I leave you 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.819
 discover the game by yourself at very 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.150
 well all over the world 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.150
 go bye
