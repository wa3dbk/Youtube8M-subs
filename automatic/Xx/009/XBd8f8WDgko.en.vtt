00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.969
 hey people welcome to another 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.519
 pbv is on video a few hours ago 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.980
 the perky Europe appeared on the pc 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.260
 and we'll take a closer look 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.790
 these changes or some of the 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.740
 We were already up to date with changes 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.210
 the pda were taken out if one 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.130
 again then she was changed 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.660
 and now that's more or less that 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.240
 Whole kittner a bit different 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.590
 so time for a video by the way 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.360
 Of course you can also mine here 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 epic duel with the nabu spot 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.050
 look at 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.210
 what happens at cheese dance is what happens 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.769
 still 15 percent reduction 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.019
 on magical damage suffered 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.120
 but not anymore, strangely enough 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.489
 this hurt then just the text with 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.620
 instead we have here like 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.940
 fitz the property that we units 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.039
 ignore collision 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.690
 there you do not need much 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.609
 to say that makes sense in any case 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.289
 kessel is a very old one 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.390
 champion with a few more kings 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.979
 characteristics and that they bring this with him 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.569
 text picture mache is one of them 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.159
 I guess that the earlier of wright 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.650
 was kind of thought so as to such a 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.570
 teenager from dota is the militant and 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.280
 neat on it but skin like that 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.170
 he does not play a human kettle for all 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.240
 on the contrary he is a birthday it in 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.190
 The jurisprudence of his stock exchange 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.500
 dismantling is not next to a club 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.470
 the whole thing from here on everyone 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.330
 a good idea 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.620
 Cheek the scu was changed drastically 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.780
 First , here are the damage pay 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.060
 a little different but above all else 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.980
 the silence away and that's violent 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.510
 at one of kessel in the great strengths 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.220
 because you stand as a champion of the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.120
 skills depends simply is not 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.130
 could withstand more 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.450
 the whole thing was now through a sign 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.610
 replacing the boiler to 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.750
 after the kku to fire him from the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.920
 magic damage contactor for 2 seconds 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.869
 special features in the ability 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.299
 that the shield with maximum manu 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.369
 what's the team of the new one 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.350
 kessel ins is because of the virus here many 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.509
 Skills has scale with mamma 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.640
 besides, the kku has the property 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.770
 to interrupt shaken abilities 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.619
 so that's a small consolation if he 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.750
 Jesse James has no more silence 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.369
 w is also interesting here now 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.379
 namely the effects theoretically 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.750
 So actively swaps to passive and 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.819
 Takes the active passive makes this 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.010
 ability now with every automatic 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.870
 Attack additional magical damage 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.110
 this additional scale scales again 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.030
 with our maximum one on it 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.620
 adds the active part of the fund now 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.870
 next automatic attack 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.420
 in addition magical harm to that 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.860
 whole escalates with ap 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.769
 moreover , the whole is now filling mahner 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.010
 on and here the value is currently ten 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.410
 percent of his reminder what he lacks that 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.560
 whole is threefold in against attacks 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.180
 All in all, you can be up to them 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.500
 So the conclusion that pull that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.130
 Stock market of cancer for being taken down 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.359
 has been 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.440
 I want to pay for it and not 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.170
 to go into detail because it is natural 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 pps and a lot can change but also 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.280
 the scalings with maximum admonisher 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.019
 absent me very impressive 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.790
 besides, you can think so 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.769
 claim that the landing phase is now 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.420
 before level 6 forget a bit 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.459
 it is more pleasant he has the possibility 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.780
 had more with crew last and that 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.340
 Mahnner then used again 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.319
 to refresh his w 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.970
 In addition, trades can possibly 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.769
 be compensated because we have the shield 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.750
 have reduced the magic damage 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.520
 if the opponent is strong on skills 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.260
 offer 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.890
 the automatic attacks then go 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.030
 course by at boiler has 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.770
 actually nothing great 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.240
 changed except the damage and 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.530
 Styling scaling was introduced here 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.510
 screwed down a bit 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.660
 but there is no point in that 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.730
 a at boiler in city have become 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.770
 Of course, the numbers changed as well 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.570
 Here it is interesting to note that 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.610
 invested much more 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.200
 pay attention to level 1 is here 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.470
 for example, the base damage the same 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.790
 but at level 2 and 3 comes twice as 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.130
 much on it as before 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.530
 that was always 20 years extra 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.180
 now it wants forty damage pole 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.770
 additionally scale 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.990
 the whole but not with ability 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.990
 strength but again with maximum 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.880
 mahner is the cooldown of skill 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.550
 currently on the pp as well as on the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.830
 liveservern at level 1 7 seconds 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.260
 but again invested level 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.480
 are twice as strong live servers per 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.080
 level - one second on the cool down 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.120
 and on the pp against it - two seconds 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.660
 So up to a minimum on level 3 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.700
 only three seconds 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.380
 at several revox in a row 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.790
 still the men cost around each 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.950
 100 raised 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.440
 but there is no longer a piece of it 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.700
 Damage does not increase 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.010
 property that if one here 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.070
 champion meets part of the additional costs 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.420
 be refunded 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.610
 with all the changes is the 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.890
 ability now more utility than harm 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.390
 Up to now, Kesse Duisburg has always been 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.160
 Carsten again with this stack 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.000
 collects and a decent burst 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.740
 had profit 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.510
 the whole thing is not possible anymore 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.470
 and that's the cooldown 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.390
 went down 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.720
 from therefore in my opinion is the 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.190
 ability is just bad 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.500
 so much at least from me to the new 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.390
 kettle in balance technically I want there 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.919
 not big what to say first 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.640
 Of course, npd can still do it 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.590
 change a lot 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.300
 and besides, I would have to do that first 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.580
 a few games played with the 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.410
 But I think that's a total one 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.760
 good change is who knows maybe 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.320
 you can kettle in the then actually 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.400
 play again because he is not anymore 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.380
 is permanently banned 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.150
 What you think about it could be me 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.190
 like to know in the comments 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.320
 that was mine, thank you for that 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.070
 to see and we are 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.070
 a video thanks
