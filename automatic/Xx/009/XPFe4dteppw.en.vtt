line down the center of the face next

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.650 
line down the center of the face next
we'll<00:01:02.190> draw<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> line<00:01:02.609> across<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.210> middle<00:01:03.539> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
we'll draw a line across the middle of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.080 
we'll draw a line across the middle of
the<00:01:03.719> egg<00:01:03.960> shape<00:01:04.230> the<00:01:04.860> eyes<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.430> human<00:01:05.790> are<00:01:05.910> at

the egg shape the eyes of a human are at

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
the egg shape the eyes of a human are at
the<00:01:06.210> halfway<00:01:06.480> point<00:01:06.720> from<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> top<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the halfway point from the top of the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
the halfway point from the top of the
head<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.310> bottom<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> chin<00:01:09.030> we'll

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
head to the bottom of the chin we'll

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.540 
head to the bottom of the chin we'll
sketch<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.840> eyes<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.440> middle<00:01:10.770> line<00:01:10.920> next

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
sketch the eyes on the middle line next

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.730 
sketch the eyes on the middle line next
we'll<00:01:12.060> draw<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> line<00:01:12.600> where<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:12.930> eyebrows<00:01:13.500> are

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
we'll draw a line where the eyebrows are

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
we'll draw a line where the eyebrows are
and<00:01:13.980> another<00:01:14.550> at<00:01:14.910> where<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> hairline<00:01:15.510> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and another at where the hairline is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
and another at where the hairline is
then<00:01:16.620> I'll<00:01:16.890> draw<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> tick<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.940> half<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
then I'll draw a tick that is half the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
then I'll draw a tick that is half the
distance<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> bottom<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.770> chin<00:01:20.010> from

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
distance to the bottom of the chin from

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
distance to the bottom of the chin from
the<00:01:20.370> eyebrows<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.510> where<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.900> bottom<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the eyebrows this is where the bottom of

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.220 
the eyebrows this is where the bottom of
the<00:01:22.500> nose<00:01:22.710> goes<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.940> last<00:01:24.150> line<00:01:24.510> I'll<00:01:24.660> draw<00:01:24.930> is

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
the nose goes the last line I'll draw is

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.140 
the nose goes the last line I'll draw is
one-third<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.280> way<00:01:26.430> between<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.940> nose

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
one-third of the way between the nose

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.570 
one-third of the way between the nose
and<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.630> bottom<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> chin<00:01:28.410> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> where

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
and the bottom of the chin this is where

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.940 
and the bottom of the chin this is where
the<00:01:29.730> mouth<00:01:29.910> will<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.320> look<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.500> lines<00:01:31.710> I've

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the mouth will be look at the lines I've

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.490 
the mouth will be look at the lines I've
just<00:01:32.160> drawn<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:33.210> sketch<00:01:33.660> them<00:01:33.870> lightly<00:01:34.110> onto

just drawn now sketch them lightly onto
your<00:01:34.620> head<00:01:34.830> shape<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:36.060> fractions<00:01:36.660> will<00:01:36.840> help

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
your head shape the fractions will help

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.660 
your head shape the fractions will help
you<00:01:37.200> remember<00:01:37.440> where<00:01:37.800> each<00:01:38.040> feature<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
