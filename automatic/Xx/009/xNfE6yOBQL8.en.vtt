 on television more than ever and good 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.899
 Well now I tell you that Jorge Ortiz de 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.240
 pinedo confessed to us that he is not 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.160
 regretting having applied the same 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 belinda's tactic to get rid of a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.360
 uncomfortable reporter during a 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.460
 press conference listen to him ran it 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.980
 a few weeks ago Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.720
 had a run-in with a reporter to 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.610
 who asked to leave the room where 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.800
 a conference of 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.080
 press, in his opinion, the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.360
 questioning that he did was 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.750
 out of place someone you tell him 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.910
 you do not serve you get out of here 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.730
 I mean, and I have here 20 means to follow 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.260
 talking about you go away or be you do not serve 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.559
 get ready and then those people think that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.380
 He did his job because it made me angry 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.930
 I do not get angry anymore because I do not get angry anymore 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.840
 I was going to die and I did not die or be 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 think about that or you think that almost 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 almost revive to get angry and to 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.440
 fight with the name if I'm worth a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.300
 I overrode the peanut and that's what it says 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.729
 who approach artists 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.520
 only with the intention of publishing 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.369
 yellowish notes soon many 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.030
 kids send them to the rugs 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.119
 red to the premieres 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.610
 with the pure slogan of getting a note 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.560
 to any actor that arrives but one 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.229
 note that I can post where I say 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.470
 that are marijuana that collided 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.380
 henaine to the woman, that is, to sell between 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.149
 Parentheses and boys come to you 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.390
 they ask questions that you say that question 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.450
 they did it to me two years ago or already 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.509
 that's already happened you have to evolve 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 clear as you did not study if you had 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.030
 You studied journalism, you would know that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.890
 it is no longer done although he assured his attitude 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.720
 it did not look at all like the one adopted by 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.659
 belinda who ran from an event a 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.420
 reporter says not to regret his 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.070
 proceed no no no but it does not look cute 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.409
 to start respecting a lot but I'm going 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.450
 yes it was so beneficial that hello that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.520
 they talked about me because if they do not talk about 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.440
 me to little that is that it does not want that it not 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.060
 I did thinking what was going to happen that I did not 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.670
 it was a start on his part was to have it 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.140
 done but it was obviously defense 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.030
 so that all of you realize 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.040
 you have to think more about what they are 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.500
 doing and can not keep doing a 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.300
 lies bubble journalism 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.570
