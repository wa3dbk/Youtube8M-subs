pencil alright we're gonna start out in
pencil<00:00:08.490> beforehand<00:00:08.970> just<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.210> give<00:00:09.420> our<00:00:09.450> us<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
pencil beforehand just to give our us a

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.410 
pencil beforehand just to give our us a
rough<00:00:10.410> idea<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.740> something<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.040> follow<00:00:11.420> let's

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
rough idea of something to follow let's

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.950 
rough idea of something to follow let's
get<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> little<00:00:12.780> snowed<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.340> here<00:00:14.960> and

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
get a little snowed in going on here and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.890 
get a little snowed in going on here and
let's<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.830> major<00:00:17.010> tree<00:00:17.660> now<00:00:18.660> even

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
let's just do one major tree now even

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.250 
let's just do one major tree now even
though<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> lot<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.289> pines<00:00:20.660> their<00:00:21.660> leaves<00:00:21.930> stick

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
though a lot of pines their leaves stick

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.660 
though a lot of pines their leaves stick
upward<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.800> when<00:00:22.920> they're<00:00:23.130> weighted<00:00:23.490> down

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
upward and when they're weighted down

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.029 
upward and when they're weighted down
with<00:00:24.029> snow<00:00:24.480> they're<00:00:25.170> gonna<00:00:25.380> hang<00:00:25.769> they're

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
with snow they're gonna hang they're

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.659 
with snow they're gonna hang they're
gonna<00:00:28.519> hang<00:00:29.519> over<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.520> these<00:00:32.520> are

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
gonna hang over like that so these are

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.500 
gonna hang over like that so these are
going<00:00:32.820> off<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> page<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.239> gonna<00:00:36.329> make

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
going off the page and it's gonna make

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.680 
going off the page and it's gonna make
the<00:00:36.630> whole<00:00:36.750> tree<00:00:36.989> lean<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> bit<00:00:37.320> too<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> once

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the whole tree lean a bit too so once

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.880 
the whole tree lean a bit too so once
you've<00:00:39.809> got<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.050> least<00:00:40.079> some<00:00:40.320> general<00:00:40.649> idea<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you've got at least some general idea of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.450 
you've got at least some general idea of
where<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:42.680> where<00:00:43.680> your<00:00:43.829> leaves<00:00:44.070> where<00:00:44.340> your

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
where your where your leaves where your

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
where your where your leaves where your
limbs<00:00:44.700> are<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.300> you're<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> be

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
limbs are going to be you're going to be

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
limbs are going to be you're going to be
thinking<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.930> limbs<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.289> gonna<00:00:49.379> be

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
thinking about the limbs you're gonna be

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.180 
thinking about the limbs you're gonna be
thinking<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> snow<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:52.129> kind<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
thinking about the snow as kind of

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.819 
thinking about the snow as kind of
random<00:00:53.699> hanging<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.680> do

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
random hanging on there but you can do

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
random hanging on there but you can do
that<00:00:56.070> without<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.329> having<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> draw

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that without actually having to draw

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.500 
that without actually having to draw
that<00:00:57.989> stage<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.850> by<00:01:00.059> using<00:01:00.120> we

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that stage you can do that by using we

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.310 
that stage you can do that by using we
use<00:01:00.629> an<00:01:00.750> olive<00:01:01.050> green<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:03.110> Pines<00:01:04.110> these

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
use an olive green here and Pines these

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
use an olive green here and Pines these
are<00:01:04.439> great<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.769> again<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> nature<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
are great because again a nature you you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.399 
are great because again a nature you you
can<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.479> imprecise<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.200> really

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
can be a little imprecise and you really

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010 
can be a little imprecise and you really
can't<00:01:07.590> tell<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> got<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> wrong<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> what

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
can't tell if you got it wrong so what

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.149 
can't tell if you got it wrong so what
we're<00:01:10.140> gonna<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> underside

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
we're gonna do is we get the underside

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.870 
we're gonna do is we get the underside
of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> branch<00:01:12.110> with<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> pines<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.700> we

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of the branch with the pines and then we

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.820 
of the branch with the pines and then we
get<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.960> shape<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.070> snow<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.520> top<00:01:17.729> and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
get the shape of the snow on top and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.520 
get the shape of the snow on top and
then<00:01:19.830> we'll<00:01:20.280> show<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.170> get<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> top

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
then we'll show you how to get the top

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.580 
then we'll show you how to get the top
edge<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.400> keep<00:01:23.580> doing<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.590> we're

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
edge but you just keep doing that we're

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.840 
edge but you just keep doing that we're
just<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.100> side<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.490> show<00:01:26.640> you

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.560 

remember<00:01:29.850> there's<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> nice<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
remember there's not going to nice to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.010 
remember there's not going to nice to
know<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> underside<00:01:32.930> normally<00:01:33.930> I'd

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
know on the underside normally I'd

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.300 
know on the underside normally I'd
probably<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.409> sharpening<00:01:34.799> those<00:01:34.950> pencils

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
probably be sharpening those pencils

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.090 
probably be sharpening those pencils
they<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.490> along<00:01:35.610> but

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
they go along but

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.400 
they go along but
go<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.840> some<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> snow<00:01:40.290> is

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
go up here to some of the snow is

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.460 
go up here to some of the snow is
actually<00:01:40.760> beyond<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.820> top<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> some<00:01:42.300> of<00:01:42.330> these

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
actually beyond the top of some of these

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.920 
actually beyond the top of some of these
shorter<00:01:43.470> limbs<00:01:43.650> will<00:01:43.890> still<00:01:44.160> get<00:01:44.430> some<00:01:44.930> upward

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
shorter limbs will still get some upward

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 
shorter limbs will still get some upward
point<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:47.060> because<00:01:48.060> they're<00:01:48.210> shorter

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
point to them because they're shorter

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.240 
point to them because they're shorter
and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.900> I'm<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.040> length<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:50.670> down

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
and then I'm just length to way down

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
and then I'm just length to way down
make<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> bottom<00:01:54.210> edge<00:01:54.390> where<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.780> snow<00:01:55.680> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
make that bottom edge where the snow is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.510 
make that bottom edge where the snow is
uneven<00:01:56.400> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.610> even<00:01:56.760> do<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.940> like<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:58.490> do<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
uneven you can even do it like that do a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.700 
uneven you can even do it like that do a
snow<00:01:59.790> edge<00:01:59.970> first<00:02:00.270> although<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.170> then<00:02:01.620> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
snow edge first although it's then you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.050 
snow edge first although it's then you
have<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:01.920> follow<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.340> lines<00:02:02.550> it's<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> little

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
have to follow the lines it's a little

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.400 
have to follow the lines it's a little
trickier<00:02:05.540> I'll<00:02:06.540> take<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:06.990> more<00:02:07.230> level

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
trickier I'll take it one more level

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:15.130 
trickier I'll take it one more level
down<00:02:09.980> and<00:02:10.980> then

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.880 

we're<00:02:15.680> gonna<00:02:15.800> use<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:17.140> very<00:02:18.140> pale<00:02:18.410> blue<00:02:20.890> let's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
we're gonna use a very pale blue let's

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.650 
we're gonna use a very pale blue let's
do<00:02:22.040> some<00:02:22.600> rough<00:02:23.600> shading<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.360> bottom

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
do some rough shading on that bottom

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.580 
do some rough shading on that bottom
edge<00:02:26.810> there<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:29.770> then<00:02:31.360> use<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:33.320> make<00:02:33.440> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
edge there and then use that to make the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.150 
edge there and then use that to make the
top<00:02:33.770> edge<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.790> doesn't<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.540> as

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
top edge it doesn't have to be as

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.590 
top edge it doesn't have to be as
extreme<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.370> can<00:02:37.490> be<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.610> little<00:02:37.880> softer<00:02:38.330> as<00:02:38.570> a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
extreme it can be a little softer as a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.560 
extreme it can be a little softer as a
sketch<00:02:39.440> there<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:40.610> where<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.880> top<00:02:41.030> edge<00:02:41.330> of

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
sketch there and where the top edge of

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.110 
sketch there and where the top edge of
the<00:02:41.660> snow<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.580> now<00:02:43.580> if<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.730> any<00:02:43.910> real

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
the snow is now if you any real

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.510 
the snow is now if you any real
realistic<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.780> detailed<00:02:47.740> go<00:02:48.740> over<00:02:49.070> this<00:02:49.190> blue

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
realistic and detailed go over this blue

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.810 
realistic and detailed go over this blue
with<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> gray<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:51.100> then<00:02:52.100> blend<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.610> with<00:02:52.760> a

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
with a gray and then blend it with a

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.140 
with a gray and then blend it with a
blending<00:02:53.180> stick<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.830> blending<00:02:54.830> pencil<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
blending stick a blending pencil or a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
blending stick a blending pencil or a
white<00:02:56.420> pencil<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:59.420> get<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.630> little<00:02:59.870> lumpy<00:03:00.140> on

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
white pencil you get a little lumpy on

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.340 
white pencil you get a little lumpy on
the<00:03:00.500> snow<00:03:00.650> up<00:03:00.800> here<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.840> when<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.050> get<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.260> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
the snow up here and when you get to the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.980 
the snow up here and when you get to the
opposite<00:03:03.740> sign<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.420> get<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.570> all<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.840> mesh

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
opposite sign to get this all to mesh

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.030 
opposite sign to get this all to mesh
together<00:03:06.190> you'll<00:03:07.190> want<00:03:07.430> some<00:03:07.580> areas<00:03:09.040> that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
together you'll want some areas that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.490 
together you'll want some areas that
just<00:03:10.510> fill<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:12.370> between<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:15.050> can<00:03:15.170> have<00:03:15.320> some

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
just fill in between you can have some

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.050 
just fill in between you can have some
more<00:03:15.620> snow<00:03:15.920> showing<00:03:16.130> between<00:03:16.670> their<00:03:16.910> two

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
more snow showing between their two

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.120 
more snow showing between their two
I'm<00:03:19.989> gonna<00:03:20.140> show<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.560> little<00:03:20.680> bit<00:03:20.890> there

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
I'm gonna show you a little bit there

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.880 
I'm gonna show you a little bit there
and<00:03:23.400> again<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.459> have<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.790> soft<00:03:25.060> underside

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
and again you have the soft underside

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.699 
and again you have the soft underside
the<00:03:26.890> outline<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.550> top<00:03:27.940> edge<00:03:28.500> we've<00:03:29.500> got

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
the outline for the top edge we've got

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.760 
the outline for the top edge we've got
some<00:03:29.890> going<00:03:30.099> on<00:03:30.220> over<00:03:30.430> here<00:03:30.459> behind<00:03:31.770> and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
some going on over here behind and

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.130 
some going on over here behind and
something<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:33.130> can<00:03:33.250> just<00:03:33.430> see<00:03:33.580> through<00:03:34.140> and

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
something you can just see through and

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.990 
something you can just see through and
we'll<00:03:35.349> continue<00:03:35.500> like<00:03:35.860> that<00:03:36.040> some<00:03:36.819> of<00:03:36.849> these

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
we'll continue like that some of these

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.820 
we'll continue like that some of these
snow<00:03:37.510> areas<00:03:37.870> will<00:03:38.019> even<00:03:38.200> go<00:03:38.319> on<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.709> next

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
snow areas will even go on to the next

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.979 
snow areas will even go on to the next
limbs<00:03:39.099> like<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:42.540> making<00:03:43.540> them<00:03:43.660> connect

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
limbs like that making them connect

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.780 
limbs like that making them connect
across<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.920> someone<00:03:45.220> will<00:03:45.310> actually<00:03:45.580> be<00:03:45.700> in

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
across and someone will actually be in

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.320 
across and someone will actually be in
front<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.640> that's<00:03:48.819> how<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.030> get<00:03:49.180> started

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
front and that's how you get started

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.910 
front and that's how you get started
with<00:03:49.720> drawing<00:03:49.900> colored<00:03:50.739> pencil<00:03:51.100> snowy<00:03:51.580> Pines
