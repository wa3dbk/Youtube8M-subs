00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 video tutorial 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.559
 today we will see how to convert ours 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.349
 unprotected dvds in video files from 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.859
 save on your computer 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 let's start that video tutorial right away 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:25.439
 first of all we must go to the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:28.380
 our browser and look for DVD shrink me 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.850
 I'll put the download link in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:43.850
 description of the free video download 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 download again for free and keep 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.370
 at this point we click and you must 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.010
 follow my procedure carefully 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.690
 because otherwise you will have one installed 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.100
 tide of other useless software e 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.100
 annoying on the computer 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.640
 let's accept here you have to tick 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.960
 custom and take off the first one is there 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.390
 they will also take away the other two 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.390
 see ahead 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:38.890
 at this point it should start 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.189
 the actual skip installation 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.129
 we do skip then we do advanced e 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.649
 we remove the check from these three installs 

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:53.539
 we do next on the toolbar 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.170
 cancel because it will tempt you again 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.890
 let me install the delta toolbar are 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.670
 very annoying in these things I do it 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:12.890
 I had already installed a stalemate 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:16.010
 to show you the dvd shrink procedure 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.859
 is one of the best free software a 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.389
 provision for non dvd rest 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:26.859
 protected really very simple from 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:32.180
 fast understanding and extremely effective 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:34.370
 at the end click on next 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:41.150
 check accept to accept the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:44.269
 license next next is again next create 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.630
 an icon on the next desktop is installed 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:53.810
 install now 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:57.050
 launch the program then finish see 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.080
 how does the program 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.060
 program is in English but really 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.180
 very simple to understand operation 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.390
 I will show you the main options immediately 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.000
 then I have already loaded the DVD in 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.900
 computer that I have to redo and do 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.200
 opendisc the only one available is this 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.200
 ok 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.600
 at this point the disc will load 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.390
 and will analyze it as you see in this 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.210
 case it takes five minutes must do e 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.660
 I will also show you the DVD preview 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.110
 of the video that in my opinion a thing 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:51.600
 very very pretty you can also take off 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:52.770
 the check is but I leave it like me there 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.330
 we soon find the end 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.320
 of the analysis well at this point 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:06.330
 you see that here on the side there will be a 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:11.130
 appeared two folders my 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:15.920
 movie and where there is my movie and title 1 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.330
 this will be our video 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.739
 present on the DVD if there are more 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.160
 video clips 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.020
 obviously everyone will appear and like 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.160
 you see the size of the movie is from 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:35.340
 about 3 and a half gigas in this case a 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:40.010
 this point let's go to this window 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:43.860
 we click and we put the no compression 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:48.060
 so when we extract the file the file 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.000
 video will not be compressed and will be 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.580
 like the original 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.680
 at this point we go on backup see 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.470
 here backup click on backup 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.660
 select here the folder in which 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.810
 we want to save ours or ours 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:12.720
 video in this case I put desktop and 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:18.570
 we click the quality we leave everything 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:22.860
 as is we click on ok while the 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.700
 file will be decrypted we will always see 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.860
 the video preview in this case there 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.770
 should put about 20 minutes on 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.980
 twenty minutes and we find ourselves like at 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.600
 usually at the end 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.730
 of the good remade we are back at the end 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.920
 of the download you see the backup is 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:47.200
 been completed 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:50.860
 I click on ok and I can close the videos there 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:55.290
 we will find in the video folder ts e 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:06:00.280
 will these be you tsi vts to me has 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:02.230
 separated the file into four parts e 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.250
 there is probably an option for not 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.250
 make them separate 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.660
 this copper we will also pass another la 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.660
 wall of the state 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:21.479
 here we close we return to dvd shrink 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.869
 opendisc ok 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:48.040
 uncompressed preferences file 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:51.130
 probably output files here 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.410
 uncheck split bob files in 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.740
 tour 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:07:00.250
 remove the tick on the separation of the 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:03.450
 file in one file in multiple files from a 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:07.180
 one gigabyte is ok 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:10.510
 so it will not divide the file if the file 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:15.130
 It is greater than a jig and only matera 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:16.720
 a file for this video tutorial e 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.470
