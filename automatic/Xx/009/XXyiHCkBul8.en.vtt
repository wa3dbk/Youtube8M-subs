00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
what does it feel like to be tossed
around<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> middle<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.770> something<00:01:26.220> like

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
around in the middle of something like

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.660 
around in the middle of something like
that<00:01:26.780> you're<00:01:27.780> basically<00:01:27.990> gasping<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.640> air

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.270 
where I was upside down rolling down the
hill<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> i<00:01:46.079> thought<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.100> not

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280

going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> end<00:01:47.729> well<00:01:47.820> how<00:01:48.659> long<00:01:48.899> did<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.170> take

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
going to end well how long did it take

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.300 
going to end well how long did it take

before they dug you out well so once the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.399 
before they dug you out well so once the
snow<00:01:53.369> stops<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.780> weights<00:01:55.229> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
snow stops it really like weights you
