particularly with Yamaha same bolt holes

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.030 
particularly with Yamaha same bolt holes
we<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:09.970> fit<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.780> new<00:02:10.899> engines<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.709> can<00:02:11.860> use

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
we can fit the new engines up we can use

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.440 
we can fit the new engines up we can use
the<00:02:12.160> same<00:02:12.370> controls<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.030> we've<00:02:13.180> got<00:02:13.330> on

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the same controls that we've got on

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720 
the same controls that we've got on
there<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.959> get<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.920> new<00:02:15.040> engines<00:02:15.400> we'll<00:02:15.580> turn

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
there so get the new engines we'll turn

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.160 
there so get the new engines we'll turn
it<00:02:15.880> around<00:02:15.970> pretty<00:02:16.299> quick<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.750> get<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.110> out

in<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.349> water<00:02:17.440> know<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.640> question<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.150> guess

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
in the water know the question I guess

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.500 
in the water know the question I guess
is<00:02:19.630> how<00:02:19.989> what<00:02:20.349> do<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.799> think<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:22.060> repair

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
is how what do you think this repair

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.270 
is how what do you think this repair
will<00:02:22.720> do<00:02:22.870> for<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.140> performer<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.709> boat<00:02:23.950> it

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
will do for the performer to the boat it

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.830 
will do for the performer to the boat it
can<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.549> very<00:02:24.730> interesting<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.239> see<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.690> new

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
can be very interesting to see the new

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
can be very interesting to see the new
70<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.310> strong<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.760> its<00:02:27.880> talk<00:02:28.120> yeah<00:02:28.480> I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
70 is very strong in its talk yeah I

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.229 
70 is very strong in its talk yeah I
anticipate<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:30.489> going<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.700> pick<00:02:30.849> up<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.120> your

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
anticipate it's going to pick up in your

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.330 
anticipate it's going to pick up in your
top-end<00:02:31.390> speed<00:02:31.599> than<00:02:32.440> what<00:02:32.620> you've<00:02:32.769> had<00:02:32.890> fuel

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
top-end speed than what you've had fuel

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.560 
top-end speed than what you've had fuel
economy<00:02:33.519> is<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.329> thing<00:02:34.540> that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
economy is going to be the thing that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.060 
economy is going to be the thing that
you'll<00:02:34.870> really<00:02:35.170> notice<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:35.709> going<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:35.920> cut

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
you'll really notice it's going to cut

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.789 
you'll really notice it's going to cut
the<00:02:36.310> fuel<00:02:36.519> bill<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.820> half<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:38.290> course<00:02:38.560> no

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
the fuel bill in half of course no

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.650 
the fuel bill in half of course no
smoking<00:02:39.250> fumes<00:02:39.549> from<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.910> two-stroke<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:40.600> I

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
smoking fumes from the two-stroke but I

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.330 
smoking fumes from the two-stroke but I
think<00:02:40.870> performance<00:02:41.350> wise<00:02:41.530> you'll<00:02:41.859> find<00:02:42.130> it'll

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
think performance wise you'll find it'll

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.009 
think performance wise you'll find it'll
be<00:02:42.459> very<00:02:42.670> very<00:02:42.970> strong<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.510> other<00:02:43.630> thing<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
be very very strong the other thing and

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.170 
be very very strong the other thing and
they<00:02:44.140> say<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.739> shouldn't<00:02:45.130> put<00:02:45.459> weight<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
they say you shouldn't put weight on the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.300 
they say you shouldn't put weight on the
back<00:02:46.329> of<00:02:46.630> cats<00:02:47.140> particularly<00:02:47.739> little<00:02:48.040> cats
