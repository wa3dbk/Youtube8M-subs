through and I've had this thinking

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.520 
through and I've had this thinking

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
reinforced by my slow cooking

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.320 
reinforced by my slow cooking
experiences<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.610> know<00:02:36.730> if<00:02:36.880> something

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
experiences that you know if something

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.570 
experiences that you know if something
cooks<00:02:37.599> long<00:02:37.810> enough<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.830> first<00:02:39.370> step

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
cooks long enough that that first step

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.330 
cooks long enough that that first step
of<00:02:39.970> cooking<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.780> onions<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.500> celery<00:02:42.099> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
of cooking the onions and celery and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.280 
of cooking the onions and celery and
everything<00:02:42.640> tender<00:02:43.000> first<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.629> really

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
everything tender first is really

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.949 
everything tender first is really
unnecessary<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:46.030> think<00:02:46.239> that's<00:02:46.330> mine

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
unnecessary I just think that's mine

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.979 
somewhere between 35 and 45 minutes
that's<00:04:03.519> all<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.760> takes<00:04:03.910> it's<00:04:04.209> really<00:04:04.569> easy<00:04:04.810> to

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
that's all it takes it's really easy to

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.339 
that's all it takes it's really easy to
do<00:04:05.139> but<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.650> think<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.579> good<00:04:06.880> pasta<00:04:07.450> sauce<00:04:07.690> takes

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.229 
do but I think a good pasta sauce takes
time<00:04:08.709> you<00:04:08.889> can't<00:04:09.220> rush<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:12.040> then<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:13.180> you

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
time you can't rush it and then so you

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.170
