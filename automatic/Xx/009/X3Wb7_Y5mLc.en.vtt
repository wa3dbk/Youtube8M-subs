00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
for the inside I needed to do a little

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.560 
for the inside I needed to do a little
adjustment<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.579> that<00:01:26.609> I<00:01:26.969> could<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.359> sure<00:01:27.539> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
adjustment so that I could be sure that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.330 
adjustment so that I could be sure that
it<00:01:27.840> wasn't<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.469> stick<00:01:28.740> out<00:01:28.920> further

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

than<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:31.079> outside<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:32.810> because<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
than the outside and because of that I

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
than the outside and because of that I

fabric fusion aleene's next we're going
to<00:01:58.200> close<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.770> ranks<00:01:59.249> we're<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.649> hot

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
to close up ranks we're going to hot

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.270 
to close up ranks we're going to hot
glue<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:03.659> seam<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.499> so<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.009> when

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.440 

I'm<00:02:54.930> going<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> peel<00:02:55.470> off<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.030> back<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.240> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
I'm going to peel off the back of the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.860 
I'm going to peel off the back of the
other<00:02:57.600> side<00:03:01.490> let's<00:03:02.490> see<00:03:02.850> where<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.540> want<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> to

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
other side let's see where we want it to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:14.090 
other side let's see where we want it to
close<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:05.550> probably<00:03:10.700> let's<00:03:11.700> go<00:03:13.070> yep

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
close to I think probably let's go yep

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.960 
close to I think probably let's go yep
about<00:03:14.520> right<00:03:14.730> there
