00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
talk to me about what we're seeing okay

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.969 
talk to me about what we're seeing okay
the<00:01:48.520> first<00:01:48.789> picture<00:01:48.999> is<00:01:49.179> a<00:01:49.450> root<00:01:49.840> canal<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.469> to

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
the first picture is a root canal and to

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.730 
the first picture is a root canal and to
the<00:01:51.130> left<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.609> the<00:01:51.819> tooth<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.389> the<00:01:53.170> abscess

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
the left of the tooth is the abscess

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.379 
the left of the tooth is the abscess
that<00:01:53.979> was<00:01:54.159> attached<00:01:54.579> to<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.999> front<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.329> that

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
that was attached to the front of that

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.749 
that was attached to the front of that
tooth<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.139> if<00:01:56.619> you<00:01:56.740> look<00:01:56.770> carefully<00:01:57.159> at<00:01:57.579> the

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
tooth and if you look carefully at the

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.510 
tooth and if you look carefully at the
tooth<00:01:57.999> you'll<00:01:58.659> see<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.259> different<00:01:59.920> materials

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
tooth you'll see the different materials

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.760 
tooth you'll see the different materials
that<00:02:00.759> were<00:02:00.880> put<00:02:01.119> in<00:02:01.299> that<00:02:01.479> tooth<00:02:01.780> all<00:02:02.289> of<00:02:02.619> them

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
that were put in that tooth all of them

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.789 
that were put in that tooth all of them
are<00:02:03.130> not<00:02:03.459> compatible<00:02:03.999> with<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:05.350> energy<00:02:05.530> of

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
are not compatible with the energy of

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.609 
are not compatible with the energy of
that<00:02:06.280> patient<00:02:06.639> they<00:02:07.630> have<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.840> non<00:02:08.140> precious

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
that patient they have a non precious

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.620 
that patient they have a non precious
crown<00:02:08.860> on<00:02:09.130> top<00:02:09.160> they<00:02:09.610> have<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.819> mercury<00:02:10.270> filling

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
crown on top they have a mercury filling

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.410 
crown on top they have a mercury filling
underneath<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.770> produces<00:02:12.430> electrical

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
underneath this produces electrical

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.420 
underneath this produces electrical
current<00:02:13.930> with<00:02:14.320> two<00:02:14.500> different<00:02:14.740> metals

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
current with two different metals

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.750 
current with two different metals
so<00:02:16.030> that's<00:02:16.269> an<00:02:16.480> issue<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.709> we<00:02:17.739> really<00:02:18.219> have<00:02:18.549> to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
so that's an issue so we really have to

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.940 
so that's an issue so we really have to
look<00:02:18.790> at<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.269> carefully<00:02:19.680> related<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.829> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
look at this carefully related to the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.830 
look at this carefully related to the
patient's<00:02:21.459> health<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.969> I<00:02:22.269> was<00:02:22.450> reading<00:02:22.750> in

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
current like a little battery and that's

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.839 
current like a little battery and that's
constantly<00:03:17.010> aggravating<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.250> whole<00:03:18.459> system
