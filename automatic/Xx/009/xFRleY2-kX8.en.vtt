home<00:00:48.970> on<00:00:49.239> national<00:00:49.600> TV<00:00:49.780> would<00:00:50.260> be<00:00:50.380> right<00:00:50.590> up

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
home on national TV would be right up

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.430 
home on national TV would be right up
there<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:51.610> had<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.510> favorite<00:00:52.780> in<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.230> game

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
there you had the favorite in that game

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.110 
there you had the favorite in that game
if<00:00:53.560> I<00:00:53.680> remember<00:00:54.040> on<00:00:54.160> our<00:00:54.280> videos<00:00:54.730> maybe<00:00:54.940> you're

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
if I remember on our videos maybe you're

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.319 
if I remember on our videos maybe you're
trying<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.390> block<00:00:55.600> that<00:00:55.870> out<00:00:56.130> but<00:00:57.130> I<00:00:57.430> think

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
trying to block that out but I think

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.549 
trying to block that out but I think
it's<00:00:58.450> interesting<00:00:58.809> that<00:00:59.170> when<00:00:59.290> you<00:00:59.380> have

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
it's interesting that when you have

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.620 
it's interesting that when you have
teams<00:00:59.950> that<00:01:00.160> don't<00:01:00.460> aren't<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:01.270> net<00:01:01.480> and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
teams that don't aren't in the net and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.389 
teams that don't aren't in the net and
NFL<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.410> different<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.829> worst<00:01:03.040> team<00:01:03.280> the

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
NFL is different the worst team the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.950 
NFL is different the worst team the
colts<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.940> worst<00:01:04.149> team<00:01:04.360> are<00:01:04.540> in<00:01:04.899> the

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
colts the worst team are in the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.510 
colts the worst team are in the
consciousness<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.859> rams<00:01:06.130> on<00:01:06.429> the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
consciousness the rams on the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.639 
consciousness the rams on the
consciousness<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:07.689> these<00:01:07.899> teen<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:08.560> know

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
consciousness but these teen you know

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.440 
consciousness but these teen you know
the<00:01:08.799> 70th<00:01:09.340> or<00:01:09.429> 80th<00:01:09.759> best<00:01:10.030> college<00:01:10.420> football

the 70th or 80th best college football

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.410 
the 70th or 80th best college football
team<00:01:10.929> isn't<00:01:11.289> and<00:01:11.770> i<00:01:12.460> think<00:01:12.670> as<00:01:12.759> a<00:01:12.789> handicapper

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
team isn't and i think as a handicapper

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.819 
team isn't and i think as a handicapper
it's<00:01:13.509> important<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.049> think<00:01:14.200> about<00:01:14.319> what<00:01:14.679> are

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
it's important to think about what are

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.279 
it's important to think about what are
those<00:01:15.009> impressions<00:01:15.689> sometimes<00:01:16.689> impressions

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
those impressions sometimes impressions

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.379 
those impressions sometimes impressions
are<00:01:17.409> things<00:01:17.590> from<00:01:17.740> years<00:01:18.009> ago<00:01:18.069> isn't<00:01:18.999> you<00:01:19.359> know

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:19.389 
are things from years ago isn't you know

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.120 
are things from years ago isn't you know
bay<00:01:19.689> times<00:01:19.959> a<00:01:20.139> pretty<00:01:20.350> good<00:01:20.560> Cole<00:01:20.859> wait<00:01:21.069> a

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
bay times a pretty good Cole wait a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.770 
bay times a pretty good Cole wait a
minute<00:01:21.579> that's<00:01:21.729> basketball<00:01:21.939> I<00:01:22.509> mean

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
minute that's basketball I mean

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.690 
minute that's basketball I mean
literally<00:01:23.079> that's<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.619> way<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:24.069> average<00:01:24.459> fan

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
literally that's the way the average fan

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.340 
literally that's the way the average fan
is<00:01:24.880> thinking<00:01:25.270> about<00:01:25.389> and<00:01:25.810> some<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.259> these

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
is thinking about and some of these

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.800 
is thinking about and some of these
teams<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.799> don't<00:01:27.009> follow<00:01:27.189> closely<00:01:27.579> before<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.719> do

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
teams I don't follow closely before I do

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.679 
teams I don't follow closely before I do
my<00:01:29.049> research<00:01:29.079> I'm<00:01:29.829> kind<00:01:30.399> of<00:01:30.490> struggling<00:01:31.420> to

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
my research I'm kind of struggling to

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.069 
my research I'm kind of struggling to
have<00:01:31.840> any<00:01:32.020> real<00:01:32.289> sense<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.770> anything<00:01:33.100> so

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
have any real sense of anything so

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.199 
have any real sense of anything so
ideally<00:01:35.079> if<00:01:35.499> one<00:01:35.740> memory<00:01:36.130> was<00:01:36.279> positive<00:01:36.850> 40<00:01:37.179> a

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
ideally if one memory was positive 40 a

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.109 
ideally if one memory was positive 40 a
team<00:01:37.630> on<00:01:37.840> one<00:01:38.049> memory<00:01:38.350> was<00:01:38.499> negative<00:01:39.069> we<00:01:39.880> have

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
team on one memory was negative we have

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.330 
team on one memory was negative we have
some<00:01:40.329> potential<00:01:40.840> for<00:01:41.200> value<00:01:41.740> just<00:01:41.950> starting

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
some potential for value just starting

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.980 
some potential for value just starting
from<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.639> in<00:01:42.850> this<00:01:42.999> case<00:01:43.209> both<00:01:43.539> are<00:01:43.779> positive

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
from that in this case both are positive

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.379 
from that in this case both are positive
they<00:01:44.859> kind<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.159> neutralize<00:01:45.700> each<00:01:45.729> other<00:01:46.149> but<00:01:46.329> I

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
they kind of neutralize each other but I

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.260 
they kind of neutralize each other but I
think<00:01:46.689> it<00:01:46.749> was<00:01:46.840> worth<00:01:46.990> talking<00:01:47.289> about<00:01:47.969> as<00:01:48.969> I

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
think it was worth talking about as I

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.580 
think it was worth talking about as I
research<00:01:49.689> this<00:01:49.840> game<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.200> one<00:01:50.380> thing<00:01:50.560> that

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
research this game the one thing that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.389 
research this game the one thing that
really<00:01:50.679> struck<00:01:51.099> me<00:01:51.299> coach<00:01:52.299> holtz<00:01:53.109> said<00:01:54.069> that

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
really struck me coach holtz said that

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.730 
really struck me coach holtz said that
