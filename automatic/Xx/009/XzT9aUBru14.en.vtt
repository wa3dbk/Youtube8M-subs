 pajapita the tomato we are going to mix the oil like the vinegar of the salt and there 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.400
 we would have the pinnacle 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.920

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.330
 i jumps just that 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.630
 so if you think we're going to start making the vinaigrette to have it 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.180
 prepared and we call it with the scrambled and the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.560
