00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
sort of build or like you know setting

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.090 
sort of build or like you know setting
up<00:01:23.909> things<00:01:24.330> around<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.229> creating<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
up things around and creating a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.510 
up things around and creating a
organized<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.090> mean<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.630> will<00:01:27.840> take<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
organized I mean it will take you to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.340 
organized I mean it will take you to
another<00:01:29.520> dimension<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.600> an<00:01:30.869> organized

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
another dimension in an organized

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.460 
another dimension in an organized
fashion<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.159> basically<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:34.290> would

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
fashion so basically I think this would

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
fashion so basically I think this would
be<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.860> awesome<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.939> would<00:01:36.150> allow<00:01:36.509> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
be really awesome if it would allow you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
be really awesome if it would allow you
to<00:01:36.930> move<00:01:37.200> inside<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> dream<00:01:38.280> dimension

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
to move inside the dream dimension

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.490 
to move inside the dream dimension
that'd<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.180> pretty<00:01:39.360> cool<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.900> then<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.350> can

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that'd be pretty cool and then you can

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140 
that'd be pretty cool and then you can
leave<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> dream<00:01:41.130> dimension<00:01:41.310> whenever<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
leave the dream dimension whenever you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.580 
leave the dream dimension whenever you
want<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.899> know<00:01:42.990> what's<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> point

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
want because you know what's the point

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
want because you know what's the point
of<00:01:43.740> having<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.130> dream<00:01:44.310> dimension<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
of having a dream dimension when you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.620 
of having a dream dimension when you
can't<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.590> control<00:01:47.159> anything<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.509> know

can't you know control anything you know
and<00:01:48.899> it'd<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> waste<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.860> time<00:01:50.040> unless

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and it'd just be a waste of time unless

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.630 
and it'd just be a waste of time unless
you're<00:01:50.579> very<00:01:50.880> interested<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.369> terms

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
huh but yeah I think this would be

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.150 
huh but yeah I think this would be
really<00:02:05.340> cool<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.079> someone<00:02:07.079> else<00:02:07.229> tweeted<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
