00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that it's going to perform very very

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.160 
that it's going to perform very very
well<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.450> we're<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> stick<00:00:37.140> with

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
well but we're just going to stick with

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.030 
well but we're just going to stick with
what's<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.250> what's<00:00:38.430> neat<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
what's here what's neat about it and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
what's here what's neat about it and
that<00:00:41.040> they're<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.910> say<00:00:42.120> killer<00:00:42.510> audio

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that they're so they say killer audio

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.680 
that they're so they say killer audio
and<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.860> did<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> rumor<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> word<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and I did the rumor of the word on the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.940 
and I did the rumor of the word on the
street<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.379> audio<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> actually

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
street is that the audio is actually

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.860 
street is that the audio is actually
surprisingly<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:48.059> given<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> form<00:00:48.660> factor

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
surprisingly good given the form factor

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
surprisingly good given the form factor
and<00:00:49.200> given<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> 4<00:00:49.739> hours<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.010> battery<00:00:50.370> life

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and given the 4 hours of battery life

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.069 
and given the 4 hours of battery life
you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.239> remember<00:00:51.629> 4<00:00:51.809> hours

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you can get out of it remember 4 hours

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.500 
you can get out of it remember 4 hours
depends<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> volume<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:53.010> listening<00:00:53.340> at

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
depends on the volume of listening at

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.970 
depends on the volume of listening at
updatable<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> intelligent<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.500> yes<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.860> can

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
updatable and intelligent so yes you can

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.619 
updatable and intelligent so yes you can
update<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.610> firmware<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.480> actually

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
update the firmware so they can actually

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.319 
update the firmware so they can actually
add<00:00:57.930> features<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> future<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.090> back<00:01:00.090> last

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
add features in the future and back last

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.880 
add features in the future and back last
year<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:01.170> added<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.559> feature<00:01:01.770> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
year they actually added a feature that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
year they actually added a feature that
made<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> perform<00:01:02.640> significantly<00:01:02.820> better<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
made it perform significantly better so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.820 
made it perform significantly better so
it<00:01:03.690> looks<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.989> they're<00:01:04.170> very<00:01:04.320> serious<00:01:04.589> about

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
it looks like they're very serious about

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.010 
it looks like they're very serious about

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
jam box from the retail packaging so I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.330 
jam box from the retail packaging so I
do<00:04:03.940> want<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.180> try<00:04:04.300> this<00:04:04.390> out<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:06.010> because<00:04:06.250> I'm

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
do want to try this out just because I'm

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.610 
do want to try this out just because I'm
curious<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.690> let's<00:04:07.840> go<00:04:07.960> ahead<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.320> throw<00:04:08.440> that

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
curious so let's go ahead and throw that

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.270 
curious so let's go ahead and throw that
in<00:04:08.770> there<00:04:08.950> fits<00:04:09.790> snugly<00:04:10.240> but<00:04:10.420> not<00:04:11.130> not<00:04:12.130> too

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
in there fits snugly but not not too

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.780 
in there fits snugly but not not too
difficult<00:04:12.490> to<00:04:12.790> put<00:04:12.940> in

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.520 

and<00:04:17.790> it<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.060> magnetic<00:04:18.419> hey<00:04:19.019> hey<00:04:19.169> look<00:04:19.380> at<00:04:19.500> that

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and it is magnetic hey hey look at that

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.379 
and it is magnetic hey hey look at that
so<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> whole<00:04:20.459> thing<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.699> like<00:04:21.000> super

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
so the whole thing is like super

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.750 
so the whole thing is like super
protected<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.500> go<00:04:22.620> ahead<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.130> open<00:04:23.550> it

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
protected you can go ahead and open it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
protected you can go ahead and open it
up<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:25.580> slide<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.729> out<00:04:26.820> not<00:04:27.449> too<00:04:27.600> difficult

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
up and slide it out not too difficult

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.450 
up and slide it out not too difficult
that'll<00:04:28.229> probably<00:04:28.320> get<00:04:28.590> easier<00:04:28.919> as<00:04:29.070> time<00:04:29.250> goes

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
that'll probably get easier as time goes

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.280 
that'll probably get easier as time goes
on<00:04:29.580> okay<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.770> there<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:33.870> what<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.139> it

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
on okay and there it is so what is it

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.350 
on okay and there it is so what is it
it's<00:04:34.500> basically<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.790> Bluetooth<00:04:36.210> speaker

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
it's basically just a Bluetooth speaker

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.620 
it's basically just a Bluetooth speaker
wit<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.290> they<00:04:37.620> claim<00:04:37.889> can<00:04:38.310> achieve<00:04:38.550> up<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:38.820> 85

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
wit that they claim can achieve up to 85

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.870 
wit that they claim can achieve up to 85
decibels<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.590> can<00:04:40.889> have<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.340> very

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
decibels so you can have a very

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.790 
decibels so you can have a very
different<00:04:42.690> listening<00:04:43.080> experience<00:04:43.620> than

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
different listening experience than

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.409 
different listening experience than
you're<00:04:43.919> used<00:04:43.949> to<00:04:44.220> whether<00:04:44.790> you're<00:04:45.150> playing

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
you're used to whether you're playing

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.200 
you're used to whether you're playing
games<00:04:45.690> on<00:04:46.080> your<00:04:46.320> tablet<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.880> know<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.030> just
