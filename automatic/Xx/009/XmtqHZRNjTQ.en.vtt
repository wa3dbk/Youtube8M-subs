00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.000
 this giant star originated in the great magellanic cloud at 11 million 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.059
 years and is twenty times bigger than the sun 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.190
 its central thermonuclear furnace is transforming hydrogen i need you 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:26.710
 the protons here marked red are joined to neutrons in a rod recurrence yes 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.169
 fit the best 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.170
 the enormous amount of energy released by this nuclear fusion 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.170
 and what allows the stars to shine 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.930
 when no hydrogen is needed to power this 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.290
 process the star's core contracts and its temperature reaches i 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.290
 170 million degrees 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.730
 the surface of the dying star expands until it reaches a diameter 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.560
 twice the distance of the earth from the sun 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.630
 here is the red supergiant over 300 million chinotti 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.210
 subjected to which pressure and with a similar temperature clelio begins to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.000
 merge into carbon and oxygen atoms 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.140
 continues to burn like this for a million years 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.730
 following a series of contractions 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.570
 occur within a thousand years with increasing density and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.170
 of temperature the nuclear fusion subsequently generates mc-1 sodium 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.410
 magnesium is won 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.930
 besides the yahoo and at the end of the iron in the core of a star 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.240
 inside of 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.520
 this super giant and in constant transformation 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.640
 hydrogen envelops the star while the different ones accumulate inside 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.930
 nuclear fusion products with the heaviest substances in the center 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.930
 and the iron begins to contract 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.000
 while the nucleus becomes more and more dense and the temperature exceeds 5 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.169
 billions of free free disintegrates 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.469
 the consequent collapse of the star's core occurs within a few 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.459
 tenths of a second but at that moment in iron falls towards the center of the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.819
 star at the speed of 70 thousand kilometers per second 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.729
 the pressure is normal and pushes the electrons to bond with the protons to 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.239
 form a solid neutron mass the future neutron star 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.219
 with a mass of a billion tons it takes you an inch 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.689
 get rid of this reaction wrong from this cauldron at the speed of 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.689
 light neutrinos float in space 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.939
 gossip 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.930
 at the end the nucleus reaches the end of the collapse 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.250
 and recovers by sending shockwaves endowed with enormous energy towards the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.250
 surface of the star in agony 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.209
 the star is about to become a supernova
