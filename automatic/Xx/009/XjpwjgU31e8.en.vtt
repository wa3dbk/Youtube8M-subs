00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
maybe I'll grow out of the 250 it's very

maybe I'll grow out of the 250 it's very
very<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.320> question<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.939> with<00:01:29.939> Americans

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
very good question and with Americans

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.830 
very good question and with Americans
it's<00:01:30.720> often<00:01:31.259> bigger<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.100> better<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.700> yet<00:01:33.450> we

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it's often bigger is better and yet we

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's often bigger is better and yet we
know<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.310> worldwide<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.939> one

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
know because we see it worldwide and one

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.429 
know because we see it worldwide and one
of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> things<00:01:36.299> about<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
of the things about this this is a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.410 
of the things about this this is a
worldwide<00:01:37.950> motorcycle<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.939> an<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.240> new

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
worldwide motorcycle it's an all new

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.740 
worldwide motorcycle it's an all new
design<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.400> came<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.210> fact<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.570> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
design that that came the fact that it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.139 
design that that came the fact that it's
a<00:01:42.840> single-cylinder<00:01:43.470> engine<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:44.490> enhances

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
a single-cylinder engine really enhances

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.819 
a single-cylinder engine really enhances
a<00:01:45.180> characteristic<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> low<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.680> mid-range

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
a characteristic of low and mid-range

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.460 
a characteristic of low and mid-range
torque<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.720> very<00:01:48.899> important

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
torque and that's really very important

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.380 
torque and that's really very important
because<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> our<00:01:50.310> competition<00:01:50.520> has<00:01:51.090> twin

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
because some of our competition has twin

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.030 
because some of our competition has twin
cylinder<00:01:51.600> engines<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> rub

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
cylinder engines you kind of have to rub

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160 
cylinder engines you kind of have to rub
them<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.280> lot<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.210> motorcycle<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.020> go

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
them a lot but this motorcycle will go

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.039 
them a lot but this motorcycle will go
along<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.680> 60<00:01:56.250> 65<00:01:56.850> 70<00:01:57.360> whatever<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.869> course

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
along at 60 65 70 whatever the course

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
along at 60 65 70 whatever the course
the<00:01:58.170> national<00:01:58.560> speed<00:01:58.770> limit<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.790> fine

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the national speed limit is just fine

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.899 
the national speed limit is just fine
and<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:01.560> know<00:02:01.649> again<00:02:01.920> you'll<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.280> over<00:02:02.399> 200

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909

miles<00:02:03.060> per<00:02:03.149> gallon<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> tank<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.340> it's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
miles per gallon for the tank so it's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.649 
miles per gallon for the tank so it's
one<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.640> those<00:02:05.729> things<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.119> once<00:02:06.450> somebody
