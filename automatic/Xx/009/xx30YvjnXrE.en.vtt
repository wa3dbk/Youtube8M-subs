00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390

the<00:04:46.450> attack<00:04:46.780> but<00:04:46.930> unfortunately<00:04:47.470> this<00:04:47.590> guy

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
the attack but unfortunately this guy

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.770 
the attack but unfortunately this guy
pauses<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.400> game<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.820> he<00:04:49.210> must<00:04:49.390> have<00:04:49.510> had

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
pauses the game and he must have had

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.970 
pauses the game and he must have had
enough<00:04:50.080> I've<00:04:50.290> thought<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.680> he<00:04:50.770> may<00:04:50.920> be

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
enough I've thought that he may be

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.500 
enough I've thought that he may be
making<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.460> change<00:04:51.700> but<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.240> know<00:04:52.360> what's

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
making a change but you know what's

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.850 
making a change but you know what's
coming<00:04:52.750> noticed<00:04:52.990> he<00:04:53.080> has<00:04:53.170> rage<00:04:53.440> quit<00:04:53.710> once

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
coming noticed he has rage quit once

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.230 
coming noticed he has rage quit once
again<00:04:54.100> so<00:04:54.250> that's<00:04:54.400> another<00:04:54.610> rage<00:04:54.880> quit<00:04:55.090> on<00:04:55.180> the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
again so that's another rage quit on the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.850 
again so that's another rage quit on the
cards<00:04:55.480> we've<00:04:55.570> got<00:04:55.690> 500<00:04:56.290> coins<00:04:56.410> for<00:04:56.650> that<00:04:56.740> game

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
cards we've got 500 coins for that game

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.920 
cards we've got 500 coins for that game
he<00:04:57.280> rage<00:04:57.490> quit<00:04:57.520> in<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.880> 86<00:04:58.240> minutes<00:04:58.390> I<00:04:58.690> really

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
he rage quit in the 86 minutes I really

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.300 
he rage quit in the 86 minutes I really
didn't<00:04:59.140> see<00:04:59.170> a<00:04:59.290> point<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.650> but<00:04:59.830> that<00:04:59.950> gives<00:05:00.160> us

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
didn't see a point to but that gives us

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.940 
didn't see a point to but that gives us
our<00:05:00.490> first<00:05:00.700> 3<00:05:01.120> points<00:05:01.480> in<00:05:01.630> online<00:05:02.320> season<00:05:02.620> so

our first 3 points in online season so

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.380 
our first 3 points in online season so
hopefully<00:05:03.070> we<00:05:03.370> can<00:05:03.520> get<00:05:03.610> our<00:05:03.760> division<00:05:04.180> Tim

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
hopefully we can get our division Tim

hopefully we can get our division Tim
really<00:05:04.900> quickly<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.590> maybe<00:05:06.010> we<00:05:06.250> can<00:05:06.400> rack<00:05:06.550> up

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
really quickly and maybe we can rack up
