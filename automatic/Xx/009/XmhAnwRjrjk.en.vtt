so here's one ship was kind of a handful
of<00:00:07.029> multiplayer<00:00:07.450> modes<00:00:07.749> and<00:00:08.019> in<00:00:08.140> gears<00:00:08.349> two

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:08.560 
of multiplayer modes and in gears two

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.050 
of multiplayer modes and in gears two
were<00:00:08.680> really<00:00:08.980> upping<00:00:09.220> the<00:00:09.370> ante<00:00:09.640> by<00:00:09.670> shipping

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.060 
were really upping the ante by shipping

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.030 
were really upping the ante by shipping
with<00:00:10.150> many<00:00:10.420> many<00:00:10.600> more<00:00:10.810> first<00:00:11.650> off<00:00:11.830> we<00:00:11.950> have

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
with many many more first off we have

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.320 
with many many more first off we have
this<00:00:12.130> mode<00:00:12.310> called<00:00:12.550> wingman<00:00:12.880> which<00:00:13.090> is<00:00:13.180> one<00:00:13.300> of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
this mode called wingman which is one of

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.820 
this mode called wingman which is one of
my<00:00:13.450> personal<00:00:13.510> favorites<00:00:14.260> it's<00:00:14.470> basically

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
my personal favorites it's basically

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.310 
my personal favorites it's basically
five<00:00:15.550> teams<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:16.269> two<00:00:16.420> players<00:00:16.720> so<00:00:17.020> it's<00:00:17.140> kind

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
five teams of two players so it's kind

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.470 
five teams of two players so it's kind
of<00:00:17.350> a<00:00:17.470> mix<00:00:17.680> of<00:00:17.890> a<00:00:18.310> free-for-all<00:00:18.880> with<00:00:18.940> a<00:00:19.090> co-op

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
of a mix of a free-for-all with a co-op

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.750 
of a mix of a free-for-all with a co-op
vs<00:00:19.990> experience<00:00:20.500> then<00:00:21.130> we<00:00:21.220> have<00:00:21.310> guardian

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
vs experience then we have guardian

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.189 
vs experience then we have guardian
which<00:00:21.910> is<00:00:22.030> essentially<00:00:22.420> assassination<00:00:23.050> to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
which is essentially assassination to

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.260 
which is essentially assassination to
point<00:00:23.440> o<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:23.740> which<00:00:23.890> each<00:00:24.369> team<00:00:24.699> has<00:00:24.910> a<00:00:24.940> leader

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
point o in which each team has a leader

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.359 
point o in which each team has a leader
and<00:00:25.539> if<00:00:26.170> you<00:00:26.320> take<00:00:26.619> out<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.890> leader<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.130> other

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
and if you take out the leader the other

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.070 
and if you take out the leader the other
team<00:00:27.550> can<00:00:27.760> no<00:00:27.850> longer<00:00:28.029> respawn<00:00:28.539> so<00:00:28.779> that's<00:00:28.960> the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
team can no longer respawn so that's the

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.870 
team can no longer respawn so that's the
goal<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.410> to<00:00:29.560> basically<00:00:29.740> you<00:00:29.980> know<00:00:30.070> get<00:00:30.730> rid<00:00:30.820> of

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
goal is to basically you know get rid of

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.790 
goal is to basically you know get rid of
all<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.150> enemy<00:00:31.359> forces<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.960> then<00:00:32.439> we<00:00:32.560> have<00:00:32.770> a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
all the enemy forces and then we have a

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.260 
all the enemy forces and then we have a
submission<00:00:33.579> which<00:00:33.910> was<00:00:34.060> previously

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
submission which was previously

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.510 
submission which was previously
codenamed<00:00:34.660> meet<00:00:35.050> flag<00:00:35.320> in<00:00:35.560> which<00:00:36.100> there's<00:00:36.399> a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
codenamed meet flag in which there's a

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.549 
codenamed meet flag in which there's a
stranded<00:00:37.390> character<00:00:37.780> that's<00:00:38.050> running<00:00:38.350> around

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
stranded character that's running around

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.900 
stranded character that's running around
the<00:00:38.620> map<00:00:38.800> it's<00:00:39.070> essentially<00:00:39.489> kind<00:00:39.610> of<00:00:39.730> like<00:00:39.820> a

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
the map it's essentially kind of like a

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.150 
the map it's essentially kind of like a
one<00:00:40.450> flag<00:00:40.780> capture<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.410> flag<00:00:41.590> game<00:00:41.920> type

knock him down take him hostage drag

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.660 
knock him down take him hostage drag
them<00:00:44.320> to<00:00:44.350> another<00:00:44.590> point<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:45.160> win<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.520> round

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
them to another point and win the round

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.340 
them to another point and win the round
and<00:00:46.030> all<00:00:46.480> of<00:00:46.600> these<00:00:46.719> modes<00:00:46.930> coming<00:00:47.230> together

scale you want to keep it intimate and
we<00:00:56.350> decided<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.770> bump<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.040> up<00:00:57.070> a<00:00:57.309> little<00:00:57.430> bit

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
we decided to bump that up a little bit

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.010 
we decided to bump that up a little bit
with<00:00:57.730> gears<00:00:57.940> two<00:00:58.149> to<00:00:58.270> go<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.420> five<00:00:58.629> on<00:00:58.660> five

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
with gears two to go to five on five

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.840 
with gears two to go to five on five
five<00:00:59.379> seems<00:00:59.710> like<00:00:59.829> a<00:00:59.860> good<00:01:00.070> kind<00:01:00.340> of<00:01:00.430> number<00:01:00.700> as

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
five seems like a good kind of number as

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.040 
five seems like a good kind of number as
far<00:01:01.030> as<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.180> know<00:01:01.239> your<00:01:01.390> average<00:01:01.450> plan<00:01:01.870> out

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.990 
far as you know your average plan out
there<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.320> about<00:01:02.530> five<00:01:02.770> people<00:01:02.980> we<00:01:03.820> didn't

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
there is about five people we didn't

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.609 
there is about five people we didn't
really<00:01:04.119> want<00:01:04.329> to<00:01:04.360> go<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.540> like<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:05.019> know<00:01:05.049> six

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
than that because we believe that more

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
bit of a scoping ability we made the gun

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.650 
bit of a scoping ability we made the gun
also<00:02:50.130> fully<00:02:50.610> automatic<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.299> slightly

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
also fully automatic but a slightly

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.660 
also fully automatic but a slightly
slower<00:02:51.959> firing<00:02:52.260> rate<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.100> also<00:02:53.370> added<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
slower firing rate and also added the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.190 
slower firing rate and also added the
ability<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:54.000> players<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.450> hit<00:02:54.690> fire<00:02:54.959> to

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
ability for players to hit fire to

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.930 
ability for players to hit fire to
famish<00:02:55.590> shots<00:02:55.830> at<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.250> trade-off<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.640> having

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
famish shots at the trade-off of having

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.090 
famish shots at the trade-off of having
a<00:02:57.000> far<00:02:57.420> more<00:02:57.570> significant<00:02:58.110> kick<00:02:58.320> we<00:02:58.950> also

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
a far more significant kick we also

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.830 
a far more significant kick we also
added<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.640> burst<00:02:59.820> pistol<00:03:00.330> which<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> very

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
added in a burst pistol which is a very

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.050 
added in a burst pistol which is a very
heavy<00:03:01.140> locust<00:03:02.010> pistol<00:03:02.400> called<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.670> Gorgon

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
heavy locust pistol called the Gorgon

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.970 
heavy locust pistol called the Gorgon
and<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.780> incredibly<00:03:04.290> useful<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.860> you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
and this is incredibly useful if you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.550 
and this is incredibly useful if you
take<00:03:05.190> somebody<00:03:05.459> as<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> meet<00:03:06.269> flag<00:03:06.480> hostage<00:03:06.989> you

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
take somebody as a meet flag hostage you

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.780 
take somebody as a meet flag hostage you
carry<00:03:07.799> them<00:03:07.950> around<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.519> have<00:03:08.670> this

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
carry them around and then you have this

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.190 
carry them around and then you have this
pistol<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.480> essentially<00:03:09.780> take<00:03:09.900> out

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
pistol and you can essentially take out

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.110 
pistol and you can essentially take out
enemies<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.650> like<00:03:10.769> two<00:03:10.980> bursts<00:03:11.430> while<00:03:11.940> you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
enemies in like two bursts while you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.460 
enemies in like two bursts while you
have<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.360> defensive<00:03:12.900> shield<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.380> would

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
have this defensive shield that would

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.320 
have this defensive shield that would
protect<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.920> for<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.160> while<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.880> also<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.299> a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
protect you for a while we also have a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.699 
protect you for a while we also have a
metal<00:03:15.600> shield<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.350> carry<00:03:16.500> around

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
metal shield that you can carry around

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.160 
metal shield that you can carry around
once<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.100> get<00:03:17.310> off<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.730> large<00:03:18.480> boomer<00:03:18.870> class

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
once you get off of a large boomer class

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.900 
once you get off of a large boomer class
you<00:03:19.709> can<00:03:19.799> use<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.160> planted<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.820> ground

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
you can use that planted in the ground

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.280 
you can use that planted in the ground
and<00:03:21.269> your<00:03:21.390> enemies<00:03:21.660> can<00:03:21.810> actually<00:03:22.049> kick<00:03:22.200> it

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
and your enemies can actually kick it

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.620 
and your enemies can actually kick it
over<00:03:22.440> as<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> defensive<00:03:23.130> mechanism<00:03:23.450> we<00:03:24.450> have<00:03:24.600> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
over as a defensive mechanism we have a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.150 
over as a defensive mechanism we have a
flamethrower<00:03:25.410> which<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.920> called<00:03:26.070> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
flamethrower which is called the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.650 
flamethrower which is called the
scorcher<00:03:26.610> if<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.850> do<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> perfect<00:03:27.390> active

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
scorcher if you do a perfect active

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.090 
scorcher if you do a perfect active
reload<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.200> shot<00:03:28.440> will<00:03:28.530> actually<00:03:28.829> go<00:03:28.890> further

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
reload the shot will actually go further

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.710 
reload the shot will actually go further
and<00:03:29.400> burn<00:03:29.610> your<00:03:29.760> enemies<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.060> everybody's
