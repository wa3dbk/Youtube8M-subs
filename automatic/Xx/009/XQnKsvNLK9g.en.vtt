 veteran miguel flaño recovered until 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.250
 the 10 balls as head of operations

 a goal of opportunism taking advantage of 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.330
 loose ball in the area and an assist 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.310
 after recovery in the action of 0-2 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.869

 danger and marked differences in the first 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.530

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.830
 pointed the way to victory for the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.600
 Barcelona in palmas with a masterly

 foul shoot was again the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.130
 perfect orchestra conductor 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.140
 azulgrana xavi hernández set shined 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.730
 in the iberostar I stayed for his boots 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.260
 they passed almost all of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.260
 offensive actions of the Catalans 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.140
 despite his youth he is already one of the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.090
 indisputable flagships of this 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.480
 zaragoza that continues treading with force 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.310
 in this first third of the championship 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.989
 víctor rodríguez excelled in the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.940
 triumph of the Aragonese team with two 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.920
 assists and came out cheered of the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.099
 romareda when it was replaced by edu 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.099
 oriole 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.359
 leo messi continues to collect records 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.579
 and has already managed to overcome the 75 goals 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.079
 that marked pele in a calendar year without 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.819
 show your best version the star 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.530
 Argentine was again decisive 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.329
 for your team in mallorca with two 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.019
 new goals that distance him in the 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.019
 race for the top scorer 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.950
 jose mourinho resorted to him in the absence of 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.200
 less than 10 minutes to the conclusion 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.790
 with a tie on the scoreboard and the young man 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.249
 Álvaro Morata did not waste the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.969
 opportunity practically in the first 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.499
 ball he played 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.359
 the canterano connected a header 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.200
 savior that allows madrid 'to maintain 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.200
 the distance with the leader 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.690
 and closing this ideal eleven of the last 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.490
 day we found iago aspas the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.040
 stiletto and great star of the Celtic 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.930
 I see even though his team finished 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.910
 losing the Galician forward shot from 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.010
 speed and completion to sign your 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.290
 first double in the first division and was 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.320
 once again the best of the team of paco 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.320
