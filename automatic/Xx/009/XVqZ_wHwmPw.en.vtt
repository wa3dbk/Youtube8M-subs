 details and that our clients feel at ease one of the requirements 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.710
 more important 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.230
 is the great flexibility we have to celebrate all kinds of events if 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.470

 no column 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.239

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.970
 that is not the option to be able to organize the pallets is a place 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.900
 perfect for the final party

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.160
