 girls love the fantastic four 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.320
 but today's video is full of dust and 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.760
 discouragement because I watched the movie 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.590
 remember i said that two parts 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.850
 fours that were shot at the beginning 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.000
 two thousand years 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.340
 horror so here is crap from josh trunk 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.890
 managed to do so i miss 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 Jessica Alba will try without spoilers 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.239
 although I want to retell the whole 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.160
 the nightmare was created on the screen stupidly to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.040
 no one to let me say cinema 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.780
 did not go two weeks later we have long 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.000
 from all sides and from critics and from 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.640
 fans have heard doubts and scary 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.830
 prophecy new four will be bad 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.320
 I tried not to believe them I can even 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.960
 explain why I like the whole topic 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.509
 the universe namely on the ultimate version 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 foursome based film will say more 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.440
 characters ranging from age and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 finishing with Victor's little beard the background of the house 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.210
 fully consistent with its image in 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.100
 comics except johnny storm but here 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
 separate story so here it should 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.600
 it was a plus but not everyone knows 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.360
 books and comics look good on 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.790
 screen trans read the ultimate concept 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.460
 literally and decided that it is very good 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 idea to take home in the performance of adam kyubi 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.430
 mouth and zafigachit him in a big movie like 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.290
 it turned out this is a very bad idea thought not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 just look like a christmas tree on 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.460
 legged thats food and totally emphasis from i 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.979
 I mean constipation from 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.560
 like a character meaning they took and bad 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.189
 made one of the coolest villains 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.170
 world marvel they made it uninteresting 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.299
 stupid took away his motivation and at least 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.490
 any charisma they gave him 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.799
 unlimited power but he did it not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.390
 took advantage of all the power came down to 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.880
 simple telekinesis 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.000
 and kidaniyu pebbles why I started with 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.640
 thought probably because this dude is stupid 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.040
 deserved the film he got somewhere from 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.019
 force of 10 minutes of the screen in time of two 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.750
 hours let at least in my video yet 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.850
 Minutes two will get and seriously I 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.640
 still at the entrance to the cinema said that 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.799
 if the creators kill doom no 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.220
 another element of the film no matter how many 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.950
 it was good 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.760
 this picture will not save and it did not happen 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.530
 rescued 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.870
 and all because they were not there now 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.940
 I will try to remember at least something good 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.460
 what was in this movie that you need 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.910
 was called fantastic insanity 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.130
 music is not from philip glass waking up 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.400
 after the show there is no demand from him 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.430
 okay but mark bolts frame sound author 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.520
 scream what place did he think or were they stupid 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.190
 did not appear at work again 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.630
 no firstly because the trunk is clearly 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.880
 bit zack sniper 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.340
 fantastic four performed in 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.410
 manâ€™s steel interiors and setting 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.360
 begin to species the big city and 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.300
 ending with the police room for 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.520
 interrogation swear to stena mustache if 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.220
 look in this room under the table 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.990
 find you leave superman's handcuffs in 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.480
 whom he sat there and what actually 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.000
 the same seven resent you ask 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.130
 because you love here and on and i am very 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.470
 I love disi because only Odessa knows how 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.630
 shoot such a dark movie gray 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.480
 fours no predatory gloom no 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.540
 it resembles not make a film noir us 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.459
 or disturbing it is flat and boring in 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.010
 there is not one bright moment 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.260
 negative zone was filmed in the studio 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.170
 noticeable final battle except for 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.300
 bright flashes and portal shrinking as 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.300
 I will say that I do not remember 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.110
 main character powers look either 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.090
 ugly 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.790
 lord rhythm pull something 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.790
 stop stretching in the nude it's 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.140
 horrible or how much you can kick 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.650
 sue containers 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.570
 or stupidly somebody extinguish already Joni 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.700
 he looks like a voodoo doll 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.730
 from this company is the best 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.680
 being by the way it is ben makeup is 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.560
 the author of the only canon in this 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.660
 movie phrases it's time to wet my love 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.030
 college new stories ie this already 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.860
 when half the film is set to become 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.840
 character their learning to use 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.090
 on their own trample in the mud 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.450
 the absence of these characters any 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.729
 charisma and motivation I th storm I want to 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.979
 leave not to be a superhero so what are you 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.150
 here you are fooling and you move a whole year 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.970
 same container 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.460
 and I ret char all cute autists I 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.710
 jump in idiocy end of the film because 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.020
 what go nafig that's why i'm johnny 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.030
 the storm and I am a rebel it is expressed in 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.710
 that i drive in a car when i have and 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.390
 take away i go work twelve 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.630
 hours a day because me dad so 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.280
 I said ben make-up and I basically 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.680
 quite dramatic character 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.380
 who suffers for others but screenwriters 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.479
 believe that three minutes is enough for this 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.000
 show formally it is very good that 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.729
 all heroes are so young this is what sets off 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.830
 film from other but in most of the scenes 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.990
 actors look like three times 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.229
 divorced and the only scene where 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.630
 four allows himself to be young and 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.030
 carefree disaster lead well done 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.130
 Josh Trank correct premise nefig 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.110
 fooling around brilliant youth go 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.330
 work for the army but choose plant 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.430
 place in the cemetery on the youth of heroes 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.450
 can not be written off frank holes which 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.300
 the film is full 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.580
 about reed richards runs away about reed richards 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.630
 returns after a year boot.ini disappeared 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.270
 ben graham 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.550
 offended by reed richards Hungarian looks 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.380
 at him very dissatisfied but everyone forgot about 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.210
 the fact that richard fucked up his life 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.370
 would this not be in this movie 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.130
 far-fetched literally everything except 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.349
 perhaps the friendship of the makeup of eris that is the makeup 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.840
 how would friends atrid just have a brush 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.849
 so many things the viewer must take 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.880
 on faith simply because there so 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:04.810
 said it is nowhere shown by the fund 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.710
 loves you storm, but wherever she just loves anywhere 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.789
 and everything is clear 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.849
 johnny storm is a very cool kid where neither 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.590
 where it is said to you that it is cool 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.870
 heroes make me perfect too 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.789
 uninteresting in them is flat and boring and 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.099
 surroundings in costumes and equipment not 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.800
 catch the eye better go again 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:26.080
 look at the creation of the brand 2 tony starck 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.360
 at least he was not afraid to add red 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.909
 Well, finally, is it worth talking about 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.370
 huge amount of anti-scientific nonsense and 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:36.099
 yes these are comics but phrases that 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.470
 says the characters even just unbearable 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.490
 you almost created a black foil hole 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.289
 and generator 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:46.319
 the matter of the earth changes the food source 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.539
 seriously movie long and hard explains 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.969
 some crap and then don't bother 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.800
 even show how two of 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.169
 four team members got their 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.270
 forces ie no matter how john 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.699
 so she shows in all the details 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.069
 rim yes you can still forget 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.559
 Enough viewers half explanations 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:06.599
 in one word if you listen to this 

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:09.839
 places new fantastic four 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:12.659
 empty dreary colorless film and i don't 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:15.869
 I understand why I had to take it off 2 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:18.089
 points out of 10 with a minus after such on 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:21.149
 the marvel place I would sue and return 

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:24.300
 right to characters by force because about 

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:26.689
 my god in 2017 comes the second 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.249
 part of this fantastic idiocy 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:31.020
 stop them anybody so I 

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:32.819
