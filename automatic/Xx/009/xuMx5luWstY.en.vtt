00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.100
 and 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.850
 welcome to photoshop point fr 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.250
 today we present you the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.860
 panasonic lumix zx1 is the successor of 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.720
 lx5 an expert compact marketed in 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.599
 2010 by panasonic 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.210
 so this new this new compact 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.260
 expert largely takes up the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.699
 design of its predecessor but evolves 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.340
 greatly at the level of the goal of the 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.260
 sensor for example whose side objectives 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.470
 we now have a leica goal 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.690
 dc vario semi luxury 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.180
 so we have the same area the same amplitude 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.970
 except that the opening this time the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.829
 the maximum opening is at 1 4 which 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.649
 allows a better a better return 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.630
 the light in the camera 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.670
 then the lx is taking advantage of a new 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.340
 10 megapixel mos sensor 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.980
 so the predecessor sound and is equipped 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.379
 a high- performance ccd sensor 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.719
 but the semo this duel x is getting of 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.369
 best results both in photo 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.759
 than in video since it is now 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.979
 able to record in 1080p to 50 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.709
 frames per second on the back the 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.840
 panasonic lumix elik 7 is equipped with a 

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:18.830
 3 inch lcd tft display displaying a 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.600
 resolution of 920 1000 points 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.250
 the difference with the lx5 sound 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.110
 predecessor was that the resolution of 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.690
 the screen was limited to four hundred 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.210
 sixty thousand points for the same 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.460
 diagonal on the lens the panasonic 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.560
 lumix helix is ​​allows you to change 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.340
 picture format as you can see 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.860
 right here it's very simple button and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.940
 good quality 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.710
 then justice can be selected there 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.080
 the focus method so if you 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.390
 manual focus or 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.210
 automatic 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.430
 and finally we have a ring that allows 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.979
 to choose the aperture of the diaphragm 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.950
 the camera so this wave is 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.590
 totally disabled in automatic mode 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.440
 here put available in all 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.229
 other modes at the level of 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.090
 manual point 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.940
 here we have at a button named focus 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:22.550
 which allows to focus 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:23.239
 very quickly also here is the setting 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.980
 Point made 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.709
 it is thanks to this button there is very 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.120
 sensitive where were enough attention 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.940
 about the menus the panasonic lumix 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.130
 helix is ​​a design we have 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.959
 the habit of seeing on his other 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.300
 models whose operation is very 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.920
 simple just move a shot 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.400
 left to go from a tab to 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.370
 the other then a shot to the right we get 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.080
 found in the east in the east on 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.180
 different settings so drawing on 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.470
 scroll the screens as you are this 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.940
 is to configure a right shot and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.330
 we still have a submenu that appears 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.769
 it was brought here it is very effective 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.900
 works very well of course especially from 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.380
 brand models 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.480
 so panasonic mexico 7 offers 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.430
 a simple grip for 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.720
 for all types of users 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.099
 despite these expert features 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.319
 then at the screen of the sockets 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:23.510
 from view we always have two buttons 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.010
 menu that allows you to configure the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.040
 mode features 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.940
 selected 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.200
 unlike the tactile models of the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.269
 mark here we can not customize it 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.430
 obviously of course the 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.910
 panasonic lumix elixens does not just have 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.010
 qualities 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.870
 even though its image quality is very 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.700
 satisfactory as is the quality 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.230
 video 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.569
 he's suffering from a little focus 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.400
 slow inside or when the 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.750
 light runs out outside it 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.549
 is no problem with option 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.700
 focus it's instant this 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.129
 interior shot the the focus on 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.769
 does about in less than a second one 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.989
 will say but it's particularly slow 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.329
 compared to some compact of the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.280
 same category that offers all the same 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.620
 a very very fast focus is 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.859
 almost instant inside and even 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.930
 in low light 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.660
 I let you discover in our test 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.419
 panasonic lumix helix is ​​safe 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.650
