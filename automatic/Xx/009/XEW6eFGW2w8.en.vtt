00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.330
 match between poorly ranked teams and 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.760
 nîmes 16th accomodates châteauroux 19th 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.350
 the Nîmes are also deprived of omrani 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.170
 and the wounded yard especially me barillon 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.210
 and sissoko suspended two very players 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.370
 important 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.190
 side castelroussin roudet head and 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.930
 makengo are missing it's stéphanie 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.580
 will tell who will arbitrate this 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.470
 very important meeting 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.000
 châteauroux won only one 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.699
 match this season and comes out of a 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.400
 catastrophic encounter a defeat 5 2 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.620
 at home against nancy 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.330
 the Nîmes with their audience who 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.839
 shoot are the first to go to 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.449
 the attack 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.870
 a first frame shot repelled by the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.460
 goblet guardian landry goody 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.740
 a first interesting attack the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.330
 reaction of the men of pascal gastian 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.780
 is expected but there is no 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.400
 reaction 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.220
 it's nimes that continue to dominate 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.210
 new attempt from afar but that does not 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.040
 not pass nimes is undefeated at home 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.159
 a win and three draws 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.869
 to the costières and the desire to continue 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.300
 for josé pasqualetti's players on 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.700
 this rhythm but be careful anyway to 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.750
 Châteauroux who finally obtain a 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.750
 opportunity in this match 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.250
 Nîmes dropped significantly after 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.640
 a win and five draws of 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.310
 after 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.290
 the Olympic Nimes comes out of his first 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.660
 defeat of the season 2-0 at sochaux 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.100
 so it's very reassuring in the 24th 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.850
 minute of open the score for the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.320
 crocos 1-0 thanks to anthony koura 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.180
 fourth goal of the season court has very 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.180
 well served by any wire or Maoulida 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.190
 it is very well gone for the nîmes 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.080
 who insist with always maoulida who 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.880
 try to trigger the right actions 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.610
 there will be no additional action 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.319
 in this first period 1 0 in the mid 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.319
 time in favor of the local team 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.250
 châteauroux still time to return 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.940
 a single opportunity for 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.769
 castelroussins 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.050
 but the Berry will not give up 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.420
 like that she was in any case reassured 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.640
 in defense after sales and that's a lot 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.080
 goals against nancy 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.630
 but in the second half nimes get 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.220
 other incredible opportunities can 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.950
 do not see the second goal nîmois on 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.319
 this action with a bouncing ball 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.830
 and which is unobstructed on the line 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.610
 the goal against his side was not far 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.770
 chateauroux which has instead a 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.330
 chance to come back very nice parade of 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.750
 mathieu michel asked for the 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.640
 first time of the match a beautiful parade 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 important to get in the legs because 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.090
 Chateauroux is trying to get hold of 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.519
 other occasions it is very very good 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.180
 built but it goes over no 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.430
 success 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.510
 lack of accuracy in the last 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.530
 gesture for the players of the Berry 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.120
 it takes a much better second 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.400
 period than the first but it does not happen 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.769
 no and nîmes goes back to the attacked with this 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.950
 center back the recovery 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:21.640
 completely missed his pass very very 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.260
 far from the frame 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.370
 it was an opportunity to take shelter 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.230
 scoring a second goal the match 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.340
 coming to an end 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.650
 chateauroux does not have much time 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.060
 and watch out for this peace seen in defense 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.650
 the second goal maybe for nîmes 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.650
 saved by landry goodfoi 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:48.459
 it was almost a gift for the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:51.820
 but there is not much left 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.870
 time and the match that ends on this 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.450
 score of 1 0 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.769
 victory of Nimes the first since the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.340
 first day she does a lot of 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.930
 well 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.930
 on its side Châteauroux remains relegated 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.030
 I
