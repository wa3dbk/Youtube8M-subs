00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
take it above my crease this is gonna be

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.170

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
like the darker crease color make sure

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.990 
like the darker crease color make sure
you<00:02:27.269> tap<00:02:27.450> off<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.599> excess<00:02:28.049> as<00:02:28.230> well<00:02:28.439> and<00:02:29.000> then

you tap off the excess as well and then

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.059 
you tap off the excess as well and then
I<00:02:30.239> find<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.959> helps<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.530> keep<00:02:31.769> your<00:02:31.950> eye

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.160 
I find it helps if you keep your eye
open<00:02:32.389> especially<00:02:33.389> if<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.659> asian<00:02:34.049> eyes
