production unit just several months ago
we're<00:00:17.250> showing<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.910> at<00:00:18.090> brand<00:00:18.779> new<00:00:18.869> concept<00:00:19.380> TJ

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
we're showing up at brand new concept TJ

we're showing up at brand new concept TJ
12<00:00:20.900> this<00:00:21.900> might<00:00:22.080> surprise<00:00:22.289> some<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.240> but

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
12 this might surprise some of you but

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.410 
12 this might surprise some of you but
we<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.230> early<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.180> it's<00:00:27.180> likely

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
we have this so early but it's likely

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.120 
we have this so early but it's likely
we're<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.439> producing<00:00:28.920> this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we're not going to be producing this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.679 
we're not going to be producing this
until<00:00:29.550> maybe<00:00:29.730> sometime<00:00:30.119> next<00:00:30.150> year<00:00:30.390> there's

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
until maybe sometime next year there's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.820 
until maybe sometime next year there's
still<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> lot<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.170> things<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.679> need<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
still a lot of things that we need to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.610 
still a lot of things that we need to
experiment<00:00:32.660> first<00:00:33.660> thing<00:00:33.840> come<00:00:33.989> outside<00:00:34.200> you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
experiment first thing come outside you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
experiment first thing come outside you
can<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.030> made<00:00:36.239> primarily<00:00:36.780> out

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
can see this will be made primarily out

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.310 
can see this will be made primarily out
of<00:00:37.290> aluminum<00:00:38.390> okay<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.450> if<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.809> take<00:00:40.020> off<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
of aluminum okay so if I take off the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
of aluminum okay so if I take off the
side<00:00:40.559> panel<00:00:40.860> you'll<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.100> why<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.450> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
side panel you'll see why this is so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.959 
side panel you'll see why this is so
experimental<00:00:44.780> okay<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.219> six

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
experimental okay right here we have six

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.910 
experimental okay right here we have six
graphic<00:00:48.539> cards<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.260> double<00:00:49.770> with

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
graphic cards you have all double with

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.760 
graphic cards you have all double with
graphic<00:00:50.760> cards<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.270> plenty<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> gaps<00:00:52.500> in

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
graphic cards and plenty of gaps in

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.590 
graphic cards and plenty of gaps in
between<00:00:52.800> obviously<00:00:53.699> there's<00:00:53.879> no<00:00:53.969> motherboard

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
between obviously there's no motherboard

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.020 
between obviously there's no motherboard
that's<00:00:55.199> designed<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.160> accept<00:00:56.550> cars

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that's designed like this to accept cars

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
that's designed like this to accept cars
lay<00:00:57.600> down<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.309> did<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.520> we

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
lay down this way so what we did is we

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.889 
lay down this way so what we did is we
use<00:01:00.600> rise<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.199> ribbon<00:01:01.559> cables<00:01:02.149> inside<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
use rise of ribbon cables inside to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.090 
use rise of ribbon cables inside to
route<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> another<00:01:06.330> lay<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> case<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
route to the another lay of the case so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.090 
route to the another lay of the case so
that<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.520> slide<00:01:09.240> your<00:01:09.270> graphics<00:01:09.869> card

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
that you can slide your graphics card

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
that you can slide your graphics card
more<00:01:11.100> spaced<00:01:11.369> out<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.720> gives<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
more spaced out and this gives you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
more spaced out and this gives you
ability<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.799> air<00:01:14.010> cool<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.549> these<00:01:14.820> card<00:01:15.180> as

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
ability to air cool all these card as

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
ability to air cool all these card as
opposed<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.530> water<00:01:16.710> coolant<00:01:17.070> for

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
opposed to going to water coolant for

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.899 
opposed to going to water coolant for
this<00:01:17.840> but<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.790> this<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this but as you can see because this is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.420 
this but as you can see because this is
a<00:01:20.939> sort<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> concept<00:01:22.259> case<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.770> rather

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
a sort of like a concept case is rather

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.060 
a sort of like a concept case is rather
deep<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> bottom<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> case<00:01:25.890> we

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
deep so on the bottom of the case we

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.390 
deep so on the bottom of the case we
have<00:01:26.220> three<00:01:26.490> 180<00:01:27.180> millimeter<00:01:27.600> fans<00:01:28.100> plus<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
have three 180 millimeter fans plus you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.359 
have three 180 millimeter fans plus you
can<00:01:29.640> replace<00:01:30.060> these<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.530> 10<00:01:31.770> 100

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
can replace these with up to 10 100

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.480 
can replace these with up to 10 100
hundred<00:01:32.520> millimeter<00:01:32.970> pan<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
hundred millimeter pan if you like the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.380 
hundred millimeter pan if you like the
power<00:01:35.700> supplies<00:01:36.619> supports<00:01:37.670> two<00:01:38.670> over<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.180> on

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
power supplies supports two over here on

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.289 
power supplies supports two over here on
the<00:01:39.509> back<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.930> also<00:01:40.740> two<00:01:41.729> more<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> front

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the back and also two more in the front

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.000 
the back and also two more in the front
if<00:01:42.540> you

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
if you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.580 
if you
need<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.310> install<00:01:43.690> all<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.750> graphics<00:01:45.200> card

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
need to install all the graphics card

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.640 
need to install all the graphics card
here<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.760> we<00:01:47.090> also<00:01:47.360> give<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:47.810> separate

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
here and we also give you separate

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
brackets as a concept that you can

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.740 
brackets as a concept that you can
replace<00:01:52.370> one<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:52.730> these<00:01:52.850> past<00:01:53.120> class<00:01:53.390> if<00:01:53.630> you

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
replace one of these past class if you

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.870 
replace one of these past class if you
don't<00:01:53.930> need<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.290> have<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.800> many<00:01:55.370> of<00:01:55.520> them<00:01:55.700> and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
don't need to have that many of them and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.290 
don't need to have that many of them and
install<00:01:56.720> SSDs<00:01:57.380> instead<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.790> addition<00:01:58.940> to

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300

we<00:02:04.220> still<00:02:04.460> don't<00:02:04.640> know<00:02:04.700> if<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.120> actually

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
we still don't know if this is actually

we still don't know if this is actually
feasible<00:02:06.050> without<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.710> cables<00:02:07.100> but<00:02:07.450> now

now<00:02:15.790> but<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.820> think<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.630> concept<00:02:17.960> will<00:02:18.140> be<00:02:18.290> very

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
now but I think the concept will be very

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.490 
now but I think the concept will be very
interesting<00:02:19.010> for<00:02:19.130> people<00:02:19.690> into<00:02:20.690> scientific

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
interesting for people into scientific

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.070 
interesting for people into scientific
calculation<00:02:22.280> or<00:02:22.460> people<00:02:23.300> doing<00:02:23.570> folding<00:02:23.960> and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
calculation or people doing folding and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.770 
calculation or people doing folding and
all<00:02:24.950> sorts<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.280> things<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:26.330> will<00:02:26.540> really

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
all sorts of things this will really

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.840 
all sorts of things this will really
give<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.230> lot<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.640> computational<00:02:28.640> power

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
give you a lot of computational power

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.960 
give you a lot of computational power
with<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.160> utilization<00:02:31.160> with<00:02:31.310> graphics<00:02:31.670> cards
