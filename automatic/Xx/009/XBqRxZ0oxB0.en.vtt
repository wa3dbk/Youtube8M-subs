00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
is way down there which means there's

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.059 
is way down there which means there's
more<00:01:31.179> material<00:01:31.869> up<00:01:32.049> here<00:01:32.079> and<00:01:32.469> it<00:01:32.590> just<00:01:32.889> makes

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
more material up here and it just makes

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.690 
more material up here and it just makes
the<00:01:33.340> blade<00:01:33.749> basically<00:01:34.749> more<00:01:34.959> durable

stronger and you see it does have a
darker<00:01:38.679> gray<00:01:38.889> coding<00:01:39.840> right<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.079> that<00:01:41.259> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
darker gray coding right and that the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.019 
darker gray coding right and that the

know with Steel's it's not just the type

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.920 
know with Steel's it's not just the type
of<00:02:14.079> steel<00:02:14.409> but<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:14.829> also<00:02:15.069> like

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
of steel but it's also like

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.179 
of steel but it's also like
heat<00:02:16.109> treatment<00:02:16.409> they<00:02:16.799> use<00:02:17.269> okay<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:19.189> can

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
heat treatment they use okay and I can

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.020 
heat treatment they use okay and I can
basically<00:02:20.549> feel<00:02:21.120> by<00:02:21.359> touch<00:02:21.719> that<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.409> is<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
basically feel by touch that this is a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.449 
basically feel by touch that this is a
pretty<00:02:24.030> crappy<00:02:24.629> version<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.890> steel<00:02:26.219> let

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
pretty crappy version of that steel let

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.959 
pretty crappy version of that steel let
me<00:02:26.519> just<00:02:26.730> say<00:02:26.909> that<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.549> price<00:02:29.909> point

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
me just say that but at this price point

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.360 
me just say that but at this price point
you<00:02:30.569> know<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.260> can't<00:02:31.500> expect<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.129> rose

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
you know you you can't expect a rose

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.360 
you know you you can't expect a rose
garden<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.480> notice<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.139> it<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:35.189> is<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
garden and notice that it this is a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.520 
garden and notice that it this is a
drought<00:02:35.730> wall<00:02:35.939> it's<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.150> modified<00:02:36.689> drop<00:02:37.139> point

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
drought wall it's a modified drop point

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.740 
drought wall it's a modified drop point
because<00:02:37.889> it<00:02:38.040> starts<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.579> drop<00:02:38.819> way<00:02:39.180> back<00:02:39.420> here

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
because it starts to drop way back here

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.869 
because it starts to drop way back here
that's<00:02:39.900> why<00:02:40.139> they<00:02:40.290> call<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.889> modified<00:02:41.430> drop

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
that's why they call it a modified drop

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.140 
that's why they call it a modified drop
point<00:02:42.239> but<00:02:43.170> notice<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.189> knife<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.579> extra

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
point but notice that the knife is extra

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.759 
point but notice that the knife is extra
wide<00:02:45.389> and<00:02:46.010> extra<00:02:47.269> thick<00:02:48.269> for<00:02:48.900> its<00:02:49.079> length<00:02:49.409> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
wide and extra thick for its length the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.270 
wide and extra thick for its length the
blade<00:02:50.010> length<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.549> this<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.409> 3<00:02:52.409> and<00:02:52.439> 1/2<00:02:52.829> inches

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
blade length on this is 3 and 1/2 inches

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.899 
blade length on this is 3 and 1/2 inches
all<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:55.169> you<00:02:56.069> know<00:02:56.099> what<00:02:56.220> does<00:02:56.519> all<00:02:56.730> this

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
all right so you know what does all this

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.289 
all right so you know what does all this
mean<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.930> basically<00:02:58.829> means<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.669> this<00:02:59.909> is<00:03:00.150> an

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
mean it basically means that this is an

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.429 
mean it basically means that this is an
ugly<00:03:00.629> but<00:03:01.319> effective<00:03:01.980> beater<00:03:02.790> knife<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:04.200> is

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
ugly but effective beater knife this is

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.580 
ugly but effective beater knife this is
for<00:03:04.859> for<00:03:05.849> heavy-duty<00:03:06.419> work<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.139> cutting

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
for for heavy-duty work and cutting

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.349 
for for heavy-duty work and cutting
tasks<00:03:08.129> look<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.489> nice<00:03:08.700> belly<00:03:09.030> there

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
tasks look at the nice belly there

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.390 
tasks look at the nice belly there
because<00:03:09.719> it's<00:03:09.900> extra<00:03:10.290> wide<00:03:10.469> it<00:03:10.950> just<00:03:11.189> gives

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
because it's extra wide it just gives

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.240 
because it's extra wide it just gives
you<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.579> more<00:03:12.060> fuller<00:03:12.599> belly<00:03:12.989> alright<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.189> you

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
you a more fuller belly alright so you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.099 
you a more fuller belly alright so you
could<00:03:14.549> get<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.730> lot<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.180> work<00:03:15.389> done<00:03:15.719> with<00:03:15.959> this

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
could get a lot of work done with this

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.470 
could get a lot of work done with this
knife<00:03:16.409> all<00:03:17.219> right<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.549> yet<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:17.969> crappy

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
knife all right and yet it is crappy

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.330 
knife all right and yet it is crappy
steel<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.409> might<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.769> know<00:03:19.919> you're<00:03:20.220> gonna

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
steel you might you know you're gonna

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.069 
steel you might you know you're gonna
have<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.639> resharpen<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.510> when<00:03:21.659> you're<00:03:21.810> done

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
have to resharpen it when you're done

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.770 
have to resharpen it when you're done
and<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:23.459> handle<00:03:23.879> gives<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> good<00:03:24.510> grip<00:03:24.750> to

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
and the handle gives you a good grip to

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.500 
and the handle gives you a good grip to
this<00:03:25.260> knife<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.889> know<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.280> not<00:03:26.459> even<00:03:26.940> meant

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
this knife you know it's not even meant

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.920 
this knife you know it's not even meant
it's<00:03:28.199> not<00:03:28.290> meant<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.829> be<00:03:28.919> easy<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.489> carry<00:03:29.930> I

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
it's not meant to be easy to carry I

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.289 
it's not meant to be easy to carry I
don't<00:03:31.500> know<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.769> exact<00:03:32.489> weight<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.180> you

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
don't know the exact weight but as you

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.240 
don't know the exact weight but as you
can<00:03:33.479> imagine<00:03:33.569> it's<00:03:34.139> it's<00:03:34.500> fairly<00:03:34.889> heavy

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
can imagine it's it's fairly heavy

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.300 
can imagine it's it's fairly heavy
because<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.609> about<00:03:36.000> twice<00:03:36.359> as<00:03:36.599> wide<00:03:36.900> as<00:03:37.349> most

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
because it's about twice as wide as most

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.890 
because it's about twice as wide as most
knives<00:03:38.639> of<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.329> same<00:03:39.859> length<00:03:41.689> right<00:03:42.689> but<00:03:42.870> I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
knives of the same length right but I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.170 
knives of the same length right but I
don't<00:03:43.139> think<00:03:43.409> this<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.620> meant<00:03:44.060> necessarily<00:03:45.060> as

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
don't think this is meant necessarily as

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.460 
don't think this is meant necessarily as
EDC<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.859> is<00:03:47.069> meant<00:03:47.459> as<00:03:47.849> a<00:03:48.180> beater<00:03:48.689> knife<00:03:49.019> when

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
EDC this is meant as a beater knife when

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.490 
EDC this is meant as a beater knife when
you<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:49.799> some<00:03:50.159> heavy<00:03:50.659> cutting<00:03:51.659> tasks<00:03:52.259> that

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
you have some heavy cutting tasks that

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.170 
you have some heavy cutting tasks that
you<00:03:52.650> know<00:03:52.859> you're<00:03:53.099> gonna<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.819> know<00:03:53.970> you're

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
you know you're gonna you know you're

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.210 
you know you're gonna you know you're
gonna<00:03:54.359> have<00:03:54.919> in<00:03:55.919> your<00:03:56.189> workday<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:59.040> does

gonna have in your workday and it does

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.280 
gonna have in your workday and it does
have<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.489> secondary<00:04:00.090> lock<00:04:00.419> here<00:04:00.689> a<00:04:00.720> manual

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
have a secondary lock here a manual

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.890 
have a secondary lock here a manual
secondary<00:04:01.949> lock<00:04:02.280> which<00:04:02.909> prevents<00:04:03.479> the<00:04:03.659> liner

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
secondary lock which prevents the liner

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.679 
secondary lock which prevents the liner
from<00:04:04.579> disengaging<00:04:05.579> I'm<00:04:05.939> not<00:04:06.150> sure<00:04:06.329> why<00:04:06.509> they

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
from disengaging I'm not sure why they

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.330 
from disengaging I'm not sure why they
put<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:06.959> on<00:04:07.259> there

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
put that on there

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.629 
put that on there
I<00:04:08.400> guess<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.329> for<00:04:09.509> extra<00:04:09.840> security<00:04:10.470> but<00:04:11.280> I

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
I guess just for extra security but I

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.699 
I guess just for extra security but I
don't<00:04:12.419> think<00:04:12.569> that's<00:04:12.750> really<00:04:13.019> needed<00:04:13.229> on<00:04:13.500> this

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
don't think that's really needed on this

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.719 
don't think that's really needed on this
knife<00:04:13.949> because<00:04:14.220> you're<00:04:14.340> not<00:04:14.489> necessarily

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
knife because you're not necessarily

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.719
