chopping off my own thumb but if I got a
hundred<00:02:37.570> grand<00:02:37.870> then<00:02:38.500> I'm<00:02:39.070> probably<00:02:39.730> sure

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
hundred grand then I'm probably sure

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.490 
hundred grand then I'm probably sure
they<00:02:40.480> will<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:42.130> as<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.340> runescape<00:02:42.820> GP<00:02:43.600> that

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
they will but as for runescape GP that

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.160 
they will but as for runescape GP that
really<00:02:44.800> doesn't<00:02:45.160> count<00:02:45.550> now<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.450> could<00:02:46.870> say

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
really doesn't count now you could say

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.500 
really doesn't count now you could say
well<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.770> could<00:02:48.040> sell<00:02:48.370> your<00:02:48.610> runescape<00:02:48.820> GP

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
well you could sell your runescape GP

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.480 
well you could sell your runescape GP
but<00:02:49.930> then<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.350> would<00:02:50.470> basically<00:02:50.680> be<00:02:50.920> risking

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
but then it would basically be risking

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.320 
but then it would basically be risking
your<00:02:51.640> account<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.590> could<00:02:53.890> get<00:02:54.100> banned<00:02:54.400> so

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
your account and you could get banned so

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.350 
your account and you could get banned so
