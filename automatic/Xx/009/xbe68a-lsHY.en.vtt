distinct<00:01:52.190> but<00:01:52.520> they're<00:01:52.760> still<00:01:53.330> there<00:01:53.659> and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
distinct but they're still there and

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.340 
distinct but they're still there and
still<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.530> it's<00:01:54.710> hard<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.070> gives<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:56.320> know<00:01:57.320> I

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
still the it's hard it gives it I know I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.090 
still the it's hard it gives it I know I
really<00:01:57.740> do<00:01:57.890> like<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.310> wood

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.240 

it<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> warmer<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.540> lot<00:02:04.040> deeper<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it is warmer and it's a lot deeper I

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.059

top

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.490 
top
I<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.539> Anglin<00:02:09.869> table<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> first

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
I think the Anglin table was the first

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.199 
I think the Anglin table was the first
one<00:02:10.709> because<00:02:11.310> serious<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.940> give<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
one because serious is going to give it

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.330 
one because serious is going to give it
a<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:13.020> bit<00:02:13.319> more<00:02:13.440> articulate<00:02:13.920> sound<00:02:14.160> and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
a little bit more articulate sound and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.510 
a little bit more articulate sound and
this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> little<00:02:14.880> more<00:02:15.319> warm<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.770> less

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
this is a little more warm and less

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.140 
this is a little more warm and less
