 hello today under the online video with you 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.469
 Yuri Sidorenko and Nikon Superzum 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.859

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.019
 thanks to the large exhibition apparatus 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.699
 convenient to hold with one right hand on 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:36.870
 the top panel has

 placed the shutter button 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.260
 and also the switch was going through broaches 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.970
 notice the extended

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.390
 it brought some useful

 bright sunlight at the back 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.500

 and before shooting you can install another 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.270
 the ratio of shutter speed and aperture that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.960
 allows you to quickly implement

 optical camera stabilization 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.379
 adds a couple of steps to the exposure 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.260
 this picture was taken by the structure

 This picture was taken of the bank of the Dnieper. 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.979
 pay attention to the margin of sharpness
