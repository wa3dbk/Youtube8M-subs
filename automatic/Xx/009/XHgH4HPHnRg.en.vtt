just<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.520> 2d<00:00:32.910> cube<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.840> hit<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.290> check<00:00:34.860> mark

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
just a 2d cube so we hit the check mark

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.370 
just a 2d cube so we hit the check mark
on<00:00:35.219> smart<00:00:35.520> dimension<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:36.690> done

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
on smart dimension and now we're done

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 
on smart dimension and now we're done
drawing<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.430> we'll<00:00:38.579> hit<00:00:38.730> exit<00:00:39.270> sketch<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you see the dimensions or we can go

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
you see the dimensions or we can go
ahead<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.410> type<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> physical

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
ahead and just type in a physical

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.760 
ahead and just type in a physical
dimension<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.300> six<00:00:54.539> inches

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
dimension we want it to be six inches

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.180 
dimension we want it to be six inches
and<00:00:56.239> from<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> sketch<00:00:57.600> playing<00:00:57.930> blind<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and from the sketch playing blind and in

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
and from the sketch playing blind and in
the<00:01:00.030> upward<00:01:00.480> direction

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the upward direction

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.260 
the upward direction
now<00:01:01.739> we'll<00:01:01.980> hit<00:01:02.100> check<00:01:02.489> mark<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> there's<00:01:03.120> our

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
now we'll hit check mark and there's our

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.539 
now we'll hit check mark and there's our
cue<00:01:03.539> let's<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.500> ahead<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> draw<00:01:05.040> some<00:01:05.309> holes

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
cue let's go ahead and draw some holes

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.000 
cue let's go ahead and draw some holes
in<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.939> cube<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.020> again<00:01:07.290> we'll<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.619> sketch

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
in this cube so again we'll go sketch

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.280 
in this cube so again we'll go sketch
I'm<00:01:08.820> gonna<00:01:09.000> select<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.450> plane<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
I'm gonna select the plane or the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
I'm gonna select the plane or the
surface<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.430> want<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> sketch<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.290> select

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
surface that we want to sketch on select

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.140 
surface that we want to sketch on select
a<00:01:13.409> hole<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:15.560> draw<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> hole<00:01:16.979> now<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.549> need<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
a hole and draw that hole now we need to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.840 
a hole and draw that hole now we need to
dimension<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.720> hole<00:01:19.009> its<00:01:20.009> location<00:01:20.670> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
dimension that hole its location so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
dimension that hole its location so
we'll<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.479> three<00:01:21.840> inches<00:01:22.020> from<00:01:22.409> that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
we'll say it's three inches from that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.179 
we'll say it's three inches from that
edge<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:23.960> we'll<00:01:24.960> say<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.740> three

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
edge and then we'll say it is three

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.730 
edge and then we'll say it is three
inches<00:01:26.580> from<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> edge

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.570 

that's<00:01:31.920> not<00:01:32.100> working<00:01:32.490> smart<00:01:33.060> dimension<00:01:34.580> this

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
that's not working smart dimension this

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.490 
that's not working smart dimension this
edge<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.840> three<00:01:37.409> inches<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.580> go

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
edge and go three inches there we go

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.880 
edge and go three inches there we go
three<00:01:40.500> inches<00:01:40.680> now<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:41.550> want<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> be

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
three inches now we also want it to be

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.649 
three inches now we also want it to be
three<00:01:43.890> inches<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.909> am<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.509> what

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
three inches and I am you know what

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.850 
three inches and I am you know what
let's<00:01:45.810> make<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.960> three<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.350> half<00:01:46.470> inches<00:01:46.799> in

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
let's make it three and a half inches in

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.120 
let's make it three and a half inches in
diameter<00:01:47.690> hit<00:01:48.690> smart<00:01:49.020> dimension<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.800> hit

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
diameter hit smart dimension and hit

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.070 
diameter hit smart dimension and hit
exit<00:01:50.550> sketch<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.630> hole<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.960> go

now let's go ahead and do the other two

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.580 
now let's go ahead and do the other two
edges<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.149> we'll<00:02:09.300> select<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:12.380> now<00:02:13.380> we're

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
edges so we'll select that now we're

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.250 
edges so we'll select that now we're
gonna<00:02:13.769> say<00:02:14.070> three<00:02:14.489> inches<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:18.269> if<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.019> didn't

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
gonna say three inches and if we didn't

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.080 
gonna say three inches and if we didn't
want<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.560> be<00:02:19.650> three<00:02:19.920> inches<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.760> two

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
want it to be three inches that one two

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.970 
want it to be three inches that one two
inches<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.720> want<00:02:21.930> three<00:02:22.200> double<00:02:22.709> click<00:02:22.890> on

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
inches we want three double click on

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.800 
inches we want three double click on
that<00:02:23.040> dimension<00:02:23.550> could<00:02:23.820> pop<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.209> up<00:02:24.330> again<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
that dimension could pop it up again and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.280 
that dimension could pop it up again and
then<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.920> select<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:27.810> type<00:02:28.080> in

another<00:02:29.910> three<00:02:30.269> inches<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:31.950> did<00:02:32.160> three

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
another three inches and we did three

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.680 
another three inches and we did three
and<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.550> half<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.610> then<00:02:36.000> we'll<00:02:36.180> hit<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.450> check

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
and a half and then we'll hit the check

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.039 
and a half and then we'll hit the check
mark

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049

we went all the way through let's go we

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.550 
we went all the way through let's go we
have<00:02:49.500> one<00:02:49.739> more<00:02:50.010> face<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.489> do<00:02:51.049> so<00:02:52.049> again<00:02:52.380> we

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
have one more face to do so again we

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.690 
have one more face to do so again we
could<00:02:52.680> also<00:02:52.799> do<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.070> from<00:02:53.220> here<00:02:53.340> we<00:02:53.519> hit

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
could also do it from here we hit

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.430 
could also do it from here we hit
extruded<00:02:54.180> cut<00:02:54.360> select<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> face<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.320> we

extruded cut select the face that we

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.350 
extruded cut select the face that we
want<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.829> then<00:02:56.010> start<00:02:56.280> drawing<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:59.360> three

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
want and then start drawing so three

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.830 
want and then start drawing so three
inches

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.960

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.460 

and<00:03:11.510> three<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.680> half<00:03:12.890> interesting<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:17.470> it

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
and three and a half interesting and it

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.500 
and three and a half interesting and it
automatically<00:03:19.130> brings<00:03:19.430> us<00:03:19.610> back<00:03:19.820> into<00:03:20.090> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
automatically brings us back into the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.930 
automatically brings us back into the
extruded<00:03:22.810> menu<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.050> again<00:03:25.040> we<00:03:25.460> want<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.730> tell

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
extruded menu and again we want to tell

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.030 
extruded menu and again we want to tell
it<00:03:26.030> through<00:03:26.240> all<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.510> hit<00:03:26.870> okay<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.620> now<00:03:27.770> we<00:03:27.830> have

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
it through all I hit okay so now we have

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.640 
it through all I hit okay so now we have
a<00:03:28.070> parts<00:03:28.430> got<00:03:28.580> holes<00:03:28.820> all<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.120> way<00:03:29.210> through<00:03:29.510> it

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
a parts got holes all the way through it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.930 
a parts got holes all the way through it
let's<00:03:30.650> say<00:03:30.830> we<00:03:30.950> wanted<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.280> put<00:03:31.400> some<00:03:31.520> bolts<00:03:31.700> in

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
let's say we wanted to put some bolts in

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.550 
let's say we wanted to put some bolts in
this<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.330> we<00:03:32.390> tip<00:03:32.900> food<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.230> you'd<00:03:33.320> like<00:03:33.410> to

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
this and we tip food and you'd like to

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.290 
this and we tip food and you'd like to
put<00:03:33.710> bolts<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.250> like<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.580> have<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:35.030> chamfer

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
put bolts in you like to have a chamfer

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.220 
put bolts in you like to have a chamfer
around<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> hole<00:03:35.990> so<00:03:36.350> select<00:03:37.250> all<00:03:37.460> the<00:03:37.820> holes

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.520 

grab<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.440> chamfer<00:03:43.040> grab<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.730> chamfer<00:03:44.530> grab

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
grab the chamfer grab the chamfer grab

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.510 
grab the chamfer grab the chamfer grab
the<00:03:45.650> chamfer<00:03:46.010> let's<00:03:46.190> make<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.459> a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
the chamfer let's make that a

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.920 
the chamfer let's make that a
quarter-inch<00:03:47.090> chamfer<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.820> at<00:03:49.820> 45<00:03:50.270> degrees

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
quarter-inch chamfer and at 45 degrees

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.699 
quarter-inch chamfer and at 45 degrees
and<00:03:51.430> there<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.580> is<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.600> let's<00:03:54.050> also<00:03:54.230> go<00:03:54.500> ahead

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
and there it is so let's also go ahead

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.580 
and there it is so let's also go ahead
and<00:03:55.000> fill<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.180> all<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.540> outside<00:03:57.110> edges

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
and fill it all the outside edges

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.840 
and fill it all the outside edges
I<00:04:01.750> could<00:04:02.750> either<00:04:02.840> select<00:04:03.320> individual<00:04:04.070> edges

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
I could either select individual edges

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.760 
I could either select individual edges
or<00:04:05.030> if<00:04:05.180> it's<00:04:05.330> like<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.600> whole<00:04:05.840> face<00:04:06.290> let's<00:04:06.650> go

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
or if it's like the whole face let's go

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.260 
or if it's like the whole face let's go
ahead<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.040> select<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.370> whole<00:04:07.520> faces<00:04:08.030> that's

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
ahead and select the whole faces that's

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.080 
ahead and select the whole faces that's
easier<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.650> we<00:04:09.800> make<00:04:09.980> sure<00:04:10.010> we<00:04:10.220> don't<00:04:10.580> miss<00:04:10.880> out

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
easier so we make sure we don't miss out

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.930 
easier so we make sure we don't miss out
on<00:04:11.270> a<00:04:11.300> face<00:04:11.680> pan<00:04:12.680> around<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.370> let's<00:04:13.670> make<00:04:13.910> sure

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
on a face pan around it let's make sure

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.190 
on a face pan around it let's make sure
okay<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:14.959> let's<00:04:15.739> call<00:04:15.920> that<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.430> quarter-inch

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
okay and let's call that a quarter-inch

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.920 
okay and let's call that a quarter-inch
rate<00:04:18.200> radius<00:04:19.160> on<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.489> fill<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.030> hit<00:04:20.540> OK

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
rate radius on the fill it and hit OK

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.440 
rate radius on the fill it and hit OK
we'll<00:04:21.200> go<00:04:21.350> back<00:04:21.560> to<00:04:21.739> our<00:04:21.830> normal<00:04:22.450> isometric

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
we'll go back to our normal isometric
