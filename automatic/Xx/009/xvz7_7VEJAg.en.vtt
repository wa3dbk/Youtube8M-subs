00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
bigger procedure but oftentimes we don't

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.770 
bigger procedure but oftentimes we don't
have<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.280> do<00:01:16.429> this<00:01:17.119> through<00:01:17.390> very<00:01:17.509> big

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
have to do this through very big

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
pockets that would allow us to place an

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.950 
pockets that would allow us to place an
implant<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.640> build<00:01:23.060> up<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.240> bone<00:01:23.509> in<00:01:23.750> some

implant to build up the bone in some

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.760 
implant to build up the bone in some
area<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.569> typically<00:01:27.050> will<00:01:27.200> do<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.470> on<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
area and you typically will do it on the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.249 
area and you typically will do it on the
cheeks<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.759> chin<00:01:29.000> area<00:01:29.259> occasionally

patients have lost a significant amount
of<00:01:34.100> bone<00:01:34.220> we<00:01:34.819> have<00:01:35.000> some<00:01:35.210> new

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
of bone we have some new

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.020 
of bone we have some new
computer-generated<00:01:36.729> implants<00:01:37.729> that

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
computer-generated implants that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.570 
computer-generated implants that
actually<00:01:38.509> can<00:01:38.720> be<00:01:39.590> made<00:01:39.800> using<00:01:40.039> a<00:01:40.190> cat<00:01:40.369> scan

actually can be made using a cat scan

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.449 
actually can be made using a cat scan
that<00:01:40.940> will<00:01:41.090> tend<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.420> make<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:41.979> in<00:01:42.979> plant<00:01:43.280> there

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
that will tend to make a in plant there

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.300 
that will tend to make a in plant there
will<00:01:43.550> be<00:01:43.819> an<00:01:44.000> exact<00:01:44.420> duplicate<00:01:45.229> for<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.890> piece

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
will be an exact duplicate for the piece

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.219 
will be an exact duplicate for the piece
of<00:01:46.340> bone<00:01:46.610> that's<00:01:46.819> been<00:01:46.940> missing<00:01:47.119> Wow<00:01:47.450> now<00:01:48.110> when

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
of bone that's been missing Wow now when

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.630 
of bone that's been missing Wow now when
we<00:01:48.319> talk<00:01:48.349> about<00:01:48.619> this<00:01:48.800> traumatic<00:01:49.129> bone<00:01:49.459> loss

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
we talk about this traumatic bone loss

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.790 
we talk about this traumatic bone loss
things<00:01:50.239> like<00:01:50.450> car<00:01:50.780> accidents<00:01:50.810> i'm<00:01:51.410> guessing

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
things like car accidents i'm guessing

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.680 
things like car accidents i'm guessing
right<00:01:51.979> yes<00:01:52.250> that's<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.910> kind<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.239> that's<00:01:53.599> the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
right yes that's it kind of that's the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.410 
right yes that's it kind of that's the
most<00:01:53.869> common<00:01:53.989> type<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.970> injury<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.119> we<00:01:56.239> see

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
most common type of injury that we see

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.749 
most common type of injury that we see
that<00:01:56.599> can<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:57.259> has<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.920> considerable<00:01:58.429> amount

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
that can that has a considerable amount

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.330 
that we need to build it back up again
and<00:02:29.300> we'll<00:02:29.750> use<00:02:29.989> some<00:02:30.290> implants<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:31.280> are

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
and we'll use some implants that are

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.280 
and we'll use some implants that are
made<00:02:31.519> up<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> silicone<00:02:32.360> based<00:02:32.659> material

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
called silastic and these implants are

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.259 
called silastic and these implants are
used<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.560> build<00:02:36.800> up<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.310> cheeks<00:02:37.610> or<00:02:37.909> the<00:02:38.000> chin

used to build up the cheeks or the chin
some<00:02:38.690> people<00:02:38.959> have<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.159> congenital<00:02:40.159> deformity

some people have a congenital deformity
or

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
or

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.500

just<00:02:42.070> absence<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.820> chimney<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> weak

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
just absence of the chimney of a weak

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.270 
just absence of the chimney of a weak
chin<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:44.050> they<00:02:44.110> want<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.320> build<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.650> up<00:02:44.740> it's<00:02:45.160> a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
chin and they want to build it up it's a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.460 
chin and they want to build it up it's a
very<00:02:45.460> simple<00:02:45.700> thing<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.120> do<00:02:46.360> by<00:02:46.600> building<00:02:47.380> up

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
very simple thing to do by building up

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.470 
very simple thing to do by building up
this<00:02:47.740> area<00:02:48.130> with<00:02:48.310> an<00:02:48.460> implant<00:02:48.820> made<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> very

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
this area with an implant made a very

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.690 
this area with an implant made a very
small<00:02:49.690> incision<00:02:50.110> under<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.350> chin<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.860> bring

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
small incision under the chin and bring

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.460 
small incision under the chin and bring
this<00:02:51.820> forward<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.570> really<00:02:52.990> change

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
this forward so we can really change

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.710 
this forward so we can really change
someone's<00:02:53.980> appearance<00:02:54.280> quite<00:02:55.150> significantly

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
someone's appearance quite significantly

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.900 
someone's appearance quite significantly
so<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.590> surgery<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> do<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.400> not<00:02:57.550> it's

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
so the surgery to do this is not it's

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.850 
so the surgery to do this is not it's
not<00:02:58.000> quite<00:02:58.240> as<00:02:58.360> radical<00:02:58.720> as<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.900> sounds<00:02:59.590> that's

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
not quite as radical as it sounds that's

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.580 
not quite as radical as it sounds that's
right<00:03:00.070> it<00:03:00.250> may<00:03:00.370> sound<00:03:00.640> like<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.510> big<00:03:02.110> procedure

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
right it may sound like a big procedure

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.870 
right it may sound like a big procedure
but<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.040> be<00:03:03.100> done<00:03:03.220> through<00:03:03.280> very<00:03:03.730> very

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
but it can be done through very very

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.450 
but it can be done through very very
small<00:03:04.150> incisions<00:03:04.300> very<00:03:04.990> small<00:03:05.230> pockets<00:03:05.680> place

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
small incisions very small pockets place

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.790 
small incisions very small pockets place
a<00:03:06.490> very<00:03:06.790> precise<00:03:07.210> implant<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.410> this<00:03:08.620> can

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
a very precise implant and and this can

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.830 
a very precise implant and and this can
be<00:03:08.890> done<00:03:09.040> without<00:03:09.490> very<00:03:10.000> much<00:03:10.120> trauma<00:03:10.480> at<00:03:10.690> all

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
be done without very much trauma at all

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.540 
be done without very much trauma at all
patients<00:03:11.320> bounce<00:03:11.470> back<00:03:11.710> very<00:03:12.070> very<00:03:12.190> quickly

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
patients bounce back very very quickly

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.890 
patients bounce back very very quickly
from<00:03:12.820> these<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.270> know<00:03:13.390> if<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.570> was<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:13.810> to

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
from these you know if I was going to

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.040 
from these you know if I was going to
come<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.140> see<00:03:14.320> you<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:16.030> was<00:03:16.720> thinking<00:03:16.750> I

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
come and see you and I was thinking I

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.780 
come and see you and I was thinking I
might<00:03:17.230> want<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:17.890> done<00:03:18.250> what<00:03:18.640> kind

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
might want to have that done what kind

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.280 
might want to have that done what kind
of<00:03:18.850> questions<00:03:19.330> would<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.540> ask<00:03:19.660> me<00:03:20.020> or<00:03:20.170> what

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
of questions would you ask me or what

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.050 
of questions would you ask me or what
would<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.500> look<00:03:20.650> for<00:03:20.710> to<00:03:21.310> decide<00:03:21.640> if<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.880> was<00:03:22.030> a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
would you look for to decide if I was a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.250 
would you look for to decide if I was a
good<00:03:22.240> candidate<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:22.960> kind<00:03:23.170> of

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
good candidate for that kind of

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.820 
good candidate for that kind of
cooperation<00:03:23.410> well<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.160> think<00:03:24.280> if<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.800> have<00:03:26.800> a

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
cooperation well I think if you have a

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.440 
cooperation well I think if you have a
particular<00:03:27.040> idea<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.730> what<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.030> want<00:03:28.060> to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
particular idea of what you want to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.080 
particular idea of what you want to
achieve<00:03:28.890> whether<00:03:29.890> or<00:03:30.280> not<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.640> want<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.880> have

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
achieve whether or not you want to have

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.420 
achieve whether or not you want to have
a<00:03:31.120> bigger<00:03:31.390> cheek<00:03:31.660> bone<00:03:31.930> or<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.290> bigger<00:03:32.740> chin<00:03:33.130> or

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
a bigger cheek bone or a bigger chin or

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.340 
a bigger cheek bone or a bigger chin or
if<00:03:33.760> you've<00:03:33.910> got<00:03:34.090> some<00:03:34.360> fullness<00:03:34.690> here<00:03:35.170> in<00:03:35.260> the

if you've got some fullness here in the
neck<00:03:35.560> area<00:03:35.800> or<00:03:36.280> some<00:03:36.730> fullness<00:03:37.000> here<00:03:37.390> on<00:03:37.510> these

folds and you want to have this sculpted
those<00:03:40.330> are<00:03:40.540> important<00:03:40.960> things<00:03:41.020> that<00:03:41.260> we<00:03:41.530> need

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
those are important things that we need

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.040 
those are important things that we need
to<00:03:42.370> know<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:42.940> then<00:03:43.060> we<00:03:43.210> can<00:03:43.420> then<00:03:43.600> go<00:03:43.900> from

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
to know and then we can then go from

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.540 
to know and then we can then go from
there<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.470> see<00:03:44.860> if<00:03:44.920> we<00:03:45.010> can<00:03:45.160> give<00:03:45.310> them<00:03:45.430> a

there and see if we can give them a

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.720 
there and see if we can give them a
realistic<00:03:45.820> idea<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:47.110> what<00:03:47.290> we<00:03:47.470> can<00:03:47.650> achieve<00:03:47.890> we

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
realistic idea of what we can achieve we

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.600 
realistic idea of what we can achieve we
have<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.940> newer<00:03:49.450> technique<00:03:49.990> now<00:03:50.490> where<00:03:51.490> we're

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
have a newer technique now where we're

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.790 
have a newer technique now where we're
actually<00:03:51.900> sculpting<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.930> fat<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.590> face

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
actually sculpting the fat on the face

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.390 
actually sculpting the fat on the face
using<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.730> laser<00:03:55.230> lipolysis<00:03:56.230> system<00:03:57.160> it's<00:03:57.340> a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
using a laser lipolysis system it's a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.280 
using a laser lipolysis system it's a
very<00:03:57.580> small<00:03:57.910> fiber<00:03:58.240> optic<00:03:58.600> laser<00:03:58.840> we<00:03:59.050> place

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
very small fiber optic laser we place

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.530 
very small fiber optic laser we place
under<00:03:59.710> the<00:03:59.740> skin<00:04:00.070> yeah<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.150> very<00:04:01.480> very

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
under the skin yeah and it's a very very

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.450 
under the skin yeah and it's a very very
new<00:04:01.930> technique<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.440> we're<00:04:02.800> using<00:04:03.010> that

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
new technique that we're using that

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.390 
new technique that we're using that
helps<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:04.170> Jimmy<00:04:05.170> precisely<00:04:05.590> remove<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> fat

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
helps to Jimmy precisely remove the fat

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.790 
helps to Jimmy precisely remove the fat
in<00:04:06.670> an<00:04:07.150> area<00:04:07.360> on<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.750> face<00:04:07.960> and<00:04:08.260> then<00:04:08.410> we<00:04:08.620> can

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
in an area on the face and then we can

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.670 
in an area on the face and then we can
go<00:04:08.950> in<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.460> and<00:04:09.730> remove<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.360> fat<00:04:10.840> so<00:04:11.140> we<00:04:11.500> want

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
go in and and remove that fat so we want

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.380 
go in and and remove that fat so we want
a<00:04:11.740> little<00:04:11.980> fat<00:04:12.160> in<00:04:12.310> some<00:04:12.520> plants<00:04:12.760> that's<00:04:13.090> right

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
a little fat in some plants that's right

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.760 
a little fat in some plants that's right

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
probably get this knocked out but there

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:18.990 
probably get this knocked out but there
are<00:04:17.770> some<00:04:17.920> places<00:04:18.100> like<00:04:18.280> maybe<00:04:18.610> around<00:04:18.820> my

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
are some places like maybe around my

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.200 
are some places like maybe around my
eyes<00:04:19.210> I<00:04:19.780> might<00:04:19.900> want<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.590> have<00:04:20.770> some<00:04:21.130> well<00:04:21.640> you
