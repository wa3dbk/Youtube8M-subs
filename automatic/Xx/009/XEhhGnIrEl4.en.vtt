00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 she salutes today I look at myself I 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.540
 I allowed myself to make a cyclist from 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.849
 findings on ways to 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.929
 constant transport while there are 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.700
 things to say first the buses on board 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.160
 that time is long in buses 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.240
 when you get your hand back in the hours of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.960
 especially peak 500 flying 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.000
 regular lambare but is not 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.480
 always one of the times there are small 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.660
 the left round is wet from chawarma 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.180
 will then say one of the worst moments 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.100
 the existence of a human being is 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.469
 well it's really hot the beginning was 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.559
 filled in so well could note that one of 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.680
 wood side roof to put a context 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.680
 it was a often a corpulent 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.230
 word often of great hair that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.770
 this day their opus of two meters 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.809
 a sleeveless t-shirt and then decides to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.020
 hang on board en route and for a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.850
 point stable then you are you 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.439
 so close to his nose that you 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 could sled and kind of situation 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.470
 novel another quite strange moment where 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.159
 it's mostly for females 40 is 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.439
 in the wall 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.970
 there is at least 7 left around 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.009
 you the tone is jesus who returns alone and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.130
 he's trying to sit by your side 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.340
 we always start to imagine everything 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 a hiccup scenario of our integrating 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.290
 a building he will decide to jump me 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.290
 above 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.369
 yes voices start to dig 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.800
 we see it threatened with a weapon no no 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.020
 the reality is that often we are 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.100
 sitting in his place fetish his place 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.430
 favorite in the bus or you just to 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.030
 real reasons there after all this long 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.040
 trip all parties with pure r he 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.430
 discover all the hidden wounds of 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.430
 your hands 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.379
 another fact that I find disturbing 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.120
 it was a person before you listen 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:23.940
 his music so strong you could 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.610
 sing the lyrics with and that's it 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.319
 is another quite comical fact it's 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.750
 when we have to push the button we pull 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.220
 the rope yet stop then kuyt or 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.420
 of human beings in your path he 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.420
 must you climb to get there 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.090
 the iphone 4 is the person to escalate 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.390
 Well, I think we went around 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.560
 buses for the plane now I 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.230
 finds that there is a paradox that is 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.940
 rather fishy we have absolutely no 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.030
 right to smoke in an airplane since at 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.590
 under 15 but in the toilet 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.140
 from an old plane ashtrays everywhere 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.019
 it's fishy and often not a cure 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.430
 with a plane to the family as a 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.879
 general applause 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.220
 but this because the pilot's job the water 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:16.190
 it's about bringing 300 people from one point 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:20.639
 at a point b without a fight ideally 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.579
 but the waitress who brings mounte 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:26.040
 makes him applaud briefly after this 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.510
 little list of findings I believe 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.510
 that I have a bus to take
