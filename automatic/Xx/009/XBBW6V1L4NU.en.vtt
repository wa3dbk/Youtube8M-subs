up screens with carbink so I decided to
lead<00:00:13.530> off<00:00:13.679> with<00:00:13.860> magnezone<00:00:14.370> knowing<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.880> could

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
lead off with magnezone knowing I could

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.880 
lead off with magnezone knowing I could
all<00:00:15.150> Co<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.450> car<00:00:15.660> being<00:00:15.839> nice<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.139> easily<00:00:16.470> and

he actually predicted that and led with

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.890 
he actually predicted that and led with
Rotom<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.100> thought<00:00:21.000> he<00:00:21.150> would<00:00:21.240> switch<00:00:21.570> here

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900

though<00:00:22.080> because<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.410> didn't<00:00:22.650> think<00:00:22.710> he'd<00:00:22.890> want

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
though because I didn't think he'd want

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
though because I didn't think he'd want

specs I have to switch here so I've lost

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860 
specs I have to switch here so I've lost
a<00:00:35.190> lot<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.340> momentum<00:00:35.520> already<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
a lot of momentum already it was not a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
a lot of momentum already it was not a
good<00:00:37.050> start<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.559> battle<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.760> decided

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
good start to this battle but I decided

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.360 
good start to this battle but I decided
I<00:00:39.600> could<00:00:40.050> switch<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.160> would<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:41.340> be

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
I could switch out and it would all be

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.760 
I could switch out and it would all be
fine<00:00:41.700> because<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.809> ultimate<00:00:42.960> counter

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
fine because I have the ultimate counter

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.209 
fine because I have the ultimate counter
in<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.280> opinion<00:00:44.550> which<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.329> Gaston<00:00:46.219> there's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
in my opinion which is Gaston there's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.299 
in my opinion which is Gaston there's
nothing<00:00:48.090> Rotom<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.039> can't

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
nothing Rotom can do to get on it can't

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
nothing Rotom can do to get on it can't
bolt<00:00:50.550> switch<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> can't<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.870> free

a<00:01:36.540> hit<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.900> my<00:01:37.020> magnet<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.770> really

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
a hit with my magnet on which I really

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.670 
a hit with my magnet on which I really
shouldn't<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.180> switch<00:01:39.479> out<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.380> my

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
shouldn't have and I switch out to my

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.940 
shouldn't have and I switch out to my
knee<00:01:40.740> deep<00:01:41.159> my<00:01:41.790> ass<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.090> Meryl<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> an

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
knee deep my ass you Meryl this is an

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.280 
knee deep my ass you Meryl this is an
absolute<00:01:44.310> threat<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.030> demolishes<00:01:45.810> goodra

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
absolute threat it demolishes goodra

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660 
absolute threat it demolishes goodra
there's<00:01:46.470> nothing<00:01:46.890> goodra<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> this

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
there's nothing goodra can do to this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
there's nothing goodra can do to this
thing<00:01:47.729> because<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:48.840> live<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> thunderbolt

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
thing because it will live a thunderbolt

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.950 
thing because it will live a thunderbolt
for<00:01:49.710> goodra<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.000> could<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.600> gone<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
for goodra so I could have gone for the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
for goodra so I could have gone for the
play<00:01:52.110> rough<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.070> predicted<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> switch

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
play rough but I predicted the switch

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.999 
play rough but I predicted the switch
and<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.689> actually<00:01:54.810> went<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.259> super<00:01:55.530> power<00:01:55.710> I'm

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
and I actually went for super power I'm

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
and I actually went for super power I'm
not<00:01:56.310> sure<00:01:56.369> why<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.210> don't<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> was

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
not sure why I don't know what I was

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.749 
not sure why I don't know what I was
thinking<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.740> maybe<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.219> was<00:01:59.430> thinking

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
thinking I think maybe I was thinking

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
thinking I think maybe I was thinking
he'd<00:01:59.939> switch<00:02:00.270> into<00:02:00.509> carving<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
he'd switch into carving so I go for the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.690 
he'd switch into carving so I go for the
super<00:02:02.430> power<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:04.140> take<00:02:04.500> out<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> Rotom<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
super power and I take out the Rotom it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.920 
super power and I take out the Rotom it
wouldn't<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.090> mattered<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.450> I'd<00:02:06.540> gone<00:02:06.750> for

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
wouldn't have mattered if I'd gone for

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.270 
wouldn't have mattered if I'd gone for
play<00:02:07.049> rough<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.380> super<00:02:07.649> power<00:02:07.829> both<00:02:08.039> would

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
play rough or super power both would

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.949 
play rough or super power both would
have<00:02:08.310> taken<00:02:08.489> him<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.569> quite<00:02:09.780> happy

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
have taken him out and I'm quite happy

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.940 
have taken him out and I'm quite happy
right<00:02:10.319> now<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.709> I'm

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
right now because I'm

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.510 
right now because I'm
I'm<00:02:11.160> 65<00:02:11.879> up<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> he<00:02:12.930> goes<00:02:13.140> for<00:02:13.410> sizzle<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.950> don't

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
I'm 65 up and he goes for sizzle I don't

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.890 
I'm 65 up and he goes for sizzle I don't
really<00:02:14.730> want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.060> taking<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.510> bullet<00:02:15.690> punch

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
really want to be taking a bullet punch

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
really want to be taking a bullet punch
here<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.379> decided<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.890> switch<00:02:17.129> out<00:02:17.400> back

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
here so I decided to switch out back

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.790 
here so I decided to switch out back
into<00:02:18.300> magnezone<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:19.170> magnezone<00:02:19.650> can

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
into magnezone because magnezone can

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.369 
into magnezone because magnezone can
ohko<00:02:20.250> sizzle<00:02:20.910> with<00:02:21.060> bolts<00:02:21.390> which<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.870> sizzle

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
ohko sizzle with bolts which and sizzle

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.619 
ohko sizzle with bolts which and sizzle
can't<00:02:22.590> switch<00:02:22.890> out<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.310> escape<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.940> because<00:02:24.599> i

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
can't switch out to escape it because i

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.420 
can't switch out to escape it because i
have<00:02:24.870> magnet<00:02:25.230> pulled<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.040> thing<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.250> an

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
have magnet pulled so this thing is an

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.670 
have magnet pulled so this thing is an
absolute<00:02:26.640> threat<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:28.050> you'll<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.470> here

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
absolute threat and as you'll see here

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.770 
absolute threat and as you'll see here
it<00:02:28.890> goes<00:02:29.069> for<00:02:29.310> another<00:02:29.370> bullet<00:02:29.790> punch<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.540> does

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
it goes for another bullet punch it does

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.650 
it goes for another bullet punch it does
nothing<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.500> volt<00:02:32.099> switch<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.209> scissor<00:02:33.450> is

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
nothing I volt switch and the scissor is

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.440 
nothing I volt switch and the scissor is
dead<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.200> big<00:02:34.950> threat<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.489> my<00:02:35.610> team<00:02:35.849> as<00:02:36.060> well<00:02:36.239> a

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
I was really happy at this point I'm 64

I was really happy at this point I'm 64
up<00:02:41.730> I'm<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> roll<00:02:44.000> Magnezone<00:02:45.000> has<00:02:45.180> done<00:02:45.330> his

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
up I'm on a roll Magnezone has done his

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.050 
up I'm on a roll Magnezone has done his
job<00:02:45.959> sizzle<00:02:46.709> was<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.099> danger<00:02:47.519> zone<00:02:47.549> he

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
job sizzle was in the danger zone he

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.240 
job sizzle was in the danger zone he
didn't<00:02:48.360> get<00:02:48.540> out<00:02:48.690> he's<00:02:49.140> dead<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.040> switched

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
didn't get out he's dead so I switched

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.979 
didn't get out he's dead so I switched
back<00:02:50.519> into<00:02:50.760> my<00:02:50.819> gosh<00:02:51.000> done<00:02:51.299> thinking<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.810> can

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
back into my gosh done thinking I can

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.360 
back into my gosh done thinking I can
walk<00:02:52.110> pretty<00:02:52.319> much<00:02:52.500> anything<00:02:52.739> he<00:02:52.950> sends<00:02:53.220> out

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
walk pretty much anything he sends out

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.949 
walk pretty much anything he sends out
and<00:02:53.670> he<00:02:54.269> goes<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:54.900> drip<00:02:55.560> drip<00:02:55.829> his<00:02:56.069> goodra<00:02:56.549> and

and he goes for drip drip his goodra and
he<00:02:57.959> actually<00:02:58.079> goes<00:02:58.349> for<00:02:58.590> Thunderbolt<00:02:59.069> I'm<00:02:59.250> not

he actually goes for Thunderbolt I'm not

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.819 
he actually goes for Thunderbolt I'm not
sure<00:02:59.519> why<00:02:59.970> maybe<00:03:00.269> he<00:03:00.540> forgot<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.110> Gaston<00:03:01.620> had

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
sure why maybe he forgot that Gaston had

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.860 
sure why maybe he forgot that Gaston had
ground<00:03:02.069> typing<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.670> go<00:03:03.090> for<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.360> school<00:03:03.599> trying

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
ground typing I go for the school trying

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.360 
ground typing I go for the school trying
to<00:03:03.959> get<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.170> burn<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> burn<00:03:05.160> off

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
to get the burn and I get the burn off

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.170 
to get the burn and I get the burn off
and<00:03:06.470> now<00:03:07.470> I've<00:03:07.620> got<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.769> choice<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.819> just

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
and now I've got a choice I can just

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.050 
and now I've got a choice I can just
stall<00:03:09.599> out<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.200> goodra<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.640> don't<00:03:11.940> really

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
stall out the goodra but I don't really

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.430 
stall out the goodra but I don't really
want<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.299> do<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> bit<00:03:13.019> boring<00:03:13.049> for

out as you Marrell in the first place I
think<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.609> was<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.730> mistake<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:03.120> send<00:04:03.510> out<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
think it was a mistake to send out the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.660 
think it was a mistake to send out the
azure<00:04:04.049> Merrill<00:04:04.349> I<00:04:04.500> should<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.340> just<00:04:05.370> sent

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
azure Merrill I should have just sent

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.059 
azure Merrill I should have just sent
out<00:04:05.790> some<00:04:06.000> Igor<00:04:06.329> kept<00:04:06.569> stalling<00:04:06.900> set<00:04:07.769> up<00:04:07.919> my

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
out some Igor kept stalling set up my

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.729 
out some Igor kept stalling set up my
hazards<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.760> then<00:04:09.239> I'd<00:04:09.359> have<00:04:09.389> been<00:04:09.660> 63<00:04:10.560> up

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
hazards and then I'd have been 63 up

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.360 
hazards and then I'd have been 63 up
instead<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.430> 53<00:04:12.209> or<00:04:13.109> at<00:04:13.410> this<00:04:13.560> point<00:04:13.859> for<00:04:14.099> three

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
instead of 53 or at this point for three

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.969 
instead of 53 or at this point for three
because<00:04:15.269> smeagol<00:04:16.019> goes<00:04:16.169> down<00:04:16.410> as<00:04:16.590> well<00:04:16.709> so

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
because smeagol goes down as well so

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.860 
because smeagol goes down as well so
this<00:04:17.099> goodra<00:04:17.549> has<00:04:17.700> killed<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.209> Admiral<00:04:18.780> and

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
this goodra has killed the Admiral and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.500 
this goodra has killed the Admiral and
my<00:04:19.409> Smeagol<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.370> shouldn't<00:04:21.060> have<00:04:21.150> let<00:04:21.299> either

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
my Smeagol I shouldn't have let either

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.930 
my Smeagol I shouldn't have let either
of<00:04:21.659> them<00:04:21.870> die<00:04:22.049> well<00:04:22.409> maybe<00:04:23.010> Smeagol<00:04:23.520> but

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
of them die well maybe Smeagol but

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.700 
of them die well maybe Smeagol but
not<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.330> as<00:04:24.420> amaryl<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.230> switched<00:04:25.470> back

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
not the as amaryl so I switched back

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.460 
not the as amaryl so I switched back
into<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.070> Gaston<00:04:26.490> here<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.930> can<00:04:28.170> eat<00:04:28.440> up

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
into the Gaston here and it can eat up

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.200 
into the Gaston here and it can eat up
anything<00:04:29.070> this<00:04:29.340> good<00:04:29.520> just<00:04:29.730> throwing<00:04:30.000> at<00:04:30.120> it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
anything this good just throwing at it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.290 
anything this good just throwing at it
it<00:04:30.450> doesn't<00:04:30.930> care<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.650> just<00:04:32.310> recover<00:04:32.760> stall<00:04:33.090> it

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
it doesn't care I just recover stall it

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.760 
it doesn't care I just recover stall it
because<00:04:33.540> it's<00:04:33.690> one<00:04:33.870> burn<00:04:34.080> from<00:04:34.290> death<00:04:34.560> and

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
because it's one burn from death and

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.330 
because it's one burn from death and
that's<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.880> good<00:04:35.970> dealt<00:04:36.360> with<00:04:37.340> obviously

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
that's the good dealt with obviously

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.280 
that's the good dealt with obviously
wasn't<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.210> best<00:04:39.330> play<00:04:39.570> by<00:04:39.750> me<00:04:39.900> here<00:04:40.140> to

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
wasn't the best play by me here to

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.550 
wasn't the best play by me here to
sacrifice<00:04:40.740> as<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.040> Marrell<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.660> wanted<00:04:43.440> to

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560

keep the match moving so had to be done

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.520 
keep the match moving so had to be done
had<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.160> be<00:04:47.250> done<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.750> I<00:04:48.750> won't<00:04:49.080> do<00:04:49.230> that<00:04:49.260> again
