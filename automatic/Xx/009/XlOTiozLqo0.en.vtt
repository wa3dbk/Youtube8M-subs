00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello my name is maxim kristin and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.899
 in this video tutorial I'll show you how 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.980
 open ports for server counter-strike 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.740
 v34 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 or maynkrafta but personally I opened 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.320
 yourself for server counter-strike v34 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:26.910
 so for this we need such a program 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 toronto honestly opens here such 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.550
 the side program through it is best 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.309
 open ports through bran maru words there 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.920
 do not open ports from through it the most 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.820
 the best option to open the port to us 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.809
 Need to go to the settings then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.370
 program settings here choose any 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.449
 the port that you want to open 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.500
 I already from the example of then 2716 clean and port 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.850
 which one do you have 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 the server has brand time from 7 to 16 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.799
 click ok we can cover all will show 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.659
 so now we go to the site 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.659
 called 2 and and dot ru 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.610
 now there is no uniform color of water erase your 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.360
 api everything is written here you can know that he 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:27.040
 you can find out on the internet so but we are 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.250
 don't need it we remove the port check and 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.800
 We enter here the port that you wrote in 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.720
 . I wanted to open the gift 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:42.980
 I for example wrote 2016 here we press 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.960
 check and see and the port is open all of you 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.210
 now opened for your server 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.640
 counter-strike and three four now on 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.620
