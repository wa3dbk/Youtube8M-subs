00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 server mills this varies a lot 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.079

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.350
 Imagine you had a rar file is here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.430
 compacted and will give up gta san andreas 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.470
 point is that if a part of the translation oc2 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.610
 critique on gta san andreas point is that 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.909
 if it will charge because it is 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.950
 compacted 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.950

 files needed for the game 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:41.000
 It works that not only that here is a 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.959
 it is at this point that if you send to the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.760
 workspace 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.980

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:27.450
 after that done that shortcut two 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.450
 clicks and the game said 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.760
 it's the ease here the game does not need 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:37.180

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.859
