00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
but it turns out the bone broth has

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.170 
but it turns out the bone broth has
glucosamine<00:03:13.380> in<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.620> too<00:03:13.920> but<00:03:14.250> unlike<00:03:15.030> the

osteoarthritis apparently the collagen

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.970 
osteoarthritis apparently the collagen
too<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.580> think<00:03:29.790> helps<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.750> absorb<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
too I think helps you absorb the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.620 
too I think helps you absorb the
glucosamine<00:03:32.490> better<00:03:32.940> we're<00:03:33.480> like

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
glucosamine better we're like

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.050 
glucosamine better we're like
supplements<00:03:34.170> don't<00:03:34.320> necessarily<00:03:34.740> have<00:03:34.890> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
supplements don't necessarily have the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.580 
supplements don't necessarily have the
collagen<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.210> it<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.110> still<00:03:37.290> pure

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
collagen in it and this is still pure

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.940 
collagen in it and this is still pure
and<00:03:37.770> come<00:03:38.310> straight<00:03:38.550> from<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:39.030> bone<00:03:39.330> source<00:03:39.600> so

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
and come straight from a bone source so

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.900 
and come straight from a bone source so
obviously<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.100> wouldn't<00:03:41.370> be<00:03:41.430> beneficial<00:03:41.820> if

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
obviously this wouldn't be beneficial if

it<00:04:44.930> my<00:04:45.260> head<00:04:45.410> nails<00:04:45.620> have<00:04:45.770> always<00:04:45.890> been<00:04:46.070> really

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
it my head nails have always been really

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.240 
it my head nails have always been really
brittle<00:04:46.660> flaky<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:47.780> like<00:04:47.990> really<00:04:48.950> like

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
brittle flaky and like really like

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.400 
brittle flaky and like really like
flimsy<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.480> think<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.840> has<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.290> do<00:04:51.380> with

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
flimsy and I think that has to do with

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.450 
flimsy and I think that has to do with
like<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.830> just<00:04:51.890> don't<00:04:52.040> have<00:04:52.220> very<00:04:52.310> much
