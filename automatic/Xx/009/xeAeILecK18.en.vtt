team to be great and I do think that Jay

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.889 
team to be great and I do think that Jay
may<00:01:25.159> was<00:01:25.340> progressing<00:01:25.880> in<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:26.149> way<00:01:26.330> he'd

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
may was progressing in that way he'd

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.630 
may was progressing in that way he'd
played<00:01:27.170> nine<00:01:27.380> games<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.100> first<00:01:28.250> 30<00:01:28.549> days

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
played nine games in the first 30 days

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.580 
played nine games in the first 30 days
of<00:01:29.000> his<00:01:29.119> college<00:01:29.420> career<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:30.289> like<00:01:30.500> to

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
of his college career and I like to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.200 
of his college career and I like to
think<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.890> progressively<00:01:31.549> he<00:01:31.789> was<00:01:31.939> getting

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
think that progressively he was getting

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.450 
think that progressively he was getting
better<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.689> if<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.289> look<00:01:33.320> at<00:01:33.649> his<00:01:33.860> production

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
better and if you look at his production

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.460 
better and if you look at his production
and<00:01:34.670> his<00:01:34.759> numbers<00:01:35.299> I<00:01:35.509> think<00:01:36.080> that<00:01:36.200> he<00:01:36.350> was

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
and his numbers I think that he was

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.160 
and his numbers I think that he was
progressively<00:01:37.070> improving<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:37.909> I<00:01:38.689> hate<00:01:39.020> that

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
progressively improving and I hate that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.719 
progressively improving and I hate that
it<00:01:39.289> didn't<00:01:39.560> work<00:01:39.679> out<00:01:39.860> for<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.250> longer<00:01:40.490> period

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
it didn't work out for a longer period

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.520 
it didn't work out for a longer period
of<00:01:41.000> time<00:01:41.060> but<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:41.780> understand<00:01:42.380> their

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
of time but I understand their

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.370 
of time but I understand their
dissatisfaction<00:01:43.119> but<00:01:44.119> our<00:01:44.390> team<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.140> never

and I think that I've been able to with

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.760 
and I think that I've been able to with
withstand<00:05:33.510> all<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:33.930> those<00:05:34.080> promises<00:05:34.590> but

withstand all of those promises but

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.120 
withstand all of those promises but
never<00:05:35.040> you<00:05:35.850> start<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.600> you<00:05:36.630> get<00:05:37.530> to<00:05:37.770> touch<00:05:37.950> the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
never you start and you get to touch the

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.550 
never you start and you get to touch the
ball<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.670> shoot<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.030> balton<00:05:39.390> no<00:05:39.690> i<00:05:39.960> don't<00:05:40.380> i

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
ball and shoot the balton no i don't i

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.930 
ball and shoot the balton no i don't i
don't<00:05:40.590> know<00:05:40.890> that<00:05:40.920> that<00:05:41.250> really<00:05:41.430> goes<00:05:41.730> on<00:05:41.880> i

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
don't know that that really goes on i

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.700 
don't know that that really goes on i
think<00:05:42.150> that<00:05:42.510> that<00:05:43.080> might<00:05:43.110> have<00:05:43.350> been<00:05:43.410> written

think that that might have been written

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.380 
think that that might have been written
in<00:05:43.860> some<00:05:44.040> books<00:05:44.250> back<00:05:44.490> in<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.700> 80s<00:05:45.090> but<00:05:45.210> that

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
in some books back in the 80s but that

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.140 
in some books back in the 80s but that
doesn't<00:05:45.630> go<00:05:45.720> on<00:05:45.870> anymore
