00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.400
 very short video because we're going to 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.630
 teach how to make a vinaigrette 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.119
 cilantro ideal for salads for 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.800
 fish for white meat and so on 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.579
 let's start I give them the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.530
 ingredients 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.600
 we are going to need the ingredient 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.850
 main cilantro the one that will contribute 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.200
 the taste we will need 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.200
 lemon we're going to need olive oil 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 which you have at home we are going to 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.100
 also need pepper 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.100
 we are going to need salt 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.590
 very simple, we started cutting 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.140
 our cilantro does not have to be a 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.660
 very small cut simply for 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.450
 help our blender we're going to 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.840
 put in the blender 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:20.539
 we put pepper amount necessary 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.539
 We put the necessary amount 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.530
 we squeeze 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.530
 a lemon 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.690
 you should also calculate there your lemon if 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.880
 It is very small, they put two and it is very 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.070
 big with one is enough 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.300
 we are going to need also 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.300
 olive oil 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.430

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.509

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.890
