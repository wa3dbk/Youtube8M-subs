need an adapter to hook it up to your
computer<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:25.670> I<00:00:26.670> got<00:00:27.090> my<00:00:27.240> adapter<00:00:27.630> from<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
computer and I got my adapter from a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.370 
computer and I got my adapter from a
normal<00:00:28.980> Seagate<00:00:29.460> hard<00:00:30.300> drive<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
normal Seagate hard drive that I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.090 
normal Seagate hard drive that I
recently<00:00:31.619> took<00:00:31.980> apart<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.829> SATA

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
recently took apart and so it's a SATA

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
recently took apart and so it's a SATA
so<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.640> has<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.030> SATA<00:00:36.329> adapter<00:00:37.760> like<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.090> set

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so it has to be SATA adapter like a set

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.610 
so it has to be SATA adapter like a set
of<00:00:39.989> hard<00:00:40.200> drives<00:00:40.440> computer<00:00:40.980> ones<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.530> what<00:00:43.530> you

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
of hard drives computer ones so what you

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.250 
of hard drives computer ones so what you
want<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.160> only<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:45.450> mine<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> also<00:00:45.989> need

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
a micro USB which I will use to hook it
up<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> my<00:00:50.190> computer<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.270> first<00:00:51.449> things<00:00:51.660> first

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
up to my computer so first things first
you<00:00:51.960> want<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> locate<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.800> top<00:00:53.070> right<00:00:53.399> corner

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you want to locate the top right corner

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.819 
you want to locate the top right corner
this<00:00:54.600> corner<00:00:54.660> right<00:00:55.230> here

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
this corner right here

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.310 
this corner right here
I<00:00:57.260> might<00:00:58.260> zoom<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> very

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
I might zoom it in and so at the very

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
I might zoom it in and so at the very
top<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.949> decide<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> size<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
top not decide because the size is a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.640 
top not decide because the size is a
little<00:01:03.390> hard<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.320> doing<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
little hard to do if you're doing at the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.130 
little hard to do if you're doing at the
top<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.220> take<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.580> piece<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.140> push

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
top if you just take this piece and push

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.420 
top if you just take this piece and push
in<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.890> should<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.220> split

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in right there it should just split

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.750 
in right there it should just split
right<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:10.470> come<00:01:10.770> down<00:01:10.799> mine's<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
right out and then come down mine's a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
right out and then come down mine's a
little<00:01:11.790> beat-up<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.299> I've<00:01:12.420> done<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
few times and so after you take it apart

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.410 
few times and so after you take it apart
you're<00:01:18.810> stuck<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.490> now<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.210> this

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
probably going to use horizon it's a lot
easier<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.100> use<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.570> we're<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> let

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
easier to use and so we're going to let

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.510 
easier to use and so we're going to let
that<00:02:07.530> load<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.979> I'll<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.099> with<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.399> guys

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that load up and I'll be with you guys

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.070 
that load up and I'll be with you guys
forever<00:02:08.729> does<00:02:11.000> okay<00:02:12.000> guys<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.540> fine

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
forever does okay guys it's fine

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.040 
forever does okay guys it's fine
load<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.740> up<00:02:13.830> put<00:02:14.820> me<00:02:14.940> about<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.300> five

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
load it up put me about like five

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.780 
load it up put me about like five
minutes<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.480> um<00:02:19.370> Erica<00:02:20.370> scribble

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
minutes but so just um Erica scribble

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.610 
minutes but so just um Erica scribble
loading<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.270> devices<00:02:21.780> that's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
loading one of your devices that's

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.140 
loading one of your devices that's
probably<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.250> because<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.940> doesn't

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
probably just because it doesn't

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.420 
probably just because it doesn't
recognize<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.560> let's<00:02:25.680> see<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.010> pulls<00:02:26.250> up

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
recognize it so let's see if it pulls up

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.940 
recognize it so let's see if it pulls up
if<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.850> then<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.420> will<00:02:27.450> use<00:02:27.960> mop<00:02:28.440> mode<00:02:28.710> yoke

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
if not then we will use mop mode yoke

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.440 
if not then we will use mop mode yoke
because<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.310> know<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> fact<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.030> works<00:02:30.180> about
