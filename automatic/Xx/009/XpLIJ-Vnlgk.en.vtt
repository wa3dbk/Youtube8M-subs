a<00:00:11.179> I'm<00:00:12.179> gonna<00:00:12.300> show<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.509> how<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> calibrate

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
a I'm gonna show you how to calibrate

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.450 
a I'm gonna show you how to calibrate
these<00:00:13.349> inexpensive<00:00:14.070> pH<00:00:15.049> probes<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.460> I'm

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
these inexpensive pH probes that I'm

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.650 
these inexpensive pH probes that I'm
going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.760> use<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.560> calibrate<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> water<00:00:20.279> in

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
going to use to calibrate the water in

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.590 
going to use to calibrate the water in
my<00:00:21.660> hydroponic<00:00:22.230> system<00:00:23.090> this<00:00:24.090> basically

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
my hydroponic system this basically

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.960 
my hydroponic system this basically
comes<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.609> some<00:00:27.500> phosphate<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.970> when

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
comes with some phosphate that when

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.700 
comes with some phosphate that when
mixed<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.240> distilled<00:00:30.689> water<00:00:30.869> will<00:00:31.260> read<00:00:31.470> at

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
mixed with distilled water will read at

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.520 
mixed with distilled water will read at
6.86<00:00:32.780> pH<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> put<00:00:35.370> some<00:00:35.760> potassium

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
6.86 pH and so put some potassium

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.069 
6.86 pH and so put some potassium
hydrogen<00:00:37.879> fall<00:00:38.879> 8<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.600> saying<00:00:39.899> that

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
hydrogen fall 8 I'm saying that

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.170 
hydrogen fall 8 I'm saying that
correctly<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:40.920> mix<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.430> pH<00:00:41.760> level<00:00:41.790> at

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
correctly which will mix a pH level at

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.770 
correctly which will mix a pH level at
4.0<00:00:43.309> but<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.430> important<00:00:44.940> according<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
4.0 but it's important according to the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.770 
4.0 but it's important according to the
directions<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.680> apparently<00:00:47.010> were

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
directions that apparently were

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.700 
directions that apparently were
translated<00:00:48.780> from<00:00:48.870> Chinese<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.559> they're

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
translated from Chinese and so they're

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.930 
translated from Chinese and so they're
kind<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> difficult<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> follow<00:00:50.610> labor

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
written by non-english speaker would
seem<00:00:55.670> but<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.410> instructions<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.730> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
seem but one of the instructions is that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.990 
seem but one of the instructions is that
you<00:01:00.059> immerse<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> electrode<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.070> this

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you immerse the electrode which is this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.240 
you immerse the electrode which is this
little<00:01:03.270> glass<00:01:03.510> ball<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.790> I'm<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
little glass ball here I'm just going to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.620 
little glass ball here I'm just going to
measure<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.490> pH<00:01:08.790> level<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.240> immerse<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
measure the pH level you immerse the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.670 
measure the pH level you immerse the
electrode<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> pH<00:01:11.659> 6.86<00:01:12.659> under<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
electrode in the pH 6.86 under a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.090 
electrode in the pH 6.86 under a
temperature<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.460> 25<00:01:14.939> °c<00:01:15.380> 25<00:01:16.380> degrees<00:01:16.650> Celsius

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
temperature of 25 °c 25 degrees Celsius

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.539 
temperature of 25 °c 25 degrees Celsius
which<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.509> 77<00:01:18.509> degrees<00:01:18.930> Fahrenheit

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.170 
which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit
pH<00:01:21.060> level<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.720> different<00:01:22.729> depending<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
pH level is different depending on the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.450 
pH level is different depending on the
temperature<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> water<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.340> is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
temperature of the water and so this is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
temperature of the water and so this is
an<00:01:26.580> important<00:01:26.939> calibration<00:01:27.479> step<00:01:27.659> you've<00:01:27.900> got

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
an important calibration step you've got

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840 
an important calibration step you've got
to<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:29.100> distilled<00:01:29.579> water

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
to get your your distilled water

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.050 
to get your your distilled water
temperature<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.630> 77<00:01:31.380> degrees<00:01:31.850> because<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
temperature at 77 degrees because the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.480 
temperature at 77 degrees because the
enix<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:33.990> reason<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> inexpensive<00:01:35.040> I'm

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
enix one reason this is inexpensive I'm

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.010 
enix one reason this is inexpensive I'm
assuming<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.119> don't<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.509> sure<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.869> I'm

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
assuming I don't know for sure but I'm

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.830 
assuming I don't know for sure but I'm
assuming<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.400> doesn't<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
assuming that it doesn't have the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.539 
assuming that it doesn't have the
ability<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.290> sense<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> temperature<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
ability to sense the temperature and

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.770 
ability to sense the temperature and
make<00:01:41.759> adjustments<00:01:41.880> based<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.720> the

make adjustments based on the
temperature<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.320> one<00:01:43.439> reason<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.799> less

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
temperature it's one reason it's less

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.039 
temperature it's one reason it's less
expensive<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.479> you're<00:01:45.630> doing<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:45.930> bit

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
expensive so you're doing a little bit

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.690 
expensive so you're doing a little bit
of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> manual<00:01:46.619> process<00:01:46.770> you're<00:01:47.340> paying<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
of the manual process you're paying a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
of the manual process you're paying a
little<00:01:47.790> bit<00:01:48.030> less<00:01:48.270> these<00:01:49.229> run<00:01:49.560> about<00:01:49.799> fifteen

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
little bit less these run about fifteen

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.569 
little bit less these run about fifteen
dollars<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.970> amazon.com<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> have

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
dollars on amazon.com so what I have

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.080 
dollars on amazon.com so what I have
here<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:55.159> thermometer<00:01:56.159> that's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
here is I have a thermometer that's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.749 
here is I have a thermometer that's
normally<00:01:57.540> used<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.140> fish<00:01:58.530> tanks<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.719> I<00:02:00.719> had

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
normally used in fish tanks and I had

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.200 
normally used in fish tanks and I had
two<00:02:02.759> glasses<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.689> distilled<00:02:04.140> water<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.850> sect

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
two glasses of distilled water this sect

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.779 
two glasses of distilled water this sect
this<00:02:07.140> doesn't<00:02:07.469> explain<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
this doesn't explain it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.850 
this doesn't explain it
but<00:02:08.969> from<00:02:09.329> what<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> figured<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.079> it<00:02:10.379> says<00:02:10.590> make

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
but from what I figured out it says make

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
but from what I figured out it says make
up<00:02:11.450> 250<00:02:12.450> mililiters<00:02:13.219> what<00:02:14.219> that<00:02:14.400> means<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:15.090> mix

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
up 250 mililiters what that means is mix

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.440 
up 250 mililiters what that means is mix
this<00:02:16.200> with<00:02:16.469> 250<00:02:17.069> milliliters<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.549> water<00:02:17.790> 250

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
this with 250 milliliters of water 250

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.110 
this with 250 milliliters of water 250
milliliters<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.959> water<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.439> roughly<00:02:19.799> 1<00:02:20.640> cup<00:02:20.969> of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
milliliters of water is roughly 1 cup of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.940 
milliliters of water is roughly 1 cup of
water<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.689> have<00:02:21.870> 1<00:02:22.079> cup<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.319> water<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.769> each

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
water so I have 1 cup of water in each

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.479 
water so I have 1 cup of water in each
glass<00:02:23.280> here<00:02:24.049> my<00:02:25.049> ambient<00:02:25.950> temperature<00:02:26.340> right

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
glass here my ambient temperature right

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.910 
glass here my ambient temperature right
now<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:26.760> 70<00:02:27.060> degrees<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.049> there<00:02:28.739> was<00:02:28.829> no

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
now is 70 degrees and so there was no

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.550 
now is 70 degrees and so there was no
way<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.069> was<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.489> get<00:02:29.609> 70<00:02:29.909> 70<00:02:30.180> degrees

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
way I was going to get 70 70 degrees

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.890 
way I was going to get 70 70 degrees
right<00:02:31.560> out<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.819> at<00:02:32.819> room<00:02:33.090> temperature<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.750> what

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
right out of at room temperature so what

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.160 
right out of at room temperature so what
I<00:02:33.930> did<00:02:34.019> was<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.439> boiled<00:02:35.060> some<00:02:36.060> distilled<00:02:36.959> water

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
I did was I boiled some distilled water

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.629 
I did was I boiled some distilled water
in<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.500> microwave<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.129> then<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> use<00:02:38.489> this

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
in the microwave and then I use this

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:43.300 
in the microwave and then I use this
eyedropper<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:40.319> add<00:02:41.060> boil<00:02:42.060> distilled<00:02:42.840> water

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
eyedropper to add boil distilled water

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.030 
eyedropper to add boil distilled water
until<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.519> temperature<00:02:44.970> got<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.170> 77<00:02:46.769> degrees

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
until the temperature got to 77 degrees

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.580 
until the temperature got to 77 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.269> so<00:02:48.720> now<00:02:48.840> both<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.230> my<00:02:49.349> glasses

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
Fahrenheit and so now both of my glasses

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.490 
Fahrenheit and so now both of my glasses
are<00:02:49.799> 77<00:02:50.310> degrees<00:02:50.579> Fahrenheit<00:02:50.609> I'm<00:02:51.389> going<00:02:52.349> to

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
are 77 degrees Fahrenheit I'm going to

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.490 
are 77 degrees Fahrenheit I'm going to
the<00:02:53.030> mix<00:02:54.030> my<00:02:55.280> phosphate<00:02:56.280> powder<00:02:56.959> with<00:02:57.959> one<00:02:58.230> cup

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the mix my phosphate powder with one cup

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.649 
the mix my phosphate powder with one cup
of<00:02:58.799> distilled<00:02:59.639> water<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:02.030> I've<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.389> bought

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
of distilled water and I've just bought

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.390 
of distilled water and I've just bought
this<00:03:03.840> gallon<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.260> distilled<00:03:04.439> water<00:03:04.799> at<00:03:05.159> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
this gallon of distilled water at the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:13.149 
this gallon of distilled water at the
grocery<00:03:06.329> store<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:06.750> 99<00:03:07.169> cents<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:11.389> also<00:03:12.389> rinsed

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
grocery store for 99 cents I also rinsed

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.770 
grocery store for 99 cents I also rinsed
my<00:03:14.159> electrode<00:03:14.729> with<00:03:14.940> distilled<00:03:15.329> water<00:03:15.449> which

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
my electrode with distilled water which

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.479 
my electrode with distilled water which
is<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.680> instructions<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:19.400> then<00:03:20.400> I

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
is in the instructions and then I

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:29.880 
is in the instructions and then I
blotted<00:03:20.849> it<00:03:20.940> dry<00:03:21.180> with<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.419> paper<00:03:21.510> towel

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.559 

so<00:03:30.890> now<00:03:31.040> mixing<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.849> potassium<00:03:32.590> hydrogen

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
so now mixing the potassium hydrogen

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.530 
so now mixing the potassium hydrogen
folate

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.930 

my<00:03:39.500> distilled<00:03:39.890> water<00:03:45.310> stir<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.519> up<00:03:46.580> until

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
my distilled water stir that up until

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:56.199 
my distilled water stir that up until
it's<00:03:47.060> completely<00:03:47.420> mixed

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.140 

okay<00:03:56.989> my<00:03:57.170> temperature<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.680> still<00:03:58.150> pretty

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
okay my temperature is still pretty

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.559 
okay my temperature is still pretty
close<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.719> 77<00:04:00.290> degrees<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:02.409> so<00:04:04.299> let's<00:04:05.299> read

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
close to 77 degrees and so let's read

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.750 
close to 77 degrees and so let's read
the<00:04:05.689> instructions<00:04:06.170> here<00:04:06.609> remove<00:04:07.609> the

use<00:04:25.669> distilled<00:04:26.000> water<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.270> clean<00:04:26.570> it<00:04:26.720> but

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
use distilled water to clean it but

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.140 
use distilled water to clean it but
that's<00:04:27.860> normal<00:04:28.340> used<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:28.789> calibration

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
that's normal used in the calibration

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.210 
that's normal used in the calibration
process<00:04:30.669> you<00:04:31.669> immerse<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.180> electrode<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:32.900> the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
process you immerse the electrode in the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.969 
process you immerse the electrode in the
6.86<00:04:34.220> first<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.509> temperature<00:04:36.229> of<00:04:36.259> 25<00:04:36.710> degrees

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
6.86 first and temperature of 25 degrees

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.850 
6.86 first and temperature of 25 degrees
Celsius<00:04:37.400> or<00:04:37.490> 77<00:04:38.060> degrees<00:04:38.360> Fahrenheit<00:04:38.860> and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
Celsius or 77 degrees Fahrenheit and

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.820 
Celsius or 77 degrees Fahrenheit and
gently<00:04:40.580> shake<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:40.820> electrode<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.810> as<00:04:45.710> you

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
gently shake the electrode and as you

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.600 
gently shake the electrode and as you
can<00:04:45.949> see

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.200 

this<00:04:51.210> arrived<00:04:53.030> pretty<00:04:54.030> close<00:04:54.479> it's<00:04:55.229> at<00:04:55.349> 6.5<00:04:56.210> so

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
this arrived pretty close it's at 6.5 so

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.450 
this arrived pretty close it's at 6.5 so
to<00:04:57.270> make<00:04:57.689> the<00:04:57.930> adjustment<00:04:58.500> I'm<00:04:58.830> going<00:04:59.189> to<00:04:59.280> turn

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
to make the adjustment I'm going to turn

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.409 
to make the adjustment I'm going to turn
this<00:04:59.639> knob<00:04:59.879> back<00:05:00.120> here<00:05:00.479> until<00:05:01.669> it<00:05:02.669> adjust<00:05:03.120> to

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
this knob back here until it adjust to

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:15.659 
this knob back here until it adjust to
six<00:05:04.289> point<00:05:04.530> eight<00:05:04.590> six

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.220 

all<00:05:16.669> right<00:05:16.910> so<00:05:17.150> now<00:05:17.330> I'd<00:05:17.449> read<00:05:17.660> six<00:05:17.930> point

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
all right so now I'd read six point

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.260 
all right so now I'd read six point
eight

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
eight

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.360 
eight
I<00:05:20.300> don't<00:05:20.960> know<00:05:21.020> if<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.139> should<00:05:21.169> go<00:05:21.380> 26.9<00:05:22.130> it

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
I don't know if I should go 26.9 it

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.450 
I don't know if I should go 26.9 it
doesn't<00:05:22.669> say<00:05:22.849> that<00:05:23.720> 6.86<00:05:24.560> is<00:05:25.009> really<00:05:25.220> closer

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
doesn't say that 6.86 is really closer

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.050 
doesn't say that 6.86 is really closer
to<00:05:25.639> 6.9<00:05:26.240> but<00:05:26.479> I'll<00:05:26.569> leave<00:05:26.690> it<00:05:26.810> at<00:05:26.870> 6.8<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.590> think

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
to 6.9 but I'll leave it at 6.8 I think

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.629 
to 6.9 but I'll leave it at 6.8 I think
and<00:05:29.199> now<00:05:30.199> I'm<00:05:30.319> to<00:05:30.560> rinse<00:05:30.860> it<00:05:31.009> in<00:05:31.160> distilled

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
and now I'm to rinse it in distilled

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:44.770 
and now I'm to rinse it in distilled
water

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.440 

yeah

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:55.800 

and<00:05:47.960> we'll<00:05:48.200> try<00:05:48.350> it<00:05:48.470> off

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.719 

turn<00:05:56.320> it<00:05:56.440> off

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
turn it off

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.560 
turn it off
turn<00:05:58.270> it<00:05:58.389> back<00:05:58.419> on

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.620 

and<00:06:02.750> now<00:06:03.290> I'm<00:06:03.380> going<00:06:03.620> to<00:06:03.710> test<00:06:04.420> this<00:06:05.420> one

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
and now I'm going to test this one

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:14.629 
and now I'm going to test this one
hopefully<00:06:06.110> we'll<00:06:06.290> go<00:06:06.470> to<00:06:08.650> 4.0

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.290 

and<00:06:14.879> it's<00:06:15.330> just<00:06:15.449> 3.9<00:06:16.229> so<00:06:16.500> I'm<00:06:16.560> going<00:06:16.800> to<00:06:16.860> just

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
and it's just 3.9 so I'm going to just

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:24.499 
and it's just 3.9 so I'm going to just
make<00:06:18.300> one<00:06:18.330> more<00:06:18.629> adjustment<00:06:22.909> and<00:06:23.909> it<00:06:24.120> appears

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
make one more adjustment and it appears

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.469 
make one more adjustment and it appears
that<00:06:24.780> clockwise<00:06:25.289> makes<00:06:25.620> it<00:06:25.770> goes<00:06:25.919> up

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
that clockwise makes it goes up

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.529 
that clockwise makes it goes up
counterclockwise<00:06:27.800> turns<00:06:28.800> it<00:06:28.979> down<00:06:29.180> so<00:06:30.180> now<00:06:30.330> my

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
counterclockwise turns it down so now my

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:36.140 
counterclockwise turns it down so now my

in a peach level three liquid for best
results<00:07:24.779> but<00:07:25.349> you<00:07:25.440> should<00:07:25.650> keep<00:07:25.830> it<00:07:26.009> moist
