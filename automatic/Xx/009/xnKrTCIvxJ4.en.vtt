is<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.670> actually<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> snippet<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:18.750> my

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
is this is actually a snippet from my

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.019 
is this is actually a snippet from my

livestream unfortunately the audio was
just<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:21.449> high<00:00:21.720> enough<00:00:21.750> quality<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
just not high enough quality that I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.140 
just not high enough quality that I
wanted<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.890> put<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.250> YouTube<00:00:23.699> that's<00:00:23.970> why

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820 
it's also in 720p but it's just such a
great<00:00:26.849> gameplay<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.410> well<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
comeback I have ever had on titanfall it
is<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.440> very<00:00:43.710> close<00:00:43.920> game<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.670> go

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
is a very very close game and I just go

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.060 
is a very very close game and I just go
absolutely<00:00:45.539> nuts<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.500> end<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.770> getting

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
absolutely nuts I think I end up getting

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.650 
absolutely nuts I think I end up getting
like<00:00:47.250> four<00:00:47.280> tight<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.940> kills<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
like four tight and kills the in the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
like four tight and kills the in the
game<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.890> definitely<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.370> quality

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
game so it's definitely a quality

that and then there are gonna be five
different<00:01:57.479> weapons<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.200> Titan<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.799> I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
different weapons for your Titan so I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.679 
different weapons for your Titan so I
guess<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> other<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
guess that's one of the other little you

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.999 
guess that's one of the other little you
know<00:02:00.780> advantages<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.560> since<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
know advantages to it since it is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.100 
know advantages to it since it is
basically<00:02:02.610> based<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.149> Titans<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.750> mean<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.020> is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
basically based on Titans I mean it is

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.410 
basically based on Titans I mean it is
called<00:02:04.350> titanfall<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.880> there's<00:02:06.060> gonna<00:02:06.149> be

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
called titanfall so there's gonna be

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.300 
called titanfall so there's gonna be
stuff<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:06.990> your<00:02:07.079> Titan<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.590> far<00:02:07.799> as<00:02:07.920> pilots

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
stuff for your Titan but far as pilots

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.889

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.880 
stuff like that same with battlefield 4
I<00:02:36.569> think<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> lot<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.049> people<00:02:37.170> at<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.620> point

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
I think a lot of people at this point

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.920 
I think a lot of people at this point
would<00:02:37.980> agree<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.400> if<00:02:39.000> battlefield<00:02:39.569> 4<00:02:39.780> would

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
would agree that if battlefield 4 would

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.930 
would agree that if battlefield 4 would
have<00:02:40.019> focused<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.799> honing<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
have focused on just honing in on the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.240 
have focused on just honing in on the
core<00:02:42.209> gameplay<00:02:42.859> mechanic<00:02:43.859> instead<00:02:44.099> of

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
core gameplay mechanic instead of

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.490 
core gameplay mechanic instead of
feeling<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.790> they<00:02:44.939> were<00:02:45.000> pressured<00:02:45.540> by<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
feeling like they were pressured by the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.229 
feeling like they were pressured by the
consumer<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:47.159> add<00:02:47.280> all<00:02:47.609> these<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.120> know

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
consumer to add all these you know

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.789 
consumer to add all these you know
bloated<00:02:48.690> features<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.230> don't<00:02:49.440> really<00:02:49.680> add

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
bloated features that don't really add

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.380 
bloated features that don't really add
anything<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.340> game<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:50.700> they<00:02:50.819> add<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> lot

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
anything to the game but they add a lot

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.449 
anything to the game but they add a lot
of<00:02:51.450> problems<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.200> balancing<00:02:52.650> issues<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:53.190> think

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
of problems and balancing issues I think

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.099 
of problems and balancing issues I think
battlefield<00:02:54.030> 4<00:02:54.209> would<00:02:54.329> have<00:02:54.420> been<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.049> lot

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
battlefield 4 would have been a lot

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.649 
battlefield 4 would have been a lot
better<00:02:55.290> off<00:02:55.680> personally<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.359> look<00:02:57.569> at

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
better off personally so if you look at

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.119 
better off personally so if you look at
some<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.319> shooters<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.859> have<00:02:58.980> done

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
some of the the shooters that have done

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
modern warfare one had a lot of

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.949 
modern warfare one had a lot of
different<00:03:14.519> unlocks<00:03:15.000> towards<00:03:15.359> the<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.780> lower

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
different unlocks towards the the lower

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.539 
different unlocks towards the the lower
levels<00:03:16.409> but<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.739> most<00:03:16.859> part<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.250> weapon

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
levels but for the most part the weapon

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.670 
levels but for the most part the weapon
choices<00:03:17.849> were<00:03:17.970> pretty<00:03:18.230> straightforward<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.470> I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
choices were pretty straightforward so I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.189 
choices were pretty straightforward so I
think<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.879> titanfall<00:03:21.299> is<00:03:21.510> actually<00:03:21.870> doing

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.020 
think that titanfall is actually doing
something<00:03:22.410> really<00:03:22.919> smart<00:03:23.160> they're<00:03:23.699> they're

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
something really smart they're they're

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.490 
something really smart they're they're

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
making a great gameplay experience which

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.039 
making a great gameplay experience which
i<00:03:40.799> think<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:41.099> a<00:03:41.160> very<00:03:41.280> smart<00:03:41.970> move<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.480> mean<00:03:42.660> if

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
i think is a very smart move I mean if

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.629 
i think is a very smart move I mean if
you<00:03:43.139> look<00:03:43.319> at<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.590> Last<00:03:43.859> Call<00:03:44.129> of<00:03:44.190> Duty<00:03:44.519> it's

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
you look at the Last Call of Duty it's

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.000 
you look at the Last Call of Duty it's
it's<00:03:45.060> pretty<00:03:45.389> obvious<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:45.900> infinity<00:03:46.799> ward

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it's pretty obvious that infinity ward

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.530 
it's pretty obvious that infinity ward
was<00:03:47.160> like<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.549> know<00:03:47.639> what<00:03:47.849> why<00:03:48.000> don't<00:03:48.030> we<00:03:48.180> tone

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
was like you know what why don't we tone

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.360 
was like you know what why don't we tone
it<00:03:48.720> back<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:49.169> a<00:03:49.349> little<00:03:49.379> bit<00:03:49.650> maybe<00:03:50.190> we

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
it back just a little bit maybe we

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.280 
it back just a little bit maybe we
should<00:03:50.519> make<00:03:50.639> ghosts<00:03:50.940> not<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.419> over<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.810> top<00:03:51.840> i

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
should make ghosts not so over the top i

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.770 
should make ghosts not so over the top i
granted<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.280> was<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.459> didn't<00:03:54.120> end<00:03:54.389> up<00:03:54.510> being<00:03:54.690> a

granted that was a didn't end up being a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.539 
granted that was a didn't end up being a
very<00:03:54.810> good<00:03:55.169> game<00:03:55.410> but<00:03:55.709> that's<00:03:55.889> not<00:03:56.040> for<00:03:56.340> you

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
very good game but that's not for you

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.009 
very good game but that's not for you
know<00:03:56.639> balancing<00:03:56.909> reasons<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.720> stuff<00:03:57.870> like

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
know balancing reasons and stuff like

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.869 
know balancing reasons and stuff like
that<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.409> just<00:03:58.440> was<00:03:58.799> kind<00:03:59.129> of<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.340> boring<00:03:59.519> game

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
that it just was kind of a boring game

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.740 
that it just was kind of a boring game
and<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:01.669> think<00:04:02.669> a<00:04:02.790> lot<00:04:02.819> of<00:04:03.060> developers<00:04:03.569> are

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
and I think a lot of developers are

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.869 
and I think a lot of developers are
seeing<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.440> know<00:04:04.590> these<00:04:05.099> problems<00:04:05.669> with

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
seeing you know these problems with

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.699 
seeing you know these problems with
adding<00:04:06.269> tons<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:06.840> tons<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.139> content<00:04:07.349> in<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
adding tons and tons of content in the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.530 
adding tons and tons of content in the
game<00:04:07.859> it's<00:04:08.069> just<00:04:08.099> not<00:04:08.400> being<00:04:08.730> able<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:09.000> do<00:04:09.359> it

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
game it's just not being able to do it

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.330 
game it's just not being able to do it
and<00:04:09.750> they're<00:04:10.500> like<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.799> know<00:04:10.919> what<00:04:11.159> that's

and<00:04:27.199> that's<00:04:27.530> probably<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.009> smart<00:04:28.280> way<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.430> do

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
and that's probably the smart way to do

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:29.710 
and that's probably the smart way to do
it<00:04:28.759> you<00:04:28.789> know<00:04:28.879> wait<00:04:29.180> till<00:04:29.389> your<00:04:29.509> games

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
it you know wait till your games

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.360 
it you know wait till your games
outweigh<00:04:30.169> to<00:04:30.349> your<00:04:30.440> games<00:04:30.680> running<00:04:30.949> smoothly

outweigh to your games running smoothly

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.070 
outweigh to your games running smoothly
and<00:04:31.669> then<00:04:32.090> worry<00:04:32.360> about<00:04:32.449> adding<00:04:32.780> more

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
and then worry about adding more

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.450 
and then worry about adding more
features<00:04:33.259> now<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.620> know<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.860> lot<00:04:33.979> of<00:04:34.129> people<00:04:34.220> are

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
features now I know a lot of people are

saying well you know yeah we pay 60
bucks<00:04:36.470> why<00:04:37.039> should<00:04:37.280> we<00:04:37.550> have<00:04:37.759> to<00:04:37.819> sort<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.389> beta

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
bucks why should we have to sort of beta

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:39.999 
bucks why should we have to sort of beta
test<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.139> game<00:04:39.289> before<00:04:39.470> we<00:04:39.740> get<00:04:39.860> more

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
test the game before we get more

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.619 
test the game before we get more
features<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.729> that's<00:04:40.879> a<00:04:41.090> fair<00:04:41.419> argument

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629 
features and that that's a fair argument

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.629 
features and that that's a fair argument
but<00:04:42.409> I<00:04:42.500> would<00:04:42.620> argue<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.949> if<00:04:43.250> you're<00:04:43.400> if

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
but I would argue that if you're if

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.890 
but I would argue that if you're if
you're<00:04:43.789> playing<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.210> game<00:04:44.240> at<00:04:44.479> that<00:04:44.629> point

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
you're playing the game at that point

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.480 
you're playing the game at that point
you<00:04:44.960> would<00:04:45.080> probably<00:04:45.500> be<00:04:45.680> more<00:04:45.889> interested<00:04:46.370> in

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
you would probably be more interested in

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.510 
you would probably be more interested in
the<00:04:46.610> season<00:04:46.940> pass<00:04:47.150> type<00:04:47.419> thing<00:04:47.690> anyways<00:04:48.520> more

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
the season pass type thing anyways more

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.800 
the season pass type thing anyways more
so<00:04:49.699> than<00:04:49.819> someone<00:04:50.120> who<00:04:50.210> bought<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.539> game<00:04:50.659> on

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
so than someone who bought the game on

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.059 
so than someone who bought the game on
release<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.349> probably<00:04:51.590> didn't<00:04:51.800> even<00:04:51.830> need

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
release and probably didn't even need

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.580 
release and probably didn't even need
those<00:04:52.340> weapons<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.879> begin<00:04:53.090> with<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:53.590> even

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
those weapons to begin with so even

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.589 
those weapons to begin with so even
though<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:55.190> like<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:55.669> get<00:04:55.849> a<00:04:55.879> good<00:04:56.120> value<00:04:56.360> out

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
though you like to get a good value out

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.839 
though you like to get a good value out
of<00:04:56.629> games<00:04:56.930> at<00:04:57.169> this<00:04:57.319> point<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:57.800> think<00:04:57.919> that<00:04:58.460> far

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
of games at this point I think that far

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.790 
of games at this point I think that far
as<00:04:59.030> balancing<00:04:59.569> and<00:04:59.780> gameplay<00:05:00.229> wise<00:05:00.469> i<00:05:00.620> think

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
as balancing and gameplay wise i think

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.100 
as balancing and gameplay wise i think
this<00:05:00.919> is<00:05:00.979> a<00:05:01.129> very<00:05:01.520> very<00:05:02.180> smart<00:05:02.569> decision

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
this is a very very smart decision

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.800 
this is a very very smart decision
because<00:05:03.979> i<00:05:04.069> i'm<00:05:04.400> i'm<00:05:04.699> a<00:05:04.759> little<00:05:05.000> bit<00:05:05.210> tired<00:05:05.479> of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
because i i'm i'm a little bit tired of

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.869 
because i i'm i'm a little bit tired of
picking<00:05:06.530> up<00:05:06.800> games<00:05:07.069> that<00:05:07.280> just<00:05:07.430> don't<00:05:07.639> run

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
picking up games that just don't run

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.339 
picking up games that just don't run
while<00:05:08.060> i<00:05:08.090> wanna<00:05:08.419> i<00:05:08.509> just<00:05:08.930> want<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.139> fun

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
while i wanna i just want a fun

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.129 
while i wanna i just want a fun
experience<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:10.039> i<00:05:10.099> think<00:05:10.430> that<00:05:10.699> by<00:05:11.330> my<00:05:11.780> focus

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
experience and i think that by my focus

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.510 
experience and i think that by my focus
you<00:05:12.289> know<00:05:12.319> what<00:05:12.740> they've<00:05:12.949> got<00:05:13.159> in<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.370> game

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
you know what they've got in the game

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.700 
you know what they've got in the game
right<00:05:13.729> now<00:05:13.789> it's<00:05:14.270> going<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.569> be<00:05:14.780> enough

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
right now it's going to be enough

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.589 
right now it's going to be enough
variety<00:05:15.940> but<00:05:16.940> it's<00:05:17.030> going<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.210> be<00:05:17.300> enough

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
variety but it's going to be enough

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:18.999 
variety but it's going to be enough
where<00:05:17.810> they<00:05:17.900> can<00:05:18.050> control<00:05:18.409> it<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:18.740> won't<00:05:18.889> be

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
where they can control it it won't be

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.309 
where they can control it it won't be
this<00:05:19.159> chaotic<00:05:19.580> environment<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.509> you<00:05:21.229> know

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
this chaotic environment and you know

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:22.749 
this chaotic environment and you know
the<00:05:21.440> season<00:05:21.710> pass<00:05:21.860> has<00:05:22.099> been<00:05:22.280> announced<00:05:22.490> and

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
i'll touch on that a little bit before

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.510 
i'll touch on that a little bit before
this<00:05:24.289> video<00:05:24.469> ends<00:05:24.770> but<00:05:24.949> keep<00:05:25.099> an<00:05:25.219> eye<00:05:25.340> on<00:05:25.370> the

not<00:05:51.380> a<00:05:51.440> huge<00:05:51.680> fan<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.979> buying<00:05:52.310> like<00:05:52.520> season

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
not a huge fan of buying like season

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.360 
not a huge fan of buying like season
passes<00:05:53.090> that<00:05:53.539> is<00:05:53.690> a<00:05:53.719> really<00:05:54.409> really<00:05:54.440> good<00:05:55.069> deal

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
passes that is a really really good deal

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.100 
passes that is a really really good deal
and<00:05:55.639> if<00:05:55.969> you<00:05:56.060> buy<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.270> digital<00:05:56.599> deluxe

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
and if you buy the digital deluxe

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.990 
and if you buy the digital deluxe
edition<00:05:57.560> you<00:05:57.650> can<00:05:57.800> actually<00:05:57.979> get<00:05:58.219> the<00:05:58.279> dlc<00:05:58.849> for

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
edition you can actually get the dlc for

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.189 
edition you can actually get the dlc for
twenty<00:05:59.330> bucks<00:05:59.360> because<00:05:59.750> i<00:05:59.900> think<00:05:59.960> it's<00:06:00.139> like

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
twenty bucks because i think it's like

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.029 
twenty bucks because i think it's like
you<00:06:00.740> pay<00:06:01.000> 7999<00:06:02.000> for<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.479> actual<00:06:02.690> game<00:06:03.039> or

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
you pay 7999 for the actual game or

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.409 
you pay 7999 for the actual game or
something<00:06:04.340> like<00:06:04.460> that<00:06:04.520> so<00:06:04.699> you<00:06:04.940> actually<00:06:05.120> end

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
something like that so you actually end

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.119 
something like that so you actually end
up<00:06:05.539> getting<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:06.050> pretty<00:06:06.440> good<00:06:06.590> deal<00:06:06.770> if<00:06:06.919> you<00:06:06.949> do

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
up getting a pretty good deal if you do

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.519 
up getting a pretty good deal if you do
that<00:06:07.340> i<00:06:07.580> personally<00:06:08.210> and<00:06:08.750> not<00:06:09.080> a<00:06:09.110> huge<00:06:09.349> fan<00:06:09.469> of

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:09.529 
that i personally and not a huge fan of

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.680 
that i personally and not a huge fan of
season<00:06:10.370> passes<00:06:10.520> but<00:06:10.849> i<00:06:10.909> think<00:06:11.270> that's<00:06:11.419> a

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
season passes but i think that's a

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.180 
season passes but i think that's a
really<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.259> really<00:06:12.349> good<00:06:12.770> deal<00:06:12.889> for<00:06:13.099> the

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
really a really good deal for the

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.519 
really a really good deal for the
consumer<00:06:13.639> if<00:06:13.849> you<00:06:14.120> if<00:06:14.419> you<00:06:14.599> decide<00:06:15.050> to<00:06:15.199> do<00:06:15.319> that

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529 
consumer if you if you decide to do that

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.800 
consumer if you if you decide to do that
but<00:06:16.430> it<00:06:16.520> is<00:06:16.610> still<00:06:16.849> a<00:06:16.909> dangerous<00:06:17.270> practice<00:06:17.690> i

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
but it is still a dangerous practice i

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.689 
but it is still a dangerous practice i
don't<00:06:17.990> like<00:06:18.349> you<00:06:18.620> know<00:06:18.800> with<00:06:18.979> premium<00:06:19.460> i<00:06:19.550> don't

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
like giving developers money before we

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.369 
like giving developers money before we

weapon choices in the season the season
pass<00:06:27.650> price<00:06:27.979> because<00:06:28.250> i<00:06:28.310> think<00:06:28.370> those<00:06:28.550> are

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
pass price because i think those are

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.689 
pass price because i think those are
both<00:06:28.849> two<00:06:29.509> very<00:06:29.539> interesting<00:06:30.500> ways<00:06:31.400> to

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
both two very interesting ways to

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.860 
both two very interesting ways to
approach<00:06:31.909> a<00:06:32.120> game<00:06:32.300> it<00:06:32.449> seems<00:06:32.539> like<00:06:32.750> they're

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
approach a game it seems like they're

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.379 
approach a game it seems like they're
taking<00:06:33.259> the<00:06:33.409> value<00:06:33.830> standpoint<00:06:34.279> at<00:06:34.729> the<00:06:35.210> same

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
taking the value standpoint at the same

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.450 
taking the value standpoint at the same
time<00:06:35.449> they're<00:06:35.930> actually<00:06:36.229> focusing<00:06:36.830> on<00:06:37.009> giving

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
time they're actually focusing on giving

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.850 
time they're actually focusing on giving
us<00:06:37.610> a<00:06:37.759> good<00:06:37.940> game<00:06:38.149> because<00:06:38.810> let's<00:06:39.380> face<00:06:39.469> it<00:06:39.770> i
