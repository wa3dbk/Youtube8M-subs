saved three so these are the three is
I've<00:00:32.070> saved<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.360> cakey

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
I've saved and and this one is a cakey

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.290 
I've saved and and this one is a cakey
it<00:00:37.890> didn't<00:00:38.340> use<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.670> any<00:00:39.000> roots<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:40.050> I

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
it didn't use to have any roots but I

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
it didn't use to have any roots but I
saved<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.410> roots<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.860> coming<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.399> so

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
saved it and the roots is coming up so

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.049 
saved it and the roots is coming up so
hopefully<00:00:45.770> this<00:00:46.770> will<00:00:46.950> survive<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.730> I'm<00:00:47.850> sure

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
hopefully this will survive and I'm sure

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.959 
hopefully this will survive and I'm sure
it<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> these<00:00:49.620> two<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.190> transfer<00:00:50.820> them

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it will and these two I transfer them

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.110 
it will and these two I transfer them
into<00:00:51.090> hydrogen<00:00:51.930> plate<00:00:52.320> medium<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.820> didn't

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
into hydrogen plate medium they didn't

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
into hydrogen plate medium they didn't
used<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.570> any<00:00:54.809> roots<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.710> especially

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
used to have any roots at all especially

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.479 
used to have any roots at all especially
this<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.539> know<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.989> I've<00:00:58.109> shown

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
this one here I know that I've shown

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.080 
this one here I know that I've shown
this<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.090> know<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.600> show<00:01:02.090> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
this one here I know that I show this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.440 
this one here I know that I show this
one<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> few<00:01:04.019> video<00:01:04.229> already<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.180> been

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
one in a few video already so it's been

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.590 
one in a few video already so it's been
doing<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.960> well<00:01:07.760> there's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> lot<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.330> roots

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
doing really well there's a lot of roots

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
doing really well there's a lot of roots
growing<00:01:10.020> inside<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.010> there's<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.310> new<00:01:11.490> area

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
growing inside and there's a new area

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.870 
growing inside and there's a new area
root<00:01:12.240> outside<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.229> well<00:01:13.439> sticking<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.520> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
root outside as well sticking out so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
root outside as well sticking out so
these<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> roots<00:01:16.130> inside<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:18.590> what's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
these are the roots inside and what's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.980 
these are the roots inside and what's
good<00:01:19.830> about<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.340> glass<00:01:20.640> ways<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.420> hydrogen

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
good about the glass ways and hydrogen

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.230 
good about the glass ways and hydrogen
clay<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.040> actually<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.970> what's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
clay is that we can actually see what's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.899 
clay is that we can actually see what's
inside<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.320> how<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.950> progress<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
inside and see how the progress of the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.550 
inside and see how the progress of the
roots<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:28.439> one<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.670> used<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> be

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
roots and this one here it used to be

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.359 
roots and this one here it used to be
the<00:01:31.560> mother<00:01:31.829> plan<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.640> escape<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.900> um<00:01:34.380> once<00:01:35.220> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the mother plan of escape but um once I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.270 
the mother plan of escape but um once I
cut<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.500> keiki<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> mother

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
cut out the keiki out of the mother

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.249 
cut out the keiki out of the mother
plant<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.000> mother<00:01:39.210> plant<00:01:39.570> didn't<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.020> well

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
plant the mother plant didn't do well

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.710 
plant the mother plant didn't do well
and<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.579> sick<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.270> root<00:01:42.509> or

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and got really sick and the root or

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.560 
and got really sick and the root or
rotten<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:44.250> I've<00:01:44.430> transferred<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.180> hydrogen

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
rotten but I've transferred to hydrogen

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.030 
rotten but I've transferred to hydrogen
clay<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.939> now<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.000> roots<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.840> coming<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.829> if

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
clay and now the roots are coming out if

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.179 
clay and now the roots are coming out if
you<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> little<00:01:50.790> roots<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
you see that little roots there and

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.850 
you see that little roots there and
there's<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.549> roots<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.229> side<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
there's the other roots on the side and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.459 
there's the other roots on the side and
also<00:01:56.490> there's<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.000> new<00:01:57.210> leaf<00:01:57.479> coming<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.170> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
also there's a new leaf coming up so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.550 
also there's a new leaf coming up so
which<00:01:58.649> means<00:01:59.030> this<00:02:00.030> plant<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.600> striving<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
which means this plant is striving and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.310 
which means this plant is striving and
it's<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.670> well<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:04.170> will

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it's going to do well and it will

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.139 
it's going to do well and it will
survive<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.280> hopefully<00:02:05.850> after<00:02:06.149> 2<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:06.750> 3<00:02:06.869> years

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
survive so hopefully after 2 or 3 years

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.140 
survive so hopefully after 2 or 3 years
they<00:02:09.149> will<00:02:09.360> give<00:02:09.780> us<00:02:09.989> pretty<00:02:10.530> big<00:02:11.099> blooms

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
they will give us pretty big blooms

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.240 
they will give us pretty big blooms
okay<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.860> now<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.099> want<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.640> tell<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.390> how

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
okay so now I want to tell you about how

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.460 
okay so now I want to tell you about how
distinguish<00:02:17.250> between<00:02:17.810> sick<00:02:18.810> orchids<00:02:19.290> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
distinguish between sick orchids and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.759 
distinguish between sick orchids and
between<00:02:19.920> healthy<00:02:20.879> orchids<00:02:22.250> if<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.909> a

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
between healthy orchids if you have a

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.080 
between healthy orchids if you have a
clear<00:02:25.769> plastic<00:02:26.129> pot<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.659> easily<00:02:29.090> see

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
clear plastic pot you can easily see

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.770 
clear plastic pot you can easily see
inside<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.799> root<00:02:32.010> system<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:33.090> example<00:02:33.569> this

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
inside the root system for example this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.350 
inside the root system for example this
one<00:02:34.019> here<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.769> means<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.549> this<00:02:35.700> orchid<00:02:36.180> is

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
one here it means that this orchid is

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.470 
one here it means that this orchid is
really<00:02:36.780> healthy<00:02:37.069> but<00:02:38.069> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.379> have<00:02:40.379> a<00:02:41.480> black

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
really healthy but if you have a black

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.990 
really healthy but if you have a black
pot<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.590> can't<00:02:43.890> see<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.160> root<00:02:44.519> system

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
pot that you can't see the root system

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.619 
pot that you can't see the root system
inside<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.590> check<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.400> leaf<00:02:47.579> if<00:02:47.849> it's

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
inside so just check the leaf if it's

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.349 
inside so just check the leaf if it's
firm<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.470> stiff<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.829> it<00:02:52.829> shiny<00:02:53.760> as<00:02:54.120> well

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
firm and stiff and it shiny as well

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.270 
firm and stiff and it shiny as well
which<00:02:54.660> mean<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.140> plant<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.709> doing<00:02:56.040> really

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
which mean this plant is doing really

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.860 
which mean this plant is doing really
well<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:57.109> also<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.760> touch<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.420> know<00:03:00.629> if

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
well and also you touch it you know if

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.940 
well and also you touch it you know if
it's<00:03:01.019> quite<00:03:01.379> thick<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:03.590> when<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.709> lift

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
it's quite thick and and when you lift

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.580 
it's quite thick and and when you lift
it<00:03:05.040> up<00:03:05.159> just<00:03:05.459> drop<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.000> very<00:03:06.810> stiff<00:03:07.200> so

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
it up just drop like that very stiff so

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.949 
it up just drop like that very stiff so
which<00:03:07.799> means<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.250> plant<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.640> doing<00:03:08.790> well<00:03:09.150> so

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
which means this plant is doing well so

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.780 
which means this plant is doing well so
without<00:03:10.290> having<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.739> check<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.159> root<00:03:11.310> systems

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
without having to check the root systems

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.220 
without having to check the root systems
for<00:03:12.450> example<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.230> one<00:03:13.560> here<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.930> touch

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
for example this one here if you touch

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.210 
for example this one here if you touch
the<00:03:16.470> leaf<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.919> really<00:03:17.310> thin<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.180> wrinkly<00:03:19.220> so

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the leaf it's really thin and wrinkly so

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.490 
the leaf it's really thin and wrinkly so
which<00:03:20.489> means<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.450> one<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.900> not<00:03:22.200> doing

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
which means this this one is not doing

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.330 
which means this this one is not doing
well<00:03:22.680> at<00:03:22.859> all<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.900> if<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.109> see<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:26.130> leaf<00:03:26.310> just

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
well at all and if you see the leaf just

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.300 
well at all and if you see the leaf just
drop<00:03:27.030> like<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:28.109> it's<00:03:28.410> not<00:03:28.500> doing<00:03:28.889> well<00:03:29.129> so

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
drop like that so it's not doing well so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.869 
drop like that so it's not doing well so
today<00:03:29.669> I'm<00:03:30.109> going<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.410> check<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:32.250> plants

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
today I'm going to check this plants

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.890 
today I'm going to check this plants
that<00:03:33.510> I'm<00:03:33.720> going<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.109> cut<00:03:34.349> this<00:03:35.060> spike<00:03:36.060> out<00:03:36.419> and

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
that I'm going to cut this spike out and

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.490 
that I'm going to cut this spike out and
I<00:03:37.109> will<00:03:37.500> check<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.489> root<00:03:38.730> system<00:03:39.150> inside<00:03:39.569> see

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
I will check the root system inside see

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.520 
I will check the root system inside see
houses<00:03:41.400> plants<00:03:41.970> doing<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.540> then<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.079> will<00:03:43.319> put

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
houses plants doing and then I will put

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.009 
houses plants doing and then I will put
it<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.859> glass<00:03:44.790> waste<00:03:45.410> with<00:03:46.410> heikal<00:03:46.919> hydrogen

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
it in glass waste with heikal hydrogen

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.280 
it in glass waste with heikal hydrogen
mediums<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.790> before<00:03:51.389> I<00:03:51.419> used<00:03:51.720> my<00:03:51.959> tools

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
mediums so before I used my tools

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.800 
mediums so before I used my tools
specially<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.190> scissors<00:03:53.549> i<00:03:53.699> sterilize<00:03:54.449> it

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
specially the scissors i sterilize it

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.150 
specially the scissors i sterilize it
with<00:03:54.989> alcohol<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:57.109> today<00:03:58.109> I'm<00:03:58.349> using<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.919> hand

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
with alcohol so today I'm using the hand

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.180 
with alcohol so today I'm using the hand
sanitizer<00:03:59.840> which<00:04:00.840> has<00:04:01.109> alcohol<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:01.980> and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
sanitizer which has alcohol in it and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.530 
sanitizer which has alcohol in it and
it's<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.160> fine

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
it's it's just fine

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.140 
it's it's just fine
I've<00:04:07.470> been<00:04:07.680> doing<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.129> for<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.489> lot<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.910> times

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
I've been doing that for a lot of times

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.140 
I've been doing that for a lot of times
and<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.569> haven't<00:04:09.810> had<00:04:10.020> any<00:04:10.200> problems<00:04:10.849> use<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:12.030> to

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
and I haven't had any problems use it to

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.690 
and I haven't had any problems use it to
cut<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.390> spike<00:04:12.780> out<00:04:14.360> yeah<00:04:15.360> here<00:04:15.660> we<00:04:15.690> go

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
cut the spike out yeah here we go

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.020 
cut the spike out yeah here we go
so<00:04:18.109> now<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.739> really<00:04:20.130> good<00:04:20.370> opportunity<00:04:20.639> to

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
so now it's a really good opportunity to

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.969 
so now it's a really good opportunity to
check<00:04:21.359> what<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.600> root<00:04:21.900> system<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.410> like<00:04:22.680> so

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
check what the root system is like so

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:31.010 
check what the root system is like so
what<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.250> do<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.760> just<00:04:23.940> pull<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.360> out<00:04:30.020> it's

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
what I do is just pull it out it's

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.480 
what I do is just pull it out it's
actually<00:04:31.410> quite<00:04:31.650> okay<00:04:32.780> there<00:04:33.780> are<00:04:33.810> no<00:04:33.990> mushy

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
actually quite okay there are no mushy

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.980 
actually quite okay there are no mushy
roots<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.840> root<00:04:36.990> are<00:04:37.200> still<00:04:37.470> quite<00:04:37.740> hot<00:04:38.040> so

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
roots the root are still quite hot so

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.350 
roots the root are still quite hot so
which<00:04:39.990> means<00:04:40.320> this<00:04:41.010> plan<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.580> still<00:04:41.820> doing

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
which means this plan is still doing

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.719 
which means this plan is still doing
fine<00:04:42.389> but<00:04:43.110> I'm<00:04:43.350> not<00:04:43.590> sure<00:04:43.919> why<00:04:44.190> is<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.520> lever

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
fine but I'm not sure why is the lever

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.530 
fine but I'm not sure why is the lever
so<00:04:45.590> soft<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:49.280> it<00:04:50.280> doesn't<00:04:50.639> produce<00:04:50.880> any

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
so soft and and it doesn't produce any

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.640 
so soft and and it doesn't produce any
new<00:04:51.570> relief<00:04:52.050> or<00:04:52.410> any<00:04:53.479> new<00:04:54.479> roots<00:04:54.810> for<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.350> while

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
new relief or any new roots for a while

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.409 
new relief or any new roots for a while
already<00:04:55.889> so<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:58.620> might<00:04:58.860> not<00:04:58.919> be<00:04:59.550> doing<00:05:00.060> well

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
already so it might not be doing well

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.580 
already so it might not be doing well
with<00:05:00.660> this<00:05:00.870> box<00:05:01.229> here<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:02.570> this<00:05:03.570> root<00:05:04.139> it<00:05:04.320> fits

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
with this box here so this root it fits

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.920 
with this box here so this root it fits
perfectly<00:05:05.070> fine<00:05:05.340> in<00:05:05.520> this<00:05:05.669> pot<00:05:05.940> here<00:05:06.419> this

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
perfectly fine in this pot here this

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.520 
perfectly fine in this pot here this
glass<00:05:07.200> waste<00:05:07.500> at<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.130> bottom<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.669> put<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:08.970> few

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
glass waste at the bottom I put a few

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.719 
glass waste at the bottom I put a few
hydrogen<00:05:10.530> clay<00:05:10.770> medium<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:12.139> there<00:05:13.139> now<00:05:13.729> the

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
hydrogen clay medium and there now the

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.580 
hydrogen clay medium and there now the
medium<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.210> I'm<00:05:15.300> using<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.960> put<00:05:16.139> in<00:05:16.229> this<00:05:16.320> pot

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
medium that I'm using to put in this pot

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.550 
medium that I'm using to put in this pot
is<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:17.010> some<00:05:17.340> speck<00:05:17.789> no<00:05:17.940> moss<00:05:18.180> a<00:05:18.510> little<00:05:19.440> bit

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
is that some speck no moss a little bit

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.129 
is that some speck no moss a little bit
of<00:05:19.680> box<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.310> most<00:05:21.240> of<00:05:21.389> them<00:05:21.539> are<00:05:21.750> hydrogen

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
of box and most of them are hydrogen

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.360 
of box and most of them are hydrogen
clay<00:05:22.470> media<00:05:27.229> and<00:05:28.229> then<00:05:28.500> just<00:05:28.740> stack<00:05:29.010> them<00:05:29.220> all

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
clay media and then just stack them all

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.850 
clay media and then just stack them all
inside

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
inside

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.040

so<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:32.039> pregnant<00:05:32.490> moth<00:05:32.669> will<00:05:32.970> give<00:05:33.840> the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
so this pregnant moth will give the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.430 
so this pregnant moth will give the
moisture<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.740> roots<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.870> -<00:05:36.870> clay<00:05:37.110> is<00:05:37.260> to

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
moisture to the roots and - clay is to

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.940 
moisture to the roots and - clay is to
give<00:05:37.620> air<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.919> root<00:05:38.910> and<00:05:39.270> also<00:05:39.800> moisture<00:05:40.800> as

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
give air a root and also moisture as

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.760 
give air a root and also moisture as
well<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:42.630> bags<00:05:42.870> just<00:05:43.200> give<00:05:43.350> a<00:05:43.380> little<00:05:43.470> bit

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
well and the bags just give a little bit

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.760 
well and the bags just give a little bit
of<00:05:43.860> nutrients<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:45.000> do<00:05:45.120> so<00:05:45.539> how<00:05:45.720> you<00:05:45.780> water<00:05:46.530> this

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
of nutrients to do so how you water this

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.529 
of nutrients to do so how you water this
plant<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:47.370> to<00:05:47.760> put<00:05:47.970> a<00:05:48.030> little<00:05:48.240> bit<00:05:48.389> of

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
plant is to put a little bit of

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.620 
plant is to put a little bit of
fertilizer<00:05:48.720> and<00:05:49.500> fill<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.520> water<00:05:50.789> up<00:05:51.210> until

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
fertilizer and fill the water up until

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.800 
fertilizer and fill the water up until
here<00:05:52.229> soak<00:05:53.099> it<00:05:53.310> for<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:53.940> minute<00:05:54.300> or<00:05:54.419> two<00:05:54.599> and

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
here soak it for a minute or two and

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.650 
here soak it for a minute or two and
then<00:05:54.960> just<00:05:55.169> pour<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.530> water<00:05:55.710> out<00:05:56.539> but<00:05:57.539> this

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
then just pour the water out but this

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.920 
then just pour the water out but this
hasn't<00:05:57.900> played<00:05:58.669> water<00:05:59.669> once<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.450> week<00:06:00.660> is

hasn't played water once a week is

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.350 
hasn't played water once a week is
totally<00:06:01.710> fine<00:06:01.919> in<00:06:02.130> the<00:06:02.220> winter<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:02.820> summer

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
totally fine in the winter and summer

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.760 
totally fine in the winter and summer
twice<00:06:03.870> a<00:06:03.900> week<00:06:04.260> and<00:06:04.610> there<00:06:05.610> you<00:06:05.729> go<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:06.240> also

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
twice a week and there you go and also

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.730 
twice a week and there you go and also
um

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
um

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.670 
um
to<00:06:09.190> make<00:06:09.820> it<00:06:09.970> strife<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:10.330> little<00:06:10.720> bit<00:06:10.840> more<00:06:11.050> with

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
to make it strife a little bit more with

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.770 
to make it strife a little bit more with
the<00:06:12.160> plant<00:06:12.430> that<00:06:12.640> have<00:06:12.790> no<00:06:12.940> reverse<00:06:13.360> planners

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
the plant that have no reverse planners

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.190 
the plant that have no reverse planners
actually<00:06:14.200> it's<00:06:14.440> not<00:06:14.590> necessary<00:06:15.390> to<00:06:16.390> put<00:06:16.690> it<00:06:17.020> on

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
actually it's not necessary to put it on

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.910 
actually it's not necessary to put it on
a<00:06:17.550> humidity<00:06:18.550> train<00:06:18.970> but<00:06:19.630> for<00:06:20.050> example<00:06:20.590> these

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
a humidity train but for example these

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.230 
a humidity train but for example these
two<00:06:21.220> plans<00:06:21.580> it<00:06:21.970> is<00:06:22.660> necessary<00:06:23.410> to<00:06:23.620> put<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:23.920> on<00:06:24.100> a

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
two plans it is necessary to put it on a

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.710 
two plans it is necessary to put it on a
humidity<00:06:25.240> train<00:06:26.070> so<00:06:27.070> like<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:27.760> because<00:06:28.540> they

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
humidity train so like that because they

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.170 
humidity train so like that because they
didn't<00:06:29.020> have<00:06:29.200> any<00:06:29.410> roots<00:06:29.650> at<00:06:29.860> all<00:06:30.010> and<00:06:30.250> because

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
didn't have any roots at all and because

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.030 
didn't have any roots at all and because
they<00:06:31.330> don't<00:06:31.480> have<00:06:31.750> roots<00:06:32.020> they<00:06:32.380> can't<00:06:32.650> absorb

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
they don't have roots they can't absorb

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.240 
they don't have roots they can't absorb
water<00:06:33.310> so<00:06:33.840> what<00:06:34.840> the<00:06:35.080> plants<00:06:35.530> does<00:06:35.770> is<00:06:36.040> that

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
water so what the plants does is that

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.940 
water so what the plants does is that
the<00:06:36.430> leaf<00:06:36.700> is<00:06:36.940> actually<00:06:37.420> absorbing<00:06:38.230> water<00:06:38.590> if

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
the leaf is actually absorbing water if

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.670 
the leaf is actually absorbing water if
you<00:06:39.490> have<00:06:41.400> gravels<00:06:42.400> in<00:06:42.820> a<00:06:43.240> tray<00:06:43.510> and<00:06:43.750> fill<00:06:44.530> it

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
you have gravels in a tray and fill it

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.340 
you have gravels in a tray and fill it
some<00:06:45.010> water<00:06:45.340> and<00:06:45.810> then<00:06:48.150> have<00:06:49.150> a<00:06:49.180> stick<00:06:49.600> on<00:06:49.870> here

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
some water and then have a stick on here

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:58.050 
some water and then have a stick on here
and<00:06:53.350> use<00:06:53.650> the<00:06:53.890> back<00:06:54.100> to<00:06:54.430> cover<00:06:55.740> and<00:06:57.060> translate

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
and use the back to cover and translate

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.310 
and use the back to cover and translate
that<00:06:58.090> in<00:06:58.450> a<00:06:58.570> quite<00:06:59.110> bright<00:06:59.940> light<00:07:00.940> area<00:07:01.420> at<00:07:02.110> the

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
that in a quite bright light area at the

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.070 
that in a quite bright light area at the
window<00:07:02.680> and<00:07:03.040> then<00:07:03.880> what<00:07:04.360> it<00:07:04.480> does<00:07:04.510> is<00:07:04.690> that<00:07:04.900> it

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
window and then what it does is that it

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.410 
window and then what it does is that it
will<00:07:05.320> keep<00:07:05.530> the<00:07:05.770> plant<00:07:06.160> warm<00:07:06.610> in<00:07:06.850> the<00:07:07.060> winter

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
will keep the plant warm in the winter

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.200 
will keep the plant warm in the winter
times<00:07:07.690> and<00:07:08.280> also<00:07:09.280> they<00:07:09.580> can<00:07:09.760> absorb<00:07:10.030> water

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
times and also they can absorb water

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.110 
times and also they can absorb water
from<00:07:10.630> stray<00:07:10.990> as<00:07:11.140> well<00:07:11.350> and<00:07:11.850> after<00:07:12.850> three

from stray as well and after three
months<00:07:13.510> to<00:07:13.690> the<00:07:13.840> rule<00:07:14.080> eventually<00:07:14.860> comes<00:07:15.070> out

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
months to the rule eventually comes out

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.000 
months to the rule eventually comes out
for<00:07:16.120> this<00:07:16.210> particular<00:07:16.390> plant<00:07:16.930> its<00:07:17.350> finds<00:07:17.710> like

for this particular plant its finds like

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.800 
for this particular plant its finds like
that<00:07:18.220> you<00:07:18.640> don't<00:07:18.820> need<00:07:19.000> to<00:07:19.060> put<00:07:19.390> it<00:07:19.510> on<00:07:19.630> the
