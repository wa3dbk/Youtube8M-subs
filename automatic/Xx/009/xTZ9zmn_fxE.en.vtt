00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.210
 Now we are starting to implement 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.039
 already our bottom for the box since 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.830
 we have a square box 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.580
 Respectively from below, we do exactly that. 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.390
 same bottom what for this we do for this 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.689
 we are just like for the previous one 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.340
 works for the previous part we type 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.980
 only thing here i advise 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.260
 it is better to dial a chain of ordinary 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.649
 air loops recruit a chain of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 air loops by loop number 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.390
 must be equal to the number of columns 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 on the verge on the same verge of our square 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.050
 our wall shape wall quantity 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.840
 wall columns must be equal 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.570
 the number of loops that you are now 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:08.880
 type I had fifteen times two 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:12.000
 three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 15 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.549
 I have recruited air loops now 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.430
 I do 2 air loops 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.830
 miss 3 loops and thread the hook into 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.229
 fourth loop according to 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 the rules of knitting the circle we are with you now 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.280
 let's connect a circle about and a circle of a square of course 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.119
 same square we have with you square 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.479
 I just have the same form 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.890
 small 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.990
 for the daughter did a pencil stand 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.619
 very interesting to you too it necessarily 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.200
 will show 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.840
 and here she has just the form below circle 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.329
 I just on the example of this stand under 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.009
 pencils show you how you can make 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.840
 decorate a little bit with different colors 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:06.570
 and small patterns 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.729
 here we are linking you to the edge we 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.560
 should knit with single poles 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.560
 nakida to the edge of the canvas 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.230
 So 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.239
 here I have quite a bit 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.689
 do not forget the last column 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.180
 knit the last post after 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:09.360
 how to knit necessarily recount 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.569
 the number of times two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.079
 12 13 14 and 15 are lifting loops 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.680
 I got everything right now satve 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.840
 according to knitting I rise 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.359
 with two air loops 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.540
 I turn the cloth and continue to knit 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:31.250
 skip lifting loops 1 loop which 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:37.099
 located under the loops of the lift and 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.099
 continue knitting I see a square square 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:47.700
 i keep on knitting like this until my square 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:51.359
 won't become a real square shape 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.540
 i repeat rows repeat them before 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:04:01.889
 the moment when I fail 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:05.430
 square since i have 15 columns 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:09.120
 most likely I will make 7 rows with bars 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.459
 with one crochet and then see how I 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.940
 it will be better to do but most likely I 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.019
 I will stop on 7 columns with 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:23.490
 one crochet on the 7 rows continue 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.340
 knitting do the same thing and you knit 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.550
 until the moment when we fail 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.550
 square 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.490
 I made a square look at me 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.800
 turned out of the seven rows of columns with 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.870
 One nakida and since I did not have enough 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.210
 a little bit to get 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.840
 rovnenky square, I took another 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.550
 row with crochets how to check 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.819
 how much square do we have 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.569
 exactly square they are elongated 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.759
 a rectangle we just add 2 2 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.460
 angle attract each other if 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.219
 it turns out a triangle here 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.620
 so he gets it clearly 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:11.539
 corners are bent 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.039
 here here and you see a clear even 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.500
 triangle as soon as it turned out 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.529
 triangle means you are ready beautiful 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.330
 the square is all on this now our square 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.979
 completed our one ready we proceed to 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.370
 mount but here I will do 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.529
 mount is not the same color and other 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.469
 so this thread is exactly the same 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:37.349
 fix do additional 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:41.270
 air loop and cut the thread on 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:45.539
 a distance of about 15-20 centimeters 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.879
 cut the thread ready I'm not now 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:52.159
 clean I will clean it in the process 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.159
 performing the connection
