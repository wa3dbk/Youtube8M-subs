simple so let's have a quick look at

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.160 
simple so let's have a quick look at
maybe<00:02:45.430> doing<00:02:45.640> something<00:02:46.090> else<00:02:46.300> I'd<00:02:46.450> said<00:02:46.780> how

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
maybe doing something else I'd said how

we<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.470> print<00:02:47.680> from<00:02:47.800> one<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.430> other

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
we can print from one of the other

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.750 
we can print from one of the other
applications<00:02:49.120> these<00:02:49.330> pages<00:02:49.780> available<00:02:50.760> from

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
applications these pages available from

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.430 
applications these pages available from
Apple<00:02:52.350> if<00:02:53.350> we<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:53.680> choose<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.250> tools<00:02:54.910> button

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
Apple if we just choose the tools button

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.780 
Apple if we just choose the tools button
and<00:02:56.440> one<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.739> options<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:57.130> share<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.489> print

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
and one of the options is share on print

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.150 
and one of the options is share on print
so<00:02:58.000> we'll<00:02:58.120> click<00:02:58.270> on<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.830> check<00:02:59.830> print

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
so we'll click on that check print

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.640 
so we'll click on that check print
option<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:02.140> going<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.320> take<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.440> few

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
option and it's going to take a few

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.550 
option and it's going to take a few
seconds<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.190> look<00:03:03.280> into<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.610> network<00:03:04.560> and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
seconds to look into the network and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.080 
seconds to look into the network and
then<00:03:05.709> what<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.040> doing<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.370> here<00:03:06.550> we<00:03:06.640> go<00:03:06.790> so

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
then what it's doing that here we go so

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.120 
then what it's doing that here we go so
we've<00:03:07.209> got<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.450> printer<00:03:08.140> recognized<00:03:08.590> we<00:03:08.980> can

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
we've got the printer recognized we can

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.340 
we've got the printer recognized we can
choose<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> range<00:03:09.700> number<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.840> copies<00:03:11.050> in

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
choose a range number of copies in

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.530 
choose a range number of copies in
double-sided<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.190> said<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.730> what<00:03:13.390> we'll

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
double-sided like I said so what we'll

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.560 
double-sided like I said so what we'll
do<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.720> we'll<00:03:13.900> just<00:03:14.140> choose<00:03:14.410> one<00:03:14.860> one<00:03:15.850> page

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
do is we'll just choose one one page

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.860 
do is we'll just choose one one page
clink<00:03:16.989> we<00:03:17.500> don't<00:03:17.650> waste<00:03:17.890> all<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.280> on<00:03:18.459> tests

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
clink we don't waste all this on tests

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.800 
clink we don't waste all this on tests
and<00:03:19.870> then<00:03:20.350> go<00:03:20.890> back<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.640> we're<00:03:21.790> putting<00:03:21.970> one

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
and then go back so we're putting one

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.290 
and then go back so we're putting one
page<00:03:23.080> where<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.610> like<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:24.880> said<00:03:25.060> we'll<00:03:25.180> hit

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
page where so like I said we'll hit

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.600 
page where so like I said we'll hit
print<00:03:25.570> tell<00:03:26.170> us<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:26.440> communicating<00:03:27.100> this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
print tell us it's communicating this

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.650 
print tell us it's communicating this
one<00:03:27.820> might<00:03:27.970> take<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.209> little<00:03:28.360> bit<00:03:28.510> longer

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
one might take a little bit longer

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.780 
one might take a little bit longer
obviously<00:03:28.959> because<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.560> page<00:03:29.769> has<00:03:30.040> got<00:03:30.250> a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
obviously because the page has got a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.830 
obviously because the page has got a
little<00:03:31.329> bit<00:03:31.450> more<00:03:31.540> data<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.829> I'm<00:03:33.130> just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
little bit more data in it so I'm just

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.039 
little bit more data in it so I'm just
printing<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.049> data<00:03:36.150> Wi-Fi<00:03:37.150> buttons<00:03:37.720> lining

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
printing the data Wi-Fi buttons lining

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.420 
printing the data Wi-Fi buttons lining
up<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.299> stays<00:03:40.630> very<00:03:40.959> nice<00:03:41.890> right<00:03:42.130> here<00:03:42.340> we

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
up and it stays very nice right here we

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:54.980 
up and it stays very nice right here we
go

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.560 

so<00:03:55.990> there<00:03:56.140> we<00:03:56.230> go<00:03:56.260> here's<00:03:56.800> our<00:03:56.950> printout<00:03:57.570> let's

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
so there we go here's our printout let's

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.640 
so there we go here's our printout let's
just<00:03:58.930> go<00:03:59.170> back<00:04:00.600> it's<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.780> printout<00:04:02.140> that's<00:04:02.440> what

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
just go back it's a printout that's what

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.700 
just go back it's a printout that's what

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
we've got you can see that some which

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.260 
we've got you can see that some which
was<00:04:08.860> printed<00:04:09.070> out<00:04:09.280> exactly<00:04:09.850> what<00:04:09.940> we<00:04:10.030> had<00:04:10.150> on

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
was printed out exactly what we had on

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.270 
was printed out exactly what we had on
screen<00:04:10.510> it's<00:04:10.690> as<00:04:10.810> simple<00:04:11.020> as<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.890> really

one of the features of this

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.139 
one of the features of this
multifunction<00:04:47.439> is<00:04:47.529> the<00:04:47.740> ability<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.189> scan<00:04:48.580> and

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:49.149 
multifunction is the ability to scan and

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.089 
multifunction is the ability to scan and
you<00:04:49.749> can<00:04:49.899> scan<00:04:50.199> traditionally<00:04:50.680> back<00:04:50.860> into<00:04:51.069> a

you can scan traditionally back into a

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.609 
you can scan traditionally back into a
computer<00:04:51.759> like<00:04:52.089> most<00:04:52.749> multi<00:04:53.050> functions<00:04:53.439> but

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:53.619 
computer like most multi functions but

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:56.399 
computer like most multi functions but
as<00:04:53.830> it's<00:04:54.039> an<00:04:54.159> AirPrint<00:04:54.460> enabled<00:04:54.639> device<00:04:55.409> it

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
as it's an AirPrint enabled device it

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.769 
as it's an AirPrint enabled device it
very<00:04:57.159> easily<00:04:57.399> will<00:04:57.789> scan<00:04:58.059> back<00:04:58.270> into<00:04:58.629> an

00:04:58.769 --> 00:04:58.779 
very easily will scan back into an

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.189 
very easily will scan back into an
iPhone<00:04:58.960> or<00:04:59.439> an<00:04:59.800> iPad<00:05:00.430> if<00:05:00.729> you<00:05:00.969> would<00:05:01.240> like<00:05:01.449> now
