you<00:01:44.970> doing<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.720> notebook<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.829> imagine

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you doing out a notebook I don't imagine

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.240 
you doing out a notebook I don't imagine
you<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.119> open<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> pci

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you want to open it up to me so a pci

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.520 
you want to open it up to me so a pci
card<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.920> some<00:01:53.030> receivers<00:01:54.030> are<00:01:54.869> aren't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
card and some receivers are aren't

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.340 
card and some receivers are aren't
written<00:01:56.070> friggin<00:01:56.549> Ernie<00:01:56.850> USB<00:01:57.420> key<00:01:58.880> if<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.119> can

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
written friggin Ernie USB key if you can

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.970 
written friggin Ernie USB key if you can
see<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.680> there

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.900 

so<00:02:06.000> that's<00:02:07.290> something<00:02:08.290> to<00:02:08.500> consider<00:02:08.860> if<00:02:09.700> you

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
so that's something to consider if you

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.420 
so that's something to consider if you
use<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.869> PC<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.430> use<00:02:12.820> either<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.990> pci<00:02:14.920> card

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
use a PC you can use either a pci card

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.190 
use a PC you can use either a pci card
which<00:02:16.240> would<00:02:16.570> require<00:02:17.640> insert<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.850> into<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.540> pci

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
which would require insert it into a pci

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.020 
which would require insert it into a pci
express<00:02:20.590> slot<00:02:21.100> or<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:23.170> motherboard<00:02:23.470> or

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
express slot or on the motherboard or

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.480 
express slot or on the motherboard or
one<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.060> these<00:02:25.530> USB<00:02:26.530> receivers<00:02:28.170> now<00:02:29.490> there's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
one of these USB receivers now there's

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
one of these USB receivers now there's
about<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.930> about<00:02:32.500> three<00:02:32.980> things<00:02:33.280> yeah<00:02:34.030> half

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
about that about three things yeah half

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.170 
about that about three things yeah half
to<00:02:34.750> consider<00:02:35.550> one<00:02:36.550> is<00:02:37.980> does<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.130> have<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.520> hook

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
to consider one is does it have to hook

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.150 
to consider one is does it have to hook
up<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:41.050> an<00:02:41.140> existing<00:02:41.760> satellite<00:02:42.760> service<00:02:43.480> or

up to an existing satellite service or

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.100 
up to an existing satellite service or
can<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.580> particular<00:02:45.880> one<00:02:46.360> you're<00:02:46.660> looking<00:02:46.690> at
