that<00:03:45.820> was<00:03:45.940> very<00:03:46.000> clever<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.570> them<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:49.620> there's

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
that was very clever of them and there's

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.210

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
the meat axe guy blaster right here and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.030 
the meat axe guy blaster right here and
the<00:03:54.220> usual<00:03:55.060> instruction<00:03:55.720> manual<00:03:56.170> this

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
the usual instruction manual this

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.920 
the usual instruction manual this
doesn't<00:03:57.430> exist<00:03:58.150> okay<00:04:00.090> we<00:04:01.090> will<00:04:01.120> now<00:04:01.420> build<00:04:01.720> the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
doesn't exist okay we will now build the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.620 
doesn't exist okay we will now build the
set<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:03.280> since<00:04:03.730> it's<00:04:03.880> too<00:04:04.090> long<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.329> do<00:04:04.600> it

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
set but since it's too long to do it

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.470 
set but since it's too long to do it
manually<00:04:05.109> I<00:04:05.470> think<00:04:05.859> I'll<00:04:06.010> just<00:04:06.040> do<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:06.609> five

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
manually I think I'll just do this five

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.820 
manually I think I'll just do this five
four<00:04:08.350> three<00:04:08.859> two<00:04:09.810> one<00:04:10.810> oh<00:04:11.790> well<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.970> was<00:04:13.120> easy

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
four three two one oh well that was easy

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.630 
four three two one oh well that was easy
I<00:04:13.890> don't<00:04:14.820> make<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.270> sound<00:04:15.330> um<00:04:16.160> let's<00:04:17.160> go<00:04:17.430> into

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
I don't make that sound um let's go into

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.100 
I don't make that sound um let's go into
bullying<00:04:18.030> experience<00:04:18.540> well<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.720> don't<00:04:18.900> know

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
bullying experience well I don't know

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.350 
bullying experience well I don't know
how<00:04:19.370> it's<00:04:20.370> going<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.610> be<00:04:20.760> because<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.150> didn't

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
how it's going to be because I didn't

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.270 
how it's going to be because I didn't
actually<00:04:21.480> build<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.110> but<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.620> imagine<00:04:23.130> we

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
actually build it but I imagine we

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.730 
actually build it but I imagine we
pretty<00:04:23.640> hard<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:25.050> legs<00:04:25.260> are<00:04:25.410> actually

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
pretty hard the legs are actually

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.470 
pretty hard the legs are actually
symmetric<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:28.590> have<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:28.890> do<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:29.790> 2x<00:04:30.180> thing

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
symmetric so you have to do the 2x thing

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.450 
symmetric so you have to do the 2x thing
on<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.720> instruction<00:04:31.260> manual<00:04:31.290> whatever<00:04:31.800> now

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
on the instruction manual whatever now

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.250 
on the instruction manual whatever now
the<00:04:32.760> first<00:04:32.940> thing<00:04:33.060> I'd<00:04:33.330> like<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.540> tell<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:33.900> is

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
the first thing I'd like to tell you is

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
that top Takata was huge this is Tommy

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.790 
that top Takata was huge this is Tommy
wha<00:04:38.460> mystica<00:04:39.060> next<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.450> him<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.930> this<00:04:40.620> is

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
wha mystica next to him and this is

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.780 
wha mystica next to him and this is
cartas<00:04:41.460> zoom<00:04:42.210> out<00:04:42.330> here<00:04:42.600> man<00:04:42.810> he's<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.050> big<00:04:43.230> guy

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
cartas zoom out here man he's a big guy

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.210 
cartas zoom out here man he's a big guy
look<00:04:44.790> at<00:04:44.910> that<00:04:45.500> cartas<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.650> about<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.040> height

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
look at that cartas is about the height

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.290 
look at that cartas is about the height
of<00:04:47.460> takanuva<00:04:48.060> that's<00:04:48.960> amazing<00:04:50.090> talking<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.150> my

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
of takanuva that's amazing talking to my

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.260 
of takanuva that's amazing talking to my
stride<00:04:51.690> antic<00:04:52.140> I<00:04:52.730> don't<00:04:53.730> want<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:53.940> spend<00:04:54.180> all

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
stride antic I don't want to spend all

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.320 
stride antic I don't want to spend all
our<00:04:54.330> time<00:04:54.480> on<00:04:54.990> how<00:04:55.140> big<00:04:55.440> he<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.680> but<00:04:56.670> as<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:57.210> can

our time on how big he is but as you can

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.080 
our time on how big he is but as you can
tell<00:04:57.390> he's<00:04:57.780> huge<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:59.250> I'd<00:04:59.460> like<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.760> do<00:04:59.910> some

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
tell he's huge so I'd like to do some

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.390 
tell he's huge so I'd like to do some

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
comparisons between the two takanuva was

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.150
