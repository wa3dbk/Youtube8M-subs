00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
bus - I'm not exactly sure how all this

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.990 
bus - I'm not exactly sure how all this
works<00:02:33.239> here<00:02:34.040> as<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.670> doesn't<00:02:35.940> even

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
works here as you can so it doesn't even

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.130 
works here as you can so it doesn't even
have<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:38.090> guess<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.209> connect<00:02:39.480> your<00:02:39.630> power<00:02:39.870> up

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
have I guess you connect your power up

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.490 
have I guess you connect your power up
to<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:41.660> kind<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.780> weird<00:02:42.959> how<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.260> guy

to that but kind of weird how this guy

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.990 
to that but kind of weird how this guy
works<00:02:43.830> I'm<00:02:44.100> not<00:02:44.130> sure<00:02:44.489> if<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.760> even

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
works I'm not sure if this is even

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
really nice radio actually I really like

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.890 
really nice radio actually I really like
it<00:03:29.400> compared<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.819> my<00:03:30.060> spectrum<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.750> x4<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.819> like

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
it compared to my spectrum the x4 I like

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.500 
it compared to my spectrum the x4 I like
how<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.080> feels<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:35.610> my<00:03:35.790> DX<00:03:36.090> for<00:03:36.360> this

how this feels you know my DX for this

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.030 
how this feels you know my DX for this
is<00:03:36.630> not<00:03:36.750> adjustable<00:03:37.170> but<00:03:37.380> on<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:37.830> can

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
is not adjustable but on this one I can

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.000 
is not adjustable but on this one I can
see<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.280> think<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.680> even<00:03:40.680> right<00:03:40.890> from

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
see I think it is and even right from

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.500 
see I think it is and even right from
the<00:03:41.069> start<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.519> feels<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.940> much<00:03:42.090> nicer<00:03:44.510> it

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
the start this feels and much nicer it

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.229 
the start this feels and much nicer it
is<00:03:45.780> powered<00:03:46.470> up<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:50.239> menu

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
is powered up that you can see the menu

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.300 
is powered up that you can see the menu
here<00:03:53.030> get<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> focus<00:03:54.630> here<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.769> lights<00:03:56.099> are

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
here get the focus here the lights are

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.970 
here get the focus here the lights are
kind<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.640> messing<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.180> up

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
kind of messing it up

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.449 
kind of messing it up
there<00:03:58.980> we<00:03:59.040> go

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.160 

I<00:04:06.519> like<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.670> way<00:04:07.790> this<00:04:08.000> feels<00:04:08.659> here

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
I like the way this feels here

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.959 
I like the way this feels here
it's<00:04:09.439> a<00:04:09.620> little<00:04:10.090> joystick<00:04:11.230> thing<00:04:12.879> it<00:04:13.879> was

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:13.969 
it's a little joystick thing it was

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.080 
it's a little joystick thing it was
really<00:04:14.269> nice<00:04:14.920> wait<00:04:15.920> did<00:04:16.130> not<00:04:16.250> like<00:04:16.459> about<00:04:16.489> my

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
really nice wait did not like about my

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.199 
really nice wait did not like about my
DX<00:04:17.720> for<00:04:17.989> ass<00:04:18.169> here<00:04:18.440> if<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:18.620> can<00:04:18.789> you<00:04:19.789> can<00:04:19.940> see<00:04:20.120> it

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
DX for ass here if I can you can see it

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.620 
DX for ass here if I can you can see it
for<00:04:20.359> comparison<00:04:20.989> six<00:04:21.350> here<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:23.090> did<00:04:23.210> not<00:04:23.360> like

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
for comparison six here it did not like

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.390 
for comparison six here it did not like
this<00:04:23.960> thing<00:04:24.199> here<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:26.270> thing<00:04:26.509> is<00:04:26.720> just<00:04:26.930> so

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
this thing here this thing is just so

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.379 
this thing here this thing is just so
sensitive<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.639> would<00:04:28.789> just<00:04:28.880> go<00:04:28.970> up<00:04:29.210> and

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
sensitive that it would just go up and

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.490 
sensitive that it would just go up and
down<00:04:29.570> when<00:04:29.780> you're<00:04:29.960> trying<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.229> get<00:04:30.350> through

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
down when you're trying to get through

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.760 
down when you're trying to get through
the<00:04:30.620> menus<00:04:31.009> there<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.750> much<00:04:32.750> prefer<00:04:33.169> this<00:04:33.350> here

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
the menus there I much prefer this here

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.770 
the menus there I much prefer this here
this<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.639> probably<00:04:34.880> why<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> got<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.660> because

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
this is probably why I got this because

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.760 
this is probably why I got this because
I'm<00:04:36.050> not<00:04:36.229> too<00:04:36.500> happy<00:04:36.710> about<00:04:36.949> this<00:04:37.370> radio<00:04:38.770> this

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
I'm not too happy about this radio this

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.140 
I'm not too happy about this radio this
one's<00:04:39.979> up<00:04:40.130> for<00:04:40.340> sale<00:04:40.520> actually<00:04:40.699> I'm<00:04:40.970> getting

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
one's up for sale actually I'm getting

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.969 
one's up for sale actually I'm getting
rid<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.330> it

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
rid of it

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.089 
rid of it
for<00:04:42.979> comparison's<00:04:43.610> sakes<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:44.120> can<00:04:44.270> see<00:04:45.099> the

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
for comparison's sakes you can see the

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:52.260 
for comparison's sakes you can see the
size<00:04:46.370> difference<00:04:47.740> for<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.830> two<00:04:49.509> this<00:04:50.509> one's<00:04:50.750> a

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
size difference for the two this one's a

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.879 
size difference for the two this one's a
little<00:04:53.270> bit<00:04:53.509> bigger<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.349> it's<00:04:54.500> actually<00:04:54.860> a

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
little bit bigger and it's actually a

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.460 
little bit bigger and it's actually a
little<00:04:55.250> bit<00:04:55.520> heavier<00:04:55.880> as<00:04:56.060> well

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
little bit heavier as well

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.420 
little bit heavier as well
feeling<00:04:58.400> wise<00:04:58.550> I<00:04:58.759> like<00:04:59.210> this<00:04:59.449> one<00:05:00.190> better<00:05:01.190> than

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
feeling wise I like this one better than

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.469 
feeling wise I like this one better than
this<00:05:01.580> one<00:05:02.259> this<00:05:03.259> one<00:05:03.530> just<00:05:03.740> feels<00:05:03.889> too<00:05:04.070> small

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
this one this one just feels too small

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.159 
this one this one just feels too small
even<00:05:05.479> with<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.810> larger<00:05:06.169> grip<00:05:07.659> it's<00:05:08.659> nice<00:05:08.930> and

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
even with the larger grip it's nice and

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.100 
even with the larger grip it's nice and
balanced<00:05:09.620> but<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:10.310> don't<00:05:10.550> know<00:05:10.639> if<00:05:10.760> if<00:05:10.849> just

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
balanced but I don't know if if just

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.810 
balanced but I don't know if if just
this<00:05:12.110> one<00:05:12.320> just<00:05:12.530> feels<00:05:12.680> better<00:05:12.979> don't<00:05:13.760> know

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
this one just feels better don't know

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.790 
this one just feels better don't know
why<00:05:14.030> I<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.990> looking<00:05:18.289> at<00:05:18.409> some<00:05:18.620> of<00:05:18.650> the

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
why I just looking at some of the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.659 
why I just looking at some of the
buttons<00:05:19.039> here

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
buttons here

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.390 
buttons here
I<00:05:20.320> like<00:05:21.320> this<00:05:21.560> switch<00:05:21.919> here<00:05:22.280> so<00:05:23.860> not<00:05:24.860> sure<00:05:25.039> how

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
I like this switch here so not sure how

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.640 
I like this switch here so not sure how
it<00:05:25.580> these<00:05:26.180> are<00:05:26.330> programmed<00:05:26.810> but<00:05:27.050> imagine<00:05:27.530> they

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
it these are programmed but imagine they

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.270 
it these are programmed but imagine they
are<00:05:28.479> only<00:05:29.479> on<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.840> wheel<00:05:30.020> there's<00:05:30.289> only<00:05:30.470> one

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
are only on the wheel there's only one

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.140 
are only on the wheel there's only one
two<00:05:31.970> then<00:05:32.630> on<00:05:32.750> this<00:05:32.930> one<00:05:33.400> compared<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.729> DX

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
two then on this one compared to the DX

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.060 
two then on this one compared to the DX
4<00:05:35.539> you<00:05:35.780> had<00:05:35.990> a<00:05:36.250> 4<00:05:37.250> on<00:05:37.460> there<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:39.740> looks<00:05:39.979> like

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
4 you had a 4 on there it looks like

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.760 
4 you had a 4 on there it looks like
you've<00:05:40.340> got<00:05:40.580> less<00:05:41.270> switches<00:05:41.840> on<00:05:42.020> now<00:05:42.229> this<00:05:42.560> one

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
you've got less switches on now this one

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.290 
you've got less switches on now this one
oh<00:05:43.449> I<00:05:44.449> can<00:05:44.630> see<00:05:44.780> a<00:05:44.810> couple<00:05:45.199> more<00:05:45.229> over<00:05:45.440> here<00:05:46.270> yep

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
oh I can see a couple more over here yep

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.010 
oh I can see a couple more over here yep
these<00:05:47.930> are<00:05:48.050> also<00:05:48.229> three<00:05:48.650> ways<00:05:49.599> and<00:05:50.599> I<00:05:50.780> think

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
these are also three ways and I think

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.719 
these are also three ways and I think
you<00:05:51.110> got<00:05:51.259> this<00:05:51.409> one<00:05:51.620> here<00:05:51.860> also

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.230 

a<00:05:55.620> nice<00:05:56.620> thing<00:05:56.800> about<00:05:56.860> this<00:05:57.189> is<00:05:57.430> I've<00:05:57.669> seen

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
a nice thing about this is I've seen

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.290 
a nice thing about this is I've seen
that<00:05:58.860> you<00:05:59.860> can<00:06:00.099> actually<00:06:00.309> just<00:06:00.669> power<00:06:00.969> on<00:06:01.270> a

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
that you can actually just power on a

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.089 
that you can actually just power on a
display<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:02.729> not<00:06:03.729> power<00:06:04.509> on<00:06:04.779> the<00:06:05.650> whole<00:06:05.830> radio

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
display and not power on the whole radio

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.290 
display and not power on the whole radio
which<00:06:06.339> is<00:06:06.460> a<00:06:06.490> nice<00:06:06.729> to<00:06:07.180> save<00:06:07.620> on<00:06:08.620> batteries<00:06:09.300> one

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
which is a nice to save on batteries one

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.329 
which is a nice to save on batteries one
thing<00:06:10.479> I<00:06:10.569> do<00:06:10.629> like<00:06:10.990> about<00:06:11.050> this<00:06:11.589> one<00:06:11.800> a<00:06:11.830> lot<00:06:12.129> is

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
thing I do like about this one a lot is

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.420 
thing I do like about this one a lot is
the<00:06:12.520> intent<00:06:12.999> no<00:06:13.569> antenna<00:06:13.960> this<00:06:14.860> one<00:06:15.069> just<00:06:15.189> has

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
the intent no antenna this one just has

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.480 
the intent no antenna this one just has
the<00:06:15.639> irregular<00:06:16.080> flip<00:06:17.080> down<00:06:17.289> flip<00:06:17.740> up<00:06:20.490> just

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
the irregular flip down flip up just

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.219 
the irregular flip down flip up just
going<00:06:21.729> on<00:06:21.789> over<00:06:22.029> to<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.270> other<00:06:22.360> side<00:06:22.779> here

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
going on over to the other side here

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:24.600 
going on over to the other side here
there's<00:06:23.620> a<00:06:23.680> couple<00:06:23.919> things<00:06:24.189> here<00:06:24.430> I<00:06:24.460> was

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
there's a couple things here I was

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.760 
there's a couple things here I was
looking<00:06:24.759> at<00:06:25.089> seems<00:06:25.900> like<00:06:25.990> it's<00:06:26.139> got<00:06:26.259> a<00:06:26.289> charge

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
looking at seems like it's got a charge

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.839 
looking at seems like it's got a charge
port<00:06:27.449> right<00:06:28.449> there<00:06:28.479> and<00:06:28.990> also<00:06:29.229> I<00:06:29.740> can<00:06:30.669> get

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.849 
port right there and also I can get

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.969 
port right there and also I can get
close<00:06:31.059> up<00:06:31.300> to<00:06:31.419> it<00:06:31.569> says<00:06:31.779> calm<00:06:32.229> on<00:06:32.469> this<00:06:32.589> one<00:06:32.800> not

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:51.619 
DX 4s you got to remove this and back
there<00:06:46.749> is<00:06:46.779> an<00:06:47.139> SD<00:06:47.439> port<00:06:48.189> to<00:06:48.879> do<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:50.520> updates

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:51.629 
there is an SD port to do the updates

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:55.279 
there is an SD port to do the updates
not<00:06:52.629> sure<00:06:52.930> there's<00:06:53.229> nothing<00:06:53.379> I<00:06:53.800> can<00:06:54.339> see<00:06:54.639> here

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
not sure there's nothing I can see here

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.929 
not sure there's nothing I can see here
so<00:06:56.289> you've<00:06:56.469> probably<00:06:56.680> got<00:06:56.979> to<00:06:57.069> use<00:06:57.219> that<00:06:57.520> there

00:06:59.929 --> 00:06:59.939

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:09.219 
up-close look at everything here I know

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:11.100 
up-close look at everything here I know
when<00:07:09.370> I<00:07:09.399> see<00:07:09.669> these<00:07:09.819> videos<00:07:10.240> I<00:07:10.389> like<00:07:10.599> sitting

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110

out up close like that you can see from

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:18.350 
out up close like that you can see from
every<00:07:13.360> angle<00:07:14.759> turn<00:07:15.759> the<00:07:15.909> screen<00:07:16.870> back<00:07:17.199> on<00:07:17.499> I

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
every angle turn the screen back on I

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.459 
every angle turn the screen back on I
think<00:07:19.360> those<00:07:19.509> videos<00:07:19.779> going<00:07:19.959> on<00:07:20.080> a<00:07:20.110> little<00:07:20.199> too
