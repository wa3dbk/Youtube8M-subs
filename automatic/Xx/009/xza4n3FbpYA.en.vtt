 necessary funding she can not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.559

 leaving the treatment station must 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.460
 be analyzed by the presence of

 billion rupees for this project and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.230
 which were valued at 1.8 billion

 the French donors had 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.079
 expected some 62.5 million euros

 more than 2 billion rupees 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.629
 according to our information the project 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.519
 should have started in 2012 because of the 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.180
 delay in achieving the 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.519

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.489
