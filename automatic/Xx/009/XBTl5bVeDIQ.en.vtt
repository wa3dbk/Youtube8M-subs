00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.990
 what's up youtube and welcome 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.890
 for the first episode of the class guide in 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.660
 black ops 2 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.400
 Tonight has become in his last 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.019
 video for you all desired classes 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.160
 i thought commerce l for his 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.780
 subscribers house, although it is out 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.679
 costs a bit more work and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.360
 that 's why we are here in the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.920
 first episode landed there yes today 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.029
 is about the storm rifles that means 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.650
 I will be my favorite now 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.939
 show three storm rifles and the classes 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 I play that is only when we 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.480
 to deal with the turks you 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.619
 I should recommend to take with me then 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.939
 I just go to every single class 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.230
 a little bit of gameplay material will show you 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.670
 just say yes was important for game 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.769
 and what kind of educator should use 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.239
 soja and in the background already kick 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.000
 the classes I now show 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 want to show and you should directly 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.940
 notice that the same perks 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.440
 I do it in all classes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.910
 always allowing for a weapons class 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 mostly the same classes setups 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.570
 use yes because the storm rifles so of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.800
 of agility and so on 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.489
 he just feels right 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.020
 are similar 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.039
 that's why it just seems the same 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.180
 parks etc use soy to the individual 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.739
 Weapons, I'll get which one 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.300
 gameplay material therefore show that on 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.859
 In addition, how much harm do they use 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.239
 and that's why I'm coming now 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.460
 But first to the parks so to the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.290
 general things yes on the first day 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.880
 you need two parks and needed 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.439
 for once hardliner and bulletproof 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.150
 Vest simply bulletproof vest 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.220
 because I know me as well as the constant 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.750
 eat exploding cars and stuff like that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 Everything died by claims and stuff 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.760
 continue and I just have the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 bullet proof vest just always 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.090
 and there are not any 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.619
 first class it just would not have been that way 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.040
 There are many alternatives , of course 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.360
 still the spirit but then I take 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.340
 not because I just think that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.930
 I have no idea that we are right 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.159
 become little they are mostly gone they 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.299
 now played are holding 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.890
 furman lightning and so on 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.270
 that's why it's always pretty good 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.619
 under the radar is and if you look 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.060
 do not want to make sure then number 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.430
 you just have to contact again 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.470
 take it with you and hardliner on everyone 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.820
 because I offer myself without a controller 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.229
 become a player and you need it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.369
 easy hardliner to immediately drone 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.780
 and the orbit to achieve that as soon as possible 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.369
 you first have the first orbital 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.930
 it's actually flowing on 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.520
 that's why it's very fast on the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.990
 That's why street should come easy 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.619
 the perfect option is that too 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.350
 to reach 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.960
 yes then blind why plunderers completely 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.479
 just because of the c4 and c4 because of me 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.829
 love to play c4 and just loot 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.119
 now we are going to fill up the c 4 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.409
 simply the hottest thing and besides 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.240
 if you look at a weapon anyway 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.920
 it has played much better if you have 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.030
 always ammo ready for it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.289
 so always quickly about these pictures 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.180
 There are no parcels 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.890
 problem 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.150
 How to pack good tricks because you 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.349
 you just have to let it go quickly 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.459
 not all the time that you just 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.689
 try that might equally well to 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.390
 you do not know how often I already do 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.290
 the mcs 16 with ms lifted so that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.250
 bad is what we play at all 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.109
 can be something like that 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.489
 that's why i'm just very good at it 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.510
 In the past I have always played toughness 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.560
 But I need a lot of time 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.900
 actually not that possible except 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.400
 maybe on maps like in a turban 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.689
 or so but I just like that 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.650
 melee and so on for what I do 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.049
 storm rifles also very much 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.180
 just can not recommend it 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.650
 yes then we have agility why 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.560
 not extreme things or tactics mask 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.709
 quite simply I find that extreme and 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.819
 very much for mps and me 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.230
 you need for storm rifles you need 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.730
 easy to target this fast though 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.829
 but no fastest, but I come 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.879
 right to and above all, this climb 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.439
 I need to get over quickly 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.389
 Anyone can climb over it 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.709
 because it's just that I'm like that 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.909
 often that's why we do not put somewhere 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.900
 climb up and so on and it works 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.049
 warned by that really fast 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.780
 that's why it 's recommended as well 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.889
 yes as 25 I have the b23 he 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.959
 one although I have always used with 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.549
 three towers and then pay without b 23 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.629
 years it played that time 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.609
 simply not recommended at all 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.870
 you just have to have a time weapon 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.220
 take along when the first time empty as 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.659
 He could so quickly change to the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.919
 berries pay first so a beast so 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.739
 Of course, many years say players 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.569
 the magazine gets along with coffee 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.099
 too fast the b23 then you do one 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.810
 Good trading day the opponent immediately 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 take and will have no problems 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.109
 more so that somehow 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.489
 will only weapon is empty then as 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.959
 said my favorite committee and 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.530
 all call of duty together just that 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.239
 c4 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.650
 because it is just that this thing 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.819
 so much harm does so quickly to the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.079
 you can just like the example 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.579
 If you know, or have 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.959
 long you just lay in too many 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.699
 his way and eliminated it 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.769
 That's why I always have to 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.180
 as I said in the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.209
 Combination with raiders is just like that 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.259
 Effectively this must be easy with so now 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.939
 comes a bit to the gameplay and 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:55.699
 show yourself as I do the individual 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.620
 Weapons play directly with the beast since 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.590
 the patch with the best weapon since 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.729
 new patch and indeed with the skate must 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.720
 I'll say that in the gameplay 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.129
 background unfortunately still fast 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.569
 pull played but you do not need one 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.680
 he quickly shivers he just does not need 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.689
 I found out a lot now 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.919
 that you just can not aim fast 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.479
 this just happens can be found if you 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.470
 somehow this time in a suit you can 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.519
 It will be a little bit perfect 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.079
 to correct amy 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.909
 so the weapon just plays along 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.709
 extended max and creates creates people 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:20.180
 is the hottest equipment have everything 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.440
 what kind of team do I always say 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.420
 so 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.820
 oh no, it does not do so well 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.890
 and people you have to do game like 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.060
 you can walk in scope around the corner 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.340
 the opponents can not do anything to us since 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.600
 Immediately with the shank because then 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.860
 Honestly, how often did you die? 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.760
 you should block somehow 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.290
 not so good in confined spaces 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.640
 then maneuver right away on the 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.630
 The ground says team has 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.340
 it just does not need anymore 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.660
 I know the enemy busy 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.070
 creates the type that still lies 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.180
 somehow you can just take it away no 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.470
 therefore, the easy it creates 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.450
 hottest thing there is 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.160
 so look because of the damage of the 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.660
 sketch and the skate has the 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.210
 highest damage of the storm rifles 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.550
 does the damage after patch 45 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.370
 melee only needs three bullets and in 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.620
 the distance 33 states a maximum of four 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.460
 balls if she needs three balls 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.470
 then it was a bit 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.390
 but people ask that is very often like that 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.460
 and three balls across the map all that 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.960
 is such a blatant rattle so the skate 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.100
 team you just have to gamble my 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.930
 first recommendation for the storm rifles 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.920
 The second tip is more or less 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.850
 an open secret namely in 94 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.830
 his heart's last assault rifle was what 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.600
 can unlock and threw it 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.560
 just become really blatant 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.640
 I found the whole in the beginning 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.890
 assault rifles are not that great but the 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.240
 once really crass 110 im 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.169
 background where I packed the nuclear 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.610
 have the animal is still with 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.440
 fast access but people grabs the 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.030
 Just go away and do it 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.370
 even the extremely extreme is just like that 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.480
 a cool thing makes 40 24 a pity 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.830
 means in close combat you also need three 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.440
 You only need balls on distance 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.760
 Of course, four to five is completely him 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.290
 not so little but I guess 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.280
 Just make it so precise when you 're on it 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.110
 then you have the opponents with it 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.340
 just go away and have no chance 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.900
 So I play in any case without 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.190
 red dot how many say yes plays 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.260
 the metropolis that it is awesome but 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.430
 you need to play him with red 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.230
 because with the ice just like that 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.340
 crass precise that also attracts one 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.690
 small fashion is high with it 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.000
 the rule just so well distributed 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.740
 as said creates and external max here 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.669
 to recommend 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.490
 Lastly, you probably have it 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.870
 already seen the m8 1 at the beginning 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.000
 was he once made to be the best 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.250
 election for black ops 2 touted by the 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.500
 community manager of treyarch david of 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.669
 soja said the m8 1 for the best 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.830
 watch weapon play because the 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.330
 weapon so shit find you because you have 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.200
 forward on it not at all 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.490
 just did not die 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.460
 what 's wrong with these just not 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.169
 fallen down work since recently is the 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.340
 actually become quite effective so 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.990
 plays in any case red dot because at 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.300
 burst throw it already at the pharmacy 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.010
 mw2 so on exchanges needs in red and 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.090
 because you just have to live with it 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.700
 if you go that far side 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.950
 mostly one 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.750
 first of all that makes it so harm 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.460
 In close combat, a burst is enough 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.380
 Removal took two bourse so that 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.610
 it's just a good thing if that 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.900
 opponent has a lot going on so far 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.460
 Of course, it will be difficult for you 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.500
 to knock twice but if you have one 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.970
 I believe it was over the 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.160
 chest last page is so synonymous 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.570
 remove and the opponent yes people 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.950
 this is definitely a very good one 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.430
 weapon has also been created with 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.560
 every case 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.940
 and at the 88 somebody you have to 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.430
 easy to use, easy to use 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.200
 simply because in black ops 2 it is 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.880
 so that you are scared and pulling so fast 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.590
 fast like mp3 with fast draw 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.270
 and mp3 without joking I'm not clear 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.100
 So I think people take on everyone 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.370
 case the m8 threatened her and gets away with it 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.660
 one all in order so yes i hope 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.070
 the video you liked the class 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.480
 I no longer wanted 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.950
 sat down and made him 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.930
 forget we will have been right 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.160
 a lot of work put in so then 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.020
 see what the next video skin again 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.300
 pure and therefore thank you for 6000 subscribers 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.430
