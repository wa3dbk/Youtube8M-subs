00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.289
 dear friends, hello 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.800
 center press today how to eliminate noise 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.199
 microplane, let's get started 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:33.559
 click on the icon on the taskbar 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:36.920
 such a speaker and click further on 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.920
 inscription sounds 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.399
 play show us no here 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.000
 they need to go further on the tab 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:57.170
 the entry here is actually my 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.170
 microphone and click on it twice and 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.250
 click to listen to that is and further 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.409
 put a tick to listen to this 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.189
 the device is now I will have sound 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.530
 go through the speakers i will hear how 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.580
 my microphone is now recording started 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.640
 listen to me angry at the question and 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:34.200
 limit and now hear me through 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:40.740
 speaker now heard so on 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:45.060
 go to the tab level here everything is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.320
 default will stand like this he and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.740
 now that is, he is better when I stand 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.420
 50 just when the nozzle is very 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.770
 high recording levels and it turns out very 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.000
 strong shock on the record 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.240
 so i will call 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:17.050
 and then we go 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:21.040
 decibel and here I have the most maximum 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.370
 worth 20 decibels on windows 8 for so much 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.870
 as far as I know there is worth it myself 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.650
 maximum 30 decibels 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.459
 for me the most optimal is 20 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.010
 decibel just when doing on 30 of 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.520
 bow windows 8 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.040
 there is a very strong record but 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.560
 it's very much in the background 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.209
 in the background everything is very noisy 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.709
 background 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.510
 so go on to the cemetery 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:57.630
 No improvement in silence 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.370
 will all stand like this away from here 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.940
 tab has stopped 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.610
 here now should 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.310
 so here you have to demonstrate 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.860
 on 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:17.730
 by default now listen here 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.730
 now 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:38.480
 he has nothing like that now 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:41.840
 jump and continue further 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.840
 haven form 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.180
 go to the playback tab here 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.209
 we see the dynamics 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.180
 I have one more connected here 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.669
 I have a receiver but they are now 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.299
 disabled and so go on the tab 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:06.030
 speakers and then click on the tab 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:09.049
 microphone level you have this tab 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.680
 need you by default will be like this 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:16.019
 it is necessary that she stood on zero not 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.250
 fear anything from the microphone will 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.759
 work the same as mine now 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.159
 just again there will be less fonit or 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:29.759
 in the background u will have a strong echo and 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:32.780
 Again, recording from the microphone can 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.780
 thin and 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:43.440
 crotch korea need to put everything like this 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:52.560

 hand here now all is well nothing to 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:07.430
 in the background 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:09.840
