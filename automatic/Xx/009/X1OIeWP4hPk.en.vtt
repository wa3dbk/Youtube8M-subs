00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
well guys CES is quickly approaching and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.510 
well guys CES is quickly approaching and
I<00:00:19.199> don't<00:00:19.410> want<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.680> repeat<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.160> happened

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.070 
I don't want to repeat what happened
last<00:00:20.699> year<00:00:20.970> where<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> had<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.510> all<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> my

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
last year where I had to do all of my

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.130 
last year where I had to do all of my
rendering<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.340> laptop<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.390> even<00:00:25.019> though

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
rendering on a laptop and even though

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.920 
rendering on a laptop and even though
it's<00:00:25.289> an<00:00:25.380> i7<00:00:25.800> laptop<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.550> was<00:00:26.730> definitely<00:00:27.570> not

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it's an i7 laptop it was definitely not

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.230 
it's an i7 laptop it was definitely not
an<00:00:28.170> ideal<00:00:28.410> situation<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:29.369> doing<00:00:29.730> my<00:00:29.880> mobile

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
an ideal situation for doing my mobile

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.410 
an ideal situation for doing my mobile
rendering<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.980> said<00:00:32.309> I'm<00:00:33.059> gonna<00:00:33.239> be

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
rendering so with that said I'm gonna be

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.620 
rendering so with that said I'm gonna be
building<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.870> ITX<00:00:34.469> system<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.239> before<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.450> get

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
building an ITX system and before we get

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.299 
building an ITX system and before we get
to<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> build<00:00:37.110> video<00:00:37.440> which<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> be

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
cooling option this is going to be

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
cooling option this is going to be
cooling<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.210> ITX<00:00:51.809> build<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.350> most<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
cooling my ITX build here and most of

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.600 
cooling my ITX build here and most of
these<00:00:52.739> parts<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> guys<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.370> already<00:00:53.489> seen

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
these parts you guys have already seen

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
these parts you guys have already seen
in<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.180> reviews<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.710> going

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
in other reviews and it's gonna be going

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.209 
in other reviews and it's gonna be going
in<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.520> node<00:00:56.969> 304<00:00:57.899> case<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
in this node 304 case right here so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.799 
in this node 304 case right here so
without<00:00:59.760> further<00:00:59.969> ado<00:01:00.270> let's<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.570> ahead<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
without further ado let's go ahead and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
without further ado let's go ahead and
open<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.140> thing<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:02.010> our<00:01:02.190> unboxing

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
open this thing up and get our unboxing

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.090 
open this thing up and get our unboxing
and<00:01:02.910> first<00:01:03.030> opinion<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> 140<00:01:04.710> XL

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and first opinion here on the 140 XL

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.609 
and first opinion here on the 140 XL
it's<00:01:05.309> pretty<00:01:05.610> obvious<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> 140<00:01:07.080> XL<00:01:07.470> is

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it's pretty obvious that a 140 XL is

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.370 
it's pretty obvious that a 140 XL is
gonna<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.270> 140<00:01:09.270> millimeter<00:01:09.659> radiator<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
gonna be a 140 millimeter radiator and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.740 
gonna be a 140 millimeter radiator and
because<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> XL<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.850> means<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.240> extra

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
because it's the XL it means it's extra

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.780 
because it's the XL it means it's extra
thick<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.530> maximum<00:01:14.070> cooling<00:01:14.340> area

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
thick so we get maximum cooling area

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.850 
thick so we get maximum cooling area
which<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.210> advertise<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.320> times<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
which they advertise here two times the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.039 
which they advertise here two times the
cooling<00:01:17.159> area<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.240> maintenance<00:01:18.600> free<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
cooling area it is maintenance free you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.719 
cooling area it is maintenance free you
don't<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> fill<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> drain<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> or<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.580> any

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
don't have to fill it drain it or do any

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.460 
don't have to fill it drain it or do any
sort<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> maintenance<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.259> does

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
sort of maintenance to it and it does

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.550 
sort of maintenance to it and it does
have<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.009> durable<00:01:23.820> fep<00:01:24.630> tubing<00:01:25.200> which<00:01:25.350> means

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
have a durable fep tubing which means

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.980 
have a durable fep tubing which means
you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.100> bend<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.420> tight<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.840> make

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you can to bend it really tight and make

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.780 
you can to bend it really tight and make
all<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> bends<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.530> need<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:28.860> system<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
all the bends you need in your system to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.749 
all the bends you need in your system to
get<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.180> nice<00:01:30.979> installation<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.310> any<00:01:32.460> case

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
get a nice installation here in any case

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
get a nice installation here in any case
that<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.030> may<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.210> using<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.170> have

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that you may be using it in and not have

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.050 
that you may be using it in and not have
to<00:01:34.439> worry<00:01:34.619> about<00:01:34.740> those<00:01:35.009> tight<00:01:35.280> bends<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to worry about those tight bends the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.899 
to worry about those tight bends the
tubing<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> nice<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.170> durable<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.770> pump<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
tubing is nice and durable the pump and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.090 
tubing is nice and durable the pump and
the<00:01:39.210> water<00:01:39.240> block<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.259> unit<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.650> are

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the water block are all one unit as are

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.859 
the water block are all one unit as are
most<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> water<00:01:42.329> cooling<00:01:42.630> options

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
most all of the water cooling options

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
most all of the water cooling options
but<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
but you can see right here that is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960 
but you can see right here that is

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.649 
degrees Celsius which is only two
degrees<00:01:55.229> higher<00:01:55.530> than<00:01:55.829> their<00:01:55.979> 280<00:01:56.430> L<00:01:56.700> which<00:01:57.420> is

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
degrees higher than their 280 L which is

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
degrees higher than their 280 L which is
the<00:01:57.840> standard<00:01:58.290> thickness<00:01:58.469> double<00:01:59.130> 140

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the standard thickness double 140

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760 
the standard thickness double 140
millimeter<00:02:00.240> radio<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.170> they<00:02:01.290> found<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.590> way<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
millimeter radio so they found a way to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950 
millimeter radio so they found a way to
get<00:02:01.950> maximum<00:02:02.460> cooling<00:02:02.640> area<00:02:03.090> crammed<00:02:03.540> into<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
get maximum cooling area crammed into a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.039 
get maximum cooling area crammed into a
small<00:02:04.430> radiator<00:02:05.430> by<00:02:05.930> increasing<00:02:06.930> its

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
small radiator by increasing its

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.050 
small radiator by increasing its
thickness<00:02:07.290> giving<00:02:07.770> us<00:02:07.890> ultimately<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.849> same

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
thickness giving us ultimately the same

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.029 
thickness giving us ultimately the same
amount<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.660> surface<00:02:10.170> area<00:02:10.349> which<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.709> really

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
amount of surface area which is really

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.650 
amount of surface area which is really
what<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.310> all<00:02:11.430> about<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:12.120> doesn't<00:02:12.360> matter<00:02:12.510> if

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
what it's all about it doesn't matter if

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.220 
what it's all about it doesn't matter if
it's<00:02:12.780> long<00:02:12.989> and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
it's long and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.140 
it's long and
skinny<00:02:13.500> or<00:02:13.769> short<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.190> thick<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.790> all<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
skinny or short and thick and all of a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.430 
skinny or short and thick and all of a
sudden<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.480> conversation<00:02:16.110> started

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
sudden this conversation started

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.050 
sudden this conversation started
sounding<00:02:16.620> like<00:02:16.950> something<00:02:17.310> way<00:02:17.640> different

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
sounding like something way different

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.850 
sounding like something way different
than<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.269> really<00:02:18.569> intended<00:02:18.989> but<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.590> long<00:02:19.739> as

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
than I really intended but as long as

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.960 
than I really intended but as long as
you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.280> same<00:02:20.430> amount<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.790> surface

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you can get the same amount of surface

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.600 
you can get the same amount of surface
area<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:21.569> cooling<00:02:21.959> will<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.260> fairly<00:02:23.099> similar

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
area that cooling will be fairly similar

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.750 
area that cooling will be fairly similar
to<00:02:23.790> something<00:02:24.360> that's<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.780> longer<00:02:25.549> here<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:26.670> go

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
to something that's a longer here we go

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.970 
to something that's a longer here we go
again<00:02:26.909> but<00:02:27.629> giving<00:02:27.900> us<00:02:27.989> more<00:02:28.170> surface<00:02:28.830> area

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
again but giving us more surface area

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.600 
again but giving us more surface area
does<00:02:29.400> give<00:02:29.640> us<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.910> lot<00:02:30.120> better<00:02:30.360> cooling<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:31.680> it

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
does give us a lot better cooling now it

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.430 
does give us a lot better cooling now it
is<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> pure<00:02:33.330> copper<00:02:33.660> water<00:02:33.840> block<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.349> a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
is a pure copper water block it's a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.199 
is a pure copper water block it's a

what<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.079> says<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.409> let's<00:02:43.860> go<00:02:43.950> ahead<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.159> open

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
what it says so let's go ahead and open

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.970 
what it says so let's go ahead and open
this<00:02:44.579> thing<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.090> see<00:02:45.629> exactly<00:02:46.019> what<00:02:46.230> comes

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
this thing up and see exactly what comes

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.970 
this thing up and see exactly what comes
in<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.940> box

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
in the box

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.199 
in the box
all<00:02:49.980> right<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.280> opening<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.640> bad<00:02:50.849> boy<00:02:51.030> up

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
all right so opening this bad boy up

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.550 
all right so opening this bad boy up
we're<00:02:51.420> immediately<00:02:51.870> met<00:02:52.109> with<00:02:52.319> some

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
we're immediately met with some

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.319 
we're immediately met with some
high-tech<00:02:53.099> foam<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:54.569> bite<00:02:55.109> out<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.410> and

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
high-tech foam to bite out of that and

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.180 
high-tech foam to bite out of that and
you<00:02:57.329> do<00:02:57.540> get<00:02:57.780> some<00:02:58.019> pretty<00:02:58.230> thick<00:02:58.620> tubing<00:02:59.069> on

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
you do get some pretty thick tubing on

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.559 
you do get some pretty thick tubing on
here<00:02:59.430> which<00:02:59.579> I'm<00:02:59.760> actually<00:02:59.940> pretty<00:03:00.269> proud<00:03:00.510> of

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
have the same rubber mounts on there but

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.650 
have the same rubber mounts on there but
overall<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.489> concept<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.209> same<00:03:30.239> as<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
jet flow speed wise I'm not sure what

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.940 
jet flow speed wise I'm not sure what

aluminum radiator a lot like the Neptune

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.930 
aluminum radiator a lot like the Neptune
series<00:04:07.560> but<00:04:08.069> look<00:04:08.190> at<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.340> thickness<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.790> this

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
series but look at the thickness of this

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.849 
series but look at the thickness of this
guy<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.329> pretty<00:04:09.569> thick<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.319> it's<00:04:10.500> giving<00:04:10.769> you

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
guy it's pretty thick so it's giving you

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.860 
guy it's pretty thick so it's giving you
a<00:04:10.919> pretty<00:04:11.250> good<00:04:11.459> amount<00:04:11.639> of<00:04:11.760> surface<00:04:11.910> area<00:04:12.239> as

with our little sticky tape on there
protecting<00:04:25.409> the<00:04:25.680> block<00:04:25.979> and<00:04:26.310> there's<00:04:26.580> a

protecting the block and there's a

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.190 
protecting the block and there's a

little bit of a rough finish on there
but<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.440> don't<00:04:28.590> think<00:04:29.070> that's<00:04:29.280> really<00:04:29.490> gonna

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
but I don't think that's really gonna

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.670 
but I don't think that's really gonna
affect<00:04:29.700> performance<00:04:30.030> too<00:04:30.540> much<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:31.590> if

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
affect performance too much but if

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.710 
affect performance too much but if
you're<00:04:31.860> into<00:04:32.490> lapping<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.150> polishing<00:04:33.600> you

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
you're into lapping and polishing you

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.700 
you're into lapping and polishing you
might<00:04:33.870> want<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.080> give<00:04:34.200> that<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.350> little<00:04:34.470> bit<00:04:34.620> of

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
might want to give that a little bit of

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.560 
might want to give that a little bit of
a<00:04:34.740> lap<00:04:34.890> in<00:04:35.040> Polish<00:04:35.370> we<00:04:36.090> got<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.360> same

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
a lap in Polish we got the same

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.050 
a lap in Polish we got the same
rotatable<00:04:37.200> fittings<00:04:37.620> as<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:38.070> find<00:04:38.340> on<00:04:38.670> the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
rotatable fittings as you find on the

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.630 
rotatable fittings as you find on the
other<00:04:39.410> water<00:04:40.410> cooling<00:04:40.710> options<00:04:40.860> here<00:04:41.310> from

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
other water cooling options here from

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.090 
other water cooling options here from
Coolermaster<00:04:42.360> but<00:04:43.350> what's<00:04:43.500> interesting<00:04:43.680> is

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
Coolermaster but what's interesting is

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.320 
Coolermaster but what's interesting is
that<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.400> do<00:04:44.640> have<00:04:44.910> both<00:04:45.210> 140<00:04:46.170> millimeter<00:04:46.590> and

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
that you do have both 140 millimeter and

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.120 
that you do have both 140 millimeter and
120<00:04:48.330> millimeter<00:04:48.870> mounting<00:04:49.350> options<00:04:49.710> here<00:04:49.950> on

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
120 millimeter mounting options here on

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.920 
120 millimeter mounting options here on
this<00:04:50.340> radiator<00:04:50.850> so<00:04:51.330> if<00:04:51.420> you<00:04:51.510> happen<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.810> have

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
this radiator so if you happen to have

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.900 
this radiator so if you happen to have
120<00:04:52.650> millimeter<00:04:53.040> fans<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.610> like<00:04:53.790> to

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
120 millimeter fans that you like to

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.370 
120 millimeter fans that you like to
prefer<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.420> could<00:04:54.600> mount<00:04:54.780> those<00:04:54.990> on<00:04:55.170> there

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
prefer you could mount those on there

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.190 
prefer you could mount those on there
whether<00:04:55.650> they<00:04:55.860> be<00:04:55.980> jet<00:04:56.220> flow<00:04:56.490> or<00:04:56.960> Corsair<00:04:57.960> or

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
whether they be jet flow or Corsair or

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.320 
whether they be jet flow or Corsair or
whatever<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.100> they<00:04:59.430> are<00:04:59.670> going<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.000> accept

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
whatever so they are going to accept

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.510 
whatever so they are going to accept
your<00:05:00.720> radiators<00:05:01.350> what<00:05:01.920> I<00:05:01.950> like<00:05:02.220> is<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.400> the

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
your radiators what I like is that the

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.190 
your radiators what I like is that the
screw<00:05:02.850> holes<00:05:03.060> are<00:05:03.240> aligned<00:05:03.540> with<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.930> fins

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
screw holes are aligned with the fins

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.440 
screw holes are aligned with the fins
and<00:05:04.470> not<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.860> cooling<00:05:05.250> channels<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:06.210> if<00:05:06.330> you

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
and not the cooling channels so if you

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.480 
and not the cooling channels so if you
do<00:05:06.660> happen<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.080> screw<00:05:07.410> down<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.800> there<00:05:07.920> too<00:05:08.130> far

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
do happen to screw down in there too far

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.790 
do happen to screw down in there too far
you're<00:05:09.030> not<00:05:09.210> gonna<00:05:09.390> deem<00:05:10.050> your<00:05:10.260> radiator<00:05:10.710> a

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
you're not gonna deem your radiator a

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.590 
you're not gonna deem your radiator a
paperweight<00:05:11.340> by<00:05:11.580> puncturing<00:05:12.210> one<00:05:12.420> of<00:05:12.510> those

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
paperweight by puncturing one of those

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.150 
paperweight by puncturing one of those
channels<00:05:12.900> you'll<00:05:13.230> just<00:05:13.410> simply<00:05:13.710> crush<00:05:13.950> some

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
channels you'll just simply crush some

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.890 
channels you'll just simply crush some
of<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.310> fins<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:15.480> have<00:05:15.570> more<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.780> an

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
of the fins and you have more of an

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.270 
of the fins and you have more of an
aesthetic<00:05:16.140> problem<00:05:16.680> than<00:05:16.830> dealing<00:05:17.010> with<00:05:17.130> the

performance problem making it completely
broken<00:05:21.390> at<00:05:21.630> that<00:05:21.780> point<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:22.650> there's<00:05:22.770> nothing

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
broken at that point so there's nothing

else<00:05:23.100> in<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.400> box<00:05:23.700> there<00:05:24.150> I<00:05:24.390> was<00:05:25.200> hoping<00:05:25.560> to

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
else in the box there I was hoping to

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.200 
else in the box there I was hoping to
see<00:05:25.980> ah<00:05:26.160> yes<00:05:26.520> here<00:05:26.820> it<00:05:26.880> is

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
see ah yes here it is

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.050 
see ah yes here it is
I<00:05:27.240> was<00:05:27.630> hoping<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.900> see<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.170> PWM<00:05:29.070> splitter<00:05:29.610> which

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
I was hoping to see a PWM splitter which

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.410 
I was hoping to see a PWM splitter which
we<00:05:30.300> do<00:05:30.570> have<00:05:30.600> right<00:05:31.410> here<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:31.920> comes<00:05:32.420> inside

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
we do have right here that comes inside

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.140 
we do have right here that comes inside
the<00:05:33.810> package<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:34.770> can<00:05:34.980> split<00:05:35.310> off<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.610> PWM

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
the package so you can split off the PWM

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.060 
the package so you can split off the PWM
signal<00:05:36.360> to<00:05:36.630> both<00:05:36.780> your<00:05:36.960> fans<00:05:37.260> if<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.710> happen

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
signal to both your fans if you happen

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.480 
signal to both your fans if you happen
to<00:05:38.100> only<00:05:38.430> have<00:05:38.760> one<00:05:39.000> PWM<00:05:39.960> header<00:05:40.370> available<00:05:41.370> to

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
to only have one PWM header available to

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.480 
to only have one PWM header available to
you<00:05:41.580> your<00:05:42.030> fan<00:05:42.390> or<00:05:42.660> if<00:05:42.810> you<00:05:42.930> have<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.080> PWM<00:05:44.070> CPU

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
you your fan or if you have a PWM CPU

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.700 
you your fan or if you have a PWM CPU
and<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.670> CPU<00:05:45.030> optional<00:05:45.480> you<00:05:45.660> can<00:05:45.840> run<00:05:46.110> all<00:05:46.320> three

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
and a CPU optional you can run all three

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.800 
and a CPU optional you can run all three
the<00:05:46.950> pump<00:05:47.190> in<00:05:47.340> both<00:05:47.490> fans<00:05:47.760> off<00:05:48.030> of<00:05:48.240> two<00:05:48.450> headers

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
the pump in both fans off of two headers

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.950 
the pump in both fans off of two headers
I<00:05:49.080> do<00:05:49.530> wish<00:05:49.890> that<00:05:49.920> the<00:05:50.220> sleeving

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
I do wish that the sleeving

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.960 
I do wish that the sleeving
went<00:05:51.960> all<00:05:52.140> the<00:05:52.200> way<00:05:52.410> down<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.950> these<00:05:53.100> two<00:05:53.130> but

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
went all the way down to these two but

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.020 
went all the way down to these two but
again<00:05:54.750> what<00:05:55.350> are<00:05:55.410> you<00:05:55.470> gonna<00:05:55.560> do<00:05:55.770> so<00:05:56.520> there<00:05:56.910> is

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
again what are you gonna do so there is

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.910 
again what are you gonna do so there is
