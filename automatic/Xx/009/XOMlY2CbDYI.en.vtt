so<00:00:00.539> you've<00:00:01.439> decided<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.159> go<00:00:02.340> mechanical<00:00:03.120> wise

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
so you've decided to go mechanical wise

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.280 
so you've decided to go mechanical wise
choice<00:00:04.609> but<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.759> brings<00:00:05.910> up<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.509> new<00:00:06.720> question

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
choice but that brings up a new question

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.970 
choice but that brings up a new question
as<00:00:07.820> what<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.420> best<00:00:09.690> mechanical<00:00:10.469> option

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
as what is the best mechanical option

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.220 
as what is the best mechanical option
well<00:00:11.490> I've<00:00:11.849> been<00:00:12.090> looking<00:00:12.480> into<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.900> for<00:00:12.960> a

long time because I was looking to buy
one<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.630> these<00:00:15.719> fancy<00:00:15.990> mechanical<00:00:16.830> typing

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
one of these fancy mechanical typing

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.820 
one of these fancy mechanical typing
machines<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.210> there<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.720> definitely<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.529> lot

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
machines and there is definitely a lot

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
machines and there is definitely a lot
of<00:00:20.039> fantastic<00:00:20.850> options<00:00:21.359> when<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.109> looking

at<00:00:22.590> these<00:00:22.710> buttes<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.250> technology

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
at these buttes of technology

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.019 
at these buttes of technology
I<00:00:24.150> had<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.779> checklist<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.590> my<00:00:25.650> mind<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.490> had<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
I had a checklist in my mind it had to

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.929 
I had a checklist in my mind it had to
look<00:00:27.269> good<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.930> had<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.470> built<00:00:28.769> well<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.429> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
look good it had to be built well and it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.600 
look good it had to be built well and it
had<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.330> get<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> job<00:00:30.990> done<00:00:31.610> fantastically

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
had to get the job done fantastically

this<00:00:35.370> field<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.390> checklist<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.140> mind

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
this field with that checklist in mind

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.740 
this field with that checklist in mind
after<00:00:37.829> lots<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.280> looking<00:00:38.700> these<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> two

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
after lots of looking these are the two

00:00:39.750 --> 00:01:31.510 
after lots of looking these are the two
best<00:00:40.079> options<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.770> found

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:03:40.920 

you

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.450 

the<00:03:41.930> last<00:03:42.260> thing<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:42.860> have<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.040> think

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
the last thing that you have to think

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.270 
the last thing that you have to think
about<00:03:43.580> is<00:03:44.030> what<00:03:44.480> type<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:45.010> mechanical<00:03:46.010> key

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
about is what type of mechanical key

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.640 
about is what type of mechanical key
switches<00:03:46.610> do<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:47.240> want<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.600> buy<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.230> options

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
switches do you want to buy the options

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.460 
switches do you want to buy the options
you<00:03:48.800> have<00:03:49.010> go<00:03:49.370> as<00:03:49.520> following<00:03:50.030> blue<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.290> brown

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
you have go as following blue the brown

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.580 
you have go as following blue the brown
red<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.220> black<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:53.270> blue<00:03:53.690> key<00:03:53.960> switches<00:03:54.260> are

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
red and black the blue key switches are

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.290 
red and black the blue key switches are
the<00:03:54.680> keys<00:03:54.920> that<00:03:55.130> I<00:03:55.250> like<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.580> best<00:03:55.820> because

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
the keys that I like the best because

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.110 
the keys that I like the best because
they<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.960> a<00:03:56.990> tactile<00:03:57.830> feedback<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.670> they

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
they have a tactile feedback and they

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.060 
they have a tactile feedback and they
make<00:03:59.330> an<00:03:59.540> audible<00:03:59.960> clicking<00:04:00.470> sound<00:04:00.770> when<00:04:00.980> you

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
make an audible clicking sound when you

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.040 
make an audible clicking sound when you
push<00:04:01.280> them<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.790> brown<00:04:02.090> switch<00:04:02.540> it's<00:04:02.810> much

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
push them the brown switch it's much

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.230 
push them the brown switch it's much
like<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.380> blue<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.860> has<00:04:04.070> tactile<00:04:04.850> feedback

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
like the blue it has tactile feedback

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.720 
like the blue it has tactile feedback
but<00:04:06.050> it<00:04:06.230> does<00:04:06.350> not<00:04:06.500> make<00:04:06.770> that<00:04:06.950> audible<00:04:07.460> click

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
but it does not make that audible click

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.490 
but it does not make that audible click
sound<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.570> if<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.720> want<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.020> to<00:04:09.140> be<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.260> little

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
sound so if you want it to be a little

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.020 
sound so if you want it to be a little
bit<00:04:09.710> on<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.860> quiet<00:04:10.160> side<00:04:10.280> but<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:10.820> want

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
bit on the quiet side but you want

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.510 
bit on the quiet side but you want
tactile<00:04:11.510> feedback<00:04:11.870> Brown<00:04:12.800> switches<00:04:13.340> are<00:04:13.460> the

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
tactile feedback Brown switches are the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.400 
tactile feedback Brown switches are the
ones<00:04:13.700> for<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.450> red<00:04:14.810> switch<00:04:15.110> is

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
ones for you the red switch is

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.920 
ones for you the red switch is
supposedly<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.430> best<00:04:16.670> for<00:04:17.000> gaming<00:04:17.030> because

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
supposedly the best for gaming because

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.039 
supposedly the best for gaming because
it<00:04:18.410> does<00:04:18.620> not<00:04:18.830> have<00:04:19.130> any<00:04:19.459> tactile<00:04:20.090> feedback<00:04:20.450> it

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
it does not have any tactile feedback it

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.170 
it does not have any tactile feedback it
does<00:04:21.230> not<00:04:21.410> make<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.830> clicking<00:04:22.310> sound<00:04:22.340> but<00:04:23.030> the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
does not make a clicking sound but the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.360 
does not make a clicking sound but the
advantage<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.960> those<00:04:24.170> types<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.740> switches<00:04:24.980> is

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
advantage of those types of switches is

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.460 
advantage of those types of switches is
you're<00:04:25.970> supposed<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.360> be<00:04:26.510> able<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.840> push<00:04:27.260> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
you're supposed to be able to push the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.800 
you're supposed to be able to push the
keys<00:04:27.710> extremely<00:04:28.370> fast<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.000> if<00:04:29.390> you<00:04:29.480> have<00:04:29.630> to

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
keys extremely fast so if you have to

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.840 
keys extremely fast so if you have to
double<00:04:30.170> click<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.350> key<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:31.190> red<00:04:31.430> one<00:04:31.670> is

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
double click a key the red one is

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.580 
double click a key the red one is
supposed<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.300> be<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.600> most<00:04:32.780> efficient<00:04:33.350> and

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
supposed to be the most efficient and

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.100 
supposed to be the most efficient and
lastly<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.370> blacks<00:04:34.700> which<00:04:35.030> has<00:04:35.330> no<00:04:35.630> tactile

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
lastly the blacks which has no tactile

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.100 
lastly the blacks which has no tactile
feedback<00:04:36.500> no<00:04:37.340> clicky<00:04:37.820> sound<00:04:37.850> it's<00:04:38.570> a<00:04:38.720> lot<00:04:38.900> like

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
feedback no clicky sound it's a lot like

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.230 
feedback no clicky sound it's a lot like
the<00:04:39.140> red<00:04:39.650> switch<00:04:39.950> but<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.340> does<00:04:40.610> have<00:04:40.880> some

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
the red switch but it does have some

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.330 
the red switch but it does have some
resistance<00:04:41.810> when<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.110> push<00:04:42.350> down<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.740> key<00:04:42.980> so

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
resistance when you push down the key so

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.550 
resistance when you push down the key so
if<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.670> have<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:43.970> heavy<00:04:44.450> hand<00:04:44.870> when<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.290> type

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
if you have a heavy hand when you type

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.590
