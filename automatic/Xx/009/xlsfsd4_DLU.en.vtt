00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hello everyone, I'm sure of pride nerd 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:11.759
 and today we will see the batman trailer 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.380
 towards superman dawn of of asti then I have 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.240
 made a goal acrobats I succeeded 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.210
 still not see it clearly unless 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.220
 a few frames because now on facebook 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.240
 they arrive in frames we can't do 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.680
 anything 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.680
 then the bands never grow 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.429
 put comics 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.360
 Tide 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.070
 inattentive 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.440
 the day of truth 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.510
 the legal aliens who come to steal us 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.309
 work rightly and costume does not suit me 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.420
 still like too shiny and dark 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.970
 when superman is the light for 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.990
 well affleck definition and a rich the 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.580
 time 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.580
 it seems to me more 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.430
 convinced me to know how cruz way 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.040
 this too little assuming instead there 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.030
 many clear photographs came to me 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.140
 reminiscent of the animated series 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.140
 you probably need to see the movie 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.360
 there will be joker 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.260
 at least in a flashback that is breeding 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260
 pulling the tires 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.579
 one of the best suite boats that 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.579
 it is used in the cold 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.360
 who is not a customer through 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.050
 not even the style as she likes it 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:04.160
 merit yes no 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:06.490
 list of duty to give me a hundred lire as well 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.490
 5 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.420
 a rhino in the house of lex luthor that 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.570
 let's remember he has the good of the thing in 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.570
 head 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.480
 there is a rhino 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.820
 and only ever 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.820
 Pierotti 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.819
 no one on friendship 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.070
 in the piece that of parma that lights 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.040
 obviously they will die again 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.920
 parent of a moment 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.400
 called bresso do not have to me 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.090
 convince 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.260
 and too much 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.260
 in the sales 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.670
 broad shoulders 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.480
 in time 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:36.550
 what is known as a rag as a dressing room 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.170
 and via labat mode the same best 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.170
 in the city with the works 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.900
 lex luthor I don't know if he has a wig 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.900
 high 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.780
 we are very naive 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.379
 from the presentation to what it says 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.129
 the deputy reminded me of how 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.989
 he played the former tutor gene colan 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.480
 so we will also see that is the thing 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.389
 which does not convince me that it does not give me much 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.580
 hype and that even less steele had a 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.740
 beautiful trailer and that gave me 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.840
 a lot of hype I was looking forward to 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.479
 see it then I saw it may like it or 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.760
 not like every fake is not a 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:41.480
 good movie 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:43.790
 at least steel and we recommend it distorts 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.310
 a lot of the vision of superman than not 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.160
 is that he must necessarily reflect 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.990
 exactly that of comics 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.610
 but if you then make a film like this where 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:59.980
 you say that it is the light of saying that it is the 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.980
 well incarnated and then I kill 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.410
 his brother is not all credible 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.140
 here 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.250
 batman batman mine convinces me though 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.650
 what I saw was in computers 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.020
 then we'll see how we'll look at graphics 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.120
 our bruce wayne 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.250
 I wouldn't want them to put too much stuff in it 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:26.140
 inside because we remember there is wonder 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.140
 woman ie lex luthor batman superman 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.160
 for white lois lane probably 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.170
 appear also plays with the mind 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.330
 will complete to appear at robin at this 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:45.660
 I don't know in a flashback 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:48.710
 will appear water menu and pear towards a 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.950
 Choral choral film to overcome successful 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.630
 that is not quality but still successful 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.300
 angels the first that comes to mind 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.910
 so I am always very reluctant to give 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.560
 to trust choral films because yes 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.560
 there is always the risk of eating 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:12.180
 viadana stuff and deepening of the 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:14.280
 characters this trailer but we'll see the 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.290
 movie based in so good does not have me 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.680
 put profile in half and pa you liked 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:23.430
 certainly inspired there are some 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.260
 frame as it was with me it was for the 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.300
 first man of steel trailer 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.640
 when there was the child with the clothes 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:36.540
 I spread the hood of superman on my back 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:39.060
 we fed a lot of age 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.650
 quite epic according to magic sneijder 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.960
 he's good at building shots 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:48.400
 single but then develop the film 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.130
 we'll see what we'll see 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.900
 tell me what you think convinces me 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.420
 this bachmann convinces you this well 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.280
 affleck convinces me superman in 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.080
 particular because we remember that too 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.870
 if the story seems to be taken from a comic 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.170
 of batman in reality and of superman e 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:11.960
 this is not one is one of the things that 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:14.240
 which helps to increase my la 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.280
 my few profession to think that it will be 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.950
 a mushroom succeeded good indeed are 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.050
 only details are not read the 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.750
 future I will be in the front row anyway a 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.140
 see it we'll see what happens 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.970
 will succeed in starting a new trend 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:32.270
 we'll find out just come rhinos 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.830
 everything to the next 3 will probably be 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.330
 that of school sociality 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.330
 hopefully it looked nice
