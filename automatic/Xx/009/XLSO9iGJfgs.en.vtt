00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.500
 but not 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.570
 hello how are you I'm Nancy and in the 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.810
 today's video I bring you the time of the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.880
 pet and she is super super nervous and 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.400
 like he does not like the cameras we 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.869
 They liked sitting for a long time 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.060
 time in the same place is like very 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.670
 active then it was pretty much 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.929
 desperate here but it will accompany me 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.929
 in this video 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.990
 and the first question is what is the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.690
 name of your pet and chat mommy 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.000
 and my life is the diminutive of miracles 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.740
 because we find them in the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.260
 street she was a victim of abuse 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.150
 animal and we found it in very bad 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.220
 been then it 's a miracle that 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.350
 be with us but the name 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.180
 vilar afterwards he seemed very serious so 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.940
 we decided to put him in lichen is like 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.280
 diminutive file of miracles the following 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.470
 question is what kind of pet do you have and 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.939
 want 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.850
 the next question is what kind of 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.340
 you have and what race is and she is 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.610
 a puppy clearly and is a puppy 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.740
 you are a bitch and how she is picked 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.380
 from the street we do not know what happens is 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.420
 obviously it 's a mixture and we know that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.270
 my dad or my mom was a frisÃ© 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.860
 but we do not know what is mixing the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.289
 next question is for how long 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.450
 you've had your pet and we have it more 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.729
 or less for five years when the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.090
 we found the had a scope was a 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.649
 baby but we've been with it for five years now 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 the next question is how 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.179
 you got your pet and as you already 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.069
 I counted she is picked up from the street and 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.009
 she approached my sister when 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.860
 it was very very bad was cut the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.250
 legs and it looks like someone cut her 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.490
 with a blade as well I had several 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.940
 cut then I was bleeding 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.729
 very much was very very very wrong and my 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.770
 sister took her to the vet and so 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.580
 it was how we got it after 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.550
 He decided 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.229
 keep it and we all accept it how many 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.510
 years has your pet as the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.080
 we found on the street then 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.080
 sometimes 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.340
 click 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.459
 we believe that more or less they have between 5 and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.530
 6 years the next question is that they are 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.079
 some curiosities of the personality 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.239
 of your pet and I feel that she has 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.950
 very many but one of the most legs and 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.290
 is that when we are eating and want 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.209
 take then as well as with a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.140
 patita and is with the left leg 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.740
 result 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.740
 yes 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.140
 the next question is what meaning 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.200
 has for you the relationship with your pet 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.939
 and actually in my grandmother's house 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.000
 when I was very little, there was a 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.890
 nugget but I did not have a relationship 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.290
 as much of affection with her I do not know why 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.420
 what was not so related 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.000
 with her but it was very is something totally 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.319
 different I feel that with her I learned 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.620
 that animals are very smart 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.139
 good feelings and above all are beings 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.500
 very good and beings that never have the 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.720
 his brainiac like hurting others 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.180
 people in case of doing harm is for 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.609
 self-defense but I feel that the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.709
 animals are very very good beings and that 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.450
 they deserve all the respect and all the love 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.500
 that we as humans can give 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.810
 what are some of your hobbies 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.989
 favorites to share with your pet 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.359
 and I feel this is going to sound super 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.700
 lazy but the truth I love 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.010
 how to sleep to see a movie and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.470
 candadito blood consent because it is 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.660
 super soft 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.520
 if I love being with her as 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.440
 prohibit watching movies or if I'm 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.690

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.610
