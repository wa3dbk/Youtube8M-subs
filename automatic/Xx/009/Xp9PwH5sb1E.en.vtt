developed<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.850> now<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.960> very

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
developed from now on because it's very

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.960 
developed from now on because it's very
different<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.920> saw<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.310> valve<00:01:47.579> gods

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
different from what we saw in valve gods

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.260 
different from what we saw in valve gods
as<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.390> said<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:50.009> an<00:01:50.130> extent<00:01:50.430> even<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.119> end

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
as I said and to an extent even the end

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.630 
as I said and to an extent even the end
of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> boo<00:01:51.689> saga<00:01:52.320> before<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> ten-year<00:01:53.610> gap

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
of the boo saga before the ten-year gap

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.200 
of the boo saga before the ten-year gap
after<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.450> demise<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.200> kid<00:01:55.530> buu<00:01:55.969> Vegeta<00:01:56.969> seen

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
after the demise of kid buu Vegeta seen

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480 
after the demise of kid buu Vegeta seen
he<00:01:57.360> should<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.689> changed<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.290> point<00:01:58.590> I'm

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
he should have changed at that point I'm

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
he should have changed at that point I'm
not<00:01:59.640> saying<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.110> bad<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.380> i

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
not saying that this is a bad thing i

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.130 
not saying that this is a bad thing i
like<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.850> version<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.299> Vegeta<00:02:03.509> better<00:02:03.869> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
like this version of Vegeta better I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.649 
like this version of Vegeta better I
always<00:02:04.710> did<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> didn't<00:02:06.180> make<00:02:06.299> sense<00:02:06.329> for

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
always did but it didn't make sense for

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.320 
always did but it didn't make sense for
his<00:02:06.780> character<00:02:07.020> arc<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.380> progress<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:09.119> he

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
his character arc to progress to what he

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.950 
his character arc to progress to what he
was<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> end<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> ten-year<00:02:10.410> gap

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
was at the end of the ten-year gap

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.810 
was at the end of the ten-year gap
that's<00:02:11.740> just<00:02:11.860> my<00:02:12.040> thoughts<00:02:12.340> when<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:12.610> lot

some focus on peel off really is nothing
to<00:02:32.050> really<00:02:32.260> come<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:32.800> but<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.070> did<00:02:33.310> enjoy<00:02:33.430> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
to really come on but I did enjoy the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.980 
to really come on but I did enjoy the
episode<00:02:33.880> even<00:02:34.390> though<00:02:34.450> really<00:02:34.660> nothing

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
episode even though really nothing

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.520 
episode even though really nothing
happened<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.250> basically<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:37.530> start

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
happened it was just basically the start

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.730 
happened it was just basically the start
of<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.390> basically<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.840> whole<00:02:41.020> retelling<00:02:41.650> of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
of the basically the whole retelling of

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.730 
of the basically the whole retelling of
battle<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.130> gods<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.140> does<00:02:44.350> seem<00:02:44.620> like

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
battle of gods and it does seem like

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.200 
battle of gods and it does seem like
they<00:02:44.800> are<00:02:44.920> going<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.130> stretch<00:02:45.460> this<00:02:45.670> arc<00:02:45.970> on

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
they are going to stretch this arc on

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.910 
they are going to stretch this arc on
for<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.630> pretty<00:02:46.810> long<00:02:47.020> time<00:02:47.080> which<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.740> little

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
for a pretty long time which is a little

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.580 
for a pretty long time which is a little
disappointing<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.840> see<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.290> they're

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
disappointing to see that they're

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
disappointing to see that they're
stretching<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:51.040> after<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.340> long<00:02:51.490> but

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
stretching it after that long but

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.700 
stretching it after that long but
hopefully<00:02:51.910> they<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.090> keep<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.390> interesting

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
hopefully they can keep it interesting

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.140 
hopefully they can keep it interesting
I'm<00:02:53.710> can't<00:02:53.950> wait<00:02:54.070> for<00:02:54.280> some<00:02:54.400> action<00:02:54.610> bits<00:02:55.000> to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
I'm can't wait for some action bits to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.840 
I'm can't wait for some action bits to
come<00:02:55.300> up<00:02:55.420> but<00:02:55.540> next<00:02:55.780> episode<00:02:56.350> goku<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.340> beers

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
come up but next episode goku and beers

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.900 
come up but next episode goku and beers
will<00:02:58.180> start<00:02:58.540> fighting<00:02:59.050> which<00:02:59.710> by<00:03:00.430> look<00:03:00.730> at<00:03:00.850> the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
will start fighting which by look at the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.450 
will start fighting which by look at the
preview<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:02.440> looks<00:03:02.500> at<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.890> fights<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.430> a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
preview it looks at the fights can be a

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.850 
preview it looks at the fights can be a
bit<00:03:03.670> more<00:03:03.850> evenly<00:03:04.360> matched<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:05.590> exactly

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
bit more evenly matched not exactly

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.410 
bit more evenly matched not exactly
evenly<00:03:06.370> matched<00:03:06.490> but<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.910> looks<00:03:07.090> like<00:03:07.150> go

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
evenly matched but it looks like go

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.640 
evenly matched but it looks like go
who's<00:03:07.600> gonna<00:03:07.720> put<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.960> better<00:03:08.200> fighter<00:03:08.530> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
who's gonna put a better fighter and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.330 
who's gonna put a better fighter and
Spears<00:03:09.300> still<00:03:10.300> getting<00:03:10.660> his<00:03:10.780> butt<00:03:11.350> kicked<00:03:11.410> but

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
Spears still getting his butt kicked but

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.830 
Spears still getting his butt kicked but
does<00:03:12.700> see<00:03:12.940> me<00:03:13.090> putting<00:03:13.330> up<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.540> better<00:03:13.720> fight

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
does see me putting up a better fight

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.960 
does see me putting up a better fight
but<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.800> guy's<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.250> French<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.640> review<00:03:15.910> I

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
but that guy's it's French the review I

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.000 
but that guy's it's French the review I
did<00:03:16.150> enjoy<00:03:16.450> episode<00:03:16.690> i<00:03:16.990> still<00:03:17.290> feel<00:03:17.440> episode

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
did enjoy episode i still feel episode

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.040 
did enjoy episode i still feel episode
um<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.900> was<00:03:20.860> probably<00:03:21.610> one<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.780> weaker

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
um to was probably one of the weaker

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.660 
um to was probably one of the weaker
ones<00:03:23.230> but<00:03:23.350> i<00:03:23.440> think<00:03:23.680> episode<00:03:24.100> 3<00:03:24.340> was<00:03:24.520> the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
ones but i think episode 3 was the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.340 
ones but i think episode 3 was the
weakest<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:26.230> bunch<00:03:27.390> necessarily<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.170> this

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
weakest of the bunch necessarily so this

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.710 
weakest of the bunch necessarily so this
