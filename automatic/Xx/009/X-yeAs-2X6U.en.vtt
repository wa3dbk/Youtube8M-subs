00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
click once on text nothing will happen

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.620 
click once on text nothing will happen
but<00:03:45.230> if<00:03:45.349> I<00:03:45.440> click<00:03:45.650> once<00:03:45.980> on<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.310> link<00:03:46.639> I<00:03:47.090> will<00:03:47.510> go

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
but if I click once on a link I will go

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.140 
but if I click once on a link I will go
directly<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.260> link<00:03:48.560> but<00:03:49.489> here<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.849> didn't

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
directly to that link but here it didn't

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.879 
directly to that link but here it didn't
know<00:03:50.299> did<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:50.720> mean<00:03:50.900> one<00:03:51.079> of<00:03:51.109> these<00:03:51.319> two<00:03:51.590> and

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
know did you mean one of these two and

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.319 
know did you mean one of these two and
so<00:03:52.849> it<00:03:52.940> zoomed<00:03:53.209> into<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.720> area<00:03:55.329> there's

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
so it zoomed into that area there's

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.330 
so it zoomed into that area there's
another<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.959> guess<00:03:57.380> last<00:03:57.650> feature<00:03:57.889> that<00:03:58.220> is

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
another I guess last feature that is

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.009 
another I guess last feature that is
really<00:03:58.579> unique<00:03:58.849> here<00:03:59.150> inside<00:03:59.389> of<00:03:59.450> opera<00:03:59.840> and

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
really unique here inside of opera and

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.199 
really unique here inside of opera and
that's<00:04:00.590> when<00:04:00.799> you're<00:04:01.030> reading<00:04:02.030> an<00:04:02.120> article

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
you get to the bottom of the webpage and

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.289 
you get to the bottom of the webpage and
you<00:04:06.379> want<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.650> go<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:06.980> top<00:04:07.160> again<00:04:07.299> some

you want to go to the top again some
platforms<00:04:08.510> has<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.019> quick<00:04:09.829> jump<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.000> top

platforms has a quick jump to the top

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.849 
platforms has a quick jump to the top
but<00:04:11.780> on<00:04:11.930> Android<00:04:12.290> here<00:04:12.500> we<00:04:12.620> have<00:04:12.739> the

but on Android here we have the
notification<00:04:13.579> bar<00:04:13.609> so<00:04:14.509> instead<00:04:14.810> opera<00:04:15.199> has

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079

opera<00:05:03.780> mobile<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.229> is<00:05:04.740> interesting<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.400> many

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
opera mobile it is interesting that many

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.129 
opera mobile it is interesting that many
people<00:05:06.030> feel<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.509> we<00:05:06.599> have<00:05:06.629> hardware

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
people feel that we have hardware

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.260 
people feel that we have hardware
acceleration<00:05:07.620> is<00:05:07.949> probably<00:05:08.490> because<00:05:08.969> of<00:05:09.000> how

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
acceleration is probably because of how

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.350 
acceleration is probably because of how
smooth<00:05:09.719> the<00:05:10.440> user<00:05:10.650> experiences<00:05:11.460> but<00:05:12.090> there<00:05:12.270> is

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
smooth the user experiences but there is

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.089 
smooth the user experiences but there is
actually<00:05:12.779> no<00:05:12.900> hardware<00:05:13.289> acceleration<00:05:13.740> so

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
actually no hardware acceleration so

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.409 
actually no hardware acceleration so
look<00:05:14.279> forward<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.789> seeing<00:05:15.029> that<00:05:15.180> in<00:05:15.330> the

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
look forward to seeing that in the

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.080 
look forward to seeing that in the
future<00:05:15.599> coming<00:05:15.990> out<00:05:16.169> of<00:05:16.199> opera<00:05:16.729> okay<00:05:17.729> perfect
