you<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.490> install<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:01.330> this<00:02:01.990> will<00:02:02.290> take

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
you you install it so this will take

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.219 
you you install it so this will take
some<00:02:02.799> time<00:02:02.860> although<00:02:03.790> it's<00:02:04.150> not<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.360> big<00:02:04.810> I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
some time although it's not that big I

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.520

would take at least if you have a slow
internet<00:02:08.830> just<00:02:09.520> take<00:02:09.789> 30<00:02:10.060> minutes<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:10.509> so

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
internet just take 30 minutes so so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.230 
internet just take 30 minutes so so
approximately<00:02:12.040> 30<00:02:12.280> minutes<00:02:12.459> okay<00:02:13.000> although
