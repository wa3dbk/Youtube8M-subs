the switch and plug and used a current

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.660 
the switch and plug and used a current

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
tester to make sure it was wired

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.270 
tester to make sure it was wired
properly<00:02:08.110> then<00:02:09.110> added<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.740> bulb<00:02:09.950> cage<00:02:15.280> now

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
properly then added the bulb cage now

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.160 
properly then added the bulb cage now
for<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.670> other<00:02:16.820> cords<00:02:17.300> set<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.720> mentioned

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
for the other cords set I mentioned

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.740 
for the other cords set I mentioned
earlier<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.980> came<00:02:19.250> already<00:02:19.640> assembled<00:02:20.180> which

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
earlier it came already assembled which

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.840 
earlier it came already assembled which
was<00:02:20.930> nice<00:02:21.170> because<00:02:21.530> after<00:02:22.100> watching<00:02:22.280> all<00:02:22.670> that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
was nice because after watching all that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.760 
was nice because after watching all that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.710 
electrical work on the turquoise light
this<00:02:25.340> one<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.850> little<00:02:26.180> more<00:02:26.330> convenient

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
this one is a little more convenient

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.990 
this one is a little more convenient
because<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.260> can<00:02:27.620> finish<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.280> just<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.850> few

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
because I can finish it in just a few

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.810 
because I can finish it in just a few
steps<00:02:29.110> for<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:30.260> one<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.650> chose<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.250> raw<00:02:31.400> metal

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
steps for this one I chose the raw metal

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.880 
steps for this one I chose the raw metal
bulb<00:02:32.090> cage<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.630> don't<00:02:33.140> need<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.440> lampshade

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
bulb cage I don't need the lampshade

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.520 
bulb cage I don't need the lampshade
ring<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:34.489> take<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.940> off<00:02:35.200> because<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.500> doesn't

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
ring so take that off because it doesn't

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.830 
ring so take that off because it doesn't
just<00:02:37.010> fit<00:02:37.250> onto<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.760> socket<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.300> need<00:02:38.660> to

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
just fit onto the socket I need to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.660 
just fit onto the socket I need to
stretch<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.350> cage<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> little<00:02:39.739> since<00:02:40.489> it's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
stretch the cage a little since it's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.940 
stretch the cage a little since it's
just<00:02:40.760> me<00:02:41.180> making<00:02:41.420> this<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:42.019> need<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.470> socket<00:02:42.830> to

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
just me making this I need the socket to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.009 
just me making this I need the socket to
stay<00:02:43.160> put<00:02:43.370> while<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.670> put<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.000> cage<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.540> my

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
stay put while I put the cage on my

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.140 
stay put while I put the cage on my
method<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.470> doing<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:45.739> was<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.130> use<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.580> cup<00:02:46.940> to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
method of doing this was to use a cup to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.720 
method of doing this was to use a cup to
hold<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.480> remove<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.500> screws<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.100> stretch

hold it remove the screws and stretch

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.810 
hold it remove the screws and stretch
the<00:02:49.910> cage<00:02:50.120> over<00:02:54.100> depending<00:02:55.100> on<00:02:55.220> your<00:02:55.310> socket

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
the cage over depending on your socket

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.550 
the cage over depending on your socket
you<00:02:56.000> may<00:02:56.209> notice<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.810> screws<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.320> comes

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
you may notice the screws that comes

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.890

with<00:02:57.769> aren't<00:02:58.130> long<00:02:58.340> enough<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.540> replace

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
with aren't long enough so I replace

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.600 
with aren't long enough so I replace
them<00:03:00.140> with<00:03:00.320> longer<00:03:00.650> screws<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.430> worked

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
them with longer screws and it worked

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.430 
them with longer screws and it worked
just<00:03:01.760> fine

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.320
