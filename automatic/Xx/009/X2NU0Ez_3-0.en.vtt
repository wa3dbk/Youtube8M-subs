00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
cleaned and prepared so the way kale

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.720 
cleaned and prepared so the way kale
comes<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.470> usually<00:03:10.829> bunched<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.519> this

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
comes is usually bunched up like this

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.860 
comes is usually bunched up like this
and<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:13.379> way<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.870> this

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
and so the way I like to do it is this

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.140

really well and wash it so we're going

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.550 
really well and wash it so we're going

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
and then change the water and then dry

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.340 
and then change the water and then dry
out<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.730> kale<00:04:20.970> using<00:04:21.419> some<00:04:21.600> paper<00:04:21.780> towel<00:04:22.049> okay

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
out the kale using some paper towel okay

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.170

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
so once the kale is dry we're going to

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.150 
so once the kale is dry we're going to
transfer<00:04:24.720> all<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.290> kale<00:04:25.470> back<00:04:25.740> into<00:04:26.040> the

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
bowl and one of the most important and

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
bowl and one of the most important and
essentials<00:04:29.389> parts<00:04:30.389> of<00:04:30.600> using<00:04:31.470> kale<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:32.010> salads

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
essentials parts of using kale in salads

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.180 
essentials parts of using kale in salads
is<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:33.180> have<00:04:33.480> it<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.410> know<00:04:34.470> it's<00:04:34.740> going<00:04:35.070> to

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
is to have it and I know it's going to

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.640 
is to have it and I know it's going to
sound<00:04:35.370> pretty<00:04:35.700> funny<00:04:36.210> but<00:04:36.570> we<00:04:37.200> need<00:04:37.440> to

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
sound pretty funny but we need to

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.860 
sound pretty funny but we need to
massage<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.970> kale

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
massage the kale

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.390 
massage the kale
we<00:04:39.930> need<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.200> massage<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.740> because<00:04:40.980> kale<00:04:41.250> is

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
we need to massage it because kale is

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.930 
we need to massage it because kale is
actually<00:04:42.110> quite<00:04:43.110> hard<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.889> what<00:04:44.220> massaging

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
actually quite hard and what massaging

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.500 
actually quite hard and what massaging
does<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:45.570> breaks<00:04:45.900> down<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.410> fibers<00:04:46.860> and

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
does it just breaks down the fibers and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.510 
does it just breaks down the fibers and
basically<00:04:48.510> makes<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.960> more<00:04:49.490> softer<00:04:50.490> and

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
basically makes it more softer and

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.260 
basically makes it more softer and
easier<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.450> sort<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.200> chew<00:04:52.470> on<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:53.010> eat<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.610> to

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
easier to sort of chew on and eat so to

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.210 
easier to sort of chew on and eat so to
do<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:54.479> we're<00:04:55.020> going<00:04:55.229> to<00:04:55.350> need<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.979> add<00:04:56.190> a

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
do that we're going to need to add a

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.110 
do that we're going to need to add a
little<00:04:56.760> bit<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:56.940> olive<00:04:57.120> oil<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:59.010> so<00:05:00.000> we're

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
little bit of olive oil and so we're

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.020 
little bit of olive oil and so we're
just<00:05:00.150> going<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.479> drizzle<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:01.080> on<00:05:01.850> like<00:05:02.850> that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
just going to drizzle that on like that

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.200 
just going to drizzle that on like that
and<00:05:03.590> what<00:05:04.590> helps<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.160> break<00:05:05.430> down<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.820> fibers

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
and what helps to break down the fibers

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.980 
and what helps to break down the fibers
is<00:05:06.479> some<00:05:06.780> sea<00:05:07.080> salt<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:08.220> we're<00:05:08.580> going<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.990> add

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
is some sea salt so we're going to add

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.800 
is some sea salt so we're going to add
some<00:05:10.620> sea<00:05:10.830> salt<00:05:13.970> here<00:05:14.970> we<00:05:15.090> are<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.570> then

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
some sea salt here we are and then

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.350 
some sea salt here we are and then
you're<00:05:16.260> going<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:16.650> go<00:05:16.860> in<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.460> get<00:05:18.120> down

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
you're going to just go in and get down

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.180 
you're going to just go in and get down
and<00:05:18.570> dirty<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.050> start<00:05:19.350> to<00:05:19.470> massage<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:20.010> does

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
and dirty and start to massage it does

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.909 
and dirty and start to massage it does
take<00:05:20.400> some<00:05:20.870> power<00:05:21.870> it's<00:05:22.169> actually<00:05:22.560> like<00:05:22.890> a

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
take some power it's actually like a
