the<00:00:08.820> energy<00:00:09.210> was<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.990> know<00:00:10.080> unbelievable<00:00:10.410> I

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
the energy was you know unbelievable I

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.180 
the energy was you know unbelievable I
came<00:00:10.950> back<00:00:11.099> here<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.340> think<00:00:12.000> two<00:00:12.240> years<00:00:12.269> ago<00:00:13.190> and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
came back here I think two years ago and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.340 
came back here I think two years ago and
if<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.030> energy<00:00:15.120> wasn't<00:00:15.599> like<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:15.990> today<00:00:16.170> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
if the energy wasn't like it was today I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.410 
if the energy wasn't like it was today I
think<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.130> because<00:00:17.550> they<00:00:18.240> had<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
LeBron said earlier this year that that

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.080 
LeBron said earlier this year that that
can't<00:04:32.689> be<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.990> be-all<00:04:33.229> and<00:04:33.379> all<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.189> don't<00:04:34.879> I

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
can't be the be-all and all I don't I

can't be the be-all and all I don't I
mean<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.300> think<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.349> championship<00:04:37.030> validates

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
mean I think a championship validates

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.480 
mean I think a championship validates
and<00:04:38.229> solidifies<00:04:39.229> you<00:04:39.770> know<00:04:39.889> to<00:04:39.949> a<00:04:40.099> certain
