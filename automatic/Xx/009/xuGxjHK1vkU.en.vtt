00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
we've done it off I'll try to describe

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.610 
we've done it off I'll try to describe
the<00:04:31.830> flavor<00:04:32.040> for<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.460> look<00:04:32.730> like<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:33.620> it's

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
the flavor for you look like you it's

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.430 
the flavor for you look like you it's
not<00:04:34.740> like<00:04:34.800> something<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.280> can<00:04:35.430> describe<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:36.440> a

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
not like something you can describe I a

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.500 
not like something you can describe I a
tiniest<00:04:38.310> hint<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.670> mint<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:39.030> could<00:04:39.240> say

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
tiniest hint the mint I could say

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.200 
tiniest hint the mint I could say
because<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.900> does<00:04:40.140> have<00:04:40.350> peppermint<00:04:40.740> in<00:04:41.040> it

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.890 

but

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.049 

that's<00:04:48.559> the<00:04:48.710> only<00:04:48.860> flavor<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.520> could<00:04:49.759> really

00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:50.059 
that's the only flavor I could really

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:52.450 
that's the only flavor I could really
point<00:04:50.809> out<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.289> you<00:04:51.469> I<00:04:51.770> guess<00:04:52.129> just<00:04:52.339> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
point out to you I guess just the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.950 
point out to you I guess just the
combination<00:04:52.759> of<00:04:53.330> these<00:04:53.569> verbs<00:04:53.930> that<00:04:58.839> makes<00:04:59.839> a

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
combination of these verbs that makes a

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.290 
combination of these verbs that makes a
really<00:05:00.080> distinct<00:05:00.529> flavor<00:05:00.889> so<00:05:01.279> then<00:05:02.059> they<00:05:02.180> rate

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
really distinct flavor so then they rate

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.890 
really distinct flavor so then they rate
the<00:05:02.449> box

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
the box

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.570 
the box
I<00:05:03.610> really<00:05:04.610> like<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.849> box<00:05:05.830> it's<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.860> nice<00:05:07.069> box

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
they're Lady and the dragon it's one of

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:14.049
