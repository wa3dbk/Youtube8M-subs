00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.130 
carbon too so if you like the carbon 2
and<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:21.210> hope<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.750> didn't<00:01:22.020> change

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.069 
didn't do that right but buckle actually
hides<00:01:44.520> inside<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.509> cup<00:01:45.659> area<00:01:45.930> which

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
hides inside the little cup area which

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
hides inside the little cup area which
is<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.350> cool<00:01:46.530> doesn't<00:01:46.770> stick<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
is really cool doesn't stick out and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.420 
is really cool doesn't stick out and
flop<00:01:47.880> everywhere<00:01:48.270> which<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> nice<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.740> will

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
flop everywhere which is nice but will

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
flop everywhere which is nice but will
actually<00:01:50.820> open<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.600> show

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
actually open this up a little bit show

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.109 
actually open this up a little bit show
you<00:01:52.439> what's<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.970> different<00:01:53.970> power

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
you what's going on different power

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600 
you what's going on different power

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
well it's like I like a little bit

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.719 
well it's like I like a little bit
thicker<00:02:02.490> laces<00:02:02.939> that's<00:02:03.180> nice<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.340> inside

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
but the carbon tues they actually don't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.890 
but the carbon tues they actually don't
have<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> liner<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.709> complete

Kelso<00:02:27.180> pro<00:02:27.629> footbed<00:02:28.519> awesome<00:02:29.519> gotta<00:02:30.329> have<00:02:30.569> it

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
Kelso pro footbed awesome gotta have it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.380 
Kelso pro footbed awesome gotta have it
but<00:02:31.230> um<00:02:31.409> so<00:02:32.280> pretty<00:02:32.489> much<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:32.670> skates<00:02:33.090> really

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
but um so pretty much the skates really

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.449 
but um so pretty much the skates really
good<00:02:33.540> because<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:34.379> light<00:02:34.650> its<00:02:34.980> carbon<00:02:35.189> fiber

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
good because it's light its carbon fiber

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.190 
good because it's light its carbon fiber
its<00:02:35.700> probably<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.569> lightest<00:02:36.870> skate<00:02:37.079> out

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
its probably the lightest skate out

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.660 
its probably the lightest skate out
there<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.620> toss<00:02:37.859> it<00:02:37.890> around<00:02:38.129> it's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
there you can just toss it around it's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.020 
there you can just toss it around it's
going<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:38.909> feel<00:02:39.599> like<00:02:39.629> nothing<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:40.170> your<00:02:40.260> foot

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
going to feel like nothing on your foot

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.160 
going to feel like nothing on your foot
but<00:02:42.030> also<00:02:42.180> because<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.750> doesn't<00:02:42.959> have<00:02:42.989> that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
but also because it doesn't have that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.750 
but also because it doesn't have that
liner<00:02:43.409> inside<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.859> there<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.159> get<00:02:44.310> your<00:02:44.489> foot

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
liner inside of there you get your foot

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.390 
liner inside of there you get your foot
as<00:02:44.909> close<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.690> skates<00:02:46.019> as<00:02:46.200> possible<00:02:47.190> or<00:02:47.310> as

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
as close to the skates as possible or as

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.670 
as close to the skates as possible or as
close<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.639> the<00:02:47.909> you<00:02:48.599> know<00:02:48.720> exterior<00:02:49.139> the<00:02:49.440> skate

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
close to the you know exterior the skate

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.080
