00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 in San Sebastian there is an affirmation that has 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.060
 heard many times that is the one that 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.910
 low tide you can walk from the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.610
 tennis club to the island walking today 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.590
 is September 10, 2014 we are in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.059
 full tides alive and the tides are 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 live strongest of the last 3 years 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.529
 in 10 minutes it will be low tide so it's 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.660
 the best time to test if this 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.880
 affirmation is true or I have not come with 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.330
 the swimsuit and the shoes 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.790
 sport 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.410
 so I'm not afraid to get wet but the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.270
 condition is that you have to walk there 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.710
 to try to walk 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.160
 I'll show it to see if it's true or not 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.160
 it's true 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.560
 so is 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.300
 yes 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.950
 what happens
