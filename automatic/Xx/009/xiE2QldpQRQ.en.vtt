okay<00:01:25.470> now<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.160> have<00:01:26.399> our<00:01:26.700> source<00:01:27.149> program

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
okay now that we have our source program

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.419 
okay now that we have our source program
punched<00:01:28.050> on<00:01:28.140> paper<00:01:28.410> tape<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:28.950> use<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
punched on paper tape we can use the

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.130 
punched on paper tape we can use the
assembler<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> translate<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> into<00:01:30.690> machine

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
assembler to translate this into machine

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
assembler to translate this into machine
language<00:01:31.289> let<00:01:32.190> me<00:01:32.280> guess<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.759> assemblers<00:01:33.149> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

another<00:01:33.570> tape<00:01:34.130> absolutely<00:01:35.810> here<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.899> is<00:01:37.050> do

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
another tape absolutely here it is do

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:54.890 
another tape absolutely here it is do
you<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.679> load<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:37.979> sure

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.060 

now<00:01:55.900> I'll<00:01:56.050> have<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.260> assembler<00:01:56.650> translate

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
now I'll have the assembler translate

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.530 
now I'll have the assembler translate

during<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.160> first<00:02:09.369> pass<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.940> assembler

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
during the first pass the assembler

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.270 
during the first pass the assembler
reads<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.780> source<00:02:11.020> tape<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.560> simply

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
reads the source tape and simply

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.250 
reads the source tape and simply
constructs<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.850> symbol<00:02:13.180> table<00:02:13.330> during<00:02:14.110> the

source program again and generates the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.740 
source program again and generates the
image<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> listing<00:02:18.430> see<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.450> finished

with<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.960> first<00:02:20.110> pass<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.740> it's<00:02:20.860> just<00:02:21.070> friend

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
with the first pass and it's just friend

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.370 
with the first pass and it's just friend
of<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.430> symbol<00:02:21.730> table<00:02:22.020> now<00:02:23.020> we'll<00:02:23.170> put<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
of the symbol table now we'll put the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.110 
of the symbol table now we'll put the
source<00:02:23.680> tape<00:02:23.950> through<00:02:24.190> again<00:02:24.490> for<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.760> second

pass<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.200> actually<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.950> put<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
pass so you actually have to put the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.210 
pass so you actually have to put the
source<00:02:27.490> tape<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.940> twice<00:02:28.390> that's<00:02:28.840> neat<00:02:29.220> yeah

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
source tape in twice that's neat yeah

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.020 
source tape in twice that's neat yeah
and<00:02:30.340> if<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.490> want<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.670> play<00:02:30.790> with<00:02:30.910> the

and if you want to play with the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.400 
and if you want to play with the
assemblers<00:02:31.450> mind<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:31.930> fun<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.230> put<00:02:32.350> a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
assemblers mind it's fun to put a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.960

have it this process probably takes a

have it this process probably takes a
while<00:04:33.450> doesn't<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.930> well<00:04:34.470> once<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.770> get<00:04:34.860> good

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
while doesn't it well once you get good

while doesn't it well once you get good
at<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.460> can<00:04:35.610> edit<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.940> program<00:04:36.360> about<00:04:36.510> five

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
at it you can edit a program about five

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.570 
at it you can edit a program about five
minutes<00:04:37.380> or<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:37.800> which<00:04:38.010> i<00:04:38.190> think<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.460> actually

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
minutes or so which i think is actually

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.670 
minutes or so which i think is actually
pretty<00:04:38.880> good<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.930> thought<00:04:40.140> fifteen

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
pretty good and and you thought fifteen
