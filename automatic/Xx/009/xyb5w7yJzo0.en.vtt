00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
as you can see I started thinking a lot

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.750 
as you can see I started thinking a lot
about<00:00:16.250> you<00:00:17.250> know<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> was<00:00:17.460> reading<00:00:17.670> the

comments and a lot of a lot of you guys
are<00:00:19.710> kind<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> leaning<00:00:20.189> towards<00:00:20.220> sensor

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
are kind of leaning towards sensor

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.380 
are kind of leaning towards sensor
issues<00:00:21.119> or<00:00:21.769> ignition<00:00:22.769> issues<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.640> what's

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
issues or ignition issues but what's

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.679 
issues or ignition issues but what's
weird<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.080> time<00:00:26.000> as<00:00:27.000> opposed<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.510> all

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
weird about this time as opposed to all

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.179 
weird about this time as opposed to all
the<00:00:27.720> other<00:00:27.930> times<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.650> has<00:00:28.800> happened

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the other times that this has happened

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.420 
the other times that this has happened
which<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.429> about<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> handful<00:00:30.830> not<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.040> bad<00:00:32.279> of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
which is about a handful not that bad of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.090 
which is about a handful not that bad of
course<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.440> what's<00:00:34.440> different<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:34.829> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
course but what's different about this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.680 
course but what's different about this
time<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.850> let<00:00:36.149> me<00:00:36.239> let<00:00:36.390> me<00:00:36.480> give<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> little

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
time is is let me let me give a little

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
time is is let me let me give a little
backstory<00:00:37.280> whenever<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.399> would<00:00:38.460> turn<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
backstory whenever I would turn the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.180 
backstory whenever I would turn the
ignition<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.649> from<00:00:40.829> regular

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
ignition to on just from regular

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.520 
ignition to on just from regular
position<00:00:41.399> off<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.660> would<00:00:43.170> hear<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
position off to on I would hear like a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
position off to on I would hear like a
whirring<00:00:43.980> noise<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:45.420> probably

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
whirring noise like like I'm probably

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.729 
whirring noise like like I'm probably
not<00:00:45.719> gonna<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:45.989> justice<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:46.590> like

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
not gonna do it justice but it was like

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.450 
not gonna do it justice but it was like
a<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> rare<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:49.590> then<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.800> would<00:00:49.890> stop<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
a like a rare and then it would stop and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.740 
a like a rare and then it would stop and
then<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> would<00:00:50.879> start<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> car<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.629> would

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
then I would start the car and it would

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
then I would start the car and it would
start<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> never<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.739> gave<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> any

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
start up and I never really gave it any

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.529 
start up and I never really gave it any
thought<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.760> could<00:00:53.879> be

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
thought of what that could be

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
thought of what that could be
I<00:00:54.629> thought<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> could<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.739> something<00:00:56.010> as

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I thought it could be something as

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.750 
I thought it could be something as
simple<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> power<00:00:57.600> antenna<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.579> have<00:00:59.579> no

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
simple as a as a power antenna I have no

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.010 
simple as a as a power antenna I have no
idea<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.239> these<00:01:00.329> cars<00:01:00.600> came<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:00.899> power

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
idea if these cars came with power

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
idea if these cars came with power
antennas<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.250> didn't<00:01:02.609> I'm

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
antennas or not but if they didn't I'm

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.789 
antennas or not but if they didn't I'm
thinking<00:01:03.120> maybe<00:01:03.300> would<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> maybe<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
thinking maybe would that maybe be a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.050 
thinking maybe would that maybe be a
fuel<00:01:05.100> pump<00:01:05.689> if<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:08.310> sound<00:01:08.580> isn't<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
fuel pump if it is the sound isn't the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000 
fuel pump if it is the sound isn't the
same<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> used<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> used<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
same as it used to be when I used to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
same as it used to be when I used to
turn<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> key<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> on

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
turn the key to on

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.990 
turn the key to on
I<00:01:13.130> highly<00:01:14.130> doubt<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.490> guys<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.880> be

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I highly doubt you guys are going to be

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.810 
I highly doubt you guys are going to be
able<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> hear<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.610> because<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
able to hear this but because now the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.249 
able to hear this but because now the
car<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.299> even<00:01:18.509> starting<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.020> by<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
car is not even starting at all by the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.810 
car is not even starting at all by the
way<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.710> won't<00:01:19.920> start<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.340> been<00:01:20.400> sitting<00:01:20.790> for

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
way it won't start it's been sitting for

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.810 
way it won't start it's been sitting for
about<00:01:21.229> four<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.350> five<00:01:22.500> hours<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> won't<00:01:23.549> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
about four or five hours and it won't it

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.170 
about four or five hours and it won't it
just<00:01:24.119> turns<00:01:24.479> over<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:26.220> wondering<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:26.880> if

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
just turns over so I'm wondering now if

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.899 
just turns over so I'm wondering now if
it's<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.360> fuel<00:01:27.600> delivery<00:01:27.689> issue<00:01:28.670> I'm<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it's a fuel delivery issue I'm going to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.609 
it's a fuel delivery issue I'm going to
turn<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> key<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.600> cycle<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> key<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
turn the key or cycle the key to on a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.170 
turn the key or cycle the key to on a
few<00:01:32.189> times<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> don't<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> guys

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180

would be able to hear the the whirring

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
would be able to hear the the whirring
noise<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.290> little

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
noise or not but it's it's just a little

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.679 
noise or not but it's it's just a little
squeak<00:01:37.829> sound<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.400> let<00:01:39.299> me<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
squeak sound so let me see if you can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:49.649 
squeak sound so let me see if you can
hear<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.130 

you

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.180 

trying<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.230> move<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.470> camera<00:01:57.650> around<00:02:00.100> again<00:02:01.100> I

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
trying to move the camera around again I

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.140 
trying to move the camera around again I
don't<00:02:01.310> know<00:02:01.370> if<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.520> can<00:02:01.610> hear<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:01.940> it's

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
don't know if you can hear that but it's

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.720 
don't know if you can hear that but it's
almost<00:02:02.240> like<00:02:02.420> an<00:02:02.600> electronic<00:02:03.050> like<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.320> real

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
almost like an electronic like a real

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.330 
almost like an electronic like a real
noise<00:02:04.870> it<00:02:05.870> used<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.140> be<00:02:06.230> a<00:02:06.260> lot<00:02:06.440> different<00:02:06.470> when

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
noise it used to be a lot different when

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.590 
noise it used to be a lot different when
I<00:02:07.370> would<00:02:07.550> go<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.640> start<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.000> car<00:02:08.179> would<00:02:08.360> go<00:02:08.479> on

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
I would go to start the car would go on

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.980 
I would go to start the car would go on
for<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.840> longer<00:02:09.080> duration<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:11.690> know<00:02:11.810> are

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
for a longer duration you know are

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.800 
for a longer duration you know are
obviously<00:02:12.320> early<00:02:12.650> signs<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.630> diagnosing<00:02:14.630> here

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
obviously early signs of diagnosing here

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.450 
obviously early signs of diagnosing here
but<00:02:14.960> let<00:02:15.560> me<00:02:15.620> try<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.830> turn<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.130> over<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.370> you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
but let me try to turn it over and you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.110 
but let me try to turn it over and you
can<00:02:16.610> see<00:02:16.640> now<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.090> won't<00:02:17.240> even<00:02:17.300> start

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.309 

it'll<00:02:23.120> just<00:02:23.299> do<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.599> until<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:23.959> kill<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
it'll just do that until I kill the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.989 
it'll just do that until I kill the
battery<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.719> know<00:02:26.719> I<00:02:26.959> mean<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.499> the<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:28.849> the

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:28.999 
battery so you know I mean to the to the

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.879 
battery so you know I mean to the to the
everyday<00:02:29.450> person<00:02:29.659> it<00:02:30.019> would<00:02:30.109> just<00:02:30.290> seem<00:02:30.739> like

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
everyday person it would just seem like

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.009 
everyday person it would just seem like
the<00:02:30.950> cars<00:02:31.249> out<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.519> gas<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.299> it's<00:02:32.450> not<00:02:32.510> it's

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
the cars out of gas but it's not it's

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.629 
the cars out of gas but it's not it's
got<00:02:33.260> three-quarters<00:02:33.829> of<00:02:33.859> a<00:02:34.040> tank<00:02:34.189> in<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.609> I

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
got three-quarters of a tank in it and I

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.069 
got three-quarters of a tank in it and I
know<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.030> because<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.569> put<00:02:35.629> in<00:02:35.840> ten

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
know so because I just put in ten

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.030 
know so because I just put in ten
gallons<00:02:36.499> with<00:02:37.159> it<00:02:38.139> like<00:02:39.139> my<00:02:39.349> gasoline<00:02:39.650> can't

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
gallons with it like my gasoline can't

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.369 
gallons with it like my gasoline can't
to<00:02:40.819> make<00:02:41.000> sure<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.540> wasn't<00:02:41.659> out<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.959> gas

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
to make sure that it wasn't out of gas

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.899 
to make sure that it wasn't out of gas
so<00:02:42.829> I<00:02:43.329> guess<00:02:44.329> my<00:02:44.540> follow-up<00:02:45.049> question<00:02:45.079> is

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
so I guess my follow-up question is

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.509 
so I guess my follow-up question is
could<00:02:46.909> this<00:02:47.060> possibly<00:02:47.359> be<00:02:47.719> a<00:02:47.840> fuel<00:02:48.169> pump<00:02:48.319> or<00:02:48.530> a

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
could this possibly be a fuel pump or a

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.050 
could this possibly be a fuel pump or a
fuel<00:02:50.209> line<00:02:50.419> issue<00:02:50.659> or<00:02:51.579> something<00:02:52.579> other<00:02:52.849> than

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
fuel line issue or something other than

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.360 
fuel line issue or something other than
ignition<00:02:53.599> like<00:02:54.019> I'm<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.739> I<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.099> leaning

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
ignition like I'm like I was leaning

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.550 
ignition like I'm like I was leaning
toward<00:02:55.609> and<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.879> it<00:02:56.090> seems<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.419> be<00:02:56.569> Tyler<00:02:57.439> and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
toward and like it seems to be Tyler and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.129 
toward and like it seems to be Tyler and
a<00:02:57.620> few<00:02:57.799> others<00:02:58.040> or<00:02:58.370> uh<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.689> know<00:02:59.719> Brian's

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
a few others or uh you know Brian's

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.140 
a few others or uh you know Brian's
pointing<00:03:00.469> out<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> couple<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.250> sensor<00:03:01.699> problems

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
pointing out a couple of sensor problems

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.939 
pointing out a couple of sensor problems
I<00:03:02.449> mean<00:03:02.599> you<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:03.590> what<00:03:03.709> do<00:03:03.769> you<00:03:03.829> guys<00:03:03.889> think

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:03.949 
I mean you know what do you guys think

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.830 
I mean you know what do you guys think
about<00:03:04.219> that<00:03:04.400> what<00:03:04.909> is<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.030> noise<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:05.599> mean<00:03:05.719> do

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
about that what is that noise I mean do

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.179 
about that what is that noise I mean do
these<00:03:05.959> things<00:03:06.199> come<00:03:06.349> with<00:03:06.500> power<00:03:06.590> antennas<00:03:07.099> I

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
these things come with power antennas I

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.830 
these things come with power antennas I
haven't<00:03:07.430> even<00:03:07.489> dug<00:03:07.760> into<00:03:07.939> this<00:03:08.120> yet<00:03:08.359> but<00:03:08.629> I

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
haven't even dug into this yet but I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.050 
haven't even dug into this yet but I
have<00:03:09.500> no<00:03:09.620> idea<00:03:09.919> if<00:03:10.040> that's<00:03:10.159> power<00:03:10.400> or<00:03:10.669> not<00:03:10.819> but

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
have no idea if that's power or not but

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.149 
have no idea if that's power or not but
it<00:03:11.959> seems<00:03:12.199> like<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.469> sound<00:03:12.650> comes<00:03:12.889> from<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
it seems like the sound comes from the

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.449 
it seems like the sound comes from the
back<00:03:13.310> or<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.549> bottom<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:13.939> the<00:03:14.000> vehicle<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:15.019> I

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
back or the bottom of the vehicle so I

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.409 
back or the bottom of the vehicle so I
mean<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.519> have<00:03:16.609> a<00:03:16.669> feeling<00:03:16.939> I'll<00:03:17.060> be<00:03:17.090> digging

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
mean I have a feeling I'll be digging

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:18.789 
mean I have a feeling I'll be digging
into<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:17.719> thing<00:03:17.900> pretty<00:03:18.079> deep<00:03:18.319> here<00:03:18.530> soon

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
into this thing pretty deep here soon

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.849 
into this thing pretty deep here soon
but<00:03:19.639> uh<00:03:19.930> curious<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.169> know<00:03:21.290> what<00:03:21.439> a<00:03:21.469> couple<00:03:21.709> of

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
but uh curious to know what a couple of

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.520 
but uh curious to know what a couple of
the<00:03:21.980> initial<00:03:22.489> thoughts<00:03:22.699> are<00:03:22.909> about<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.530> you

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
the initial thoughts are about this you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.599 
the initial thoughts are about this you
know<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.769> is<00:03:24.889> starting<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.189> make<00:03:25.340> me<00:03:25.489> not

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
know this is starting to make me not

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:26.949 
know this is starting to make me not
want<00:03:25.819> to<00:03:25.909> sell<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.180> car<00:03:26.419> at<00:03:26.540> all<00:03:26.659> and<00:03:26.870> just

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
want to sell this car at all and just

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.199 
want to sell this car at all and just
maybe<00:03:27.199> keep<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.620> for<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.799> long<00:03:27.829> term<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.489> real

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
maybe keep it for a long term a real

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.789 
maybe keep it for a long term a real
long<00:03:29.419> term<00:03:29.629> project<00:03:30.109> kind<00:03:30.349> of<00:03:30.439> like<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.650> Mach

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
long term project kind of like the Mach
