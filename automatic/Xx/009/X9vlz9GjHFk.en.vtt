00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
to be a D minor 7 d minor 7 would be DF

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.559 
to be a D minor 7 d minor 7 would be DF
a<00:02:47.660> that's<00:02:47.900> in<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.079> minor<00:02:48.290> part<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:49.130> 7<00:02:49.640> now<00:02:50.299> is

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
a that's in the minor part the 7 now is

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.350 
a that's in the minor part the 7 now is
the<00:02:50.750> C<00:02:51.220> these<00:02:52.220> centers<00:02:52.790> were<00:02:52.940> that's<00:02:53.150> why<00:02:53.269> we

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
the C these centers were that's why we

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.009 
the C these centers were that's why we
call<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:53.599> 77th<00:02:54.500> because<00:02:54.769> C<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.519> 7th<00:02:55.940> away<00:02:56.299> we

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
call it 77th because C is a 7th away we

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.440 
call it 77th because C is a 7th away we
need<00:02:57.230> d<00:02:57.560> e<00:02:57.590> f<00:02:57.769> g<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.129> b<00:02:58.280> c<00:02:58.489> one<00:02:58.940> two<00:02:59.090> three<00:02:59.239> four

five six seven seven

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.650 
five six seven seven
now<00:03:04.160> let's<00:03:04.700> put<00:03:04.879> those<00:03:04.970> two<00:03:05.150> together<00:03:05.269> let's

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
now let's put those two together let's

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.869 
now let's put those two together let's
start<00:03:05.900> here<00:03:06.110> ready<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.709> go

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.369 

now<00:03:11.879> we're<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> do<00:03:12.239> an<00:03:12.330> F<00:03:12.480> chord<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:13.230> up

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
now we're going to do an F chord go up

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.640 
now we're going to do an F chord go up
high<00:03:13.560> five<00:03:13.920> four<00:03:14.220> two<00:03:14.430> one<00:03:14.840> AFCA

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.230 

but<00:03:19.650> can't<00:03:19.860> be<00:03:20.040> an<00:03:20.129> amp<00:03:20.340> octave

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.800 

then<00:03:23.810> we're<00:03:23.900> gonna<00:03:23.990> just<00:03:24.370> end<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.820> minor

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
then we're gonna just end on a minor

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.380 
then we're gonna just end on a minor
here<00:03:27.140> EAC

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
here EAC

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.760 
here EAC
again<00:03:29.390> use<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:29.630> for<00:03:30.020> one<00:03:30.260> two<00:03:30.470> four<00:03:30.740> five

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
again use that for one two four five

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.510 
again use that for one two four five
lefty<00:03:31.370> nan<00:03:31.520> na<00:03:31.760> octave<00:03:32.180> and

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.060 

then<00:03:36.120> we<00:03:36.210> continue<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:39.630> let's<00:03:39.950> look<00:03:40.950> at

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
then we continue it but so let's look at

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.770 
then we continue it but so let's look at
the<00:03:41.190> whole<00:03:41.340> thing<00:03:41.370> again<00:03:41.670> alright<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.660> I'll
