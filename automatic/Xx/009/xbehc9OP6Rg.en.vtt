thought it would be a great car to do a

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.600 
thought it would be a great car to do a

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
drift build of and I was right because

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.750 
drift build of and I was right because
it's<00:04:00.610> it's<00:04:01.360> fun<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:01.989> stable<00:04:02.739> it's<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:03.489> really

stable<00:04:04.090> car<00:04:04.569> and<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.500> way<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.890> snaps<00:04:06.459> in

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
stable car and the way it snaps in

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.000 
stable car and the way it snaps in
transitions<00:04:07.630> is<00:04:07.900> different<00:04:08.470> than<00:04:08.620> almost<00:04:08.799> any

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
transitions is different than almost any

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.400 
transitions is different than almost any
other<00:04:09.069> drift<00:04:09.549> car<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.030> have<00:04:10.360> because<00:04:11.170> it

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
other drift car that I have because it

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.970 
other drift car that I have because it
will<00:04:11.590> keep<00:04:11.920> almost<00:04:12.489> all<00:04:13.030> of<00:04:13.090> its<00:04:13.480> angle<00:04:14.019> almost

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
will keep almost all of its angle almost

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.800 
will keep almost all of its angle almost
all<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.579> angle<00:04:15.940> that<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.150> had<00:04:16.390> from<00:04:16.690> the

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
previous corner and just carry it right

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.180

from some of the some say just the super
basic<00:04:55.270> setups<00:04:55.870> maybe<00:04:56.110> get<00:04:56.320> into<00:04:56.440> something<00:04:56.800> a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
basic setups maybe get into something a

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.310 
basic setups maybe get into something a
little<00:04:56.979> bit<00:04:57.100> more<00:04:57.660> intermediate<00:04:58.660> sort<00:04:59.169> of

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
little bit more intermediate sort of

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.950 
little bit more intermediate sort of
this<00:05:00.039> is<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.250> great<00:05:00.610> car<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:00.910> step<00:05:01.300> up<00:05:01.479> to<00:05:01.690> sort

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
this is a great car to step up to sort

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.440 
this is a great car to step up to sort
of<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.140> intermediate<00:05:02.830> level<00:05:03.190> of<00:05:03.340> drifting<00:05:04.270> so

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
of the intermediate level of drifting so

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.510 
of the intermediate level of drifting so
I<00:05:04.570> consider<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.289> think<00:05:05.710> there<00:05:05.860> are<00:05:05.890> pretty<00:05:06.340> much

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
I consider I think there are pretty much

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.100 
I consider I think there are pretty much
basically<00:05:07.090> three<00:05:07.330> levels<00:05:07.450> of<00:05:07.690> drifting<00:05:08.020> you

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
basically three levels of drifting you

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.659 
basically three levels of drifting you
got<00:05:08.229> your<00:05:08.350> beginner<00:05:08.680> cars<00:05:09.010> you<00:05:09.430> got<00:05:09.520> your

that kind of stuff now let me step up to

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.460 
that kind of stuff now let me step up to
intermediate<00:05:21.039> you<00:05:21.520> start<00:05:21.729> getting<00:05:21.909> into<00:05:22.120> more

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
intermediate you start getting into more

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.690 
intermediate you start getting into more
like<00:05:23.470> muscle<00:05:23.950> cars

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
like muscle cars

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.230 
like muscle cars
and<00:05:24.790> you<00:05:25.090> know<00:05:25.210> 350<00:05:25.780> Z's<00:05:26.790> things<00:05:27.790> like<00:05:28.000> that

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
drive to rear drive swaps you know that

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.550 
drive to rear drive swaps you know that
that<00:05:40.540> kind<00:05:40.750> of<00:05:40.810> stuff<00:05:41.020> where<00:05:41.200> basically

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
that kind of stuff where basically

if<00:05:43.480> you<00:05:43.570> know<00:05:43.690> what<00:05:43.780> I<00:05:43.840> mean<00:05:44.460> but<00:05:45.460> yeah<00:05:45.580> this

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
if you know what I mean but yeah this

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.810 
if you know what I mean but yeah this
350z<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:47.050> works<00:05:47.440> well<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.920> power<00:05:48.160> delivery<00:05:48.730> is

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
350z it works well the power delivery is

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.240 
350z it works well the power delivery is
really<00:05:49.270> immediate<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.020> there's<00:05:50.680> not<00:05:50.890> much

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
really immediate and there's not much

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.150 
really immediate and there's not much
snap<00:05:52.210> in<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:52.690> way<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.990> car<00:05:53.170> transitions<00:05:53.830> so

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
snap in the way the car transitions so

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.030 
snap in the way the car transitions so
it<00:05:54.760> transitions<00:05:55.630> a<00:05:55.810> little<00:05:56.350> bit<00:05:56.470> harder<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.010> a

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
it transitions a little bit harder and a

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.580 
it transitions a little bit harder and a
little<00:05:57.250> bit<00:05:57.370> faster<00:05:58.110> then<00:05:59.110> some<00:05:59.410> other

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
little bit faster then some other

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.030 
little bit faster then some other
beginner<00:05:59.980> cars<00:06:00.310> do<00:06:01.020> but<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.350> way<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:02.770> power

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
beginner cars do but the way the power

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.510 
beginner cars do but the way the power
is<00:06:03.370> delivered<00:06:03.580> is<00:06:04.060> nice<00:06:04.840> and<00:06:05.260> nice<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:06.010> normal

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
is delivered is nice and nice and normal

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.400 
is delivered is nice and nice and normal
it's<00:06:06.910> natural<00:06:07.450> and<00:06:07.630> I<00:06:07.690> know<00:06:07.750> I<00:06:07.870> go<00:06:08.110> off<00:06:08.290> the

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
it's natural and I know I go off the

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.770 
it's natural and I know I go off the
track<00:06:08.650> here<00:06:08.680> but<00:06:09.070> you<00:06:09.250> know<00:06:09.370> who<00:06:09.790> cares<00:06:10.120> who

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
track here but you know who cares who

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.210 
track here but you know who cares who
cares<00:06:10.990> I<00:06:11.170> work<00:06:11.320> my<00:06:11.470> way<00:06:11.500> back<00:06:11.740> up<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:11.920> the<00:06:12.040> top

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
cares I work my way back up to the top

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.330 
cares I work my way back up to the top
but<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:13.480> car<00:06:13.750> is<00:06:14.020> very<00:06:14.380> predictable<00:06:14.920> it's

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
but the car is very predictable it's

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.950 
but the car is very predictable it's
very<00:06:15.580> predictable<00:06:15.820> and<00:06:16.120> easy<00:06:16.390> to<00:06:16.570> control

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
very predictable and easy to control

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.680 
very predictable and easy to control
easy<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.620> know<00:06:17.860> where<00:06:18.640> it's<00:06:18.790> going<00:06:19.240> after<00:06:19.630> you

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
easy to know where it's going after you

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.630 
easy to know where it's going after you
practice<00:06:19.960> with<00:06:20.320> it<00:06:20.380> for<00:06:20.680> a<00:06:21.070> little<00:06:21.190> while<00:06:21.310> and

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
practice with it for a little while and

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.850 
practice with it for a little while and
it's<00:06:21.730> nice<00:06:22.000> for<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.450> sweepers<00:06:22.990> because<00:06:23.740> of

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
it's nice for the sweepers because of

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.530 
it's nice for the sweepers because of
because<00:06:24.400> of<00:06:24.490> all<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:24.700> power<00:06:24.910> that<00:06:25.150> I<00:06:25.210> put<00:06:25.420> in

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
because of all the power that I put in

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.010 
because of all the power that I put in
it<00:06:25.630> but<00:06:25.810> also<00:06:26.070> because<00:06:27.070> of<00:06:27.220> its<00:06:27.310> nice<00:06:27.640> little

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
it but also because of its nice little

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.710 
it but also because of its nice little
snappy<00:06:29.020> transitions<00:06:29.800> it<00:06:30.040> can<00:06:30.610> do<00:06:30.850> the<00:06:31.120> short

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
snappy transitions it can do the short

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.400 
snappy transitions it can do the short
tight<00:06:32.500> technical<00:06:33.340> tracks<00:06:33.610> as<00:06:33.850> well<00:06:34.060> and<00:06:34.380> do<00:06:35.380> a

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
tight technical tracks as well and do a

tight technical tracks as well and do a
