different<00:01:20.580> dance<00:01:21.180> no<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.770> no<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
different dance no this is no I think I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.940 
different dance no this is no I think I
gotta<00:01:24.750> make<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> six<00:01:25.409> hundred<00:01:25.710> thousand

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
gotta make it to six hundred thousand

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
gotta make it to six hundred thousand
make<00:01:26.100> sense<00:01:26.720> if<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.229> six<00:01:28.439> hundred

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
make sense if I could get to six hundred

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
make sense if I could get to six hundred
I<00:01:28.829> guess<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.159> gonna<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> end<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> all

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I guess it's gonna be the end of all

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.480 
I guess it's gonna be the end of all
this<00:01:30.150> cuz<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> seems<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.470> culminating<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this cuz it seems to be culminating I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
this cuz it seems to be culminating I
really<00:01:33.450> hope<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.930> ends<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.650> is

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
really hope that it ends as to what is

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550 
really hope that it ends as to what is
happening<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.549> screen<00:01:36.259> why<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
happening to my screen why is the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.920 
happening to my screen why is the
revolution<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.549> flung<00:01:39.090> feet<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.570> never<00:01:39.840> mind

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.210 
revolution all flung feet up never mind
I<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.350> talk<00:01:42.020> why<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> veneer<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
