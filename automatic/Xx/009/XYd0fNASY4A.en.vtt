00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.530 
tend to have like a marbled effect going
on<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.200> did<00:01:52.530> apply<00:01:52.770> them<00:01:53.040> under<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.240> little

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
on I did apply them under the little

on I did apply them under the little
nail<00:01:54.750> tip<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:56.000> thinking<00:01:57.000> maybe<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.509> would

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
nail tip I was thinking maybe that would

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.780 
nail tip I was thinking maybe that would
be<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> problem<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.100> will<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.610> why<00:01:59.759> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
be the problem that it will that's why I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330 
be the problem that it will that's why I
came<00:01:59.969> marbled<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:01.950> even

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
came marbled like that but then even

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.359 
came marbled like that but then even
when<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.490> applied<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.630> top<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.130> color

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
when I applied it on top of it the color

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.180 
when I applied it on top of it the color
to<00:02:05.640> me<00:02:05.790> still<00:02:06.060> isn't<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.479> even<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.110> did<00:02:07.740> mix<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to me still isn't that even I did mix it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.309 
to me still isn't that even I did mix it
up<00:02:08.310> pretty<00:02:08.489> good<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.000> pot<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.840> I'm<00:02:09.989> thinking

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
up pretty good in a pot so I'm thinking

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.020 
up pretty good in a pot so I'm thinking
maybe<00:02:10.349> these<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:11.009> needs<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.430> come<00:02:11.670> out<00:02:11.819> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
maybe these just needs to come out of

second<00:04:25.770> thing<00:04:25.979> that<00:04:26.010> I<00:04:26.190> ordered<00:04:26.640> from

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
second thing that I ordered from

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.350 
second thing that I ordered from
is<00:04:27.379> the<00:04:28.099> nail<00:04:28.849> nails<00:04:29.270> acrylic<00:04:30.370> monomer<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.669> I

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
is the nail nails acrylic monomer and I

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.809 
is the nail nails acrylic monomer and I
ordered<00:04:33.639> 120<00:04:34.639> milliliters<00:04:35.439> of<00:04:36.439> the<00:04:37.280> maximum

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
ordered 120 milliliters of the maximum

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.670 
ordered 120 milliliters of the maximum
adhesion<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.599> is<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.900> primer<00:04:39.229> lyst

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
adhesion this is the primer lyst

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.850 
adhesion this is the primer lyst
acrylic<00:04:40.550> liquid<00:04:40.669> but<00:04:41.449> because<00:04:42.110> they<00:04:42.530> have<00:04:42.710> to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
acrylic liquid but because they have to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.790 
acrylic liquid but because they have to
put<00:04:42.979> it<00:04:43.099> on<00:04:43.219> an<00:04:43.370> airplane<00:04:43.669> they<00:04:44.569> they<00:04:45.349> send<00:04:45.680> you

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
put it on an airplane they they send you

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.339 
put it on an airplane they they send you
out<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.460> thirty<00:04:46.759> milliliter<00:04:47.389> bottles<00:04:48.199> which

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
out the thirty milliliter bottles which

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.929 
out the thirty milliliter bottles which
I<00:04:48.530> actually<00:04:48.830> don't<00:04:49.219> mind<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.610> think<00:04:49.669> the

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:49.939 
I actually don't mind I think the

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.850 
I actually don't mind I think the
bottles<00:04:50.270> are<00:04:50.389> cute<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:50.960> if<00:04:51.409> you<00:04:51.530> have<00:04:51.710> to

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
bottles are cute and if you have to

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.020 
bottles are cute and if you have to
travel<00:04:52.189> you<00:04:52.280> don't<00:04:52.430> have<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.639> worry<00:04:52.819> about<00:04:52.879> a

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
travel you don't have to worry about a

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.149 
travel you don't have to worry about a
big<00:04:53.300> old<00:04:53.360> container<00:04:53.900> or<00:04:54.169> transferring<00:04:54.919> it<00:04:55.039> you

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
big old container or transferring it you

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.490 
big old container or transferring it you
kind<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.580> just<00:04:55.759> have<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.360> one<00:04:56.719> little<00:04:57.080> one<00:04:57.229> and

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
kind of just have the one little one and

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.070 
kind of just have the one little one and
that's<00:04:57.680> good<00:04:57.919> so<00:04:58.219> I<00:04:58.250> did<00:04:58.729> get<00:04:58.939> the<00:04:59.150> maximum

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
that's good so I did get the maximum

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.649 
that's good so I did get the maximum
adhesion<00:05:00.199> primer<00:05:00.979> list<00:05:01.340> acrylic<00:05:01.879> liquid<00:05:02.180> and

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
adhesion primer list acrylic liquid and

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.409 
adhesion primer list acrylic liquid and
these<00:05:03.469> individually<00:05:04.400> are<00:05:04.580> three<00:05:04.849> dollars<00:05:05.210> and

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
these individually are three dollars and

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:06.550 
these individually are three dollars and
79<00:05:05.840> cents

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
79 cents

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.520 
79 cents
so<00:05:07.069> this<00:05:07.520> equalled<00:05:08.120> up<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.629> fifteen<00:05:09.139> dollars

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
so this equalled up to fifteen dollars

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.920 
so this equalled up to fifteen dollars
and<00:05:09.800> sixteen<00:05:10.310> cents<00:05:10.669> for<00:05:11.090> one<00:05:11.120> hundred<00:05:11.780> and

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
and sixteen cents for one hundred and

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.369 
and sixteen cents for one hundred and
twenty<00:05:12.289> milliliters<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:13.190> then<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.479> picked<00:05:15.229> up

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
twenty milliliters and then I picked up

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.659 
twenty milliliters and then I picked up
the<00:05:16.389> medium<00:05:17.389> speed<00:05:18.050> acrylic<00:05:18.919> liquid<00:05:19.129> and

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
the medium speed acrylic liquid and

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.159 
the medium speed acrylic liquid and
again<00:05:20.000> these<00:05:20.210> were<00:05:20.389> three<00:05:20.629> dollars<00:05:20.930> and

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
again these were three dollars and

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.320 
again these were three dollars and
seventy<00:05:21.289> nine<00:05:21.620> cents<00:05:21.919> each<00:05:22.129> but<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:22.610> chose<00:05:23.060> the

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
seventy nine cents each but I chose the

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.200 
seventy nine cents each but I chose the
120<00:05:24.110> milliliter<00:05:25.069> option<00:05:25.490> so<00:05:25.669> that's<00:05:25.819> why<00:05:26.029> they

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
120 milliliter option so that's why they

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.350 
120 milliliter option so that's why they
sent<00:05:26.509> me<00:05:26.599> four<00:05:27.069> in<00:05:28.069> the<00:05:28.279> individual<00:05:28.939> bottles

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
sent me four in the individual bottles

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.379 
sent me four in the individual bottles
because<00:05:29.689> they<00:05:29.870> have<00:05:30.110> to<00:05:30.460> get<00:05:31.460> flown<00:05:31.759> over<00:05:32.180> here

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
because they have to get flown over here

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.649 
because they have to get flown over here
on<00:05:32.569> an<00:05:32.719> airplane<00:05:33.199> now<00:05:34.009> I<00:05:34.460> got<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.270> medium

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
on an airplane now I got the medium

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.300 
on an airplane now I got the medium
speed<00:05:35.990> because<00:05:36.289> I<00:05:36.319> wasn't<00:05:36.620> sure<00:05:36.800> what<00:05:37.159> the

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
speed because I wasn't sure what the

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.939 
speed because I wasn't sure what the
difference<00:05:37.819> setting<00:05:38.690> for<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.259> set<00:05:39.500> nut<00:05:39.710> would

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
difference setting for the set nut would

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.459 
difference setting for the set nut would
be<00:05:40.099> for<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:40.550> maximum<00:05:41.000> adhesion<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.719> honestly

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469 
be for the maximum adhesion and honestly

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:44.170 
be for the maximum adhesion and honestly
I<00:05:42.529> think<00:05:42.680> as<00:05:43.009> a<00:05:43.039> beginner<00:05:43.430> you<00:05:43.520> can<00:05:43.849> just<00:05:44.029> go

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
I think as a beginner you can just go

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.079 
I think as a beginner you can just go
ahead<00:05:44.449> and<00:05:44.659> start<00:05:44.870> off<00:05:45.050> with<00:05:45.080> this<00:05:45.560> one

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
ahead and start off with this one

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:50.050 
ahead and start off with this one
because<00:05:47.089> the<00:05:47.779> maximum<00:05:48.259> speed<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.580> maximum

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
because the maximum speed the maximum

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.029 
because the maximum speed the maximum
excuse<00:05:50.449> me<00:05:50.599> the<00:05:50.750> maximum<00:05:51.169> adhesion<00:05:51.259> gives<00:05:51.919> you

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
excuse me the maximum adhesion gives you

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.119 
excuse me the maximum adhesion gives you
a<00:05:52.310> lot<00:05:52.759> of<00:05:52.789> playtime<00:05:53.379> you<00:05:54.379> do<00:05:54.560> still<00:05:54.800> need<00:05:54.830> to

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
a lot of playtime you do still need to

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.209 
a lot of playtime you do still need to
move<00:05:55.310> a<00:05:55.699> little<00:05:56.000> bit<00:05:56.349> faster<00:05:57.349> but<00:05:57.830> it<00:05:57.979> still

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
move a little bit faster but it still

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:59.829 
move a little bit faster but it still
gives<00:05:58.460> you<00:05:58.580> a<00:05:58.610> good<00:05:58.849> amount<00:05:59.029> of<00:05:59.180> playtime<00:05:59.599> if

00:05:59.829 --> 00:05:59.839 
gives you a good amount of playtime if

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.719 
gives you a good amount of playtime if
you<00:05:59.960> had<00:06:00.169> to<00:06:00.319> choose<00:06:00.500> between<00:06:00.529> the<00:06:01.219> two<00:06:01.250> I

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
you had to choose between the two I

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.329 
you had to choose between the two I
would<00:06:02.150> say<00:06:02.539> go<00:06:02.750> ahead<00:06:02.839> and<00:06:03.259> just<00:06:03.500> get<00:06:03.979> the

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.339 
would say go ahead and just get the

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.269 
would say go ahead and just get the
maximum<00:06:05.000> speed<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:06.319> he<00:06:06.589> Shannon<00:06:06.889> if<00:06:06.979> you<00:06:07.039> can

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:07.279 
maximum speed and he Shannon if you can

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.610 
maximum speed and he Shannon if you can
afford<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.729> then<00:06:07.969> just<00:06:08.180> go<00:06:08.360> ahead<00:06:08.479> and<00:06:08.930> get

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
afford it then just go ahead and get

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.649 
afford it then just go ahead and get
both<00:06:10.190> so<00:06:10.520> you<00:06:10.580> can<00:06:10.819> figure<00:06:11.000> out<00:06:11.150> what<00:06:11.449> works

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
both so you can figure out what works

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.200 
both so you can figure out what works
for<00:06:11.779> you<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.680> medium<00:06:13.339> speed<00:06:13.610> could<00:06:13.789> even<00:06:13.940> work

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
for you the medium speed could even work

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.079 
for you the medium speed could even work
if<00:06:14.419> you<00:06:14.750> are<00:06:14.779> trying<00:06:15.349> to<00:06:15.469> start<00:06:16.129> out<00:06:16.310> with<00:06:16.520> 3d

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.089 
if you are trying to start out with 3d

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:19.300 
if you are trying to start out with 3d
nail<00:06:17.330> art<00:06:17.569> or<00:06:17.839> something<00:06:18.199> like<00:06:18.319> that<00:06:18.589> now<00:06:19.099> as

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
nail art or something like that now as

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.420 
nail art or something like that now as
far<00:06:19.520> as<00:06:19.580> the<00:06:19.789> smell<00:06:20.210> for<00:06:20.569> the<00:06:20.960> monomer<00:06:21.469> I<00:06:21.710> think

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
far as the smell for the monomer I think

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.610 
far as the smell for the monomer I think
it's<00:06:22.550> no<00:06:22.729> different<00:06:23.210> than<00:06:23.360> any<00:06:23.599> other<00:06:23.690> one<00:06:24.139> so

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
it's no different than any other one so

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.490 
it's no different than any other one so
it's<00:06:24.830> not<00:06:25.159> that<00:06:25.219> that<00:06:25.819> like<00:06:26.690> it<00:06:26.900> doesn't<00:06:27.319> have

to me it's really no different than any

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.159 
to me it's really no different than any
other<00:06:33.159> acrylic<00:06:34.159> monomer<00:06:34.729> and<00:06:34.969> that's<00:06:35.659> it<00:06:35.899> so

only thing you have to figure out is

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:13.749 
only thing you have to figure out is
whether<00:07:11.120> or<00:07:11.300> not<00:07:11.360> you<00:07:11.599> want<00:07:11.779> to<00:07:11.870> spend<00:07:12.169> the<00:07:12.759> $20

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:16.399 
for the shipping but I thought that

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.249 
for the shipping but I thought that
shipment<00:07:16.699> was<00:07:16.729> extremely<00:07:17.539> fast<00:07:17.779> considering

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:18.259

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 
it's coming from the UK and I think

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:24.100 
it's coming from the UK and I think
that's<00:07:22.279> pretty<00:07:22.580> much<00:07:22.699> it<00:07:23.120> I<00:07:23.419> really<00:07:23.870> like<00:07:24.050> it

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110
