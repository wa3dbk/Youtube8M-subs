00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
hey whats up guys today I have a review

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.640 
hey whats up guys today I have a review
on<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.330> morrow<00:00:07.340> cx-3<00:00:08.480> Gib<00:00:09.480> has<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.809> fast<00:00:10.230> but

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
on the morrow cx-3 Gib has a fast but

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.930 
on the morrow cx-3 Gib has a fast but
also<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.040> controlled<00:00:11.700> feel<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:13.460> and<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.730> think

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
also a controlled feel to it and I think

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.820 
also a controlled feel to it and I think
the<00:00:15.059> reason<00:00:15.089> why<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> feels<00:00:15.719> more<00:00:16.350> controlled

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the reason why it feels more controlled

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.870 
the reason why it feels more controlled
is<00:00:17.150> because<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.010> slightly<00:00:20.010> bumpy<00:00:20.430> feel

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
is because of the slightly bumpy feel

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
is because of the slightly bumpy feel
this<00:00:21.060> cube<00:00:21.420> has<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:22.769> stickers<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.279> this

going down the core which I've never
seen<00:00:48.000> before<00:00:48.300> maybe<00:00:48.809> mine<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> only<00:00:49.770> one

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
seen before maybe mine is the only one

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.350 
seen before maybe mine is the only one
that<00:00:50.010> has<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.730> has<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> groove<00:00:51.120> going

down<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> core<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.969> it<00:00:53.969> has<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.390> lip<00:00:54.690> right

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
down the core and it has this lip right

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.819 
down the core and it has this lip right
here<00:00:55.129> which<00:00:56.129> connects<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.300> edge<00:00:57.870> piece

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
here which connects with the edge piece

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.119 
here which connects with the edge piece
so<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> does<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.609> pop<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so that it does not pop out you got the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.280 
so that it does not pop out you got the
edge<00:01:02.280> piece<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.850> first<00:01:03.120> impressions<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
edge piece my first impressions on this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.990 
edge piece my first impressions on this
edge<00:01:04.470> piece<00:01:04.739> was<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.280> reminded<00:01:05.670> me<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000

anything it's just that the plastic
feels<00:01:42.930> very<00:01:43.079> cheap<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:44.689> one<00:01:45.689> problem<00:01:45.990> is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
feels very cheap on this one problem is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.310 
feels very cheap on this one problem is
how<00:01:46.439> trouble<00:01:46.860> has<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.689> centerpiece

how trouble has is that the centerpiece
flies<00:01:49.890> off<00:01:50.509> very<00:01:51.509> frequently<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.500> even<00:01:53.009> put

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
flies off very frequently I even put

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.249 
flies off very frequently I even put
some<00:01:53.610> Lube<00:01:53.850> around<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> centerpiece<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.960> try

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
some Lube around the centerpiece to try

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.050 
some Lube around the centerpiece to try
to<00:01:55.320> make<00:01:55.500> sure<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.740> doesn't<00:01:55.950> pop<00:01:56.189> off<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.880> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to make sure it doesn't pop off but that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.899 
to make sure it doesn't pop off but that
really<00:01:57.360> hasn't<00:01:57.570> helped<00:01:58.399> now<00:01:59.399> corner-cutting

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
really hasn't helped now corner-cutting

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.569 
really hasn't helped now corner-cutting
on<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.270> puzzle<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:01.049> good<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.799> cuts<00:02:02.070> 45

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
on this puzzle is very good it cuts 45

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.209 
on this puzzle is very good it cuts 45
very<00:02:03.000> easily<00:02:03.329> which<00:02:04.320> then<00:02:04.590> results<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
very easily which then results in it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.490 
very easily which then results in it
corner<00:02:05.820> cutting<00:02:06.060> smaller<00:02:06.570> amounts<00:02:07.259> very

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
corner cutting smaller amounts very

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.210 
corner cutting smaller amounts very
easily<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.979> well<00:02:08.509> looking<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.020> reverse<00:02:10.379> it

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
easily as well looking at the reverse it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.510 
easily as well looking at the reverse it
can<00:02:11.459> do<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> half<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.030> QB

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
can do a half a QB

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.730 
can do a half a QB
pretty<00:02:13.090> simply<00:02:13.570> but<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.990> try<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> go<00:02:14.470> any

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
pretty simply but if you try to go any

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.660 
pretty simply but if you try to go any
farther<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:16.240> will<00:02:16.480> get<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.750> pop<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:17.800> about<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
farther you will get a pop so about a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.060 
farther you will get a pop so about a
half<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.420> piece<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.260> limit<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:20.680> this

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
half the piece is the limit for this

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.090 
half the piece is the limit for this
cubes<00:02:21.640> reverse<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.990> cube<00:02:23.440> did<00:02:23.680> come<00:02:23.950> with

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
cubes reverse this cube did come with

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.220 
cubes reverse this cube did come with
other<00:02:24.340> springs<00:02:24.880> but<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.330> haven't<00:02:25.720> tried<00:02:25.900> them

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
other springs but I haven't tried them

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.550 
other springs but I haven't tried them
out<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.070> think<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.870> cube<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.350> fine

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
out so I think that this cube is fine

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.170 
out so I think that this cube is fine
the<00:02:29.710> way<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.550> doesn't<00:02:30.850> need<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the way it is and it doesn't need the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.330 
the way it is and it doesn't need the
different<00:02:31.480> Springs<00:02:31.810> plus<00:02:32.710> I've<00:02:32.980> heard<00:02:33.190> that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
different Springs plus I've heard that

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.340 
different Springs plus I've heard that
those<00:02:33.520> Springs<00:02:33.910> really<00:02:34.390> don't<00:02:34.600> help<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.080> cube

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
those Springs really don't help the cube

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.950 
those Springs really don't help the cube
very<00:02:35.590> much<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.700> these<00:02:37.030> are<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.480> original

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
very much so these are just the original

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.880 
very much so these are just the original
Springs<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.370> cube<00:02:39.640> came<00:02:39.940> with<00:02:40.890> overall

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
Springs that just cube came with overall

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.820 
Springs that just cube came with overall
I<00:02:41.920> think<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.610> very<00:02:42.730> very<00:02:43.000> good<00:02:43.390> cube

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
I think this is a very very good cube

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.140 
I think this is a very very good cube
however<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.160> not<00:02:45.340> my<00:02:45.550> main<00:02:45.700> because<00:02:46.030> I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
however it is not my main because I

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.510 
however it is not my main because I
prefer<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.570> smoother<00:02:47.140> cube<00:02:47.440> but<00:02:48.160> i<00:02:48.190> definitely

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
prefer a smoother cube but i definitely

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.460 
prefer a smoother cube but i definitely
recommend<00:02:48.850> everybody<00:02:49.480> go<00:02:49.840> out<00:02:49.990> and<00:02:50.170> get<00:02:50.320> one

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
recommend everybody go out and get one

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.770 
recommend everybody go out and get one
because<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.490> definitely<00:02:51.640> has<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> potential<00:02:52.690> to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
because it definitely has a potential to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.980 
because it definitely has a potential to
be<00:02:52.930> many<00:02:53.140> people's<00:02:53.530> mains<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:55.240> go<00:02:55.570> pick<00:02:55.750> one<00:02:55.780> up

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
be many people's mains so go pick one up

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.500 
be many people's mains so go pick one up
from<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> chemical<00:02:56.710> got<00:02:56.830> us<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.580> congrats

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
from the chemical got us and congrats
