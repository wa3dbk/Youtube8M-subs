00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.910
 we are all here and we have here a 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.580
 new engine is here and you are I am 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.879
 here in a new way that right now 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.879
 see you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.170
 ar removes the rain that is very annoying 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:26.120
 it is worth it that you see here 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.620
 data five devices one two three four 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.560
 five of these nine objects consists of 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.140
 this mod 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.250
 and well this is easily used for 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.410
 defend yourself from anything as you can 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.740
 see here this mode what it does is put 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.290
 turrets good mini turrets and you with 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.080
 this command from here you choose what 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.630
 they want attacks you see now and not 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.990
 I have to attack bats to 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:00.110
 beige dragons clippers but if I want 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.880
 I can choose to attack or bats 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.880
 today I'm gone 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.240
 as well and that announced an attack and 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.240
 until it's something else 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.090
 to the wolves 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.640
 things like that equal to people 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.430
 the people I think it is to be here 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.410
 at 3 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.410
 I do not know what it ends for people 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.250
 You see the shoot can also be done 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.800
 synthetic turrets not only 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.600
 They can do these things and why not 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.610
 here not the other way around and others if you see 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.830
 with blue the color red 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.200
 how to evolve the turrets good 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.460
 We have two English types here 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.770
 one silver and one gold good as 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.490
 He knows to be unless he is and will be more 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.720
 what is 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.310
 only that it's more durability is worth it if 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.689
 we want to evolve you see that we give 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.050
 a heart is as if we are 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.760
 arranging you do not see this half and murcia 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.760
 stop to halves is broken 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.360
 you see the absolutions until it changes 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.360
 of form and now it's another kind of challenge 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.010
 and with the blue the same thing will happen 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.000
 and if we want to solve it more then more 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.980
 still 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.980
 this is the maximum evolution that there is 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.470
 Well now let's put clippers and 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.090
 you will see what happens a chicken come on let's go 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.540
 go 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.870
 other could you 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.510
 fixes they shoot all clear to time 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.510
 does not give time for the chickens to appear 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.850
 dies right away 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.890
 just like I think the goals 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.890
 where we have iron here 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.540
 fix 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.140
 I do not know if I have activated because they die 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.140
 also the goals 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:30.060
 if you see also they attack the golem to them 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.060
 but come on, there are many here 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.180
 Well, this way, everyone does not 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.650
 have nothing else but this is for this 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.470
 They can evolve put everything 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.350
 you want and it's more like defense mode 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.360
 in case you have to create your house and 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.740
 I do not know in the entrance is installed yours 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.860
 entry 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.270
 of your house is something like that 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:57.180
 another here is that if you enter a chicken going 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.580
 to enter and with criterion of these here 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.890
 the clippers 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.640
 please do not want anyone to enter 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.640
 bother 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.620
 you imagine that a client is 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.680
 but if it comes from here 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.720
 it is in point 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.260
 fix from here and you get to touch 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.290
 if they separate t 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.290
 here and at an age that is not there they would not let 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.650
 I will play jce sumo that is pretty good 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.280
 now defend anything magical that 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.820
 here a lot of 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.350
 of this you defend to stop good because nothing 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.420
 this has been all I hope that I have 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.900
 liked this way to be here all 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.900
 fighting and nothing a greeting and goodbye
