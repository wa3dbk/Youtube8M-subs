00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
we've told the weather story in lots of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
we've told the weather story in lots of
different<00:00:51.270> ways<00:00:51.420> over<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> year<00:00:52.079> they<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
different ways over the year they and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.590 
different ways over the year they and
where<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.219> been<00:00:53.309> practicing<00:00:53.879> using<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.480> new

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
where I've been practicing using the new

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350 
where I've been practicing using the new
3d<00:00:55.140> system<00:00:55.680> now<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.370> taken<00:00:56.699> months<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> plan

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
3d system now it's taken months to plan

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.689 
3d system now it's taken months to plan
there's<00:00:57.989> still<00:00:58.320> lots<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.680> learn<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.399> take<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
there's still lots to learn but take a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.750 
there's still lots to learn but take a
look<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.510> finished<00:01:00.930> article<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.250> idea<00:01:02.640> is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
look at the finished article the idea is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.820 
look at the finished article the idea is
to<00:01:02.910> bring<00:01:03.030> forecasting<00:01:03.899> right<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> date

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to bring forecasting right up to date

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.950 
to bring forecasting right up to date
and<00:01:05.159> communicate<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> weather<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.750> at

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and communicate the weather to you at

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.010 
and communicate the weather to you at
home<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> clearest<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
home in the clearest way we can so the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.500 
home in the clearest way we can so the
static<00:01:10.409> symbols<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> instead<00:01:12.030> we

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
static symbols are going and instead we

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.090 
static symbols are going and instead we
can<00:01:12.689> show<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> exactly<00:01:13.080> where<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> sun

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
can show you exactly where the sun

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.340 
can show you exactly where the sun
shining<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.150> rains<00:01:15.360> falling<00:01:15.869> directly

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350

onto the map virtual reality means

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
onto the map virtual reality means
there's<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:19.950> movement<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.270> can

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
there's more movement because we can

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.670 
there's more movement because we can
zoom<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.049> show<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.320> where<00:01:22.500> all<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
weather I must say but this this will

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
weather I must say but this this will
make<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.670> easier<00:01:44.970> even<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.689> probably

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
make it easier even you could probably

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
make it easier even you could probably
handle<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.740> bill<00:01:48.890> well<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> see

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
handle this one bill well you can see

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.670 
handle this one bill well you can see
from<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.549> globe<00:01:51.119> here<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.930> everything<00:01:52.470> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
from my globe here that everything is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.740 
from my globe here that everything is
moving<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.399> gives<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> good<00:01:53.820> hint<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
moving so that gives a good hint as to

our<00:01:54.869> new<00:01:55.020> graphics<00:01:55.530> everything<00:01:56.130> will<00:01:56.490> move
