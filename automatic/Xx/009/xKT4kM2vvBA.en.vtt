00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.450
 what you see is marshall ms ii that 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.570
 it would be a mini cost amplifier 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.599
 of 35 euros is easily found on ebay 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.480
 on amazon and I must say that it is nothing 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.900
 bad as you see there is the entrance of the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.490
 genre guitar volume tone e 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.900
 this knob is added to that for 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:38.410
 turn it on so maybe not allow 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.379
 loverdrive the ignition signals from 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.900
 this red light we have here the entrance 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.190
 for the power supply however it can work 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:51.909
 a stack of 9 is fine even in a pile 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:56.080
 volt and then we have the entrance here for the 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:58.420
 headphones so it would n't disturb I have to say 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.150
 that to be great 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.250
 this is even smaller than a hand 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.839
 amplifier for the price of 35 euros 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.839
 and really satisfying 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.860
 the clean sound is not very loud I have to 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.920
 say however feel how it changes you put 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.920
 in the minutes 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.720
 I must say that the sun is a lot 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.720
 strong
