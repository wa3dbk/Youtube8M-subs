gotta try stone here that we're going to
use<00:00:09.019> if<00:00:10.019> you'll<00:00:10.170> notice<00:00:10.349> there's<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.800> small

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
little guide on here at a 23 degree

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.259 
little guide on here at a 23 degree
angle<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.340> those<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.880> haven't<00:00:15.089> ever

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
angle for those of you that haven't ever

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.720 
angle for those of you that haven't ever
done<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.870> before<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.100> will<00:00:17.430> give<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
done this before so that will give you a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.760 
done this before so that will give you a
point<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.090> reference<00:00:18.150> as<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.260> angle<00:00:19.619> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
point of reference as to what angle to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.310 
point of reference as to what angle to
hit<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> knife<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.630> I've<00:00:21.630> got<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> couple<00:00:22.140> of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
hit the knife at I've got a couple of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.380 
hit the knife at I've got a couple of
different<00:00:22.680> knives<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.789> show<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.090> as<00:00:24.240> an

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
different knives just to show you as an

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.070 
different knives just to show you as an
example<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.289> santoku<00:00:26.010> knife<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.080> I've

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
example this is a santoku knife and I've

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.050 
example this is a santoku knife and I've
got<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> basic<00:00:28.830> chef's<00:00:29.099> utility<00:00:29.640> knife<00:00:29.789> that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
got a basic chef's utility knife that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.110 
got a basic chef's utility knife that
we're<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.420> put<00:00:30.630> an<00:00:30.779> edge<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> instead

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
we're going to put an edge on so instead

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700 
we're going to put an edge on so instead
of<00:00:33.180> using<00:00:33.420> mineral<00:00:33.690> oil<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.200> actually<00:00:34.380> using

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
of using mineral oil I'm actually using

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
of using mineral oil I'm actually using
a<00:00:34.920> honing<00:00:35.130> oil<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.700> provided<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.180> this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
a honing oil that was provided with this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.190 
a honing oil that was provided with this
stone<00:00:36.829> tends<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.980> work<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.370> better<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
stone tends to work a little better and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.369 
stone tends to work a little better and
we're<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> put<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> small<00:00:42.379> stream

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
we're just going to put a small stream

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:53.119 
we're just going to put a small stream
on<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:50.090> okay<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.710> don't<00:00:52.980> want

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
on there okay and you really don't want

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
on there okay and you really don't want
to<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.280> an<00:00:53.399> excess<00:00:53.730> amount<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:54.210> oil<00:00:54.360> simply

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
to have an excess amount of oil simply

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.680 
to have an excess amount of oil simply
because<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.829> won't<00:00:56.149> sharpen<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> blade<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
because it won't sharpen the blade it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
because it won't sharpen the blade it
will<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> create<00:00:58.260> too<00:00:58.500> much<00:00:58.649> lubrication

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
will just create too much lubrication

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
will just create too much lubrication
and<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.670> won't<00:00:59.789> get<00:01:00.000> enough<00:01:00.239> friction<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and we won't get enough friction out of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.510 
and we won't get enough friction out of
it<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.010> 23<00:01:02.489> degree<00:01:02.760> angle<00:01:04.640> let's<00:01:05.640> start<00:01:05.939> I

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
it so at a 23 degree angle let's start I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
it so at a 23 degree angle let's start I
usually<00:01:08.520> use<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.820> thumb<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> guide<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
usually use my thumb as a guide on the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
usually use my thumb as a guide on the
back<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> blade<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.650> you'll<00:01:10.770> notice<00:01:10.950> on

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
back of the blade if you'll notice on

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.600 
back of the blade if you'll notice on
the<00:01:11.400> stroke<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.790> goes<00:01:11.970> away<00:01:12.119> from<00:01:12.510> me<00:01:13.610> we're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the stroke that goes away from me we're

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.160 
the stroke that goes away from me we're
just<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.119> back<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.390> forth<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.080> if

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
just going to go back and forth and if

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.969 
just going to go back and forth and if
you<00:01:16.290> notice<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:17.869> started<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.380> course<00:01:19.710> edge

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you notice i started on the course edge

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.170 
you notice i started on the course edge
of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> stone<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:25.580> you'll<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.700> able<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.970> feel

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
of the stone and you'll be able to feel

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.490 
of the stone and you'll be able to feel
with<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.540> thumb<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.930> there's<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> small

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
with your thumb that there's a small

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.450 
with your thumb that there's a small
burr<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.939> actually<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.360> little<00:01:30.509> bit<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
burr which is actually a little bit of a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.969 
burr which is actually a little bit of a
little<00:01:32.460> resistance<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.299> thumb<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.979> so

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
little resistance to your thumb there so

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
little resistance to your thumb there so
all<00:01:35.220> we're<00:01:35.400> trying<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.140> keep<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.380> bar

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
all we're trying to do is keep that bar

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.230 
all we're trying to do is keep that bar
going<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.670> 23<00:01:39.180> degree<00:01:39.450> angle<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:41.240> we'll

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
going at a 23 degree angle and we'll

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800 
going at a 23 degree angle and we'll
follow<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.200> fine<00:01:43.439> stone<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:45.479> medium

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
follow up on the fine stone the medium

00:01:45.810 --> 00:02:02.020 
follow up on the fine stone the medium
and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> fun

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.659 

ok
