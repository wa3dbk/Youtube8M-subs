00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it was the damage on it is really really

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the stats of the obsidian Steve we have

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
the stats of the obsidian Steve we have
two<00:00:46.260> plus<00:00:46.500> damage<00:00:46.860> which<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.280> separates

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
two plus damage which really separates

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.200 
two plus damage which really separates
it<00:00:47.910> from<00:00:47.940> many<00:00:48.629> guns<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> game<00:00:50.090> it's<00:00:51.090> just

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
it from many guns of the game it's just

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.639 
it from many guns of the game it's just
a<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.539> powerful<00:00:51.750> gun<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.379> don't<00:00:52.469> really

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
a really powerful gun I don't really

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.319 
a really powerful gun I don't really
understand<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> melts<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.850> three<00:00:54.059> shots

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
understand it melts in three shots

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.060 
understand it melts in three shots
anywhere<00:00:54.930> across<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> map<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.829> really

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
anywhere across the map so it's a really

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.520 
anywhere across the map so it's a really
really<00:00:56.370> efficient<00:00:56.850> gun<00:00:57.030> um<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.870> accuracy<00:00:58.379> can

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
really efficient gun um the accuracy can

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
really efficient gun um the accuracy can
be<00:00:58.620> taken<00:00:58.859> away<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.129> grips<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.910> know

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
be taken away with grips so you know

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.819 
be taken away with grips so you know
that<00:01:00.270> balances<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.750> out<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.320> fire<00:01:01.590> rate<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
that balances it out the fire rate is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.680 
that balances it out the fire rate is
one<00:01:02.100> thing<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.090> slows<00:01:03.420> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
one thing that really you know slows it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.119 
one thing that really you know slows it
down<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.439> close<00:01:04.589> gunfights

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
down when you get up up close gunfights

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
down when you get up up close gunfights
but<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.850> believe<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.450> plus<00:01:06.630> damage<00:01:06.990> really

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
but I believe that to plus damage really

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
but I believe that to plus damage really
helps<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> -1

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
helps it out and then we have the -1

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.359 
helps it out and then we have the -1
handling<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.570> +1<00:01:10.020> mobility<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:10.740> isn't<00:01:11.130> too

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
handling and +1 mobility which isn't too

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.800 
handling and +1 mobility which isn't too
big<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> deal<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> use<00:01:12.150> lightweight<00:01:12.420> so

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
big of a deal if you use lightweight so

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
big of a deal if you use lightweight so
that's<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> stats<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> city

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that's it that's the stats of the city

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.990 
that's it that's the stats of the city
and<00:01:14.970> Steve<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.420> gun<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.500> good

this gameplay I was using the obsidian
steed<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.310> grip<00:01:35.640> which<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.360> helps<00:01:36.600> out

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
steed with grip which really helps out

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
steed with grip which really helps out
the<00:01:36.750> accuracy<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.560> bounced<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.100> out

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the accuracy you know bounced it out

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
the accuracy you know bounced it out
with<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> recoil<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.060> had<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> stock<00:01:39.810> which

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
with the recoil I had the stock which

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.480 
with the recoil I had the stock which
you<00:01:40.200> should<00:01:40.350> run<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.560> every<00:01:40.920> single<00:01:41.100> assault

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you should run on every single assault

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.039 
you should run on every single assault
rifle<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.909> opinion<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.390> I'm<00:01:42.450> extended<00:01:42.899> clip

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
rifle my opinion and I'm extended clip

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
rifle my opinion and I'm extended clip
because<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.729> playground<00:01:44.729> world<00:01:44.909> line<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> run

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
because I playground world line so I run

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
because I playground world line so I run
into<00:01:45.780> multiple<00:01:46.110> enemies<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> extended

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
into multiple enemies so that extended

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.219

mags definitely helps out a lot and then

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
mags definitely helps out a lot and then
I<00:01:49.290> use<00:01:49.470> lightweight<00:01:49.740> lightweight<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:51.390> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
I use lightweight lightweight is it's so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
I use lightweight lightweight is it's so
underrated<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.439> feel<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.890> slow

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
underrated because you feel so slow

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.069 
underrated because you feel so slow
without<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> don't<00:01:54.060> notice<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.509> even

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
without it if you don't notice it even

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780 
without it if you don't notice it even
with<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> XO<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> feel<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.280> slow<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
with the XO so you feel so slow at the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.240 
with the XO so you feel so slow at the
movie<00:01:57.000> when<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.299> an<00:01:57.360> AR<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> lightweight

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
movie when you have an AR so lightweight

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.039 
movie when you have an AR so lightweight
is<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.670> beneficial<00:01:59.939> thing<00:02:00.509> peripherals

do not use blast suppressor because in

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740
