when you find a fabric that you like see

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.590 
when you find a fabric that you like see
how<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:38.850> creases<00:01:39.390> okay<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.219> heavy

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
how well creases okay if it's a heavy

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.300 
how well creases okay if it's a heavy
upholstery<00:01:42.600> type<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.049> feeling<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.189> not

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
upholstery type of feeling then it's not

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
upholstery type of feeling then it's not
going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> crease<00:01:44.820> well<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.840> therefore

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
going to crease well and that therefore

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
going to crease well and that therefore
it's<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> fight<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.070> when<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.969> go<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it's going to fight you when you go to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.170
