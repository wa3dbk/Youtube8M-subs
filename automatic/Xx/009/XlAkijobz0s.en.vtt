that's why I really enjoyed the lower

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.070 
that's why I really enjoyed the lower
tiers<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:29.970> enough<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.359> let's<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.929> get

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.400 
guys saw from the team preview we both
kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> brought<00:00:36.180> some<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:36.750> random<00:00:36.899> stuff

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
kind of brought some really random stuff

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.799 
kind of brought some really random stuff
but<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.640> honest<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.059> why<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.660> do

but to be honest that is why I really do

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600

enjoy the pu and any tears so much

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.100 
enjoy the pu and any tears so much

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
off with it I can pretty much assured my

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.459 
off with it I can pretty much assured my
self<00:00:57.239> getting<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:57.840> least<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> stealth

Barry on there and what because that
Barry<00:01:02.789> does<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.660> you're<00:01:03.809> under<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> fourth

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Barry does is if you're under a fourth

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.289 
Barry does is if you're under a fourth
of<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.739> maximum<00:01:04.890> HP<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.210> make

of your maximum HP it's going to make
your<00:01:06.479> next<00:01:06.750> move<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.170> priority<00:01:07.650> move<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
your next move a priority move so as you

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.830 
your next move a priority move so as you
see<00:01:08.760> they're<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.270> able<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.510> go<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
see they're going to be able to go for a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
see they're going to be able to go for a
priority<00:01:10.380> layer<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.740> spikes<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.310> before<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
priority layer of spikes right before it

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.850 
priority layer of spikes right before it
takes<00:01:11.850> me<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:13.170> means<00:01:13.290> my<00:01:13.530> hazards

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
takes me out and that means my hazards

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.289 
takes me out and that means my hazards
are<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.340> stay<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> rest<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
are there to stay for the rest of the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.580 
are there to stay for the rest of the
battle<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.080> saw<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> team

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
battle because as we saw on the team

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.320 
battle because as we saw on the team
preview<00:01:16.920> he<00:01:17.070> does<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> rapid<00:01:18.090> spitter

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
preview he does not have a rapid spitter

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.350 
preview he does not have a rapid spitter
that's<00:01:19.229> great<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> seeing<00:01:20.700> no<00:01:20.939> life<00:01:21.180> will

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that's great so seeing no life will

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
that's great so seeing no life will
recoil<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> killer<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.439> figured<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> would

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
recoil on the killer I figured it would

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
recoil on the killer I figured it would
be<00:01:22.979> choice<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:23.820> sort<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> went

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
be choice in some sort of way so I went

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
be choice in some sort of way so I went
into<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.140> side<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.100> bluffing<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
into my side up really just bluffing the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.010 
into my side up really just bluffing the
fact<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.090> more<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> defensive<00:01:27.509> bill

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
fact that was more of a defensive bill

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.530 
fact that was more of a defensive bill
but<00:01:28.380> i'm<00:01:28.590> actually<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.430> sub<00:01:29.790> calm<00:01:30.030> minding<00:01:30.420> one

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
but i'm actually a sub calm minding one

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.880 
but i'm actually a sub calm minding one
which<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.140> cool<00:01:31.409> i've<00:01:31.650> been<00:01:31.770> enjoying

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
which is really cool i've been enjoying

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.940 
which is really cool i've been enjoying
it<00:01:32.220> quite<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> lot<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> pu<00:01:33.630> tears<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.079> sonic

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it quite a lot in the pu tears and sonic

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
it quite a lot in the pu tears and sonic
can<00:01:35.100> pull<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.340> off<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.670> well<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.270> he's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
can pull it off really well so he's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
can pull it off really well so he's
gonna<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.380> tues<00:01:37.619> IV<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.250> i'm<00:01:38.490> guessing

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
gonna go tues IV so now i'm guessing

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.219 
gonna go tues IV so now i'm guessing
this<00:01:38.939> things<00:01:39.119> especially<00:01:39.420> defensive<00:01:40.079> wall

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
this things especially defensive wall

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.410 
this things especially defensive wall
and<00:01:40.439> even<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:40.950> +1<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.150> speed

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and even at +1 I don't think I speed

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.569 
and even at +1 I don't think I speed
field<00:01:42.869> will<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.200> doing<00:01:43.470> too<00:01:43.619> much<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.070> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
field will be doing too much and I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
field will be doing too much and I
figured<00:01:44.909> he<00:01:45.299> might<00:01:45.420> want<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> go<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> status

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
figured he might want to go for a status

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.990 
figured he might want to go for a status
inducing<00:01:46.799> move<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.610> gonna<00:01:47.670> set<00:01:47.909> up

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
inducing move there so I'm gonna set up

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
inducing move there so I'm gonna set up
a<00:01:48.090> sub<00:01:48.329> thankfully<00:01:49.229> he's<00:01:49.320> gonna<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
a sub thankfully he's gonna go for a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
a sub thankfully he's gonna go for a
leech<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:50.340> obviously<00:01:50.670> does<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.030> affect

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
leech in which obviously does not affect

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.359 
leech in which obviously does not affect
me<00:01:51.930> because<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.290> behind<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.619> substitute<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
me because I'm behind a substitute and

switch into his maw I'll probably

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.530 
switch into his maw I'll probably
fingering<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.460> I'll<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.119> ice<00:02:00.329> that

about this situation is a while I may
not<00:02:07.560> look<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.950> sonic<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:08.910> quite<00:02:09.090> fast

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
not look at sonic is actually quite fast

sitting<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.209> about

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
sitting in about

sitting in about
229<00:02:13.090> speed<00:02:13.540> which<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.260> actually<00:02:14.530> very<00:02:14.710> decent

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
229 speed which is actually very decent

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.100 
229 speed which is actually very decent

Rhyhorn<00:02:51.790> he's<00:02:52.150> at<00:02:52.270> such<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.510> low<00:02:52.690> range<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.989> HP

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
Rhyhorn he's at such a low range of HP

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.740 
Rhyhorn he's at such a low range of HP
he's<00:02:53.560> very<00:02:53.800> easy<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.220> deal<00:02:54.370> with<00:02:54.400> now<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.940> I

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
he's very easy to deal with now and I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.030 
he's very easy to deal with now and I
really<00:02:55.780> figured<00:02:56.290> he<00:02:56.410> would<00:02:56.500> switch<00:02:56.680> out<00:02:56.830> here

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
really figured he would switch out here

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.800 
really figured he would switch out here
so<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.310> just<00:02:57.489> went<00:02:57.610> for<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.910> roar<00:02:58.180> hoping<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.780> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
so I just went for a roar hoping that I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.120 
so I just went for a roar hoping that I
could<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.140> get<00:02:59.350> some<00:02:59.560> hazards<00:02:59.920> damage

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
could just get some hazards damage

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.340 
could just get some hazards damage
racking<00:03:00.459> up<00:03:00.520> on<00:03:00.700> him<00:03:00.820> but<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.750> guess<00:03:01.959> he<00:03:01.989> did<00:03:02.230> not

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
racking up on him but I guess he did not

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.540 
racking up on him but I guess he did not
want<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.590> save<00:03:02.739> King<00:03:02.920> before<00:03:03.190> death<00:03:03.310> fodder

want to save King before death fodder

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.490 
want to save King before death fodder
and<00:03:03.640> just<00:03:03.940> stayed<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.300> but<00:03:05.020> that's<00:03:05.080> still<00:03:05.320> fine

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
and just stayed in but that's still fine

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.780 
and just stayed in but that's still fine
because<00:03:05.709> now<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.040> start<00:03:06.220> war<00:03:06.520> on<00:03:06.610> some

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
because now I can start war on some

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.979 
because now I can start war on some
stuff<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.120> do<00:03:07.209> bring<00:03:07.450> him<00:03:07.570> out<00:03:07.660> into<00:03:07.810> his

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
does get access to water fall but it's

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.920 
does get access to water fall but it's
not<00:03:12.070> as<00:03:12.250> common<00:03:12.850> so<00:03:13.180> I'll<00:03:13.390> just<00:03:13.420> figured<00:03:13.840> he

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
not as common so I'll just figured he

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.060 
not as common so I'll just figured he

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
that can just go for another war that is

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
going for the grass-type move he will go

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.000

for<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:22.990> meta<00:05:23.140> shock<00:05:23.410> which<00:05:23.620> makes<00:05:23.860> sense

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
for the meta shock which makes sense

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.040 
for the meta shock which makes sense
because<00:05:24.190> I<00:05:24.400> was<00:05:24.550> toxic<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.240> that's<00:05:25.840> pretty

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
because I was toxic and that's pretty

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.870 
because I was toxic and that's pretty
neat<00:05:26.230> running<00:05:26.500> toxic<00:05:27.040> and<00:05:27.220> Venice<00:05:27.520> shock<00:05:27.700> on

neat running toxic and Venice shock on
the<00:05:28.000> same<00:05:28.240> set<00:05:28.600> on<00:05:28.810> Ivysaur<00:05:29.260> so<00:05:30.070> now<00:05:30.190> I'm<00:05:30.280> going

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
the same set on Ivysaur so now I'm going

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.890 
the same set on Ivysaur so now I'm going
to<00:05:30.490> go<00:05:30.580> for<00:05:30.760> a<00:05:30.790> fireblast<00:05:31.120> really<00:05:31.540> just<00:05:31.690> over

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
predicting him to go into it i believe

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.130 
predicting him to go into it i believe
is<00:05:33.610> dragging<00:05:33.970> there<00:05:34.090> but<00:05:34.780> he's<00:05:34.900> just<00:05:34.990> gonna

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
is dragging there but he's just gonna

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.840 
is dragging there but he's just gonna
stay<00:05:35.380> in<00:05:35.410> and<00:05:35.770> regardless<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.550> not<00:05:36.670> having

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
stay in and regardless and not having

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.100 
stay in and regardless and not having
the<00:05:37.030> avaya<00:05:37.240> light<00:05:37.390> he'll<00:05:37.600> be<00:05:37.720> able<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:37.930> take

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
the avaya light he'll be able to take

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.230 
the avaya light he'll be able to take
that<00:05:38.290> because<00:05:38.530> he<00:05:38.620> does<00:05:38.740> resist<00:05:39.160> it<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.580> like

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
that because he does resist it and like

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.820 
that because he does resist it and like
I<00:05:40.270> said<00:05:40.390> most<00:05:40.690> definitely<00:05:40.870> he's<00:05:41.440> specially

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
kind of set up with Bidoof this is a

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.170 
kind of set up with Bidoof this is a
cursing<00:06:02.170> Bidoof<00:06:02.470> with<00:06:02.710> last<00:06:02.950> resort<00:06:03.370> so<00:06:03.730> the

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
cursing Bidoof with last resort so the

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.850 
cursing Bidoof with last resort so the
way<00:06:04.300> last<00:06:04.540> resort<00:06:04.840> works<00:06:05.020> obviously<00:06:05.170> is<00:06:05.620> once

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
way last resort works obviously is once

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.350 
way last resort works obviously is once
you<00:06:05.980> have<00:06:06.070> used<00:06:06.190> all<00:06:06.370> your<00:06:06.520> moves<00:06:06.790> you<00:06:07.210> can

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
you have used all your moves you can

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.660 
you have used all your moves you can
then<00:06:07.480> use<00:06:07.690> it<00:06:07.840> and<00:06:08.020> it<00:06:08.590> has<00:06:08.680> 140<00:06:09.280> based<00:06:09.490> power

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
then use it and it has 140 based power

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.340 
then use it and it has 140 based power
