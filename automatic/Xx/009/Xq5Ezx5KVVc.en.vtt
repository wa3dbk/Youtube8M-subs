the<00:01:50.560> original<00:01:51.040> English<00:01:51.399> audio<00:01:51.759> so<00:01:51.969> you<00:01:52.060> could

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
the original English audio so you could

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.410 
the original English audio so you could
watch<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.540> German<00:01:52.930> dubbed<00:01:53.200> version<00:01:53.740> or<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
original English version so even though

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.920 
original English version so even though

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
you needed a region 2 player you could

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.289 
you needed a region 2 player you could
still<00:01:59.170> get<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.439> whole<00:01:59.590> series<00:02:00.070> in<00:02:00.219> English<00:02:00.789> so

as well so as you can see i mean the

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.609 
as well so as you can see i mean the
toys<00:06:39.819> were<00:06:40.059> basically<00:06:40.449> just<00:06:40.719> vehicles<00:06:41.259> so

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:41.619 
toys were basically just vehicles so

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:43.230 
toys were basically just vehicles so
they<00:06:41.740> just<00:06:41.769> had<00:06:42.009> the<00:06:42.099> vehicles<00:06:42.579> the<00:06:43.059> whole

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
they just had the vehicles the whole

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.999 
they just had the vehicles the whole
concept<00:06:43.449> of<00:06:43.839> the<00:06:43.929> monster<00:06:44.319> minds<00:06:44.529> having

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
concept of the monster minds having

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.589 
concept of the monster minds having
these<00:06:45.159> humanoid<00:06:45.819> forms<00:06:46.240> that<00:06:46.449> could

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
these humanoid forms that could

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.739 
these humanoid forms that could
transform<00:06:47.189> from<00:06:48.189> vehicle<00:06:48.909> to<00:06:48.939> humanoid<00:06:49.599> and

transform from vehicle to humanoid and

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:51.839 
transform from vehicle to humanoid and
back<00:06:49.929> again<00:06:50.110> was<00:06:50.740> created<00:06:51.159> solely<00:06:51.429> for<00:06:51.819> the

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:51.849 
back again was created solely for the

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.269 
back again was created solely for the
show<00:06:52.119> I<00:06:52.149> mean<00:06:52.389> I<00:06:52.479> didn't<00:06:52.779> exist<00:06:53.079> even<00:06:53.349> in<00:06:53.889> some

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:54.279
