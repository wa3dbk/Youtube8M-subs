the<00:00:19.189> same<00:00:19.400> mindset<00:00:19.820> that<00:00:20.210> we<00:00:20.539> had<00:00:20.750> the

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
the same mindset that we had the

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:29.410 
the same mindset that we had the
beginning<00:00:26.140> well<00:00:27.140> it<00:00:27.650> wasn't<00:00:28.420> significant

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
probably is in the word because they

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.430 
probably is in the word because they
were<00:00:31.160> really<00:00:31.400> good<00:00:31.490> at<00:00:31.820> it<00:00:31.849> I<00:00:32.509> think<00:00:33.199> we<00:00:33.260> move

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that they won't come out with everything

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
that they won't come out with everything
they<00:02:42.690> had<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.230> they<00:02:43.620> didn't<00:02:43.950> want<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.130> lose

they had that they didn't want to lose

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.680 
they had that they didn't want to lose
so<00:02:44.580> we<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.850> try<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.060> keep<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.360> pressure<00:02:45.540> on

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
so we just try to keep the pressure on

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.330 
so we just try to keep the pressure on
once<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.200> broke<00:02:46.440> their<00:02:46.650> precious<00:02:46.920> sort<00:02:47.250> of

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
once you broke their precious sort of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.280 
once you broke their precious sort of
broke<00:02:47.489> their<00:02:47.670> spirit<00:02:48.060> right<00:02:48.239> yeah<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> think<00:02:48.989> so

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
at so that's a really good team they're

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.990 
at so that's a really good team they're
athletic<00:02:54.630> they're<00:02:54.810> long<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:56.130> hard<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.430> know
