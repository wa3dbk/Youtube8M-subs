00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.550 
complicated but it makes more expensive
when<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> actually<00:01:55.530> watch<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
when you actually watch it and so in the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.429 
when you actually watch it and so in the
end<00:01:58.850> everything<00:01:59.850> goes<00:02:00.180> back<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> normal<00:02:00.630> like

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
end everything goes back to normal like

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.560 
end everything goes back to normal like
you<00:02:01.619> would<00:02:01.770> expect<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.490> everyone<00:02:03.329> has<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you would expect and everyone has a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.229 
you would expect and everyone has a
Merry<00:02:03.990> Christmas<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.079> episode<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
Merry Christmas so this episode is

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.900 
Merry Christmas so this episode is
complex<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.770> lot<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.920> things<00:02:11.129> happen<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.640> only

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
complex a lot of things happen in only

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.520 
complex a lot of things happen in only
22<00:02:12.390> minutes<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.989> as<00:02:13.140> far<00:02:13.290> as

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
22 minutes and as far as

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.830 
22 minutes and as far as
out<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.830> some<00:02:14.310> parts<00:02:14.640> feel<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> bit<00:02:15.209> rushed

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
out of it some parts feel a bit rushed

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.790 
out of it some parts feel a bit rushed
as<00:02:16.880> for<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.910> story<00:02:18.240> itself<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.410> somewhat

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
as for the story itself it is somewhat

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.190 
as for the story itself it is somewhat
interesting<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.850> don't<00:02:21.180> think<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.900> takes

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
interesting but I don't think it takes

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.980 
interesting but I don't think it takes
full<00:02:22.470> advantage<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.700> life<00:02:24.030> swap<00:02:24.420> type<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
full advantage of the life swap type of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.890 
full advantage of the life swap type of
plot<00:02:25.260> which<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.190> kind<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.550> plot<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.510> tend

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
plot which is a kind of plot that I tend

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.140 
plot which is a kind of plot that I tend
to<00:02:28.020> enjoy<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:30.209> episode<00:02:30.959> isn't<00:02:31.770> funny<00:02:32.610> at<00:02:32.910> all

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
to enjoy the episode isn't funny at all

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.690 
to enjoy the episode isn't funny at all
to<00:02:33.480> me<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.810> could<00:02:34.739> see<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.130> they<00:02:35.280> were<00:02:35.340> trying

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
to me I could see that they were trying

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.640 
to me I could see that they were trying
to<00:02:35.819> be<00:02:35.970> funny<00:02:36.150> with<00:02:36.420> some<00:02:36.720> scenes<00:02:37.080> like<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
to be funny with some scenes like the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.350 
to be funny with some scenes like the

family<00:03:06.390> really<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.530> well<00:03:07.680> that's<00:03:08.160> a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
family really is and well that's a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.040 
family really is and well that's a
pretty<00:03:08.489> decent<00:03:08.880> moral<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.420> kind<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.810> too

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
pretty decent moral it's kind of too

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.970 
pretty decent moral it's kind of too
general<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:12.060> feel<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:12.569> they<00:03:13.140> should<00:03:13.350> have

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
general and I feel like they should have

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.430 
general and I feel like they should have
specified<00:03:14.700> what<00:03:15.239> makes<00:03:15.600> family<00:03:15.870> important

specified what makes family important

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.590 
specified what makes family important
but<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.340> digress<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:19.049> app<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.680> episode<00:03:20.190> is

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
but I digress the app this episode is

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.600 
but I digress the app this episode is
decent<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.810> was<00:03:22.380> honestly<00:03:22.739> expecting<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.579> be

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
decent I was honestly expecting it to be

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.060 
decent I was honestly expecting it to be
a<00:03:23.700> lot<00:03:24.030> worse<00:03:24.299> considering<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.079> from<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.680> show

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
a lot worse considering that from a show

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.120 
a lot worse considering that from a show
created<00:03:26.549> by<00:03:26.670> Seth<00:03:26.940> MacFarlane<00:03:27.739> but<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.769> was

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
created by Seth MacFarlane but I was

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.100 
created by Seth MacFarlane but I was
pleasantly<00:03:29.730> surprised<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.510> see<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.870> this

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
pleasantly surprised to see that this

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.050 
pleasantly surprised to see that this
episode<00:03:31.620> wasn't<00:03:31.920> trying<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.430> disturb<00:03:32.820> me<00:03:33.030> for
