00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello everyone's eyes 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 by and today we are here this new 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.290
 video that could be the first video 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.450
 of a new series I throw it there 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.160
 we try to get to 8 thousand likes and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.670
 if you want another video of this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.830
 gender 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.230
 what we will do then we are going to make gods 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.670
 attacks very very simply though 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.160
 as we go against the current 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 since we highly care 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.260
 of the system 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.000
 we must be able to do zero percent 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.859
 brilliant both who but what it takes to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.199
 make zero percent or squares too 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.420
 late in the battle and it's done and no 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.280
 guys this is where you are wrong because 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.230
 we should go and place everyone and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.910
 all troops then in this case 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.739
 to obviously try this will be a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 trial episode if you like I will do it 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.289
 others therefore will not be very long and today 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.289
 we're going to attack with 240 barbarians 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.820
 let's try someone to attack and then 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.920
 summarizing we must position everyone 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.680
 these 240 glares of course 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.150
 clear connection what is stuff 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.040
 connection lost again of course 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.470
 without positioning the king and the queen if 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.270
 no it would really be a mess to do 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.220
 a little zero percent I'd say that 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.080
 we have to choose a very village 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.229
 very strong with many defenses 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.930
 external therefore not this however shortly 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.360
 I don't know let's see a little bit 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.550
 this could be done here is enough 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 strong not to say that it is very strong e 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.780
 that to all buildings at most 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.820
 we can kind of start by putting a 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.259
 barbaric here 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.270
 let's get him killed then we put a 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.070
 and we have to do this 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.770
 practically all along the building 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.110
 so be careful not to destroy anything 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.330
 calmly we must ensure that they die 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.840
 without doing anything 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.320
 ok good bum die morite is a bit 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.119
 stupid as what I have to say though 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.490
 believe me that surely the deco bar 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.080
 evil rather than with archers will not be 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.920
 too difficult is true 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.250
 I hope no no no no no no no we have lost 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.410
 my mistake 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.479
 go home and redo will immediately 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.610
 more difficult than expected and a lot 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.149
 we will probably lose a mess of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.040
 trophies 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.440
 great idea the bows to start this 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.300
 series is very good we moan barbarians who 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.090
 we need a gem so we can 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.430
 turn off and then we're ready again 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.780
 to look for someone to attack I would say 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.110
 that we can attack right away 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.860
 this is not too weak 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.930
 someone with hell would be comfortable 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.090
 external ok I think we can attack 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.010
 this is because there are walls and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.870
 so we can put type i 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.270
 barbarians like that 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.220
 meanwhile let them be killed by them 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.130
 cannons from all other things then ne 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.890
 let's put some kind here all so much hosts 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.319
 canons estimate estimate at 10 o'clock should 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.150
 to be quite strong and all in the meantime 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.040
 the canons destroy everything from the ne 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.040
 let's do the same a bit more 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.510
 identical thing here eye not eye 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.299
 they must go to the hut of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.610
 curator please if not risk of 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.540
 destroy another building here they are 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.090
 penetrating but now we say they are dead 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.120
 perfect guys from the floor plan we are 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.620
 still at 185 boys is a mess 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.530
 no, however, the boys are very strange 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.349
 attack so try because it is also 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.000
 fun because compared to the usual one 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.329
 he says yes I have to do something completely 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.390
 different you guys are stupid them 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:32.129
 let us also put an eye over here not to do 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.440
 crap good barbarians you died die 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:39.519
 sacrifice yourself for re a kidal and no no no 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.209
 no no no no no no no no no no ok 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.400
 perfect 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.709
 here there was a little thrill because 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.709
 if they had passed they would have destroyed 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.019
 type everything calls half guys we are a 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.670
 half and time is starting to 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.310
 scarcity therefore it is a problem 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.099
 we have to put some eyes here or 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.940
 I want to put others here 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:04.660
 ok very good perfect guys two or three 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.000
 up here of three passed calmly i 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.549
 our barbarians will die, there are 80 missing 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.319
 we have a minute we don't have to do it 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.019
 panic because of anyway 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.750
 but there is still time for beard 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.750
 too many are missing up here 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:27.629
 we will all die the last 50 barbarian boys 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.939
 last 50 we can do it there 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:33.120
 we can do if we can do it 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:35.219
 40 speak the 40 beards we do not 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.330
 bullshit guys we don't do crap 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:40.979
 30 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:44.340
 ok ok very good no no no no guys not 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:49.620
 I can do it fast and fast 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.539
 you die very well very well 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.560
 I also owe one last barbarian 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:58.430
 the goal here 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.430
 ok we did 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:06.210
 240 level 7 barbarians with a loot of 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.830
 zero of gold 0 of elixir zero stars indeed 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.110
 minus 30 trophies 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.300
 never seen anything more ugly than this 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.009
 guys I have to say it wasn't 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.650
 simple as I thought then if indeed 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.449
 you like it if you throw it big there 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.740
 it will be fun to have here 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:26.039
 giant archers but healers sins 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.259
 dragons and then stay tuned 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.849
 because we will see some good ones 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.009
 having said this guys I remind you that 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.689
 this was just an introductory episode 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.919
 an experiment to see if you focus on them 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.930
 they are looking for this series 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.259
 so I recommend it in this case 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.849
 so many nice i like a kidal and always 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.379
 for this reason this video is not 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.029
 was very long but the next 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.639
 surely they will be a little longer with 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.259
 maybe more attacks more troops or maybe 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.349
 even not just with a scam maybe 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.389
 type attacks with sins golem bombs 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.879
 whatever you want write here 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.250
 under me, as usual, I thank you 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.919
 greeting I remind you to go through all the 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.289
 link below in the description mi 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.990
 I recommend no kids we see each other 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.500
 in the next 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.500
 video
