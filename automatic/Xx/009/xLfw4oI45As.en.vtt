00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
you is the effect of water in the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.789 
you is the effect of water in the
airline's<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.870> what<00:00:12.870> we're<00:00:13.049> going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> do<00:00:13.440> here

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
airline's so what we're going to do here

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.029 
airline's so what we're going to do here
is<00:00:14.009> I've<00:00:14.400> got<00:00:14.429> these<00:00:14.820> unit<00:00:15.330> set<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.690> at<00:00:15.859> 90<00:00:16.859> psi

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
is I've got these unit set it at 90 psi

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.550 
is I've got these unit set it at 90 psi
I've<00:00:17.760> got<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.390> flow<00:00:18.630> controls<00:00:19.109> turned<00:00:19.350> all

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
I've got the flow controls turned all

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.380 
I've got the flow controls turned all
the<00:00:19.680> way<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.250> I've<00:00:20.490> got<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.910> cushions

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the way out and I've got the cushions

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.960 
the way out and I've got the cushions
turned<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> way<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> very

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
turned all the way in so we have a very

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.400 
turned all the way in so we have a very
fast<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:25.140> yet<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:26.220> robust<00:00:27.080> system<00:00:28.080> here

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
fast but yet very robust system here

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.279 
fast but yet very robust system here
that<00:00:28.560> should<00:00:29.070> last<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.519> lot<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.820> years<00:00:30.090> yeah<00:00:30.929> I'm

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that should last a lot of years yeah I'm

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.780 
that should last a lot of years yeah I'm
going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> activate<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> air<00:00:32.550> cylinder

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
going to activate the air cylinder

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
going to activate the air cylinder
several<00:00:33.270> times<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:34.110> how<00:00:34.260> fast<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
several times so you can see how fast it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.400 
several times so you can see how fast it
operates<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> its<00:00:35.880> characteristics<00:00:42.410> okay

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
operates and its characteristics okay

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.500 
operates and its characteristics okay
now<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.520> we're<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.329> we're

going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> de-energize<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.710> system<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:48.980> with

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
going to de-energize the system and with

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
going to de-energize the system and with
a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.760> bit<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.030> help<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.600> cup<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.960> water

pneumatics okay now we're going to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.260 
pneumatics okay now we're going to
energize<00:01:26.100> our<00:01:26.340> system<00:01:27.829> now<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.790> we're<00:01:30.150> going

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
energize our system now what we're going

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.359 
energize our system now what we're going
to<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.479> doing<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.930> pushing<00:01:31.170> water<00:01:31.650> into<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to be doing is pushing water into the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.899 
to be doing is pushing water into the
cylinder<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.140> you'll<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> effects<00:01:34.829> here

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:46.639 

these<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> notch<00:01:39.270> enos<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.649> acting

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
these a notch enos you know it's acting

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.060 
these a notch enos you know it's acting
strange<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.310> end<00:01:48.560> how<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> doesn't<00:01:49.979> want

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
strange at the end how it doesn't want

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.670 
strange at the end how it doesn't want
to<00:01:50.130> come<00:01:50.310> back<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.729> anymore

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
to come back in anymore

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.109 
to come back in anymore
what's<00:01:52.680> happening<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.490> we're<00:01:53.700> trying<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
what's happening here is we're trying to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.420 
what's happening here is we're trying to
compress<00:01:54.540> water<00:01:54.899> inside<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.860> cushions<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
compress water inside of the cushions of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.580 
compress water inside of the cushions of
the<00:01:56.490> air<00:01:56.670> cylinders<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.350> plain

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the air cylinders and it's just plain

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 
the air cylinders and it's just plain
cannot<00:01:59.009> compress<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.479> water's<00:02:00.810> got

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
cannot compress it the water's got

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.719 
cannot compress it the water's got
nowhere<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.409> go<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> water<00:02:02.130> cannot<00:02:02.549> get

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
nowhere to go and the water cannot get

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.709 
nowhere to go and the water cannot get
through<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.810> openings<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:06.299> in

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
through the openings that are there in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.380 
through the openings that are there in
the<00:02:06.840> little<00:02:07.020> valves<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.340> cushions<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the little valves of the cushions so

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.720 
the little valves of the cushions so
it'll<00:02:09.569> sit<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.050> forever<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.550> also

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
it'll sit out here forever and you also

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460 
it'll sit out here forever and you also
see<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.150> when<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.480> operates

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
see that when it operates

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.680 
see that when it operates
very<00:02:14.840> Nachi<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.460> hydraulic<00:02:18.090> e<00:02:18.420> now

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
very Nachi and it's hydraulic e now

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.330 
very Nachi and it's hydraulic e now
against<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.670> against<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.820> return<00:02:22.340> also

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
against that against that return also

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.460 
against that against that return also
notice<00:02:23.880> all<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.480> water<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:25.050> spraying

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
notice all this water that's spraying

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.010 
notice all this water that's spraying
all<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.860> only<00:02:26.340> getting<00:02:27.240> pumped<00:02:27.540> through<00:02:27.870> the
