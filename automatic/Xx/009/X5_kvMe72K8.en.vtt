you look closely at the character okay
we've<00:00:55.379> already<00:00:55.590> covered<00:00:56.690> barriers<00:00:59.510> okay

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
top left there's a little platform just

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.320 
top left there's a little platform just
watch<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> character<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> bit<00:01:11.970> slow

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
watch the character so it's a bit slow

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.350 
watch the character so it's a bit slow
so<00:01:12.560> watch<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> character<00:01:14.160> you<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.210> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so watch the character you see this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.050 
so watch the character you see this
little<00:01:15.540> platform<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.200> step<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.970> it's<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
little platform you can step on it's a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.200 
little platform you can step on it's a
teleporter<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.370> watch<00:01:20.580> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.940> watch

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
teleporter so if you watch if you watch

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.750 
teleporter so if you watch if you watch
the<00:01:21.390> character<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:22.950> he'll<00:01:23.190> teleport

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
the character all right he'll teleport

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.260 
the character all right he'll teleport
from<00:01:23.990> there<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.370> see<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.730> two<00:01:26.940> little

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
from there and if you see the two little

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
from there and if you see the two little
blue<00:01:27.690> um<00:01:29.030> little<00:01:30.320> test<00:01:31.320> tube<00:01:31.530> things<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:32.580> was

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
blue um little test tube things it was

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.450 
blue um little test tube things it was
spawned<00:01:33.030> next<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> right<00:01:34.320> hand<00:01:34.619> blue<00:01:34.950> test

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
spawned next to the right hand blue test

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.890 
spawned next to the right hand blue test
tube<00:01:35.790> after<00:01:36.060> our<00:01:36.869> press<00:01:37.080> space<00:01:37.790> see<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.720> that's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
tube after our press space see so that's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.180 
tube after our press space see so that's
what<00:01:40.020> we're<00:01:40.140> trying<00:01:40.260> to<00:01:40.350> achieve<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
what we're trying to achieve a

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.270 
what we're trying to achieve a
teleporter<00:01:42.320> now<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:43.950> teleport

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
teleporter now that so you can teleport

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560 
teleporter now that so you can teleport
back<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.640> forth<00:01:44.850> till<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> fall<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
back and forth till the fall back and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.540 
back and forth till the fall back and
forth<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> create<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.010> basic<00:01:47.250> one

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
forth I'm going to create a basic one

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.090 
forth I'm going to create a basic one
not<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.150> with<00:01:48.420> an<00:01:48.540> animation<00:01:48.900> like<00:01:49.260> that<00:01:49.470> just

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
not one with an animation like that just

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
not one with an animation like that just
tell<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.970> instantly<00:01:51.479> teleports<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
tell it just it instantly teleports you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
tell it just it instantly teleports you
to<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.190> location<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.760> want<00:01:54.030> ok<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.740> um<00:01:56.280> in

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
to the location you want ok so um in

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.609 
to the location you want ok so um in
this<00:01:57.030> instance<00:01:57.619> will<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.800> creating<00:01:59.160> an<00:01:59.250> object

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
this instance will be creating an object

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
this instance will be creating an object
new<00:02:01.619> sprite<00:02:01.979> edits<00:02:02.880> bright<00:02:03.150> just<00:02:03.930> right<00:02:05.420> they

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
new sprite edits bright just right they

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
new sprite edits bright just right they
make<00:02:06.600> us<00:02:06.720> today<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.260> 32<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:10.649> am<00:02:11.070> going

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
make us today to the 32 and I am going

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
make us today to the 32 and I am going
to<00:02:11.730> make<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:13.640> crap<00:02:14.640> um

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.090 

I'm<00:02:20.189> gonna<00:02:20.370> make<00:02:20.579> it

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
I'm gonna make it

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.930 
I'm gonna make it
the<00:02:22.730> reasonably<00:02:23.210> small<00:02:23.630> hole<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:27.880> there<00:02:28.880> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
the reasonably small hole so there you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.640 
the reasonably small hole so there you
go<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.930> I'm<00:02:30.020> going<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.230> paint<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.530> inside

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
go and I'm going to paint the inside

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.360 
go and I'm going to paint the inside
black<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.400> like<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> whole<00:02:31.940> sea<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.370> this

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
black so it's like a whole sea and this

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.800 
black so it's like a whole sea and this
will<00:02:34.520> be<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> teleporter<00:02:35.360> spray<00:02:35.630> okay<00:02:36.320> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
will be the teleporter spray okay and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.020 
will be the teleporter spray okay and
this<00:02:38.810> will<00:02:39.020> be<00:02:39.140> teleporter<00:02:39.890> one<00:02:41.860> okay

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.020 

so<00:02:46.630> what<00:02:46.750> we're<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.020> do<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:48.480> character

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
so what we're going to do is character

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.410

in this instance sbarro will go to
teleported<00:04:15.019> to<00:04:16.870> okay<00:04:18.220> now<00:04:19.220> check<00:04:20.120> if<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.450> to

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
teleported to okay now check if this to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.480 
teleported to okay now check if this to
the<00:04:20.720> 42<00:04:21.109> okay<00:04:21.380> now<00:04:22.130> we're<00:04:22.310> done<00:04:22.400> here<00:04:22.729> okay

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
the 42 okay now we're done here okay

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.269 
the 42 okay now we're done here okay
here<00:04:25.490> add<00:04:26.289> event<00:04:27.289> step

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:29.279 
here add event step

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:35.879 
here add event step
control<00:04:32.039> vereb<00:04:33.039> test<00:04:33.340> variable<00:04:33.909> go<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.800> have

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
control vereb test variable go to have

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:44.540 
control vereb test variable go to have
equal<00:04:36.219> to<00:04:36.699> one<00:04:37.210> then<00:04:41.550> jump<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.610> position<00:04:43.210> and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
equal to one then jump to position and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.679 
equal to one then jump to position and
then<00:04:45.550> we'll<00:04:45.849> have<00:04:45.939> to<00:04:46.090> find<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.389> coordinates

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
then we'll have to find the coordinates

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.760 
then we'll have to find the coordinates
later<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.710> object<00:04:48.900> character<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.499> it's<00:04:50.650> the

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
later but object character so it's the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.399 
later but object character so it's the
character<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.370> has<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.789> jump<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.740> then<00:04:55.409> set

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
character that has to jump and then set

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:05.970 
character that has to jump and then set
variable<00:04:57.310> go<00:04:58.259> to<00:04:59.259> zero<00:05:01.020> okay<00:05:02.310> just<00:05:03.310> copy<00:05:03.610> that

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.740 

then<00:05:06.340> step

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.250 

okay<00:05:10.790> now<00:05:11.790> we<00:05:12.600> got<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.840> find<00:05:12.960> out<00:05:13.140> the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
okay now we got to find out the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.170 
okay now we got to find out the
coordinates<00:05:13.590> of<00:05:13.890> where<00:05:13.950> he<00:05:14.430> my<00:05:14.730> character<00:05:15.150> is

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
coordinates of where he my character is

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.510 
coordinates of where he my character is
going<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.390> go<00:05:15.570> so<00:05:16.560> we're<00:05:16.740> going<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.950> put<00:05:16.980> in<00:05:17.220> a

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
going to go so we're going to put in a

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:26.000 
going to go so we're going to put in a
wall<00:05:19.850> yeah<00:05:23.270> so<00:05:24.270> let's<00:05:24.960> say<00:05:25.110> we<00:05:25.470> want<00:05:25.680> him<00:05:25.830> to

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
wall yeah so let's say we want him to

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.520 
wall yeah so let's say we want him to
teleport<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.730> a<00:05:26.760> different<00:05:27.210> room<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:28.500> a

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
teleport to a different room to a

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.440 
teleport to a different room to a
different<00:05:28.860> area<00:05:29.070> okay<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:33.000> we<00:05:33.120> wanted<00:05:33.330> to

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
different area okay so we wanted to

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.800 
different area okay so we wanted to
teleport<00:05:33.900> here<00:05:34.790> we<00:05:35.790> put<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.090> teleporter<00:05:36.630> one

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
teleport here we put the teleporter one

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.010 
teleport here we put the teleporter one
in<00:05:37.020> this<00:05:37.170> corner<00:05:37.650> remember<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.400> coordinates

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
in this corner remember the coordinates

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.490 
in this corner remember the coordinates
okay<00:05:40.430> coordinates<00:05:41.540> three<00:05:42.540> if<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:43.230> look<00:05:43.350> on

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
okay coordinates three if you look on

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.159 
okay coordinates three if you look on
the<00:05:43.650> bottom<00:05:43.770> here<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:45.630> coordinates<00:05:45.990> are<00:05:46.290> 384

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
the bottom here the coordinates are 384

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.790 
the bottom here the coordinates are 384
let<00:05:49.169> me<00:05:49.260> just<00:05:49.410> write<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:49.710> down<00:05:49.860> for<00:05:50.900> 16<00:05:51.900> okay

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
let me just write it down for 16 okay

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.640 
let me just write it down for 16 okay
that's<00:05:53.490> for<00:05:53.669> teleporter<00:05:54.180> one<00:05:54.560> that's<00:05:55.560> a

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
that's for teleporter one that's a

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.970 
that's for teleporter one that's a
teleporter<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.340> you<00:05:57.150> put<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.450> in<00:05:57.690> this<00:05:58.620> corner

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
teleporter to you put it in this corner

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:07.760 
teleporter to you put it in this corner
here<00:05:59.220> and<00:05:59.460> it's<00:06:00.300> 288<00:06:03.320> by<00:06:04.320> 192<00:06:05.130> okay<00:06:06.650> so<00:06:07.650> what

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
here and it's 288 by 192 okay so what

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.190 
here and it's 288 by 192 okay so what
happens<00:06:08.070> now<00:06:08.310> is<00:06:08.580> remember<00:06:09.390> that<00:06:09.540> jump<00:06:09.900> before

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
happens now is remember that jump before

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.130 
happens now is remember that jump before
we<00:06:10.560> had<00:06:10.770> so<00:06:11.490> teleporter<00:06:12.090> one<00:06:12.270> makes<00:06:12.690> us<00:06:12.930> want

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
we had so teleporter one makes us want

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.400 
we had so teleporter one makes us want
to<00:06:13.200> jump<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.620> teleport<00:06:14.160> or<00:06:14.280> two<00:06:14.840> so<00:06:15.840> the

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
to jump to teleport or two so the

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.500 
to jump to teleport or two so the
position<00:06:16.830> for<00:06:16.950> teleporter<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.610> is<00:06:17.850> 288<00:06:19.490> 192

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
position for teleporter to is 288 192

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.070 
position for teleporter to is 288 192
okay<00:06:22.430> through<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.520> teleporter<00:06:23.820> to<00:06:24.270> it's<00:06:24.630> the

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
okay through the teleporter to it's the

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.590 
okay through the teleporter to it's the
other<00:06:25.169> way<00:06:25.350> around<00:06:25.380> so<00:06:25.919> we<00:06:26.040> do<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:26.220> other

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
other way around so we do the other

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:35.900 
other way around so we do the other
coordinates<00:06:27.600> which<00:06:27.780> is<00:06:27.990> 384<00:06:30.680> 2416<00:06:32.510> okay

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.900 

so<00:06:36.600> here's<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.230> room<00:06:37.470> let<00:06:38.280> me<00:06:38.340> just<00:06:38.490> reput<00:06:38.790> the

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
so here's the room let me just reput the

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.550 
so here's the room let me just reput the
character<00:06:39.300> otherwise<00:06:39.540> it<00:06:39.720> looks<00:06:39.750> retarded<00:06:40.170> if

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
character otherwise it looks retarded if

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.520 
character otherwise it looks retarded if
I<00:06:40.680> don't<00:06:41.600> okay<00:06:42.600> and<00:06:42.840> then<00:06:43.200> um<00:06:44.720> let<00:06:45.720> let<00:06:46.230> me<00:06:46.350> run

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
I don't okay and then um let let me run

going to be do it on I guess keys which
is<00:07:34.710> similar<00:07:34.890> to<00:07:35.160> buttons<00:07:35.580> but<00:07:36.620> you<00:07:37.620> can<00:07:37.800> have<00:07:37.950> a
