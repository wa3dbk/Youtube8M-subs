00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.700
 Hello everybody, I'm getting Mario today. 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.310
 here in Belmiro village 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.109
 It's much better than an expert on 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.490
 brackets for transporting bicycles and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.850
 Today he will explain to us a little 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.900
 on the mario coupling model than 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.400
 treats 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.529
 as this is a support for 12 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.000
 bicycles first you have to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.130
 have a hitch in the car 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
 this cat has to be in agreement with the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.340
 Pedro was loading after the place of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.070
 spoken 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.879
 you will put the support is a support 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.280
 in simple only with the pressure of itself 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 body is already installed and is well 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.530
 practical, right? 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 there the first care that people 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.370
 recommends taking that onboard iraty not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 is spinning 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.129
 In this case, here it is turning into a pj. 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.719
 Turning, we actually let it go. 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.550
 also to show that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.590
 this type of movement is a test in which 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.260
 be done and can not have any kind of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.260
 rotation that shows that it is not OK 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.200
 This part of the hitch itself is tight. 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.080
 is tightening the ball of the angle bracket 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.049
 has a movement that exists in it two 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.820
 formations you can as you turn the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.740
 to better visualize the people 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.990
 may be changing that for a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.790
 grip better then if your world from above 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.070
 mail product to the other is more 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.380
 pressure still with an expression that I used 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.960
 this a smaller ball or it can serve 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.270
 a small difference in diameter or 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.430
 some wear one - piece for you 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.939
 really is leaning firmly and not 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.890
 in expenses does not remain unresolved if we 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.020
 If the ball is not increased, the pressure increases 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.590
 we can already count said Clevers beauty 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.070
 do not put we have already put the first 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.409
 bicycle with these strips of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.720
 rubber and now let's put the second 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.189
 always remembering that when it comes to putting 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.469
 the 50's on the stand 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.719
 you may be moving your 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.950
 in accordance with the geometry of the 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.329
 picture as we do now here 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.879
 at the time of placing other information 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.170
 important is that a handlebar has to be 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.000
 to each side 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.120
 so you can ride the bike 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.120
 on one 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:28.650
 Then it 's settled, just learn the strips. 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:31.470
 rubber and do not forget to pass right 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.300
 tape is very important to join the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.550
 bicycles so that they do not get 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.010
 bottom 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.520
 Look at this rubber question I found well 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.900
 cool 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.270
 So that means here is not a 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.640
 fixed position is in accordance with the 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.920
 of the frame may be that the attachment is 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.590
 here or below according to the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.870
 frame geometry this is what you have 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.240
 For you are playing with the opposition to 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.430
 infinite number of net positions 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.340
 playing exactly in the face of great 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.290
 Most pictures of you plant Mario 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.000
 even without having a car here in our 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.220
 demonstration you can see that this here 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.030
 will cover the board and the lanterns as is 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.040
 that is 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.690
 today essential for you to have no 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 type of problem carrying the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.320
 bikes on the hitch put a board 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.540
 of lights 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.430
 this one exactly what this 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.980
 accessory is the recommended folds in the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.550
 own bike holder and then 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.209
 You will put a second 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.760
 plate of the vehicle and connected to the jack on 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.560
 car hitch there you might be going 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.989
 traveling and taking your equipment with you 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.480
 safety within and within the

 and the lyrics, that 's what you do not have 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.290

 You're everything, everything just right. Social 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.970
 pedal 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.580
 Thank you to the brigade, so this tip is 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.650
 to ip of the leiria in the time of transporting the 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.260

 Hello 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:12.530
 that ball that the company charges company 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:19.709
 always the ball ball coffee company 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:24.049
 they will equal the ball equivalent 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.049
 fat lap only then
