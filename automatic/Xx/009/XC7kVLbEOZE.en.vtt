00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
going but each essay is so precise that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.549 
going but each essay is so precise that
they<00:00:44.219> don't<00:00:44.430> read<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:45.960> aimless

difficult thing to do and it's a thing

powerful ways he applies this is looking

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.080 
powerful ways he applies this is looking
at<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.859> relationship<00:03:25.519> for<00:03:25.700> instance

at just a relationship for instance

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.270 
at just a relationship for instance

illusion that he hated America that's an

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.570 
illusion that he hated America that's an
interesting<00:05:17.620> thing<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:18.069> think<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:18.430> this

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
interesting thing I think in this

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.430 
interesting thing I think in this
collection<00:05:18.970> is<00:05:19.419> it<00:05:19.599> he<00:05:19.870> says<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.050> couple<00:05:20.380> of

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
collection is it he says a couple of

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.279 
collection is it he says a couple of
times<00:05:20.650> that<00:05:20.979> leaving<00:05:21.759> America<00:05:22.060> did<00:05:22.780> not<00:05:22.960> give

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
times that leaving America did not give

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.589 
times that leaving America did not give
him<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.500> great<00:05:23.830> clarity<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.610> understanding

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
him the great clarity and understanding

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.779 
him the great clarity and understanding
that<00:05:25.780> he<00:05:25.990> hoped<00:05:26.409> that<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.740> would<00:05:26.949> but<00:05:27.610> in

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
that he hoped that it would but in

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.790 
that he hoped that it would but in
another<00:05:27.909> sense<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.720> really<00:05:28.960> did<00:05:29.320> give<00:05:29.560> him

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
another sense it really did give him

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.339 
another sense it really did give him
some<00:05:30.130> perspective<00:05:30.759> on<00:05:31.150> his<00:05:31.780> American

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
some perspective on his American

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.430 
some perspective on his American
identity<00:05:33.039> and<00:05:33.280> especially<00:05:33.610> race<00:05:34.449> in<00:05:34.780> America

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
identity and especially race in America

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.129 
identity and especially race in America
and<00:05:35.699> eventually<00:05:36.699> it<00:05:36.880> led<00:05:37.150> him<00:05:37.360> back<00:05:37.719> to<00:05:38.050> the

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
and eventually it led him back to the

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.839 
and eventually it led him back to the
United<00:05:38.440> States<00:05:38.500> he<00:05:39.159> talks<00:05:39.400> about<00:05:39.520> his<00:05:39.820> life

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
it's really interesting to see them all

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.369 
it's really interesting to see them all
wrestling<00:06:22.250> with<00:06:22.430> these<00:06:22.610> same<00:06:22.940> ideas<00:06:23.210> and<00:06:23.870> yet

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379 
wrestling with these same ideas and yet

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.830 
wrestling with these same ideas and yet
not<00:06:24.620> necessarily<00:06:25.340> reaching<00:06:25.849> any<00:06:26.120> conclusions

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
the same conclusions he makes the point

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.529 
the same conclusions he makes the point
especially<00:06:31.340> with<00:06:31.729> Richard<00:06:32.060> right<00:06:32.240> but<00:06:32.479> I

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
especially with Richard right but I

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.629 
especially with Richard right but I
think<00:06:32.780> it<00:06:32.900> can<00:06:33.020> apply<00:06:33.259> more<00:06:33.530> broadly<00:06:33.560> but<00:06:34.460> he

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
think it can apply more broadly but he

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.330 
think it can apply more broadly but he
is<00:06:34.759> exiled<00:06:35.210> both<00:06:35.539> from<00:06:35.900> America<00:06:36.590> and<00:06:36.889> from

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.990 
just find James Baldwin's ideas on those
things<00:07:09.099> fascinating<00:07:10.129> he<00:07:10.370> also<00:07:10.610> touches

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:16.069 
because an essay collection like this is

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.860 
because an essay collection like this is
made<00:07:16.310> up<00:07:16.490> of<00:07:16.669> things<00:07:16.879> that<00:07:17.150> were<00:07:17.240> published<00:07:17.659> in

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
magazines at the time it does have the

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.600 
magazines at the time it does have the
possibility<00:07:20.990> of<00:07:21.020> being<00:07:21.409> dated<00:07:21.680> but<00:07:22.310> I<00:07:22.370> would

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
possibility of being dated but I would

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.330 
possibility of being dated but I would
say<00:07:22.789> that<00:07:22.819> James<00:07:23.419> Baldwin<00:07:23.960> writes<00:07:24.289> so<00:07:25.039> well

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340
