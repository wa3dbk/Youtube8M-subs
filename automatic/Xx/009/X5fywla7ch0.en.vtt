program on online I said new land speed
record<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.760> applying<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.450> program<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
record it's applying for this program I

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.779 
record it's applying for this program I
couldn't<00:00:49.260> wait<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> part<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> us<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.579> how
