you've got a pillion on of course the
back<00:01:58.890> end<00:01:59.130> squats<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.520> bit<00:01:59.670> more<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
back end squats a bit more the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.910 
back end squats a bit more the
headlights<00:02:00.840> tend<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> point<00:02:01.320> upwards<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
headlights tend to point upwards so you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.010 
headlights tend to point upwards so you
can<00:02:02.070> adjust<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:02.880> yeah<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.659> features

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
can adjust it as well yeah the features

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.389 
can adjust it as well yeah the features
a<00:02:04.049> lot<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.320> other<00:02:04.469> bikes<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:04.979> well<00:02:05.159> but

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
a lot of other bikes have as well but

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.020 
a lot of other bikes have as well but
not<00:02:06.000> many<00:02:06.210> bikes<00:02:06.560> under<00:02:07.560> 15<00:02:07.920> green<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.819> all

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
not many bikes under 15 green have all

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.210 
not many bikes under 15 green have all
this<00:02:09.379> now<00:02:10.379> there's<00:02:10.590> lots<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.800> room<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
this now there's lots of room for the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.490 
this now there's lots of room for the
writer<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> pillion<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.450> tracer

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
writer and pillion on the tracer

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.960 
writer and pillion on the tracer
and<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.770> writer<00:02:13.980> gets<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> two<00:02:14.460> position

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970

and the writer gets a two position
adjustable<00:02:15.390> seat<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.590> don't<00:02:16.740> find<00:02:16.890> yourself

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
adjustable seat you don't find yourself

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.430 
adjustable seat you don't find yourself
forced<00:02:17.610> forward<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> lot<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.080> bikes<00:02:19.290> that

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
forced forward like a lot of bikes that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.790 
forced forward like a lot of bikes that
have<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.800> skip<00:02:20.190> pillion<00:02:20.760> seat<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.900> that's<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
have that skip pillion seat and that's a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.890 
have that skip pillion seat and that's a
real<00:02:22.950> benefit<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:23.850> what<00:02:24.300> that's<00:02:24.420> also<00:02:24.750> done

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
real benefit now what that's also done

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930 
real benefit now what that's also done
is<00:02:25.020> push<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.770> pillion<00:02:25.950> back<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.640> this

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
is push the pillion back of it and this

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.700 
is push the pillion back of it and this
all<00:02:27.120> depends<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.630> how<00:02:28.230> much<00:02:28.380> weight<00:02:28.560> you've

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
all depends on how much weight you've

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.560 
all depends on how much weight you've
got<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> back<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.310> course<00:02:29.460> but<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.390> does

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
got on the back of course but it does

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.930 
got on the back of course but it does
tend<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.959> affect<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> rear<00:02:32.160> shock<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.640> how

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
tend to affect the rear shock in how

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.300 
tend to affect the rear shock in how
that<00:02:33.000> performs<00:02:33.630> now<00:02:34.320> Yamaha<00:02:34.770> set<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.100> bike

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that performs now Yamaha set this bike

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.670 
that performs now Yamaha set this bike
up<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.550> be<00:02:35.730> fairly<00:02:35.970> plush<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.200> doesn't

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
up to be fairly plush and it doesn't

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.770 
up to be fairly plush and it doesn't
have<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> lot<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.310> adjustability<00:02:38.490> as<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.540> said

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
have a lot of adjustability as I said

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.550 
have a lot of adjustability as I said
but<00:02:41.120> overall<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.330> works<00:02:42.420> quite<00:02:42.780> well<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
but overall it works quite well but you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.010 
but overall it works quite well but you
will<00:02:43.740> find<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.250> sometimes<00:02:44.970> once<00:02:45.780> again

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
will find that sometimes once again

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.290 
will find that sometimes once again
depending<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.410> weight<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:47.670> might<00:02:47.970> affect

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
depending on the weight it might affect

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.730 
depending on the weight it might affect
it<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.630> rough<00:02:49.170> conditions

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.880 

we<00:02:57.740> know<00:02:57.950> what<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.540> reckon<00:02:59.540> Yamaha<00:03:00.050> has<00:03:00.410> got<00:03:00.740> a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
cracking black with the tracer it sort

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.150 
cracking black with the tracer it sort
of<00:03:04.160> reminds<00:03:04.730> me<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.990> XK<00:03:06.290> 900<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:06.890> might<00:03:07.040> as
