00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.440
 good in this video I bring you in what 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:12.040
 are three very good keyboards for what 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:16.359
 is good android not starting the 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.520
 first would be the debut that this is in 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.510
 pro and the link is institution of the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.510
 could we will 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.820
 and this we need to accept 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.620
 then here he tells us to choose a 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:39.640
 language 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.640
 how to choose or not 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.680
 perhaps it is Spanish 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.190
 and we hope the download this something very 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.190
 Quick 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:02.980
 well now let's activate the pipeline 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.980
 how they touch 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.710
 and here we are going to activate 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.200
 how will you accept 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.300
 and then today in back 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.250
 now before set as entry 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.290
 we click 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.900
 and we activate it 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.530
 and then to fall and then we'll go to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.380
 partner and the flow is to be able to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.990
 using the finger 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.159
 You can go let's call it a 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.159
 text application 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.120
 how come here is 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.120
 it also has a keyboard 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.910
 with predictions 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.920
 and average self correction for example 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.230
 I had pressed here we can see the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.220
 different for example 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:07.010
 the example of more adjustments we see when 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.009
 the interpreter keyboard with thumbs 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.049
 well observe 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.569
 because we will not come here playing the 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.480
 part of the middle when studied 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.099
 then good then they are very good 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.060
 keyboard and let's see us directly 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.250
 with the following 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.580
 well the next clear that we can 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.180
 show that google keyboard 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.120
 some since it tells us this this 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.340
 first is to enable what we have to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.850
 sends us as well as the other here the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.890
 enabled in this then the next 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.010
 step in both 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.750
 we have alternate to the input method and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.120
 we select what is the last 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.769
 keyboard and here we give in ready 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.610
 then we can open again the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.610
 application of notes 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.560
 and as you can see here is an interface 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.739
 very good 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.500
 and for example to the bootcamp that we can 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.780
 change everything to this huge issues because 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.160
 this is the original we can not modify 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.160
 the issues but that one 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.239
 and how it's pretty good 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.239
 have also to realize our 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.540
 watch good back 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.500
 to everyone and the next one that can 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.050
 show your life 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.860
 he is the one of hayward 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.860
 to see us 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.170
 since it is not loading we give it 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.709
 okay 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.709
 okay 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.480
 here may be the stay 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.100
 and well let's start we give the touch 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.170
 to be 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.130
 this was in the play store the others 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.460
 two i'm going to leave 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.240
 in this is the video and we give to 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.240
 order caigua 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.700
 in the selected note that is the 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.590
 first and then here in case we can 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.380
 personalize 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:25.010
 those of sound good the precisions 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.510
 well let's give it back 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.510
 in the room where it's free 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.010
 we do not know in the text application 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.699
 creating times 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.699
 I do not know 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.800
 can not observe here is 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.370
 on the other hand it is not very good 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.370
 no precision 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.569
 and I recommend that you download it 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.069
 and we do not know until the next but that 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.069
 you liked it and goodbye
