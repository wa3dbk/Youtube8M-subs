00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
width and we're going to use our rolling

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.990 
width and we're going to use our rolling
pin<00:02:26.160> we're<00:02:27.160> going<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.310> roll<00:02:27.460> this<00:02:27.520> into<00:02:27.850> a

pin we're going to roll this into a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.240 
pin we're going to roll this into a
rectangle<00:02:28.630> all<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:28.870> while<00:02:29.620> I'm<00:02:29.800> working<00:02:29.980> on

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
rectangle all right while I'm working on

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.800 
rectangle all right while I'm working on
the<00:02:30.370> dough<00:02:30.520> I've<00:02:30.820> set<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.450> oven<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.690> preheat

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the dough I've set the oven to preheat

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.740 
the dough I've set the oven to preheat
on<00:02:32.490> 390<00:02:33.490> degrees<00:02:33.610> Fahrenheit<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.570> going

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
on 390 degrees Fahrenheit this is going

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750 
on 390 degrees Fahrenheit this is going
to<00:02:34.810> be<00:02:34.930> pretty<00:02:35.260> hot<00:02:35.470> pretty<00:02:35.740> fast<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.610> going

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
to be pretty hot pretty fast it's going

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.840 
to be pretty hot pretty fast it's going
to<00:02:36.850> go<00:02:37.000> for<00:02:37.270> around<00:02:37.420> twenty-five<00:02:37.930> minutes<00:02:38.290> and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
to go for around twenty-five minutes and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.040 
to go for around twenty-five minutes and
at<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.030> point<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.420> want<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.690> check<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.960> to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
at that point you want to check it to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.330 
at that point you want to check it to
see<00:02:41.080> if<00:02:41.230> they're<00:02:41.380> crispy<00:02:41.860> enough<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.280> you

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
see if they're crispy enough for you

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.160 
see if they're crispy enough for you
okay<00:02:42.580> my<00:02:42.760> kids<00:02:42.820> tend<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.690> more<00:02:43.720> crisp

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
okay my kids tend to like it more crisp

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.740 
okay my kids tend to like it more crisp
so<00:02:44.770> we<00:02:44.950> go<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> little<00:02:45.640> bit<00:02:45.910> longer<00:02:46.270> than<00:02:46.600> that

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
so we go a little bit longer than that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.900 
so we go a little bit longer than that
but<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.230> average<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.800> about<00:02:47.920> 25<00:02:48.430> minutes<00:02:48.670> on

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
but the average is about 25 minutes on

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.130 
but the average is about 25 minutes on
390<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.170> here<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.620> on<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> rectangle<00:02:52.140> coming

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
390 and here it is on a rectangle coming

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.840 
390 and here it is on a rectangle coming
out<00:02:53.260> here<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.950> want<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.220> get<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.520> thin

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
out here and you want to get it as thin

out here and you want to get it as thin
as<00:02:54.910> we<00:02:55.210> can<00:02:55.390> go<00:02:55.570> without<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.170> breaking<00:02:56.500> all

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
as we can go without it breaking all
