00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
need to do is add a little bit more of

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.270 
need to do is add a little bit more of
my<00:00:53.879> carrot<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.570> these<00:00:55.289> pieces<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.980> coarse

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
my carrot and these pieces can be coarse

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.369 
my carrot and these pieces can be coarse
we're<00:00:56.579> actually<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.300> puree<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.109> dish

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
we're actually going to puree this dish

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
we're actually going to puree this dish
so<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.800> doesn't<00:00:59.100> matter<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> pieces

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so it doesn't matter what the pieces

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.750 
so it doesn't matter what the pieces
look<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:01.350> sizes<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.579> just

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
look like what sizes they are you just

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.789 
look like what sizes they are you just
want<00:01:02.940> them<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.300> small<00:01:03.690> enough<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
want them to be small enough so that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.190 
want them to be small enough so that
they<00:01:05.430> cook<00:01:05.670> through<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> thick

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
they cook through so if you have a thick

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.109 
they cook through so if you have a thick
big<00:01:07.619> piece<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> cut<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
big piece like this you want to cut it

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.660 
big piece like this you want to cut it
thin<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.540> thinner<00:01:10.049> piece<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
thin a thinner piece like this you can

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.340 
thin a thinner piece like this you can
cut<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.090> little<00:01:12.270> bit<00:01:12.420> different<00:01:12.750> size<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
cut it a little bit different size and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.080 
cut it a little bit different size and
then<00:01:13.560> eventually<00:01:13.830> they'll<00:01:14.159> cook<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:14.970> much

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
then eventually they'll cook pretty much

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.960 
then eventually they'll cook pretty much
at<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> same<00:01:15.330> rate<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.590> we'll<00:01:16.710> take<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.189> we

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
at the same rate so we'll take this we

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.640 
at the same rate so we'll take this we
will<00:01:18.150> cover<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.830> little<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.250> our<00:01:20.400> foil

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
will cover it a little bit with our foil

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.649 
will cover it a little bit with our foil
we<00:01:22.650> put<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:24.090> our<00:01:24.420> salt

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
we put a little bit of of our salt

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.999 
we put a little bit of of our salt
pepper<00:01:24.840> blend<00:01:25.080> probably<00:01:25.530> about<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> teaspoon

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
pepper blend probably about a teaspoon

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
pepper blend probably about a teaspoon
worth<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.610> our<00:01:26.700> salt<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:26.939> pepper<00:01:27.119> blend<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
worth of our salt and pepper blend and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.999 
worth of our salt and pepper blend and
then<00:01:27.990> we've<00:01:28.140> drizzled<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> little

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
then we've drizzled with just a little

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.770 
then we've drizzled with just a little
bit<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> olive<00:01:29.400> oil<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.790> teaspoon<00:01:30.030> worth<00:01:30.450> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
bit of olive oil a teaspoon worth so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
bit of olive oil a teaspoon worth so
that<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> vegetables<00:01:31.770> don't<00:01:31.979> stick<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that the vegetables don't stick to the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.520 
that the vegetables don't stick to the
foil<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.420> take<00:01:33.540> those<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.840> easily<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
foil and we can take those out easily so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
foil and we can take those out easily so
