00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
for like 15 bucks which was a really

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.770 
for like 15 bucks which was a really
really<00:01:22.619> good<00:01:22.830> deal<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.850> um<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.240> did<00:01:24.450> go<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
really good deal but um I did go with a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.219 
really good deal but um I did go with a
matte<00:01:25.080> finish<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.740> once<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.640> order<00:01:26.850> your

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
matte finish because once you order your

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.840 
matte finish because once you order your
skin<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.590> actually<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.460> glossy

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
skin you can actually get it in a glossy

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.210 
skin you can actually get it in a glossy
finish<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> matte<00:01:31.110> finish<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.650> decided<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> go

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
finish or a matte finish I decided to go

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.800 
finish or a matte finish I decided to go
with<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> matte<00:01:32.939> finish<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> looks

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
with the matte finish because it looks

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.200 
with the matte finish because it looks
much<00:01:34.049> better<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.030> is
