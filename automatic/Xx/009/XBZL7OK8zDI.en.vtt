come<00:03:35.129> back<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:35.459> here<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.000> top<00:03:36.209> now<00:03:36.419> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
come back over here to the top now the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.330 
come back over here to the top now the
worst<00:03:36.720> thing<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.019> can<00:03:37.200> do<00:03:37.349> is<00:03:37.680> make<00:03:37.919> this<00:03:38.099> too

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
worst thing you can do is make this too

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.500 
worst thing you can do is make this too
tight<00:03:38.549> because<00:03:38.699> that's<00:03:38.940> gonna<00:03:39.030> make<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.269> too

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
tight because that's gonna make it too

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.900 
tight because that's gonna make it too
difficult<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:40.109> take<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.500> on<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.829> off<00:03:40.980> I'm<00:03:41.250> just

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
difficult to take it on and off I'm just

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.280 
difficult to take it on and off I'm just
creasing<00:03:42.389> it<00:03:42.510> with<00:03:42.660> my<00:03:42.840> thumbs

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
did the top I am using the stamp set tea

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.520 
did the top I am using the stamp set tea
shop<00:03:59.459> which<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.510> absolutely<00:04:00.870> love<00:04:01.199> you<00:04:01.349> can

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
Calypso coral and Primrose petals so I

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.089 
Calypso coral and Primrose petals so I
found<00:04:15.900> by<00:04:16.049> using<00:04:16.289> both<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.650> them<00:04:16.889> together

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
found by using both of them together

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.000 
found by using both of them together
that<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:17.489> get

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
that I get

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.980 
that I get
nice<00:04:18.370> combination<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:19.300> the<00:04:19.420> colors<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:19.780> are

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:19.990 
nice combination of the colors that are

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.290 
nice combination of the colors that are
in<00:04:20.110> here<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:20.950> I'm<00:04:21.100> actually<00:04:21.310> going<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:21.880> stamp

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
in here so I'm actually going to stamp

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.750 
in here so I'm actually going to stamp
this<00:04:22.600> image<00:04:22.990> twice<00:04:23.400> once<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:24.670> each<00:04:25.000> color<00:04:26.760> this

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
this image twice once in each color this

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:41.990 
this image twice once in each color this
is<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.180> coral<00:04:31.260> okay<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:36.690> rose<00:04:37.690> petals<00:04:40.860> well

of course now that you're watching them

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.130 
of course now that you're watching them
and<00:04:44.230> come<00:04:44.380> out<00:04:44.500> perfect

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
and come out perfect

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
inside here I'd love to use my punches

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.090 
inside here I'd love to use my punches
upside<00:04:52.840> down<00:04:52.990> so<00:04:53.200> I<00:04:53.260> can<00:04:53.440> see<00:04:53.590> exactly<00:04:53.620> where

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
upside down so I can see exactly where

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.950 
upside down so I can see exactly where
you<00:04:54.370> going

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
you going

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.110 
you going
the<00:04:55.960> next<00:04:56.320> is<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.710> scalloped<00:04:57.160> oval<00:04:59.910> see<00:05:00.910> how<00:05:01.090> I

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
the next is the scalloped oval see how I

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.350 
the next is the scalloped oval see how I
have<00:05:01.360> a<00:05:01.390> little<00:05:01.570> bit<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:01.810> imperfection<00:05:02.470> there

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
have a little bit of imperfection there

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.200 
have a little bit of imperfection there
it's<00:05:04.360> okay<00:05:04.600> this<00:05:04.780> is<00:05:04.930> just<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.260> sample<00:05:05.650> for<00:05:05.890> you

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
it's okay this is just a sample for you

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.790 
it's okay this is just a sample for you
then<00:05:07.210> last<00:05:07.480> but<00:05:07.600> not<00:05:07.720> least<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.290> used<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.590> piece

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
then last but not least I used a piece

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.670 
then last but not least I used a piece
of<00:05:08.830> Sahara<00:05:09.340> sand<00:05:09.700> cardstock<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:10.630> the<00:05:11.260> extra

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
of Sahara sand cardstock and the extra

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.230 
of Sahara sand cardstock and the extra
large<00:05:11.830> oval<00:05:12.340> punch<00:05:12.520> for<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.270> background<00:05:15.240> what

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
large oval punch for the background what

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.700 
large oval punch for the background what
I<00:05:16.270> did<00:05:16.480> is<00:05:16.600> I<00:05:16.720> did<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:16.930> lot<00:05:17.110> of<00:05:17.140> dimensionals

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
I did is I did a lot of dimensionals

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.210 
I did is I did a lot of dimensionals
here<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.950> create<00:05:18.160> some<00:05:18.400> depth<00:05:18.640> I<00:05:19.320> put<00:05:20.320> two

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
here to create some depth I put two

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.640 
here to create some depth I put two
dimensionals<00:05:21.790> here<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.720> I've<00:05:23.260> talked<00:05:23.470> to<00:05:23.560> you

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
dimensionals here and I've talked to you

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.690 
dimensionals here and I've talked to you
about<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:23.860> before<00:05:24.040> I<00:05:24.280> like<00:05:24.520> the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
about this before I like the

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.610 
about this before I like the
dimensionals<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.420> be<00:05:25.510> balanced<00:05:26.080> so<00:05:26.230> make<00:05:26.500> sure

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
dimensionals to be balanced so make sure

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.380 
dimensionals to be balanced so make sure
that<00:05:26.740> you<00:05:26.890> put<00:05:27.100> two<00:05:27.280> on<00:05:27.310> an<00:05:27.550> area<00:05:27.880> that's<00:05:28.030> large

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
that you put two on an area that's large

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:36.390 
that you put two on an area that's large
and<00:05:28.780> then<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.620> used<00:05:29.800> two<00:05:30.220> more<00:05:30.460> here<00:05:34.560> to<00:05:35.560> go
