00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.269
 hi guys i just damaris smart leader 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.219
 fit of viana farm and I'm here today 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 together with 10 to show some 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.630
 exercises for you psychics 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.090
 first exercise is the thread 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 direct to exercise we go 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.560
 use a comfortable weight slit 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.090
 parallel feet may be to flex the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.609
 knee a little and always keeping the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.009
 posture and straight spine you will climb the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.899
 bar towards the chest two seconds 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.370
 to go up and two seconds to go down 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.879
 also in a hurry 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.450
 calm in the movement grows slowly 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.180
 Perfect Art 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.789
 this exercise directly threads a variation 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.500
 with the same principle the thread 21 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.670
 we are going to share the same exercise in 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.020
 three portions 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.300
 You will perform the first move. 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.910
 from the height of your thigh to the height of your 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.050
 elbow doing seven repetitions with the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 same weight 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.309
 at the end of the seventh repetition you will 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.410
 stop at elbow height leading to 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.620
 bar to chest height but seven 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.620
 movements 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.100
 completing the complete 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.170
 the thigh and slowly go up to the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 height of your chest also completing 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 seven more repetitions forming the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 thread 21 next suggestion like 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.540
 alternating with palm always hand 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.900
 facing forward parallel elbows 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.900
 to your trunk you will raise an arm and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.189
 then the other two seconds on the climb 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.509
 in seconds in the decision 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.740
 if you want to leave the workout yet 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.270
 more complex 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.850
 you can also vary this exercise 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.380
 for 'thread' alternating with wrist twist 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 The principle is the same, but you 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 adds on the rise the wrist turn 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 thus leaving the angle of movement 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.540
 more complex taking a little more 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.890
 also on the head beyond the perfect biceps 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.079
 continuing our training 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.170
 our next suggestion of exercise is 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.600
 rice and straight with rope in the crosse you 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.729
 will keep the posture a little inclined 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.409
 back flexing a little your 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.170
 and keeping the elbow aligned to the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.869
 height of the trunk under the weight 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.299
 direction 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.610
 its achievement and 10 stretching the maximum that 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.049
 you get your elbow working 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.849
 In this regulation you can pick up 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.370
 both the long head and the 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.290
 short head of biceps varying angle 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.599
 taking a step back a little 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.640
 You can also 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.489
 elbows and work a little more 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.440
 long head flexing elbow and 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.110
 lengthening remembering the fact maintain 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.670
 contracted abdomen and elbow posture 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.670
 with the least movement possible 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.329
 perfect and continuing with variations 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.420
 biceps exercise we're going to do 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.170
 now the unilateral thread finishes high 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.299
 in the next 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.150
 you can use a unilateral handle 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.530
 of any color or nationality 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.390
 always remembering that the police should 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.129
 stand tall 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.739
 You will use your facing palm. 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.510
 straight up elbow and bring the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.000
 weight toward your shoulder 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.870
 always keeping the posture erect and 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.519
 perfect contracted abdomen 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.120
 always remembering to run the two 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.120
 games 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.230
 an evaluation of the movement is the same 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.750
 position however from the front you go 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.610
 bring weight toward your chest 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.780
 keeping the elbow aligned in the direction 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.909
 of your shoulder 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.040
 always remembering that changing the 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.810
 motion angle variations you 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.549
 manages to work both the long head 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.590
 with the head also commitment with 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.329
 do not hesitate to ask one of the teachers 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.519
 in room they are always in t - shirt 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.409
 Yellow liked the video sharing in 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.409
