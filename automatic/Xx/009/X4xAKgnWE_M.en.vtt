00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.920
 about 500 thousand and 750 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.140
 wanted people who produced a more maria antonieta style 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.340
 some curiosities that attracted a lot of attention from the public 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.390
 I was a month and twenty pounds 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.260
 and that it was pointed in the body 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.430
 and who is a strange country is that many women could move 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.859
 with so much good time but it is an area man dress 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.850
 a queen consider it clear that one can not forget 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.620
 and it is spring trade clothing but took from the period that can not 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:30.290
 be 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.190
 composing the collection of the exhibition were also made 30 custom dolls 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.630
 especially to compose this period from 1650 to less than five years 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.590
 so it's good to know a bit of luck 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.100
 this fashion story 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.300

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.810
 like fashion 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.540
 for example 200 years we can not forget the 20th century 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.779
 so for this I am certain if we follow that compose this period 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.129
 we start talking about the game the designers have done 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.030
 the success 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.629
 as in the same year before 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.199

 at the time their defense was armed 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.769

 The French but here 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.529
 a substitute agent Maria 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.449
 has a great hand fetish 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.240
 love leaves the period of 1927 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.879
 give few amal 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.859
 it was a major breakthrough in the little black 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.409
 that portrayed 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.229
 a period less than the fashion was not wearing a jacket 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.269
