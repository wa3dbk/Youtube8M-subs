00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.339
 relatively short video is maximum 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.080
 four minutes or so does not take long 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.929
 and that's what I really wanted 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.420
 Just ask if you have a let's play of 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.430
 super mario from new super mario bros you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 I do not want to see that is not blind 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.720
 the game just a few hours ago 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.100
 not played out to 100 percent or 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 so just played by 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.359
 and I wanted to ask you if you it 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.220
 want to see let 's play alone 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.579
 background So here in the video you see 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.140
 Just me and Thomas like us a few 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.760
 have made challenges 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.050
 most of that, I think so 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.730
 I think I was one two three 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.899
 four five six challenge me 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.309
 I think he did three of them 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.940
 made me or so anyway the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.370
 question that is beyond 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.100
 Do you want to see an added player of 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.649
 even if we have to assume that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.780
 I'm not the best super mario player 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.489
 I'm really not in the game 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 So good, I'll wait for that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.729
 first 20 are the first four worlds 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.780
 no problem and then from the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.820
 Fifth world is somehow 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 harder for me to level for a few 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.509
 so need the three four attempts 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.030
 at least if not more 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.939
 and I see myself from time to time 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.790
 I'll probably be upset , too 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.130
 try to avoid it but it will 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.500
 most likely happen and before 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.360
 above all else, that means that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.590
 I'm probably not 100 percent 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.180
 I will do any of the super 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 Mario plays always wants 100 percent 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 do not care if it is now at mario 64 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.420
 or galaxy or water light i will 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.189
 probably do not make 100 percent 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.750
 because you would have to be in each level and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.439
 how to collect three coins and then still 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 The starwood make star red star road 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.759
 like that and I do not think so 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.440
 Now that would be so much fun if I had 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.300
 I'm angry 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.530
 the singer I do thought 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.909
 just like that and yes that was actually 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.830
 my question by and large of biu 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.500
 that's still true 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.340
 fun with a stick hard meanwhile 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.100
 I already did that, I think so 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.950
 within two hours in total 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.200
 three survivors lost me 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.150
 a little sad the difficult one at 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.709
 Just play if you have too many 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.989
 You still have zombies on your ass 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.069
 not come because you can always 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.280
 do not sprint and then pick them up 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.110
 one and then you are in the ass because 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.340
 then they tear you apart like little ones 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.410
 fan this is really evil so that's real 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.050
 mean and nasty and I found it really hard 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.680
 I have to say real 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.450
 but well, I would say that's it 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.440
 then again 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.880
 and yes you can me in the comments 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.790
 Write what you think of the idea 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.680
 and if you see anything else 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.209
 I want a few wishes 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.829
 express because slowly so I'm the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.670
 last ideas except me i have 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.160
 actually only black ops 2 the rest 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.870
 I already finished recording 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.829
 far cry 3 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.600
 I already finished that 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.890
 and yes, well zombie I do now and 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.870
 that 's about it you can do 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.450
 quietly express a few ideas if the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.780
 have fun and I would say that 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.940
 until then it was pure 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.940
 adiÃ³s until then 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.120
 come
