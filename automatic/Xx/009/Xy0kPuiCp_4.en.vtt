to<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.300> next<00:01:25.780> corner<00:01:26.140> right<00:01:26.440> there<00:01:28.320> okay<00:01:29.320> so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
to the next corner right there okay so

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.430 
to the next corner right there okay so
it<00:01:30.009> looks<00:01:30.040> like<00:01:30.280> this<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.960> just<00:01:32.140> use<00:01:32.350> the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
it looks like this and you just use the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.389 
it looks like this and you just use the
very<00:01:32.680> same<00:01:32.979> thing<00:01:33.280> all<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.640> way<00:01:33.910> around<00:01:34.119> until

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
very same thing all the way around until

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.639 
very same thing all the way around until
you<00:01:36.399> get<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.759> end<00:01:36.940> which<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.080> only<00:01:38.290> four

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
you get to the end which is only four

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.800 
you get to the end which is only four
corners<00:01:39.040> so<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.460> doesn't<00:01:39.790> take<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:39.970> long<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
corners so it doesn't take that long and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.800 
corners so it doesn't take that long and
then<00:01:43.930> once<00:01:44.110> you're<00:01:44.290> all<00:01:44.440> done<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.479> tie

then once you're all done you just tie

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.320 
then once you're all done you just tie
it<00:01:46.840> off<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.910> stuff<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.610> they're<00:01:51.850> on<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.000> last

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
it off and stuff so they're on the last

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.340
