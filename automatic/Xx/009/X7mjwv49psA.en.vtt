stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique

stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
that allows us to precisely deliver a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.600

to remove the brain metastases if that
can<00:01:01.719> be<00:01:01.750> done<00:01:01.989> safely<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:03.250> that<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:04.059> often

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
can be done safely and that is often

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.760 
can be done safely and that is often
followed<00:01:04.690> by<00:01:05.250> radiation<00:01:06.299> therapy<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:08.530> with

intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery
in<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:12.280> properly<00:01:12.850> selected<00:01:13.360> patients<00:01:13.750> we<00:01:14.619> are

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
in the properly selected patients we are

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.410 
in the properly selected patients we are
able<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:15.340> deliver<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.810> very<00:01:17.440> precise<00:01:18.180> burst<00:01:19.180> of

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
able to deliver a very precise burst of

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.859 
able to deliver a very precise burst of
radiation<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:20.979> area<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.850> metastasis<00:01:22.690> in

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
radiation to the area of metastasis in

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.440 
radiation to the area of metastasis in
the<00:01:22.990> brain<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:24.009> destroy<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.759> cancer<00:01:25.000> cells

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
the brain to destroy the cancer cells

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.340 
the brain to destroy the cancer cells
and<00:01:26.520> potentially

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and potentially

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.600 
and potentially
eliminate<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> need<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.450> surgery

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
eliminate the need to go for the surgery

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.120 
eliminate the need to go for the surgery
so<00:01:32.610> from<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> patient's<00:01:33.689> perspective<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.560> think

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
so from a patient's perspective I think

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
so from a patient's perspective I think
there<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.490> many<00:01:35.790> benefits<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
there are many benefits that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.740 
there are many benefits that
radiosurgery<00:01:37.259> provides<00:01:37.860> over<00:01:38.750> conventional

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
radiosurgery provides over conventional

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.219 
radiosurgery provides over conventional
or<00:01:40.140> traditional<00:01:40.170> open<00:01:41.009> surgery<00:01:41.899> first<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.110> all

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
or traditional open surgery first of all

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.070 
or traditional open surgery first of all
it<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:44.180> pain-free<00:01:45.440> essentially

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
it is pain-free essentially

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.620 
it is pain-free essentially
it<00:01:47.410> is<00:01:47.560> also<00:01:47.770> without<00:01:48.250> an<00:01:48.370> incision<00:01:48.940> so<00:01:49.330> really

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
it is also without an incision so really

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.980 
it is also without an incision so really
the<00:01:49.750> risk<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.140> infection<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:50.830> minimal<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.520> none

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the risk of infection is minimal to none

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.720 
the risk of infection is minimal to none
and<00:01:52.990> again<00:01:53.290> for<00:01:53.470> patients<00:01:53.890> who<00:01:53.980> are<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.130> other

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
and again for patients who are on other

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.000 
and again for patients who are on other
medications<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.690> are<00:01:55.750> needed<00:01:56.140> for<00:01:56.560> other

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
medications that are needed for other

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.970 
medications that are needed for other
medical<00:01:57.490> conditions<00:01:58.500> some<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.830> those

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
medical conditions some of those

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.800 
medical conditions some of those
medications<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.760> do<00:02:01.030> need<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.360> be<00:02:01.480> stopped

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
medications that do need to be stopped

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.170 
medications that do need to be stopped
for<00:02:02.320> open<00:02:02.380> surgery<00:02:02.920> do<00:02:03.490> not<00:02:03.700> need<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.090> be

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
able to go home the same day as the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.800 
able to go home the same day as the
treatment<00:02:17.940> whereas<00:02:18.940> compared<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.420> open

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
treatment whereas compared to open

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.020 
treatment whereas compared to open
surgery<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.470> lot<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.860> people<00:02:21.010> are<00:02:21.280> off<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.760> work

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
surgery a lot of people are off of work

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.500 
surgery a lot of people are off of work
two<00:02:22.900> four<00:02:23.500> six<00:02:23.530> eight<00:02:24.310> weeks<00:02:24.880> or<00:02:25.090> sometimes

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
two four six eight weeks or sometimes

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.620 
two four six eight weeks or sometimes
longer<00:02:25.810> with<00:02:26.770> radiosurgery<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:28.240> ask<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
longer with radiosurgery we ask the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.270 
longer with radiosurgery we ask the
patients<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.050> take<00:02:29.290> maybe<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.620> day<00:02:29.830> off<00:02:30.040> from

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
patients to take maybe a day off from

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.340 
patients to take maybe a day off from
work<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.850> next<00:02:31.000> day<00:02:31.209> but<00:02:31.930> then<00:02:32.080> they're<00:02:32.230> able

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
work the next day but then they're able

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.199 
work the next day but then they're able
to<00:02:32.500> go<00:02:32.650> back<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.980> work<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.310> second<00:02:33.670> day<00:02:33.760> after

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
to go back to work the second day after

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.500 
to go back to work the second day after
so<00:02:35.170> really<00:02:35.560> there's<00:02:36.070> minimal<00:02:36.510> interruption

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
so really there's minimal interruption

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.620 
so really there's minimal interruption
for<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.230> patients<00:02:38.800> other<00:02:39.550> important<00:02:40.209> aspects

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630
