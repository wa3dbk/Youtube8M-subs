00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.940
 Now in their screens phrase latch

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 Skype does not need malkov added and 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.690
 shorter here and so but now it will be 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.360
 slightly different contest from sponsor 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.149

 so 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.260
 Well, we change the background, but we changed the background perfectly and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.720
 reported I said winners can 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.300

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.120

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.920
 and Che there is still well everything is shorter, this is not fake 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.920
 Immediately talking about can see how 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.700
 competition from mr larissa let's 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.250

 our video is shorter very good shorter 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.800
 yes promotion is just a subset 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.410
 Sponsorship is not really effective it 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.460
 happens effectively when people 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.520
 interested in you for example now by 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.510

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.370
 you had apples and wait for the result in 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.520

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.530
 unknown but then in the comments I 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.910
