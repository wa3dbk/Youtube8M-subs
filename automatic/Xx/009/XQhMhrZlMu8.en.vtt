00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.459
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.010
 Another video of me is my name 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.140
 bond buy back to the keyboard and the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.340
 Here is a little info video because you 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.500
 you probably already asked 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 where i am staying i have since 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.270
 about a week not uploaded 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.800
 exactly one week started and is 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.290
 probably also I am 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 I do not mean sick mental 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.140
 Disease spread over decades 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.969
 hid no i was really flu 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.989
 and probably one more 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.100
 I'm still a bit agree 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.980
 therefore there was no reaper day 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 but I will hopefully now 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.520
 at the latest the day after tomorrow full again 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.690
 to be content 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 it was actually not such a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.020
 little that will come 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.620
 Of course on Monday the report second 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.540
 then hopefully receive the revolution 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.520
 more fingers pressed than you'll have 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:09.090
 I in the fourth part is a guide where 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.590
 row to end yes I will 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.509
 I hope I can manage 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.530
 started a few snippets too 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.759
 get and a bit 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.440
 then it's all about cutting it together 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.640
 easy to show like that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.430
 different from a broker 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.880
 work in the game 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.440
 and I hope I fix it, thank you 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.960
 me with you for the impatience of the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.970
 consuming antal green then had to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.330
 I try all the other videos 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.670
 to the storm I wanted to do in 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.080
 connection with the wiki then to the end 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.700
 do 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.900
 this whole theory may be 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.729
 maybe we get even a 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.500
 alphatier in connection with our 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.210
 partner network game loading not scheduled 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.229
 gamestar position is not always complete 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.479
 our partnerhops 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.340
 But that was the chance 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.680
 of course, was not great so far 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.159
 which in the end with the order 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.930
 raushaut like x 1 600 is still not so 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.490
 just frequent and not exactly good 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.470
 chances but we try our best 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.240
 to do 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.920
 otherwise I will probably 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.950
 someday because the days a video to la 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.110
 Cruz make two and two info video like 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.700
 it looks like the display looks like it 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.980
 I've imagined doing that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.569
 maybe a kind of preview because 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.400
 I will have to cancel 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.080
 I'm guaranteed this weekend 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.330
 gamble with a colleague 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 I never had to before a space-money 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.380
 because that's what in my eyes 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.800
 useless and dumbest is what I do 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.600
 can 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.040
 when ringing does not work for me 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.750
 i will be totally unhappy and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.980
 frustrated because i love people 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.770
 to explain things 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.870
 and if I contained reprints myself 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.610
 then I always liked to stand 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.950
 20 times from any cliff to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.540
 look if not what is yes and that 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.560
 just not how old does I play 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.480
 then want to show 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.880
 and when I try to die 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.500
 to go through I miss more than three 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.020
 A quarter of the game is not what I am 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.390
 like to play yourself one way or another 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.870
 stay in my hands despite play 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.600
 fei 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.090
 I think about my last let's play 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.200
 dark souls has worked great there 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.870
 the people were too much too 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.209
 that's why I'm going to work that up 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.470
 make the before preview like so 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.640
 some say whether worth the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.260
 ever to introduce 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.850
 I think I'm very helpful but 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.100
 instead of the comments 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.060
 as you imagine if I am that 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.230
 do it anyway or not 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.260
 Maybe you all have one already 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.790
 right review looked at with reports 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.530
 Gameplay scenes because I neither only 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.720
 View gameplay scenes from lexus 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.330
 can not yet be on the pc needs 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.950
 Unfortunately 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.840
 otherwise look forward to another account 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.730
 by nature and me in connection 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.800
 with there we are working on 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.590
 something if I have something else 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.730
 other cool big and i can only 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:51.950
 three i can only write the letters my 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:55.620
 wrong order l &amp; m throw the room 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.489
 that's it, then we try solid 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.350
 foundation 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.870
 there was something not working then stop 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.330
 not work because there is still work to 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.430
 otherwise the water will not wave us anymore 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.959
 to the small but fine of video me 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.310
 hope you like a bit of understanding 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.519
 said my voice still totally in the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.110
 bucket but what the hell and yes thanks to the 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.800
 attention until next time and 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.800
 whip
