posse<00:01:33.000> bugger<00:01:33.330> patterns<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.960> usually<00:01:34.350> tie<00:01:34.590> two

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
posse bugger patterns we usually tie two

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.790 
posse bugger patterns we usually tie two
strands<00:01:35.580> on<00:01:35.789> either<00:01:36.119> side<00:01:36.539> of<00:01:36.569> the<00:01:36.810> tail<00:01:36.990> so

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
strands on either side of the tail so

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.660 
strands on either side of the tail so
I'll<00:01:37.860> type<00:01:38.039> this<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.850> side<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
I'll type this one in on this side and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.980 
I'll type this one in on this side and
then<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.819> will<00:01:42.149> tie<00:01:42.539> in<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.560> other<00:01:43.800> side

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
then I will tie in on the other side

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.440 
then I will tie in on the other side
about<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> same<00:01:46.409> length<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.850> piece<00:01:48.149> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
about the same length on this piece I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.960 
about the same length on this piece I
actually<00:01:48.780> leave<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> whole<00:01:50.039> I'm<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
actually leave it whole I'm not going to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
actually leave it whole I'm not going to
snip<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:52.020> away<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.409> we're<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.799> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
snip it right away because we're in just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.550 
snip it right away because we're in just
a<00:01:53.190> minute<00:01:53.340> we're<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.819> it<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> rib

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
a minute we're going to use it as a rib

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.749 
a minute we're going to use it as a rib
it's<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> make<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> nice<00:01:56.190> shiny

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it's going to make a nice shiny

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.889 
it's going to make a nice shiny
highlight<00:01:57.679> on<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:59.130> side<00:01:59.569> what<00:02:00.569> is<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> about

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
highlight on the side what is it about

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.870 
highlight on the side what is it about
this<00:02:01.020> posse<00:02:01.409> bugger<00:02:01.740> baron<00:02:02.159> why<00:02:02.429> does<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.700> work

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
this posse bugger baron why does it work

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.350 
this posse bugger baron why does it work
well<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.820> as<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.119> bugger

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
well I think that that as the bugger

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.029 
well I think that that as the bugger
name<00:02:06.689> kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> suggests<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> woolly

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
name kind of suggests like with a woolly

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.889 
name kind of suggests like with a woolly
bugger<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.729> doesn't<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.119> look<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.509> any

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
bugger it doesn't really look like any

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.900 
bugger it doesn't really look like any
one<00:02:10.259> thing<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.709> particular<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.579> does<00:02:11.730> look

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
one thing in particular but it does look

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.640 
one thing in particular but it does look
like<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.060> whole<00:02:12.329> bunch<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.750> thing<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.410> mean

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
like a whole bunch of thing so I mean

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.650 
like a whole bunch of thing so I mean
maybe<00:02:14.070> they're<00:02:14.340> eating<00:02:14.579> it<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> Cavs<00:02:15.180> pupil

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
maybe they're eating it as a Cavs pupil

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.930 
maybe they're eating it as a Cavs pupil
which<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.959> looks<00:02:16.079> very<00:02:16.380> much<00:02:16.620> like<00:02:16.940> but

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
which it looks very much like but

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.610 
which it looks very much like but
perhaps<00:02:18.150> they're<00:02:18.570> eating<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.959> as<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> minnow

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
perhaps they're eating it as a minnow

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.380 
perhaps they're eating it as a minnow
because<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:20.250> got<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.549> extra<00:02:20.790> flash<00:02:21.150> in

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
because it's got the extra flash in

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
because it's got the extra flash in
there<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.440> got<00:02:22.590> real<00:02:22.799> good<00:02:23.430> color

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
there it's just got real good color

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.099 
there it's just got real good color
scheme<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.239> lots<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.570> things<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.989> are

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
more fish than standard colors maybe

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.370

they<00:03:02.790> see<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.120> better<00:03:03.329> maybe<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.900> works<00:03:04.109> better

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
so I did leave one aspect out here have

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.430 
so I did leave one aspect out here have
to<00:03:24.310> just<00:03:24.550> kind<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.790> tie<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.240> this<00:03:25.930> length<00:03:26.260> of

wire and then redub over it a little bit
i<00:03:28.300> forgot<00:03:28.720> my<00:03:28.840> copper<00:03:29.140> wire<00:03:29.350> there<00:03:29.620> which<00:03:29.950> is

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
i forgot my copper wire there which is

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.240 

and<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.870> could<00:03:43.019> add<00:03:43.170> weight<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.590> this<00:03:43.950> thing

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
and you could add weight to this thing

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.030 
and you could add weight to this thing
depending<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:44.909> your<00:03:45.060> flow<00:03:45.450> or<00:03:45.959> absolutely<00:03:46.739> ya

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
depending on your flow or absolutely ya

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.020 
depending on your flow or absolutely ya
know<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.370> would<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.610> great<00:03:47.790> opportunity

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
know this would be a great opportunity

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.289 
know this would be a great opportunity
to<00:03:48.569> use<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> little<00:03:50.310> bit<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.459> lead<00:03:50.730> or<00:03:50.760> lead<00:03:51.030> free

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
to use a little bit of lead or lead free

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.100 
to use a little bit of lead or lead free
wire<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:52.200> there<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:54.450> know<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.750> way<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.930> can

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
wire in there you know that way you can

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.850 
wire in there you know that way you can
get<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.150> neat<00:03:57.150> light<00:03:58.080> effects<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.829> that

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
get the neat light effects of that

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.770 
get the neat light effects of that
rainbow<00:03:59.400> bead<00:03:59.849> with<00:04:00.629> without<00:04:02.780> sacrificing

rainbow bead with without sacrificing
the<00:04:04.909> effect<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:07.140> I'm<00:04:07.260> going<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.620> just<00:04:07.709> wrap

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
the effect so I'm going to just wrap

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:19.689 
the effect so I'm going to just wrap
over<00:04:08.549> with<00:04:08.909> that<00:04:09.120> flash<00:04:09.599> boo<00:04:09.900> lithium<00:04:10.860> Mirage

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.029 

then<00:04:20.699> I'm<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.229> reinforce<00:04:22.229> those<00:04:22.620> wraps

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
then I'm going to reinforce those wraps

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:30.350 
then I'm going to reinforce those wraps
with<00:04:23.460> just<00:04:23.699> a<00:04:23.789> little<00:04:24.000> bit<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.180> copper<00:04:24.360> wire<00:04:29.360> so

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
with just a little bit of copper wire so

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.450 
with just a little bit of copper wire so
the<00:04:30.449> next<00:04:30.600> thing<00:04:30.720> I'm<00:04:30.900> going<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.169> do<00:04:31.350> is<00:04:31.680> tie<00:04:32.130> in

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
the next thing I'm going to do is tie in

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:53.140 
the next thing I'm going to do is tie in
some<00:04:33.150> barred<00:04:34.139> pearl<00:04:35.870> crazy<00:04:36.870> legs

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
tie in a set on each side length is

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.040 
tie in a set on each side length is
about<00:04:58.410> an<00:04:58.710> inch<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.550> half<00:04:59.580> per<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.900> can

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
about an inch and a half per and you can

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.570 
about an inch and a half per and you can
always<00:05:01.170> trim<00:05:01.470> them<00:05:01.620> down<00:05:01.680> better<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.400> have<00:05:02.430> a

always trim them down better to have a

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.030 
always trim them down better to have a
little<00:05:02.760> bit<00:05:02.880> too<00:05:03.000> much<00:05:03.180> than<00:05:03.510> too<00:05:03.690> little<00:05:04.040> so

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
little bit too much than too little so

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.440 
little bit too much than too little so
I've<00:05:05.100> got<00:05:05.250> them<00:05:05.370> cinched<00:05:05.760> down<00:05:05.820> in<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.150> center

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
I've got them cinched down in the center

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.690 
I've got them cinched down in the center
there<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:07.890> now<00:05:07.980> I'm<00:05:08.040> going<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.250> take<00:05:08.400> just<00:05:08.430> a
