get quite annoying listing up all these
contracts<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> best<00:02:00.149> way<00:02:00.420> because

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
contracts but it is the best way because

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
contracts but it is the best way because
you're<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.380> buying<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.920> selling<00:02:02.040> players

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.300 
you're not buying and selling players
that<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:04.049> might<00:02:04.320> seem<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.920> because

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that way it might seem that because

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.469 
that way it might seem that because
you're<00:02:05.430> making<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.729> bigger<00:02:05.939> profit<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.450> each

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you're making a bigger profit on each

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.660 
you're making a bigger profit on each
pod<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.990> buy<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.799> end<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:08.039> losing<00:02:08.310> money

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
pod you buy but you end up losing money

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
pod you buy but you end up losing money
because

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
because

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.380 
because
you<00:02:10.920> can't<00:02:11.250> then<00:02:11.400> sell<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.849> card<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you can't then sell on that card you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.449 
you can't then sell on that card you
bought<00:02:12.420> off<00:02:12.780> yourself<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.980> had<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.250> end<00:02:14.370> up
