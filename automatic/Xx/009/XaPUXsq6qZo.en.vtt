advance we're going we don't really have
good<00:00:23.640> defense<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:25.790> the<00:00:26.790> rest<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.000> our<00:00:27.090> teams

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
good defense but the rest of our teams

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.150 
good defense but the rest of our teams
not<00:00:27.449> too<00:00:27.690> shabby<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.789> should<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.850> decent

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
not too shabby so should be decent

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.860 
not too shabby so should be decent
hardcore<00:00:32.160> simulation<00:00:32.669> I've<00:00:33.449> actually<00:00:33.660> tried

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
hardcore simulation I've actually tried

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630 
hardcore simulation I've actually tried
a<00:00:33.960> few<00:00:34.110> games<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.739> simulation<00:00:35.400> and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
a few games just with simulation and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.210 
a few games just with simulation and
hardcore<00:00:36.000> simulation<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:37.830> didn't

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
hardcore simulation and I really didn't

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.220 
hardcore simulation and I really didn't
notice<00:00:38.400> a<00:00:38.670> whole<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.330> I'm<00:00:39.540> gonna<00:00:39.690> kind<00:00:40.199> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
notice a whole lot so I'm gonna kind of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
notice a whole lot so I'm gonna kind of
look<00:00:40.379> more<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.710> depth<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.190> i<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.489> i'm

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
look more in depth of that i think i'm

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.639 
look more in depth of that i think i'm
going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.970> try<00:00:42.390> different<00:00:42.540> scenarios<00:00:43.350> with

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
going to try different scenarios with

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.139 
going to try different scenarios with
the<00:00:44.040> different<00:00:44.399> things<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.880> see<00:00:45.030> what

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the different things and see what

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.380 
the different things and see what
happens<00:00:46.550> like<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.730> instance<00:00:47.760> I'll<00:00:48.059> dump<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
happens like for instance I'll dump it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.209 
happens like for instance I'll dump it
in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.540> corner<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.829> from<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> certain

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
in the corner and like from a certain

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
in the corner and like from a certain
area<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.880> see<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.540> difference<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
area and see what the difference is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.150 
area and see what the difference is
between<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.680> different<00:00:53.070> game<00:00:53.820> kind<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.420> types

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
between the different game kind of types

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
between the different game kind of types
so<00:00:56.160> we'll<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.550> I'll<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.120> eventually<00:00:57.360> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so we'll see I'll do that eventually but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.860 
so we'll see I'll do that eventually but
for<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.770> we're<00:00:59.010> doing<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> hut<00:00:59.430> demo<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.969> are

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
for now we're doing the hut demo and are
