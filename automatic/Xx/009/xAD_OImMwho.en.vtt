attempt<00:00:12.420> at<00:00:12.870> using<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.349> slingshot<00:00:13.590> now<00:00:14.429> mind

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
attempt at using a slingshot now mind

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.599 
attempt at using a slingshot now mind
you<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.150> slingshot<00:00:15.900> was<00:00:16.500> pretty<00:00:17.250> old<00:00:17.400> all

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
you this slingshot was pretty old all

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.420 
you this slingshot was pretty old all
worn<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.900> think<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.109> look<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.439> X<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.010> it

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
worn in and I think we look to X so it

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.029 
worn in and I think we look to X so it
didn't<00:00:20.699> even<00:00:20.760> fit<00:00:21.119> me<00:00:21.240> at<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.050> take<00:00:23.010> that

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
didn't even fit me at all so take that

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.859 
didn't even fit me at all so take that
with<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.820> will<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.449> actually<00:00:24.689> my

with what you will this was actually my

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.410 
with what you will this was actually my
squat<00:00:25.439> day<00:00:25.760> wasn't<00:00:26.760> even<00:00:26.939> supposed<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> bench

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
squat day wasn't even supposed to bench

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.730

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
but a bunch of guys were benching using

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.839 
but a bunch of guys were benching using
the<00:00:28.800> slingshot<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.490> asked<00:00:29.609> me<00:00:29.699> if<00:00:29.760> ever

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
is 385 hit that for I don't know to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.549 
is 385 hit that for I don't know to
maybe<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.100> let's<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.989> now<00:00:42.989> three<00:00:43.290> hit<00:00:43.440> that

maybe and let's see now three hit that
432<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.690> no<00:00:45.690> felt<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.289> easy<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.710> I'm

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
432 that was no felt really easy so I'm

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.500 
432 that was no felt really easy so I'm
like<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.250> hell<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.579> jump<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> 405

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
like what the hell is jump up the 405

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
like what the hell is jump up the 405
and<00:00:50.000> hit<00:00:51.000> an<00:00:51.090> easy<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> 405<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.529 
and hit an easy to and 405 with the
slingshot<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.010> mind<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> black<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
slingshot now mind you the black one is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.860 
slingshot now mind you the black one is
supposedly<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> most<00:00:56.010> help<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.059> guess<00:00:57.300> but

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
supposedly the most help I guess but

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.319 
supposedly the most help I guess but
like<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.170> said<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:59.640> two<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.300> three

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like I said it was like two or three

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.500 
like I said it was like two or three
sizes<00:01:00.660> too<00:01:00.960> big<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.530> me<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.879> like<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.149> don't

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
sizes too big for me so like I don't

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.880 
sizes too big for me so like I don't
know<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> probably<00:01:04.170> didn't<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> quite<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
know it probably didn't have quite the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.770 
know it probably didn't have quite the
tension<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:05.850> supposed<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.450> but

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
tension is what it was supposed to but

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
tension is what it was supposed to but
anyway<00:01:07.560> take<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.670> am

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
anyway take that with what you will I am

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.640 
anyway take that with what you will I am
going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> buy<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.659> because<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.530> there

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
going to buy one because I think there

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.039 
going to buy one because I think there
is<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.890> benefit<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> using<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.760> slingshot

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
is some benefit to using a slingshot

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.560 
is some benefit to using a slingshot
more<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.409> adding<00:01:14.070> volume<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.670> saves<00:01:15.390> your

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
more so just adding volume in saves your

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.870 
more so just adding volume in saves your
shoulders<00:01:16.049> helps<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.009> right<00:01:17.159> off<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> bottom

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
shoulders helps you right off the bottom

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.170 
shoulders helps you right off the bottom
of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> bench<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.000> something

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
of the bench so I think it's something

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.230 
of the bench so I think it's something
to<00:01:21.540> also<00:01:22.409> give<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.340> confidence<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to also give you confidence because I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.140 
to also give you confidence because I
mean<00:01:24.869> you're<00:01:25.470> using<00:01:25.710> ten<00:01:26.490> percent<00:01:26.850> more

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
mean you're using ten percent more

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.660 
mean you're using ten percent more
than<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.799> probably<00:01:29.189> normally

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
than then what you can probably normally

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.539 
than then what you can probably normally
bench<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.240> anyway<00:01:30.979> just<00:01:31.979> want<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> throw<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
bench so anyway just want to throw that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.060 
bench so anyway just want to throw that
in<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> was<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> Monday<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.890> had<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in that was a Monday and then I had to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.219 
in that was a Monday and then I had to
do<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> push<00:01:35.579> work<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.299> boy<00:01:36.509> tom<00:01:36.900> night

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
do a push work out with my boy tom night

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.410

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
back on a Tuesday so I basically benched

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.530 
back on a Tuesday so I basically benched
heavy<00:01:39.630> two<00:01:39.810> days<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.170> row<00:01:41.030> did<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> nice

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
heavy two days in a row did a nice

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.899 
heavy two days in a row did a nice
little<00:01:42.720> warm-up<00:01:43.020> my<00:01:43.560> first<00:01:43.770> set<00:01:43.979> was<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.399> 275

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
little warm-up my first set was but 275

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.880 
little warm-up my first set was but 275
was<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> another<00:01:45.509> warm-up<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> ended

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
was kind of another warm-up now I ended

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.450 
was kind of another warm-up now I ended
up<00:01:46.950> hitting<00:01:47.130> three<00:01:47.490> sets<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> five<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.450> 315

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
up hitting three sets of five with 315

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.700 
up hitting three sets of five with 315
Tom<00:01:50.460> my<00:01:50.670> back's<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.509> deep<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
Tom my back's actually in deep in the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.330 
Tom my back's actually in deep in the
contest<00:01:53.189> prep<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.619> he<00:01:55.619> looks<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> skeleton

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
