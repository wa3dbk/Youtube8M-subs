 We present a video of how to create you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.789
 your own campaign in those myths and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.159
 well the first thing to do is andy 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.920
 schleck mythology good of mythology 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:19.050
 better to zoom in because they're going to have 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.300
 what to put here here to see are many 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:28.200
 options are going to have to click on 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:32.099
 a player are going to put here a 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.900
 player a random map and here goes to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.550
 appear a lot of things to cali with 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.740
 the difficulty that you want is going to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.040
 fight of course against the pc the pc 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.810
 it's easy enough that it's easy to moderate 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.570
 that normal difficult that the building and 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.540
 remove would be as super difficult the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.230
 young space diners 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.930
 good here the tooth that they give their account to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.730
 zeus to dispossessed 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.340
 and if sector of lots 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.530
 I for example choose him 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.680
 the god of war 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.640
 Well here it will seem to customize 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.799
 opponents for example for example you can 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.710
 to play one against one one controls 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.869
 2 1 against 3 2 against 2 and so 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.490
 personalized and here personalize by 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.140
 example in the letter of change by 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.600
 some god 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.070
 and they put what I know for example you can 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.420
 make a team here of 111 and it's 11 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.070
 so you can do everyone here choose 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.160
 kind you want 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.680
 for example super macÃ­a is victory for 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.040
 conquer settlements or wonders the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:50.580
 conquest is to see defeat all your 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:54.840
 lightning enemies would be that it 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.430
 they play a great speed and to death with 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.450
 many resources and I recommend you to 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.619
 death 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:06.409
 good here because you want a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.409
 big world and current 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.410
 the pressure may seem like any 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.310
 Random random meat all 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.670
 that is the entire map available on 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.070
 drinking trough and that's the proof of 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.710
 this form by the flocks my gratos 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.460
 stop in rivers and pond to drink 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.750
 but there is no other food available 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.100
 apropol and the player starts with great 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.440
 amount of resources in the plateaus 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.040
 also available resources in the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.880
 valleys in the vicinity at the end of 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.440
 dikes or obi forgot forgotten and you see 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.300
 that is terrible is hidden among those 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.260
 these rocky hills 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.940
 anatolia the ugliest desert more 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.920
 beyond the Mediterranean embedded between 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.280
 the amount of trucks that protects the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.550
 gold mine archipelago chain of island 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.010
 punished by the software and all 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.790
 definitions for example I see that the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.140
 underworld 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.610
 the cold here is more water here has to 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.580
 research 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.400
 here they have to investigate to calm down 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.550
 Mediterranean worms in a thousand degrees thousand 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.700
 team wars sudden death normed 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:29.100

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:32.070
 Valley of the Kings and rear with 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.080
 Mediterranean ten and a good start
