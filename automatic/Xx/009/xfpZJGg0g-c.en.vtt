00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.090
 you have to go to the folder where you have 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 installed your great theft auto 'I 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.830

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.100
 the game files installed then 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.809
 now we go to the first file that you 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.629
 I leave in the description that it is the mode 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.970
 menu you simply have to choose 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.220
 these files and drag and drop them 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.010
 in the main folder of the game for 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.019
 install the cars mod 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.570
 The same applies to the file that 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.670
 It puts lm really there does not no matter 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.989

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.790
 how to install it but I 'm ready 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.320
 explaining myself so it does not matter what 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.450
 you read but there you have it in case you have 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.479
 some doubt once in the game to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.220
 open the menu we will open it with the f 4 and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.530
 to move up right down 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.610
 left with the numeric keypad with the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.040
 4 8 6 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.860
 and to give it accept it would be with the number 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.650
 5 to go back the backward the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.420
 Skateboard or just give to 4 close 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.070
 and go back to open the menu and as you are 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.500
 watching I'm moving through the menu and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.910
 I have chosen for example to choose we can 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.560
 change our appearance we can 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.420
 put on the skin that we want and chosen 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 the skin of the monkey for example also 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.160
 we could do is to study 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.160
 cars we can also change the time 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.690
 of the weather technological climate for what 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.720
 I have put here snowy we can get 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.119
 all deadly weapons that ammunition 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.310
 explosive to all weapons and so on 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.840
 we can do a lot of things and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.729
 apart then already to finish 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.200
 explain the subject of the hydraulic is very 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.350
 simple simply when we are in 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.090
 a car with the key r the car will paste 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.149
 this jump as if we had the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.220
 Hydraulic suspension installed and how much 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.860
 more time let it tighten higher 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.630
 the car will be skipped because that has been 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.370
 I hope you liked us 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.520

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.520
