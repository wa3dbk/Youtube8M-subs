00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the vision of Rapid Response we have a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
the vision of Rapid Response we have a
custom<00:01:44.520> organizer<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.360> made<00:01:45.570> which<00:01:45.750> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
custom organizer that we made which is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.560 
custom organizer that we made which is
really<00:01:46.350> neat<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:47.640> federation's<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.360> came

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
really neat the federation's have came

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.600 
really neat the federation's have came
by<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> said<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.439> there's<00:01:49.920> stuff<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> back

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
by and said if there's stuff in the back

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.480 
by and said if there's stuff in the back
you<00:01:51.000> can't<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.509> items<00:01:52.200> fly<00:01:52.590> front<00:01:53.070> into<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
you can't have items fly front into the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
so most people install a cage well when

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.149 
so most people install a cage well when
you<00:01:57.479> install<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> cage<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.740> run<00:01:58.890> into<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
you install a cage you run into the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
you install a cage you run into the
problem<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.700> when<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> transverse

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
problem of when you have a transverse

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.530 
problem of when you have a transverse
compartment<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.640> cage<00:02:02.909> blocks<00:02:03.270> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
compartment like this the cage blocks it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.590 
compartment like this the cage blocks it
so<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.469> our<00:02:04.680> box<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.399> custom<00:02:05.939> design<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.360> we

so in our box we custom design and we

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.249 
so in our box we custom design and we
custom<00:02:07.049> make<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.429> cage<00:02:08.429> insert<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:10.020> the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.450 

so<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.170> crucial<00:05:10.650> thing<00:05:10.890> with<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:11.250> vehicle

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
so the crucial thing with this vehicle

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.850 
so the crucial thing with this vehicle
when<00:05:11.760> we<00:05:11.880> build<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.240> was<00:05:12.360> intersection<00:05:13.230> they

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
when we build it was intersection they

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.770 
when we build it was intersection they
run<00:05:14.250> into<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.460> lot<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.790> problems<00:05:15.060> going<00:05:15.540> through

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
run into a lot of problems going through

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.240 
run into a lot of problems going through
intersection<00:05:16.290> people<00:05:16.560> not<00:05:16.710> stopping<00:05:17.220> for

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
intersection people not stopping for

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.550 
intersection people not stopping for
them<00:05:19.610> in<00:05:20.610> front<00:05:20.850> of<00:05:20.970> them<00:05:21.180> so<00:05:21.840> we<00:05:21.990> got<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.140> six

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560
