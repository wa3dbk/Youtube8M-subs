there's problems we can solve it we can

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
there's problems we can solve it we can
make<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> better<00:01:11.070> industry<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:12.240> we're

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360

make it a better industry what we're
talking<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.260> rebuilding<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.040> economy

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
talking about is rebuilding this economy

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.790 
talking about is rebuilding this economy
to<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.940> sustainable<00:01:15.570> sustainable<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.710> an

to be sustainable sustainable from an

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.650 
to be sustainable sustainable from an
environmental<00:01:17.010> perspective<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:18.000> well<00:01:18.480> as<00:01:18.570> an

economic perspective and so everything

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.990 
economic perspective and so everything
we<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.660> really<00:01:22.500> about<00:01:22.820> localizing<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
we do is really about localizing the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.560 
we do is really about localizing the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
food industry as a system and we break

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.680 
food industry as a system and we break
it<00:01:37.770> down<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.520> about<00:01:38.730> how<00:01:38.760> to<00:01:39.000> produce<00:01:39.300> a

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
it down and think about how to produce a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.140 
it down and think about how to produce a
sustainable<00:01:40.680> industry<00:01:41.040> from<00:01:41.640> start<00:01:42.000> to

sustainable industry from start to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700 
sustainable industry from start to

retail to delivery of food on our table
every<00:01:48.930> day<00:01:49.080> we<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.070> create<00:01:50.250> decent<00:01:50.910> jobs<00:01:51.420> as

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
every day we can create decent jobs as

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.500 
every day we can create decent jobs as
well<00:01:52.230> as<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> better<00:01:52.920> environment<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:54.300> one

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
well as a better environment the one

resources<00:01:55.050> that<00:01:55.110> were<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.350> challenged<00:01:55.860> with

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
resources that were not challenged with

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.830 
resources that were not challenged with
is<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.730> fact<00:01:56.760> that<00:01:56.970> we<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.240> seven<00:01:57.630> billion

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
is the fact that we have seven billion

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
is the fact that we have seven billion
people<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.530> planet<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.610> we

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
people on the planet so I think we

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.420 
people on the planet so I think we
should<00:01:59.880> not<00:01:59.910> be<00:02:00.120> so<00:02:00.510> allergic<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.200> using<00:02:01.650> human

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
should not be so allergic to using human

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
should not be so allergic to using human
beings<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.420> production<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.020> food<00:02:04.320> than

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
beings in the production of food than

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.280 
beings in the production of food than
less<00:02:05.370> natural<00:02:05.580> resources<00:02:06.300> which<00:02:06.480> are<00:02:06.660> what

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
less natural resources which are what

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.750 
less natural resources which are what
are<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.590> constraining<00:02:08.070> our<00:02:08.340> economy

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
are really constraining our economy

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.639 
are really constraining our economy
moving<00:02:08.790> ahead<00:02:09.119> right<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> create

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
moving ahead right we have to create

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
moving ahead right we have to create
ways<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.430> everybody<00:02:11.820> participate<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.300> our

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
ways for everybody participate in our

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.270 
ways for everybody participate in our
communities<00:02:12.690> from<00:02:12.780> our<00:02:12.989> youth<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.770> our<00:02:13.890> elders
