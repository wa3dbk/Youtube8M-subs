00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.360 

and<00:03:55.510> we're<00:03:55.599> bringing<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.900> all<00:03:56.140> together<00:03:56.409> and

and we're bringing it all together and
the<00:03:57.489> all<00:03:57.670> right<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.909> brought<00:03:58.510> some<00:03:58.750> salt<00:03:59.019> over

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
the all right I brought some salt over

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.690 
the all right I brought some salt over
here<00:03:59.470> I'm<00:03:59.590> going<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.830> add<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.950> little<00:04:00.159> pinch<00:04:00.459> of

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
here I'm going to add a little pinch of

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.490 
here I'm going to add a little pinch of
salt<00:04:00.909> it<00:04:01.150> has<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.390> be<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.569> little<00:04:01.810> applause<00:04:02.200> for

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
salt it has to be a little applause for

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.490 
salt it has to be a little applause for
that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
that

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.730 
that
and<00:04:04.980> there's<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.310> recipe<00:04:05.730> also<00:04:05.880> calls<00:04:06.060> for

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
and there's the recipe also calls for

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.860 
and there's the recipe also calls for
milk<00:04:07.740> instead<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.160> water<00:04:08.510> but<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.600> thought<00:04:09.810> that

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
milk instead of water but I thought that

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.800 
milk instead of water but I thought that
it<00:04:10.140> would<00:04:10.260> just<00:04:10.410> last<00:04:10.740> longer<00:04:11.360> have<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.390> lot<00:04:12.660> of

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
it would just last longer have a lot of

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.810 
it would just last longer have a lot of
show<00:04:13.020> but<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:13.560> just<00:04:13.770> use<00:04:13.980> one<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.550> things

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
show but if I just use one of the things

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.990 
show but if I just use one of the things

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
and just to go to the texture that you

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.850 
and just to go to the texture that you
want<00:05:06.040> it<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.610> be<00:05:07.050> but<00:05:08.050> always<00:05:08.230> make<00:05:08.500> sure<00:05:08.530> that

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
want it to be but always make sure that

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.850 
want it to be but always make sure that
you<00:05:08.980> scrape<00:05:09.310> because<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:11.560> don't<00:05:11.740> want

anything<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.280> dry<00:05:12.490> out<00:05:12.700> on<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.000> sides<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.630> get

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
anything to dry out on the sides and get

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.660 
anything to dry out on the sides and get
back<00:05:13.960> into<00:05:14.170> your<00:05:14.290> eyes<00:05:17.130> okay<00:05:18.130> now<00:05:18.370> I'm<00:05:18.520> going

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
to put this back down and I'll start to

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.409 
to put this back down and I'll start to
add<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:21.450> little<00:05:22.450> bit<00:05:22.600> of<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.870> water<00:05:24.210> but<00:05:25.210> head

add a little bit of the water but head
it<00:05:25.540> very<00:05:25.720> slowly<00:05:26.020> because<00:05:26.290> a<00:05:26.320> little<00:05:26.500> bit<00:05:26.740> goes

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
it very slowly because a little bit goes

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.239 
it very slowly because a little bit goes
a<00:05:27.220> long<00:05:27.370> way

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
looks like I can just take a little

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.170 
looks like I can just take a little
little<00:05:46.990> detour<00:05:47.319> off<00:05:47.470> for<00:05:47.800> ya<00:05:48.449> here<00:05:50.250> okay<00:05:51.250> I'll

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
have too much liquid you can add a

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.670 
have too much liquid you can add a
little<00:06:17.760> more<00:06:17.880> powdered<00:06:18.360> sugar<00:06:18.600> to<00:06:18.870> it<00:06:19.020> but<00:06:19.560> at

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
little more powdered sugar to it but at

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.500 
little more powdered sugar to it but at
this<00:06:19.800> point<00:06:20.040> you<00:06:20.220> if<00:06:20.400> you<00:06:20.730> start<00:06:21.060> doing<00:06:21.210> that

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
this point you if you start doing that

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.740 
this point you if you start doing that
it<00:06:21.630> might<00:06:21.750> get<00:06:21.870> a<00:06:21.930> little<00:06:21.990> lumpy<00:06:23.180> I'm<00:06:24.180> going<00:06:24.630> to

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
it might get a little lumpy I'm going to

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.810 
it might get a little lumpy I'm going to
put<00:06:24.900> the<00:06:25.020> mixer<00:06:25.350> back<00:06:25.560> on<00:06:25.800> and<00:06:26.130> mix<00:06:26.370> this<00:06:26.550> let

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
put the mixer back on and mix this let

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.550 
put the mixer back on and mix this let
this<00:06:26.940> beat<00:06:27.210> for<00:06:27.450> a<00:06:27.510> couple<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:28.050> moments<00:06:28.200> okay

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
this beat for a couple of moments okay

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.010 
this beat for a couple of moments okay
maybe<00:06:29.070> thirty<00:06:29.760> seconds<00:06:30.270> or<00:06:30.360> so<00:06:30.510> just<00:06:30.690> to<00:06:30.810> whip

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
maybe thirty seconds or so just to whip

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.330 
maybe thirty seconds or so just to whip
it<00:06:31.170> up<00:06:31.260> and<00:06:31.440> make<00:06:31.560> sure<00:06:31.590> everything<00:06:32.100> is<00:06:32.160> really

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
it up and make sure everything is really

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:43.560 
it up and make sure everything is really
well<00:06:32.460> incorporated

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.180
