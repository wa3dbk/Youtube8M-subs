00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
up grabbing if you try to ollie and you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.350 
up grabbing if you try to ollie and you
push<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.550> foot<00:00:47.760> goes<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.090> front<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
one of these sensors it's going to do a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.990 
one of these sensors it's going to do a
grab<00:00:49.860> which<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.879> didn't<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:53.000> know

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it's who's a better glitcher for the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.800 
it's who's a better glitcher for the
xbox<00:01:47.490> live<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:48.290> whatever<00:01:49.290> online<00:01:50.250> um<00:01:53.420> yeah<00:01:54.420> but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
xbox live or whatever online um yeah but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.080 
xbox live or whatever online um yeah but
other<00:01:55.110> than<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:57.119> game

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
other than that it's pretty good game

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.550 
other than that it's pretty good game
100<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> hundred<00:02:00.840> ten<00:02:01.110> dollars

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
100 it's like a hundred ten dollars

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
100 it's like a hundred ten dollars
pretty<00:02:02.070> pricey<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:04.009> um<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.390> worth

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
pretty pricey but um I think it's worth

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.580 
pretty pricey but um I think it's worth
it<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.990> would<00:02:07.890> definitely<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.959> it's<00:02:09.959> pretty

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
it I would definitely get it it's pretty

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.780 
it I would definitely get it it's pretty
good<00:02:10.679> game

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
good game

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.199 
good game
easy<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.659> learn<00:02:13.810> oh<00:02:14.189> and<00:02:15.189> one<00:02:15.310> more<00:02:15.340> thing<00:02:15.519> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
easy to learn oh and one more thing the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.470 
easy to learn oh and one more thing the
calibration<00:02:16.930> for<00:02:17.079> the<00:02:17.200> board<00:02:18.090> when<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.180> start

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
calibration for the board when you start

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.750 
calibration for the board when you start
it<00:02:19.750> makes<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.049> cover<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.409> sensors<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:21.640> know

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
it makes you cover the sensors you know

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.300 
it makes you cover the sensors you know
just<00:02:21.909> calibrate<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.859> you<00:02:23.859> have<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.069> calibrate

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
just calibrate it you have to calibrate

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.349 
just calibrate it you have to calibrate
it<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.909> lot<00:02:25.150> because<00:02:26.129> it<00:02:27.129> doesn't<00:02:27.909> always<00:02:28.060> stay

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
it a lot because it doesn't always stay

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.990 
it a lot because it doesn't always stay
keep<00:02:28.689> its<00:02:28.840> calibration<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:30.879> to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
keep its calibration you have to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.460 
keep its calibration you have to
