00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
about it because when people follow me

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.520 
about it because when people follow me
in<00:01:27.330> game<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.750> makes<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> watch

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
them even more and maybe you know

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.999
