say it's coming from the upper left that
would<00:01:56.490> mean<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.790> each<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> these<00:01:57.570> ball

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
would mean that each one of these ball

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.520 
would mean that each one of these ball
shapes<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.470> would<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.430> casting<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.909> shadow<00:02:00.530> on

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
shapes here would be casting a shadow on

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.289 
shapes here would be casting a shadow on
the<00:02:01.740> next<00:02:02.010> shape<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:02.700> let's<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the next shape so let's just do that a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.149 
the next shape so let's just do that a
little<00:02:03.630> bit<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:06.450> adds<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
little bit like this see and that adds a

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.699 
little bit like this see and that adds a
little<00:02:08.159> bit<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> depth<00:02:09.259> ok<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.409> next<00:02:10.560> thing

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
little bit of depth ok the next thing

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.390 
little bit of depth ok the next thing
we're<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.519> put<00:02:11.700> them<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.939> big<00:02:12.239> leaf

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
we're going to put them on a big leaf

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.740 
we're going to put them on a big leaf
and<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.730> nothing<00:02:15.030> more<00:02:15.209> than<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> big

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and that is nothing more than a big

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.500 
and that is nothing more than a big
teardrop<00:02:16.379> shape<00:02:16.910> comes<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.090> point<00:02:18.300> right

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
teardrop shape comes to a point right

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.480 
teardrop shape comes to a point right
there<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.900> back

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
there and back

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.240 
there and back

on the bottom if the light is coming

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.540 
on the bottom if the light is coming
from<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.030> top<00:02:46.710> we're<00:02:47.710> going<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.950> shade<00:02:48.250> the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.260 
part would be a little bit darker value
because<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.050> not<00:02:53.170> seeing<00:02:53.500> as<00:02:53.710> much<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.910> the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
because it's not seeing as much of the

character now let's have him thinking of
something<00:03:22.210> let's<00:03:23.020> see<00:03:23.200> maybe<00:03:23.380> he's<00:03:23.590> thinking

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
something let's see maybe he's thinking

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.270 
something let's see maybe he's thinking
of<00:03:24.010> becoming<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.810> butterfly<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:27.010> course<00:03:27.190> that's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
of becoming a butterfly of course that's

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.160 
of becoming a butterfly of course that's
what<00:03:27.430> he's<00:03:27.520> going<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.790> become<00:03:27.940> male<00:03:28.900> and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
what he's going to become male and

female caterpillars become butterflies
so<00:03:33.490> a<00:03:33.520> little<00:03:33.640> detail<00:03:34.000> on<00:03:34.120> that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
so a little detail on that

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.260 
so a little detail on that
and<00:03:34.540> those<00:03:34.690> have<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.020> in<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.730> cloud<00:03:36.730> like<00:03:37.030> this

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
and those have it in a cloud like this

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.050 
and those have it in a cloud like this
like<00:03:37.510> he's<00:03:37.690> thinking<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:39.490> some<00:03:39.700> circles

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
like he's thinking that and some circles

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.730 
like he's thinking that and some circles
indicate<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.930> he's<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.260> one<00:03:41.380> doing<00:03:41.560> the

indicate that he's the one doing the
thinking<00:03:42.070> maybe<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.370> little<00:03:42.520> blue<00:03:42.790> for<00:03:43.540> the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
thinking maybe a little blue for the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.430 
thinking maybe a little blue for the
butterfly<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:45.810> see<00:03:46.810> how<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.900> little<00:03:47.050> simple

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
butterfly and see how a little simple

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.710 
butterfly and see how a little simple
sketch<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:48.010> has<00:03:48.820> some<00:03:49.060> dimension<00:03:49.480> to

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
sketch like this has some dimension to
