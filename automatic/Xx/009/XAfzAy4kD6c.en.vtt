00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.560

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 medals brought hearty 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 Congratulations first , you ask yourself 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
 Of course, how is this whole story 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 come on roll how do you have your 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.449
 talent discovered or who has to you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.240
 the first time, so to speak said the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.920
 can you become a really good gymnast yes 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.150
 So that started I was with 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.529
 my mother's mother and child gymnastics 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.939
 they have already seen that you are a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.830
 very cool movement talent would have been there 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.730
 I sound normal and then it went 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.529
 boring in the very fast 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.700
 performance sport in it and since my first 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.980
 then trainer in Munich has then 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.790
 tumbles detected the young of out 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.800
 to the cameras 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.180
 and yes that has then developed so 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.890
 then i will go to stuttgart someday 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.930
 gone and then walked uphill 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.100
 Ok, so you trained a lot and now 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.719
 also to achieve this goal 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 maybe there was also where you live 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.539
 said I'll throw it all down 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.700
 I do not feel like it anymore 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.020
 yes clearly such phases between the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.489
 there's always everything finally everyone can 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.110
 athlete confirm 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.360
 Of course that is not always fun 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.640
 but if you then have the successes and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.000
 so then you stand on top of the podium 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.920
 Then you know why you think about it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.560
 of course, that's what spurs me on, too 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 how is this with you of the competition 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.130
 you then totally turned back 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.420
 concentrate or do that to you 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.650
 even as well as some swimmers i have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.600
 partially seen at the olympic 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.159
 play this loud music or listen 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.200
 so how do you do it all 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.700
 otherwise, me personally , me too 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.500
 quite like music on the passion 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.140
 competition in I think I always 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 I do a lot of music and something special 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.380
 I do not like doing something completely 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.420
 quite normal, so I have no ritual 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 or so okay because I ask what 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.590
 The music likes to be very different 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 Actually, it was okay if you did not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.860
 well trained or at olympia until the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.680
 example what are you doing in yours 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.670
 leisure what your hobbies so all 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.830
 normal things so 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.799
 with friends, the company in the cinema 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.780
 go at night go away even fit in 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.460
 training plan 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.299
 Okay, I saw you yesterday 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.770
 have 212,000 facebook fans at the moment 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.680
 maybe even more now 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.220
 I think fabian hambÃ¼chen only 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.810
 20,000 or so 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.039
 that reflects a bit the whole 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.299
 romp about your person now 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.039
 now also just got out of london 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.300
 he has come back that 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.170
 sometimes a little too much you would have 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 sometimes a little more quiet 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.780
 actually makes fun on everyone 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.100
 If I come now a lot around and experienced 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.470
 things that I did not experience before 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.310
 have and is definitely one 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.470
 nice change to the training everyday 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.940
 otherwise I am up in the morning until the evening 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.959

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.519
 I have a bit of free time now 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.049
