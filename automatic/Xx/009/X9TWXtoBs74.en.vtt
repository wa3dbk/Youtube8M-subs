00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.530 

and<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:20.799> harbour<00:01:21.159> was<00:01:21.400> done<00:01:21.670> obviously<00:01:21.909> very

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
and this harbour was done obviously very

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.929 
and this harbour was done obviously very
well<00:01:22.829> it's<00:01:23.829> not<00:01:24.159> it<00:01:24.399> has<00:01:25.090> steel<00:01:26.100> pull<00:01:27.100> Post

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
well it's not it has steel pull Post

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.740 
well it's not it has steel pull Post
sets<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:28.450> it's<00:01:28.600> resting<00:01:29.110> on<00:01:29.320> right<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
sets that it's resting on right here and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.289 
sets that it's resting on right here and
then<00:01:35.610> connected<00:01:36.610> with<00:01:36.789> steel<00:01:37.149> post<00:01:37.950> rest

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
then connected with steel post rest

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.289 
then connected with steel post rest
going<00:01:40.299> off<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.869> sides

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:56.950 

so<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:45.990> built<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.500> long-lasting<00:01:48.140> value

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.700
