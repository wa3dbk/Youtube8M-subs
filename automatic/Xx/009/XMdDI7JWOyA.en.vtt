00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
but as I think it goes like ten or
fifteen<00:01:21.180> twenty<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> discount

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.950 
which is really cool they fit really
nice<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> rmx<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> imagine<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.890> fit<00:01:29.189> on

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
nice on the rmx so I imagine they fit on

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.630 
nice on the rmx so I imagine they fit on
the<00:01:30.960> other<00:01:31.110> Hercules<00:01:31.560> related<00:01:32.040> type<00:01:32.220> products

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the other Hercules related type products

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
the other Hercules related type products
really<00:01:33.509> well<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.900> only<00:01:34.079> ones<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:34.710> do

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
really well the only ones that they do

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.450 
really well the only ones that they do
not<00:01:35.040> fit<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:37.110> headphone<00:01:37.770> volume<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
not fit on is the headphone volume and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.649 
not fit on is the headphone volume and
the<00:01:39.420> microphone<00:01:40.290> volume<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:41.490> has<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.880> different

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the microphone volume it has a different

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.960 
the microphone volume it has a different
like<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> guess<00:01:43.049> stab<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.729> will

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
like I guess stab on it so it they will

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.810 
like I guess stab on it so it they will
not<00:01:45.030> fit<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> only<00:01:47.220> bad<00:01:47.549> thing

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
not fit so that is the only bad thing

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.330 
not fit so that is the only bad thing
about<00:01:48.090> them<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.259> other<00:01:49.500> than<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:50.310> are

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
about them but other than that they are

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.639 
about them but other than that they are
really<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.060> cool<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.320> want<00:01:52.500> to
