00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
just simply seems to have lost his way

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.020 
just simply seems to have lost his way
over<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> past<00:01:55.409> couple<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.549> years<00:01:56.609> since

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
over the past couple of years since

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.779 
over the past couple of years since
since<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.569> wanted<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.229> stay<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.649> those

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
since they wanted to stay one of those

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.639 
since they wanted to stay one of those
two<00:01:59.789> titles<00:02:00.210> he<00:02:00.359> really<00:02:00.840> has<00:02:00.990> lost<00:02:01.350> his<00:02:01.590> way

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
two titles he really has lost his way

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.319 
two titles he really has lost his way
and<00:02:01.859> he<00:02:02.039> just<00:02:02.249> isn't<00:02:02.789> playing<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and he just isn't playing with the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.870 
and he just isn't playing with the
passion<00:02:03.749> it's<00:02:03.929> necessary<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> champion

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
passion it's necessary to be a champion

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
passion it's necessary to be a champion
again<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> Lakers<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.049> got<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.560> make<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
again so the Lakers have got to make a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.620 
again so the Lakers have got to make a
move<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.250> don't<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.820> whether<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.180> should

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
move I don't know whether they should

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.590 
move I don't know whether they should
bynum<00:02:10.080> Bynum's<00:02:10.530> effort<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.610> very

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
bynum Bynum's effort is is very

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.990 
bynum Bynum's effort is is very
inconsistent<00:02:13.440> though<00:02:13.680> he<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> top<00:02:14.610> flight

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
inconsistent though he is a top flight

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.560 
inconsistent though he is a top flight
center<00:02:15.750> he<00:02:15.960> can<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.580> he<00:02:17.580> can<00:02:17.610> dominate<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.330> both

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
center he can do he can dominate on both

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.270 
center he can do he can dominate on both
ends<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.930> floor<00:02:18.990> both<00:02:19.410> defensively<00:02:20.100> and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
ends of the floor both defensively and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.820 
ends of the floor both defensively and
offensively<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:21.150> they've<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.500> get

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
offensively but they've got to get

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.670 
offensively but they've got to get
consistent<00:02:23.550> effort<00:02:23.820> in<00:02:24.120> order<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.630> a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
consistent effort in order to be a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.050 
consistent effort in order to be a
championship<00:02:25.680> contender<00:02:25.830> again<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.910> i<00:02:26.940> think

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
championship contender again so i think

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.290 
championship contender again so i think
the<00:02:27.330> lakers<00:02:27.510> should<00:02:28.050> go<00:02:28.410> after<00:02:28.590> maybe<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.700> Aaron

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the lakers should go after maybe a Aaron

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.290 
the lakers should go after maybe a Aaron
Brooks<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.990> free<00:02:31.200> agency<00:02:31.740> maybe<00:02:32.640> even<00:02:33.090> us

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
Brooks and free agency maybe even us

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.150 
Brooks and free agency maybe even us
maybe<00:02:33.810> even<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.200> Steve<00:02:34.440> Nash<00:02:34.740> they<00:02:34.950> need<00:02:35.130> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
maybe even a Steve Nash they need a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.430 
maybe even a Steve Nash they need a
facilitator<00:02:35.850> will<00:02:35.940> which<00:02:36.390> will<00:02:36.420> allow<00:02:36.720> Colby

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
facilitator will which will allow Colby

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.200 
facilitator will which will allow Colby

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
to not have to be the primary

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.910 
to not have to be the primary
ball-handler<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.590> make<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.920> make

everybody<00:02:44.430> else<00:02:44.550> get<00:02:45.060> involved<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.720> they

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
everybody else get involved and they

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.290 
everybody else get involved and they
also<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:47.310> get<00:02:47.550> better<00:02:47.850> at<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300

4-position<00:02:48.570> they<00:02:49.140> got<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.620> get<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.830> consistent

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
4-position they got to get a consistent

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.450 
4-position they got to get a consistent
effort<00:02:51.510> from<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.750> full<00:02:52.080> position<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.310> the
