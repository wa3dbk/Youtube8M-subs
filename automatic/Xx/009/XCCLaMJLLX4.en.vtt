00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.310
 of Italian chefs if I give you the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.199
 welcome to this high demand 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 tutorial what we will talk about today 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.050
 today I will reveal two methods for you 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.910
 download and install the agrarian 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.700
 skies in sp 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.730
 finally correct we are doing this 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.899
 tutorial then let's not get lost in 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.020
 Chatter 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.610
 the first thing to do for the first one 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.559
 method with which they gravitate first method is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.510
 go to the site which among other things e 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 put in description and what john you have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.149
 in all our videos or feed the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.469
 beast dot com as written here 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.120
 scrolling down the page 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.920
 just go on the ex download this here 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.470
 then meanwhile I'm checking here 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.380
 ok once we have done this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 download 15 will be downloaded exactly 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.340
 this file so i put in this one 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.010
 games folder on my desktop ft 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 exe barbell starting this 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.960
 file I have already done because it takes a 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.460
 some time the slow computer is created a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.140
 something like this 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.320
 ok so we have one more console 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 screen 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.490
 if you see that it traces you because maybe 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.950
 you don't have a very powerful computer vi 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.770
 I recommend closing this console 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 because I don't need so much though I mean though 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.799
 which occupies a lot of ram and therefore 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 could make the computer grow a 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.250
 someone 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.909
 now this is the bin launcher effect 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:49.200
 original then the normal one of the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:52.229
 ftb just have a profile on man kraft 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.409
 puntonet even if you have not purchased 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.049
 the premium is you can do krait profil 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.579
 put the e-mail address then me 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.130
 put in this case the e-mail address 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.219
 and the password of that profile I have 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.090
 created on minecraft puntonet I add it 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.180
 and startup will now win a series of 500 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.980
 billions of tens of millions of errors 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.319
 I let him go safely 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.310
 go ahead and then ask me what you want 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.849
 play offline 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.239
 I at this net point yes 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.489
 but before doing all this 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:30.739
 we have to do a little operation now 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.549
 close to avoid delays more than 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:40.680
 so it will close we have to go to 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:42.329
 insert this zip file in here 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.069
 zip file and you will find it in the description 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:49.769
 which then just go on percentage 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:56.669
 appdata percentage after which I go up 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:03:00.560
 ftp launcher in mod pax agrarian skies è 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:02.069
 insert this zip file ag ryan skies is 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.159
 in here 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.620
 in this folder because this is the 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.780
 mode pack of the gr réan skies without di 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.030
 this year it practically cannot 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.859
 work there because the launcher 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.109
 will try to unload it but not being 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.049
 premium won't let you download it though 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:22.199
 will then step into the description then 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.979
 recapping you go and download the 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:27.479
 launcher from feed b.com the launcher ex o 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:30.180
 also the garden 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:32.629
 then you go here and open the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.209
 launcher the first time and we close it 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.889
 let's go to a percentage appdata 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:43.319
 percentage and let's go about bill effects 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:45.870
 lancer then mode pax a graz skies hq e 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.370
 let's copy here zip files of the grave 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.269
 a sky if we close we restart from here the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.549
 ftv launcher we insert the profile a 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.810
 any profile of minecraft puntonet 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.639
 also not premium 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.500
 let's go ahead and ask to play 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.310
 offline 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.709
 this is the first method the second 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.689
 meanwhile method instead of mine 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.650
 computer blows to java 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:16.329
 platform according to method instead provides 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.259
 the download of a 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:25.240
 this launcher cracked the launcher is this 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:27.610
 here ftb 1.38 in practice and I own it 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.900
 on the desktop so we operate more 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.479
 simple 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.659
 close yourself, my mother 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:38.199
 I open this zip file and find this file 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:41.430
 jar the jar file then copy with coulter 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.430
 c control v 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:46.689
 obviously they must have java installed 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:52.330
 on our pc you wo n't forget that 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:54.490
 is the most important thing continues 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.610
 very good ok at this point we can 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.069
 launch this crack and ftb in this 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.879
 in case we don't need to enter the 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:08.740
 serious package to sky if I go then 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:10.840
 on open with java tn platform 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.009
 I remember these second method with 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.529
 the cracked launcher will ask me to do 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:21.039
 do not do the update for any reason 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.789
 so make it ok now everyone does it 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.819
 download zoi 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.090
 in this case it creates a profile one 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.090
 any 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.580
 I add ok and launch and I feel like it 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.849
 directly in crowd mode here too 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.419
 I will make mistakes I put that ok ok 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:47.319
