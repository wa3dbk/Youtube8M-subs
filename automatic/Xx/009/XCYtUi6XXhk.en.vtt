00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.319
 well it was very good in English to me 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.600
 loved you liked if that is the topic that 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.250
 we composed for the study portal very 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.840
 good good 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.840
 we are talking about the song 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.600
 and good 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 the endless brainstorming just 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.550
 adding incredible 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.240
 what is the theme that the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.829
 guys this month 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.710
 good not very good 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.370
 in fact I was thinking and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.660
 I do not know if it's worth it 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.059
 and the band 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.890
 I do not speak about that 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.180
 no longer let the study is a label of the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.130
 crossbar 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.130
 and you did not leave him alone but Antonio 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.980
 yes it is true 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.350
 we had other reasons too 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.300
 new feel that you have today will be 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 more our video 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.020
 I 'm not 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 yesterday made a decision he thought was 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.400
 intimately correct and I do not 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.400
 I regret me either 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.680
 How about we make a mistake 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.990
 I do not know what if we have to think 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.990
 less in us and more 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.610
 I decided when I told you I made a decision 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 and it was not easy for me yes I know but I 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.770
 I was agreeing last year 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.480
 when I did not know whether to choose between 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.270
 motocross and music 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.319
 you told me who called both 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.999
 and defend them not choosing between one and another 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.999
 I told you hey
