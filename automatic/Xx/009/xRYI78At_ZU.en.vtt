00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.180
 Colomer has remained a whole 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.180
 about an unpleasant point of view that we lost the game 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.400
 Pepote we have lost many of the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.430
 illusions that we had with the league but a baby and on the other hand recognizing 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.900
 that higher education played better than us 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.749
 and stand apart deserves mind 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.339
 percent go slowly May 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.949
 imposes a new zone on us that is that the other is to put us ahead in the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.069
 marker 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.460
 I had given him illusions but I believe that he the 1 1 and the one-two 

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:35.480
 air soon enough then the team does not give him time to sit from there 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.690
 the zone with advantage to the matador is a team that keeps the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.270
 possession of the ball and controlled the game and stateless and we have suffered a lot 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.750
 we have made a tremendous physical effort to try to get closer on the scoreboard 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.200
 It could not be because it's because it's good and there are people 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 and of many and of a lot of quality in those eight years 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.140
 yesterday good night my being she has said guardiola that to review the first leg and 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.640
 who has found the place and decide area for messi 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 which cost raised the match or seeing how it happened match if 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.670
 done something else 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.030
 Buenos Aires and I remembered when we played the first leg drums 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.400
 a few meters back i and that the world criticized the way to play as 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.580
 we wanted to play with a small team 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.580
 and we were about to get a positive result 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.050
 percent today france that Real Madrid had in the match 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.870
 we are playing practically all put league we have no choice 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.940
 to go ahead and look for them Saturday their field 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.859
 the webos done for 20 25 minutes pretty well 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.060
 and not only for his goal against the score but with these spaces and with that net or 

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.980
 the Barcelona 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.760
 is lethal as practically happened but we have no other choice but to 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.000
 you have to take those risks 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.970
 and I am convinced that at this moment it is not going to be difficult to play him back 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.800
 or ahead and then well, unfortunately for us, it has gone well 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.429
 or the hump percent percents you think it's real the difference that in topic of debate 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.900
 to the result or that is that the tamayazo especially bad 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.159
 well I think that what is exposed at this moment is a step 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.399
 above barcelona 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:20.039
 what is certain is that it is shown that superior but they begin 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:24.299
 the first goals we have received has been for errors that we did not expect and 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.769
 that has facilitated the ldl the result that we say so exaggerated not 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.259
 but it is that when we are behind on the scoreboard and it did not work 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.069
 we have to burn the ships sections with many forwards maybe we were a 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.189
 little bit unbalanced but not but we had to try big of 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:41.639
 either way
