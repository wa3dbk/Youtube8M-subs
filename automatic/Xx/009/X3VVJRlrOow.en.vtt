00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 sharpshooter black ops 2 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:18.720
 yes i only want very short video 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.949

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 no rodrik now again 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.670
 before that I KVIP itself, I think I 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.810
 more than that, I'm holding something again 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.439
 but she does not want to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.060
 -keep 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.250
 But I have to say that is not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 only on me should also in the thriller mails 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 somehow not so I'm gonna go 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.489
 with that is to say we can so 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.540
 not on because I just know 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.250
 not what's wrong with him, maybe 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.780
 From this one says to clarify the relief 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.350
 Which of course is more important than 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.930
 youtube so there you should understand 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 if anything has to clarify there 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.309
 somehow yes already has priorities 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.390
 put so try it anyway 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.399
 rauszuhauen few videos 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.199
 because it just makes me play 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.160
 Buying addict how much fun 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.680
 I must say 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.150
 although I still loose and so 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.140
 but somehow makes me really head more 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.960
 fun just because of festivals from 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 I also have a bit of black ops 1 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 Try again mw3 can be really good 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 did you build 5006 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.049
 I expected it to 2,000 or 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 even 5000 if I'm pretty nice 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.330
 So definitely with it come 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.640
 either a bit more, I know 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 not if that is the case with ours and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.720
 documents ready if not wrong 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.680
 when we finish 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.049
 We will definitely be there 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 we'll even discuss the end 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.950
 not but i dont know who to tell me 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.310
 Now we're done there 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.869

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.890

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.560

 the chamber showed not least fashion fiercer 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.960
 type one so that depends on the tests 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.750
 had suspected men when we were three 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.650
