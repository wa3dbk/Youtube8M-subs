00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:30.359
 hello friends of the guinea pigs here 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:32.969
 you catch with a small group of dwarf guinea pigs 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.500
 three months to explain the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.050
 differences between one and the other 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.829
 This group of guinea pigs is short haired 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.140
 the guinea pigs are basically divided into 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.030
 short hair guinea pigs and hair guinea pigs 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.769
 long and inside the hair guinea pigs 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.199
 short we also have a great variety 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.530
 of tonalities that I will now enter 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.199
 detail if you want we start with the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.100
 from my right we're going to see if we 're 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 all still the tricolor guinea pig is very 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.160
 simple is called tricolor because it has 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.479
 three colors in this case white brown 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.420
 and an ear patch in black 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.340
 well we follow then for the most 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.020
 small of all the hair guinea pigs 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.789
 short fix that miniature with three 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.110
 months a wonder is called guinea pig 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.750
 Dutch and the same as the rabbit 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.500
 Dutch is a guinea pig that crosses 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.290
 a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.840
 white white stripe 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.870
 more you look there and if it's more 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.790
 little one that the rest and you will ask 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.950
 smallest what is the normal size of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.250
 a guinea pig the normal size of a 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 adult guinea pig depends on whether it is male or 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.660
 it is female normally females weight 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.960
 adult is between 800 grams and one kilo 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.910
 200 while the males go for a 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.710
 kilo up to a kilo and a half to the 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.630
 bigger that as long as no 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 they are fat because if they get fat 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.970
 we can still get to overcome 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.050
 those weights very well let's continue for 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.260
 the 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.690
 and Malay short hair and in color and Malay 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.030
 the himalayas 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.140
 is a guinea pig, fundamentally white or 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.300
 toast with the red eyes and with the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.920
 tip of the extremities of your body 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.750
 in black the tip of the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.030
 limbs we are talking about ears 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.990
 legs 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.990
 snout 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.470
 back legs and hands and legs of 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.070
 behind 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.230
 and we finish with the Dalmatian that is like 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.810
 the dog a marbled guinea pig 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.100
 with the white background normally and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.470
 Marbled in brown or black 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.050
 Very well, you see there, although all 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.810
 they look very similar there are very colors 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.000
 different from each other but yes all 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.750
 encompassed within the group of guinea pigs 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.750
 short hair
