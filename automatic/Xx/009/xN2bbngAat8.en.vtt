00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.260
 chickens are reared on a farm 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.839
 rabbits if you count the heads are 87 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.080
 and if they count the parts are 212 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.930
 how many animals there are of each class 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.450
 to solve this problem we must 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.080
 define first that the variables 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.789
 let say 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.149
 x 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.149
 are going to be the number of chickens there 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.780
 and that is going to be the number of rabbits that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.780
 there is in the farm 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.640
 the problem that if we count the heads 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:58.200
 there are 87 between hens and rabbits there are 187 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:05.440
 animals of the first equation would be 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:07.900
 x m and equal to 87 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.990
 the second act tells us that if 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.370
 count the potatoes are 212 we have to 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.430
 check 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.230
 that a whale has two legs that we 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.180
 it would be 2x 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.240
 and the rabbits 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:32.570
 must have four legs 34 and this of 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.570
 be equal to 212 which are the legs 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.940
 here we have the system already raised 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.070
 let's solve it by one of the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.910
 methods that we know and we're going to do it 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.440
 by the method of reduction or elimination 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.390
 and remembering that these two terms 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.010
 they must be exactly the same but 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.940
 with signs against him therefore 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.240
 let's multiply by 2 and here 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.579
 for 1 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.979
 but as they have opposite signs one 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.280
 from this to be negative the indifferent 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.340
 place anyone at least 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.450
 remember that this 2 will multiply 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.780
 the x to yesterday and the 87 that we would have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:27.880
 then for x2 x 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:30.610
 + 2 because 27 and 42 by 87 gives us a hundred 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.260
 74 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.910
 equally the -1 multiply two more by 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.100
 less than at least two x 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.700
 - One by four more for less note 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.720
 less 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:54.180
 4 and equal minus one for more 212 gives us 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.180
 minus 200 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.040
 let's add 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.790
 this two schools are canceled 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.390
 in all but 4 we would give 2 and see what 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.880
 contrary signs are subtracted and placed 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.920
 the sign of greater than the greatest 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.130
 negatively we have less 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.390
 two 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.530
 202 74 gives us 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.520
 38 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.360
 without the opposites the greater is negative 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:35.350
 so it's minus 38 this minus 2 that 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:41.130
 is multiplying to happen to divide with 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:44.470
 the same sign of notary minus 38 over 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.570
 minus 2 remember that when it is 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.020
 multiplying exactly to go with 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.730
 the same end 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:59.590
 then we have that is already equal to less 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.950
 for less gives us more 38 2 note 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.860
 19 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.140
 what does it mean ? 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.110
 we had said to arrive are rabbits 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.490
 so 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.209
 we say there are 19 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.699
 rabbits on the farm 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.370
 and we are going to find the number of hens 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.440
 what's on the farm and we take 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.880
 any of the equations we are going to take 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.449
 the first 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:34.920
 x mayer but we said it was 19 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.610
 is equal to 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.289
 87 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.590
 19 that is positive to spend 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.619
 3x negative equal 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.980
 87 - 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:56.900
 19 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:05:00.880
 and 87 -19 note 68 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.880
 what does this 68 mean 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:10.249
 we have said that x2 barinas loves you 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.220
 say that the farm there are 68 chickens 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:16.810
 conclusion 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.170
 there are 19 rabbits and 68 chickens in the 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.170
 farm
