basically I was here in the box and was

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.269 
basically I was here in the box and was
like<00:00:16.209> whoa<00:00:16.570> what<00:00:17.560> is<00:00:17.710> this<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.710> as<00:00:20.920> you<00:00:21.099> heard

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
like whoa what is this and as you heard

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.640 
like whoa what is this and as you heard
from<00:00:21.460> that<00:00:21.550> person<00:00:21.880> just<00:00:22.060> there<00:00:22.420> I<00:00:22.689> think<00:00:23.529> it

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
from that person just there I think it

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.140 
from that person just there I think it
seems<00:00:23.860> to<00:00:23.950> be<00:00:24.040> a<00:00:24.070> bomb<00:00:24.279> of<00:00:24.430> some<00:00:24.550> kind<00:00:24.759> but<00:00:25.119> I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
seems to be a bomb of some kind but I

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.030 
seems to be a bomb of some kind but I
think<00:00:25.570> it's<00:00:25.750> something<00:00:25.960> more<00:00:26.320> first<00:00:26.919> of<00:00:27.009> all

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
think it's something more first of all

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
and i was going to kind of try and

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.810 
and i was going to kind of try and
activate<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.500> later<00:00:47.769> on<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:47.949> certain<00:00:48.399> point<00:00:48.579> and

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
activate a later on a certain point and

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.549 
activate a later on a certain point and
especially<00:00:49.750> always<00:00:50.019> hit<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.199> box<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.530> couple

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559

especially always hit the box a couple
of<00:00:50.829> times<00:00:51.010> 7<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.429> Chimeran<00:00:51.910> see<00:00:52.149> it<00:00:52.210> still

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
of times 7 the Chimeran see it still

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.110 
of times 7 the Chimeran see it still
sitting<00:00:52.690> there<00:00:52.839> on<00:00:52.929> the<00:00:53.019> floor<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.699> basically

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
sitting there on the floor but basically

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.790 
sitting there on the floor but basically
I<00:00:55.239> just<00:00:55.539> kind<00:00:55.780> of<00:00:55.839> wanted<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.199> have<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.350> go<00:00:56.589> and

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
I just kind of wanted to have a go and

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.610 
I just kind of wanted to have a go and
see<00:00:56.890> what<00:00:57.160> actually<00:00:57.489> did<00:00:57.789> so<00:00:58.480> as<00:00:59.170> you<00:00:59.410> can<00:00:59.469> see

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
see what actually did so as you can see

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.130 
see what actually did so as you can see
kind<00:00:59.859> of<00:00:59.949> from<00:01:00.159> floor<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:00.760> there<00:01:01.149> we<00:01:01.239> go<00:01:01.449> I<00:01:01.659> was

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
kind of from floor and there we go I was

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.689 
kind of from floor and there we go I was
thinking<00:01:02.260> actually<00:01:02.559> because<00:01:02.949> basically<00:01:03.519> you

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
thinking actually because basically you

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:04.920 
thinking actually because basically you
have<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.909> get<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.120> big<00:01:04.300> guy<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.510> kind<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:04.809> open

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
have to get the big guy to kind of open

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
up juggernog as you see right now you

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600 
up juggernog as you see right now you
can<00:01:07.750> hear<00:01:07.900> it<00:01:07.990> ticking<00:01:08.140> man<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.860> hit<00:01:08.980> go<00:01:09.220> the

unfortunately<00:01:16.710> rookie<00:01:17.710> arrow<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:18.100> there

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
unfortunately rookie arrow just there

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.069 
unfortunately rookie arrow just there
myself<00:01:18.549> decided<00:01:19.149> to<00:01:19.390> kill<00:01:19.600> myself<00:01:19.780> by

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079

with<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.180> Juggernog<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.689> may<00:01:22.899> be<00:01:22.960> fought<00:01:23.290> over

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
with a Juggernog you may be fought over

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.050 
with a Juggernog you may be fought over
it<00:01:23.829> and<00:01:23.950> kind<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.159> glitch<00:01:24.430> yourself<00:01:24.820> into

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
it and kind of glitch yourself into

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.459 
it and kind of glitch yourself into
there<00:01:25.210> may<00:01:25.420> be<00:01:25.450> something<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.110> just<00:01:26.140> want<00:01:26.439> to

there may be something I just want to

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.260 
there may be something I just want to
try<00:01:26.649> out<00:01:26.860> what<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.100> never<00:01:27.280> know<00:01:27.430> if<00:01:27.790> it<00:01:28.030> works

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
try out what you never know if it works

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.069 
try out what you never know if it works
it<00:01:28.479> works<00:01:28.509> it's<00:01:28.899> a<00:01:28.960> glitch<00:01:30.659> there<00:01:31.659> we<00:01:31.750> go<00:01:31.899> guys

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
it works it's a glitch there we go guys

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.770 
it works it's a glitch there we go guys
so<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.619> is<00:01:32.770> pretty<00:01:33.130> cool<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.969> there<00:01:34.180> is<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
so this is pretty cool that there is the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.719 
so this is pretty cool that there is the
time<00:01:35.020> bomb<00:01:35.320> basically<00:01:36.070> works<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.430> kind<00:01:36.579> of

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
time bomb basically works is kind of

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.580 
time bomb basically works is kind of
teleporters<00:01:37.329> kind<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.659> safe<00:01:37.869> back<00:01:38.170> at<00:01:38.200> maybe

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
teleporters kind of safe back at maybe
