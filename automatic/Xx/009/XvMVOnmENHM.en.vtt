00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
played now without having to deal with

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.130 
played now without having to deal with
the<00:02:25.740> airport<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.180> Goodyear<00:02:27.570> blimp<00:02:27.600> like<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
the airport the Goodyear blimp like I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
the airport the Goodyear blimp like I
said<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.500> my<00:02:28.530> other<00:02:28.800> commentary<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.240> that's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
said in my other commentary so that's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.260 
said in my other commentary so that's
pretty<00:02:30.720> good<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.980> usually<00:02:32.490> don't<00:02:32.550> run<00:02:32.850> attack

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
pretty good I usually don't run attack

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030 
pretty good I usually don't run attack
helicopter<00:02:33.960> as<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.320> see<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> got<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.740> tech

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
helicopter as you see I got a tech

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.680 
helicopter as you see I got a tech
helicopter<00:02:35.610> there<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.910> i<00:02:35.940> usually<00:02:36.240> don't<00:02:36.450> run

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
helicopter there and i usually don't run

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.140 
helicopter there and i usually don't run
attack<00:02:36.990> helicopter<00:02:37.740> but<00:02:38.370> i<00:02:38.640> think<00:02:38.820> i<00:02:39.030> was

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
attack helicopter but i think i was

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.360 
attack helicopter but i think i was
switching<00:02:39.330> my<00:02:39.510> killstreaks<00:02:39.810> up<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.860> just

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
switching my killstreaks up and I just

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.090 
switching my killstreaks up and I just
ended<00:02:41.880> up<00:02:42.920> having<00:02:43.920> attack<00:02:44.910> helicopter<00:02:45.780> and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
ended up having attack helicopter and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.920 
ended up having attack helicopter and
having<00:02:47.100> pave<00:02:47.310> low<00:02:47.550> but<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.240> as<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.660> can<00:02:48.810> see

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.720 
having pave low but you as you can see

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
you can't call them both in at the same

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.790 
you can't call them both in at the same
time<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.210> don't<00:02:52.170> know<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.410> guys<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.770> that

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the same time as soon as the attack

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.820 
the same time as soon as the attack
helicopters<00:03:03.690> either<00:03:03.810> destroyed<00:03:04.380> or<00:03:04.560> blown

out<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.160> air<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:06.210> pave<00:03:06.420> low<00:03:06.600> will

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
out of the air the pave low will

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.830 
out of the air the pave low will
automatically<00:03:07.380> come<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:09.510> was<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.660> nice

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
automatically come in that was a nice

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.350 
automatically come in that was a nice
shot<00:03:09.870> there<00:03:11.990> so<00:03:13.370> yeah<00:03:14.370> modded<00:03:14.790> controllers

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
shot there so yeah modded controllers

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.810 
shot there so yeah modded controllers
now<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.830> see<00:03:17.070> some<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.430> my<00:03:17.520> clips

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
now and you can see some of my clips

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.680 
now and you can see some of my clips
here<00:03:18.000> when<00:03:18.960> I<00:03:18.990> do<00:03:19.950> use<00:03:20.220> my<00:03:20.400> USP<00:03:20.700> 45<00:03:21.180> when<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.540> pull

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
here when I do use my USP 45 when I pull

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.720 
here when I do use my USP 45 when I pull
out<00:03:21.720> my<00:03:21.810> USP<00:03:22.200> 45<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.700> know<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.630> only<00:03:24.780> takes<00:03:25.050> I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
out my USP 45 you know I it only takes I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.150 
out my USP 45 you know I it only takes I
think<00:03:26.730> two<00:03:27.150> or<00:03:27.480> three<00:03:27.840> shots<00:03:28.080> with<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.410> USP<00:03:28.860> 45

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
think two or three shots with the USP 45

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.120 
think two or three shots with the USP 45
i<00:03:29.340> believe<00:03:29.760> its<00:03:29.910> own<00:03:30.060> only<00:03:30.690> two<00:03:30.990> with<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.680> USP

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
i believe its own only two with the USP

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.710 
i believe its own only two with the USP
45<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.820> think<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.180> dependent<00:03:33.660> on

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
45 and I think it's dependent on

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.190 
45 and I think it's dependent on
distance<00:03:34.290> also<00:03:34.800> but<00:03:35.580> from<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.240> medium<00:03:36.660> distance

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
distance also but from a medium distance

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.570 
distance also but from a medium distance
or<00:03:37.350> Coast<00:03:37.620> quarters<00:03:38.220> distance<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:40.200> really<00:03:41.130> you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
or Coast quarters distance it really you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.640 
or Coast quarters distance it really you
don't<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.720> know<00:03:42.870> spam<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.500> or

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
don't have to you know spam it or

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.380 
don't have to you know spam it or
whatever<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> mean<00:03:44.520> just<00:03:44.820> press<00:03:45.209> both

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
triggers at the same time like twice and

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.360 
triggers at the same time like twice and
boom<00:03:49.080> they're<00:03:49.380> dead<00:03:51.080> but<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.380> few<00:03:52.890> games<00:03:53.160> i've

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.710 
that's just pressing the triggers at the
same<00:04:01.800> time<00:04:02.040> maybe<00:04:02.910> those<00:04:03.090> people<00:04:03.420> are<00:04:03.540> on

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
same time maybe those people are on

same time maybe those people are on
default<00:04:04.350> layout<00:04:04.650> instead<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.550> tactical<00:04:06.030> or

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180

you<00:04:15.090> can<00:04:15.300> get<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.350> hitmarker<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:17.250> can<00:04:17.430> drop

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
you can get a hitmarker you can drop

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.520 
you can get a hitmarker you can drop
down<00:04:18.049> MLG<00:04:19.049> pro<00:04:19.470> style<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:21.020> once<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:22.109> get<00:04:22.290> that

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
down MLG pro style and once you get that

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.640 
down MLG pro style and once you get that
that<00:04:23.100> MLG<00:04:23.640> pro<00:04:24.290> drop<00:04:25.290> down<00:04:25.560> then

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
that MLG pro drop down then

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.680 
that MLG pro drop down then
take<00:04:26.919> them<00:04:27.100> out<00:04:27.250> for<00:04:27.460> if<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.360> get<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.509> hitmarker

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
take them out for if you get a hitmarker

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.680 
take them out for if you get a hitmarker
you<00:04:29.169> know<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.410> could<00:04:29.680> run<00:04:30.040> behind<00:04:30.669> cover<00:04:31.270> run

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
you know you could run behind cover run

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.890 
you know you could run behind cover run
around<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.139> corner<00:04:32.199> and<00:04:33.449> switch<00:04:34.449> real<00:04:34.690> fast

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
around the corner and switch real fast

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.749 
around the corner and switch real fast
and<00:04:35.199> then<00:04:35.259> hop<00:04:35.710> back<00:04:35.740> out<00:04:36.130> usually<00:04:36.610> they're

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
and then hop back out usually they're

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:37.740 
and then hop back out usually they're
trying<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.030> wait<00:04:37.180> for<00:04:37.389> you<00:04:37.449> to<00:04:37.539> come<00:04:37.630> around

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
trying to wait for you to come around

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.930 
trying to wait for you to come around
opponent<00:04:38.199> home<00:04:38.320> they're<00:04:38.530> dead<00:04:38.710> unless<00:04:39.669> it's<00:04:39.850> a

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
opponent home they're dead unless it's a

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.990 
opponent home they're dead unless it's a
shotgun<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.479> course<00:04:41.130> because<00:04:42.130> nothing<00:04:42.759> beats

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
shotgun of course because nothing beats

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.409 
shotgun of course because nothing beats
a<00:04:43.210> shotgun<00:04:43.750> at<00:04:43.960> close<00:04:44.650> range<00:04:45.009> I<00:04:45.310> don't<00:04:45.940> think<00:04:46.180> I

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
a shotgun at close range I don't think I

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.120 
a shotgun at close range I don't think I
know<00:04:46.810> some<00:04:47.080> people<00:04:47.110> have<00:04:47.380> modded<00:04:47.680> controllers

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
know some people have modded controllers

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.540 
know some people have modded controllers
for<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.970> foul<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.720> mean<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:50.620> can<00:04:50.740> tell<00:04:50.979> some

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
for the foul I mean you can tell some

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.480 
for the foul I mean you can tell some
people<00:04:51.789> have<00:04:51.940> for<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.270> m21<00:04:52.840> EBR<00:04:53.310> stuff<00:04:54.310> like

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
people have for the m21 EBR stuff like

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.120 
people have for the m21 EBR stuff like
that<00:04:54.520> but<00:04:55.090> i<00:04:55.360> mean<00:04:55.840> i<00:04:56.199> don't<00:04:57.039> know<00:04:57.130> i<00:04:58.110> think

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
that but i mean i don't know i think

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.070 
that but i mean i don't know i think
modded<00:05:00.130> controllers<00:05:00.550> for<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.880> foul<00:05:01.150> really

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
modded controllers for the foul really

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.810 
modded controllers for the foul really
don't<00:05:02.380> give<00:05:02.590> you<00:05:02.710> an<00:05:02.800> advantage<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.580> foul<00:05:03.789> is

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
don't give you an advantage the foul is

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.590 
don't give you an advantage the foul is
a<00:05:03.970> two-shot<00:05:04.539> burst<00:05:04.870> with<00:05:05.940> holographic<00:05:06.940> sight

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
a two-shot burst with holographic sight

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.990 
a two-shot burst with holographic sight
I<00:05:07.810> believe<00:05:08.260> it's<00:05:08.470> holographic<00:05:09.039> sight<00:05:09.250> it's<00:05:09.520> a

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
I believe it's holographic sight it's a

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.870 
I believe it's holographic sight it's a
two<00:05:10.210> shot<00:05:10.449> burst<00:05:10.750> from<00:05:11.229> any<00:05:11.530> distance<00:05:12.070> it's<00:05:12.550> an

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
two shot burst from any distance it's an

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.360 
two shot burst from any distance it's an
infinite<00:05:13.510> damage<00:05:14.440> range<00:05:14.680> for<00:05:14.979> the<00:05:15.070> for<00:05:15.340> the

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
infinite damage range for the for the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.600 
infinite damage range for the for the
foul<00:05:16.199> now<00:05:17.199> it's<00:05:17.380> not<00:05:17.500> meant<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.919> be<00:05:18.010> fired<00:05:18.340> so

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
foul now it's not meant to be fired so

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.939 
foul now it's not meant to be fired so
fast<00:05:18.940> as<00:05:19.330> as<00:05:19.570> people<00:05:20.050> have<00:05:20.229> a<00:05:20.530> modded

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
fast as as people have a modded

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.580 
fast as as people have a modded
controller<00:05:21.280> but<00:05:21.669> I<00:05:21.910> mean<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:22.930> can<00:05:23.080> snipe<00:05:23.349> with

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
controller but I mean you can snipe with

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.939 
controller but I mean you can snipe with
the<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:23.919> up<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.430> up<00:05:24.699> and<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.780> can<00:05:26.020> snipe<00:05:26.320> also

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
the you up and up and you can snipe also

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.960 
the you up and up and you can snipe also
with<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:28.020> what's<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.169> gun<00:05:29.590> you<00:05:29.979> can<00:05:30.130> also<00:05:30.580> snipe

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
with the what's a gun you can also snipe

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.260 
with the what's a gun you can also snipe
with<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.919> fête<00:05:32.919> world<00:05:33.160> of<00:05:33.340> family<00:05:33.639> so<00:05:33.820> I<00:05:34.060> don't

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
with the fête world of family so I don't

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.029 
with the fête world of family so I don't
know<00:05:34.330> why<00:05:34.449> though<00:05:34.660> many<00:05:35.169> up<00:05:35.320> but<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:35.889> can

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
know why though many up but you can

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.070 
know why though many up but you can
snipe<00:05:36.340> also<00:05:36.789> with<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:37.000> famous<00:05:37.210> and<00:05:37.630> and<00:05:37.840> with

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
snipe also with the famous and and with

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.110 
snipe also with the famous and and with
the<00:05:38.199> m16<00:05:38.740> so<00:05:38.979> that's<00:05:39.220> that's<00:05:39.460> really<00:05:39.639> not<00:05:39.970> that

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
the m16 so that's that's really not that

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.570 
the m16 so that's that's really not that
bad<00:05:40.360> or<00:05:40.630> at<00:05:41.110> that<00:05:41.289> hard<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:43.900> think<00:05:44.380> in<00:05:44.740> the

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
bad or at that hard so I think in the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.529 
bad or at that hard so I think in the
end<00:05:45.610> really<00:05:46.389> the<00:05:46.510> way<00:05:46.630> I<00:05:46.659> look<00:05:46.930> at<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.380> is<00:05:48.539> if

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
end really the way I look at it is is if

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.089 
end really the way I look at it is is if
you<00:05:49.720> have<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:49.840> modded<00:05:50.169> controller<00:05:50.470> for<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.770> foul

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
you have a modded controller for a foul

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.050 
you have a modded controller for a foul
then<00:05:51.760> it<00:05:52.270> really<00:05:53.400> doesn't<00:05:54.400> affect<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.880> game

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
then it really doesn't affect the game

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.339 
then it really doesn't affect the game
that<00:05:55.270> much<00:05:55.510> because<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:58.030> foul<00:05:58.330> is<00:05:58.690> just

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
that much because the foul is just

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.500 
that much because the foul is just
another<00:05:59.680> gun<00:06:00.039> that<00:06:00.400> somebody<00:06:00.849> wants<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.240> use

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
another gun that somebody wants to use

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.810 
another gun that somebody wants to use
and<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.020> makes<00:06:02.560> it<00:06:02.680> viable<00:06:03.039> I<00:06:03.280> guess<00:06:03.520> if<00:06:03.699> you

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
and it makes it viable I guess if you

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.740 
and it makes it viable I guess if you
have<00:06:03.909> a<00:06:03.940> modded<00:06:04.300> controller<00:06:05.610> so<00:06:06.610> yeah<00:06:07.539> I<00:06:07.570> go

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
have a modded controller so yeah I go

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.170 
have a modded controller so yeah I go
thirty<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.260> seven<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:08.860> that's<00:06:09.669> in<00:06:10.000> this

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
thirty and seven and that's in this

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.390 
thirty and seven and that's in this
