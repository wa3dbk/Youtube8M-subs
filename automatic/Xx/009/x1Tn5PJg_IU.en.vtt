connected to a USB hub it's a very slim
USB<00:00:42.420> hub<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:43.469> four<00:00:43.710> ports<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.190> were

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
USB hub it's about four ports we were

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
USB hub it's about four ports we were
using<00:00:44.519> one<00:00:44.820> port<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.300> air<00:00:45.510> remote<00:00:45.780> one

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
using one port for the air remote one

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.090 
using one port for the air remote one
for<00:00:46.769> the<00:00:47.210> camera<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.199> USB<00:00:49.829> flash

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
for the camera and one for USB flash
drive<00:00:50.429> or<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> hard<00:00:51.359> drive<00:00:51.539> so

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
drive or you can use a hard drive so

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.979 
drive or you can use a hard drive so
let's<00:00:52.500> plug<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.510> I'll<00:00:54.510> tell<00:00:54.899> you

let's plug it back in and I'll tell you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.259 
let's plug it back in and I'll tell you
a<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.410> about<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.769> remotes<00:00:56.070> so

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.700 

basically<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.690> standard<00:01:00.899> infrared<00:01:01.530> remote

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
basically the standard infrared remote

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.460 
basically the standard infrared remote
that<00:01:02.010> comes<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> pocket<00:01:02.789> TV<00:01:03.089> is<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:04.110> much

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that comes with a pocket TV is very much

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.790 
that comes with a pocket TV is very much
like<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> Apple<00:01:05.339> TV<00:01:05.840> remote<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.470> uses

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
like the Apple TV remote it uses

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.270 
like the Apple TV remote it uses
infrared

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
infrared

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
infrared
it's<00:01:08.550> got<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:08.909> down<00:01:09.150> sideways<00:01:09.540> buttons<00:01:10.079> menu

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it's got up down sideways buttons menu

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.130 
it's got up down sideways buttons menu
buttons<00:01:11.130> etc<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.570> does<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
buttons etc and what it does is it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.550 
buttons etc and what it does is it
connects<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:14.640> infrared<00:01:15.060> cable<00:01:15.900> that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
connects to this infrared cable that

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.310 
connects to this infrared cable that
then<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.310> other<00:01:17.460> end<00:01:17.930> connects<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
then the other end connects to the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.819 
then the other end connects to the
pocket<00:01:19.650> TV<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.880> plug<00:01:21.329> it<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.509> there

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
pocket TV so you just plug it in there

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.440 
pocket TV so you just plug it in there
then<00:01:22.829> it<00:01:22.950> gives<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.399> basic<00:01:23.790> functionality

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
then it gives you a basic functionality

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.840 
then it gives you a basic functionality
that<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> would<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.369> click<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.579> down

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that you would then just click up down

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.080 
that you would then just click up down
sideways<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.720> control<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> pocket<00:01:28.950> TV<00:01:29.810> but

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
sideways and control the pocket TV but

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.490 
sideways and control the pocket TV but
the<00:01:33.090> air<00:01:33.210> remote<00:01:33.509> izi<00:01:33.719> is<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> more<00:01:34.259> intuitive

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the air remote izi is a more intuitive

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.130 
the air remote izi is a more intuitive
easier<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.490> remote<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.360> gives<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.750> some

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
easier to use remote it gives you some

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.359 
easier to use remote it gives you some
more<00:01:37.259> functionalities<00:01:37.920> let's<00:01:38.159> look<00:01:38.340> more

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
more functionalities let's look more

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.100 
more functionalities let's look more
let's<00:01:39.149> look<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> air<00:01:39.600> remote<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> little

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
let's look at the air remote a little

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
let's look at the air remote a little
bit<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.909> all<00:01:41.909> right<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.479> we're<00:01:42.689> gonna<00:01:42.810> just

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
bit more all right so we're gonna just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.039 
bit more all right so we're gonna just
start<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.590> our<00:01:43.829> conserve<00:01:44.430> age<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> this

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
start up with our conserve age so this

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
start up with our conserve age so this
is<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:47.189> browser<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.969> we're<00:01:48.090> running

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
is now just a browser that we're running

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.959 
is now just a browser that we're running
on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> Ice<00:01:48.750> Cream<00:01:49.020> Sandwich<00:01:49.049> browser<00:01:49.969> that

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
on the Ice Cream Sandwich browser that

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.899 
on the Ice Cream Sandwich browser that
comes<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.680> with<00:01:52.680> Android<00:01:53.399> Ice<00:01:53.850> Cream

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
comes with with with Android Ice Cream
