that's a point that's often debated by a
lot<00:00:59.799> of<00:00:59.830> football<00:01:00.070> coaches<00:01:00.670> we<00:01:01.180> feel<00:01:01.449> that<00:01:01.600> if

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
lot of football coaches we feel that if

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.939 
lot of football coaches we feel that if
you<00:01:01.809> hold<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.080> ball<00:01:02.229> on<00:01:02.260> your<00:01:02.440> strong<00:01:02.739> arm

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
you hold the ball on your strong arm

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.439 
you hold the ball on your strong arm
you're<00:01:03.129> much<00:01:03.280> less<00:01:03.460> likely<00:01:03.519> to<00:01:04.000> turn<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.330> over

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
you're much less likely to turn it over

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.149 
you're much less likely to turn it over
and<00:01:04.780> we're<00:01:05.019> going<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.170> hold<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.500> ball<00:01:05.710> high
