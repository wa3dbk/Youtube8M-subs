this<00:00:13.349> phone<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.580> haven't<00:00:14.880> seen<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> lot<00:00:15.269> of

information for those of us that came or

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.120 
information for those of us that came or
coming<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.000> Nexus<00:00:18.359> 5<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.800> wanted<00:00:20.039> to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
coming from the Nexus 5 so I wanted to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.830 
coming from the Nexus 5 so I wanted to
provide<00:00:20.340> basically<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> major<00:00:21.359> differences

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
provide basically the major differences

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.790 
provide basically the major differences
between<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.320> Nexus<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.490> oneplus<00:00:24.359> one

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
between the Nexus and the oneplus one

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
between the Nexus and the oneplus one
now<00:00:25.800> I've<00:00:25.980> been<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> loyal<00:00:26.640> Nexus<00:00:27.300> user

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
now I've been a loyal Nexus user

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.990 
now I've been a loyal Nexus user
probably<00:00:28.199> since<00:00:28.500> well<00:00:28.710> since<00:00:28.859> nexus<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.730> came

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
probably since well since nexus one came

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.179 
probably since well since nexus one came
out<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.330> January<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> 2010<00:00:31.410> when<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.920> switched

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
out in January of 2010 when I switched

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.690 
out in January of 2010 when I switched
from<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> iphone<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:35.040> I've<00:00:35.219> used<00:00:35.460> every

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
from the iphone and and I've used every

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000 
from the iphone and and I've used every
Nexus<00:00:35.969> since<00:00:36.360> I'd<00:00:36.719> had<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> brief<00:00:37.320> stint<00:00:37.649> with

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
Nexus since I'd had a brief stint with

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
Nexus since I'd had a brief stint with
the<00:00:38.070> galaxy<00:00:38.910> s3<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.629> bit<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.870> time

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the galaxy s3 for a little bit of time

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.750 
the galaxy s3 for a little bit of time
then<00:00:40.260> switch<00:00:40.500> back<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.100> Nexus<00:00:41.579> line

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
then switch back to the Nexus line

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.240 
then switch back to the Nexus line
because<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> preferred<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.930> stock<00:00:43.590> Android

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because I preferred the stock Android

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.360 
because I preferred the stock Android
experience<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.649> question<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.010> becomes

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
experience so the question then becomes

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.700 
experience so the question then becomes
does<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:49.140> best<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.160> 1+1<00:00:51.230> best<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
does the one best or the 1+1 best the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.060 
does the one best or the 1+1 best the
the<00:00:53.309> Nexus<00:00:53.610> 5<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.969> would<00:00:54.090> say<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.539> does

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
the Nexus 5 and I would say that it does

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.340 
the Nexus 5 and I would say that it does
and<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.420> couple<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.719> differences<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.260> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and just a couple of differences that I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
and just a couple of differences that I
wanted<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> highlight<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.309> why<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> think<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
wanted to highlight and why I think this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
wanted to highlight and why I think this
is<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.570> better<00:01:00.780> phone<00:01:01.170> than<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> nexus<00:01:02.489> phone

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
is a better phone than the nexus phone

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.630 
is a better phone than the nexus phone
the<00:01:03.000> nexus<00:01:03.390> 5<00:01:04.010> certainly<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.250> wait<00:01:05.460> until

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the nexus 5 certainly you can wait until

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.250 
the nexus 5 certainly you can wait until
perhaps<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.299> Nexus<00:01:06.570> 6<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> come<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
perhaps the Nexus 6 to come out but that

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
perhaps the Nexus 6 to come out but that
most<00:01:07.590> likely<00:01:07.950> won't<00:01:08.130> happen<00:01:08.250> until<00:01:08.520> November

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
most likely won't happen until November

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.460 
most likely won't happen until November
which<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.299> when<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.570> typically<00:01:09.869> release<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
which is when they typically release the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.679 
which is when they typically release the
Nexus<00:01:10.770> line<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:11.670> most<00:01:11.850> likely<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> very

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
Nexus line it will most likely be a very

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.719 
Nexus line it will most likely be a very
similar<00:01:12.930> spec<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.159> most<00:01:14.369> likely<00:01:14.580> be

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
similar spec and it will most likely be

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.630 
similar spec and it will most likely be
a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.570> more<00:01:15.720> expensive<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.770> all

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
a little bit more expensive so all

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
a little bit more expensive so all
things<00:01:17.850> considered<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
things considered I do think this is a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.370 
things considered I do think this is a
better<00:01:19.830> phone<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.400> let<00:01:20.520> me<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.820> into<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
better phone but let me just go into the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.010 
better phone but let me just go into the
the<00:01:22.380> big<00:01:22.530> differences<00:01:23.090> perhaps<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.810> one

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the big differences perhaps the the one

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
the big differences perhaps the the one
that's<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> most<00:01:25.670> debated<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that's the most debated with the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
that's the most debated with the
exception<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:27.930> plus<00:01:28.290> invite<00:01:28.710> system

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
exception of the one plus invite system

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.359 
exception of the one plus invite system
itself<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:31.049> sheer<00:01:31.320> size<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.040> device

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
itself is the sheer size of this device

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.810 
itself is the sheer size of this device
the<00:01:33.240> question<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.840> too<00:01:34.200> big<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:35.700> was

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the question is is it too big that was

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
the question is is it too big that was
my<00:01:35.970> skepticism<00:01:36.689> when<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> first<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:38.130> looking

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
my skepticism when I first I was looking

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.890 
my skepticism when I first I was looking
to<00:01:38.430> purchase<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.970> phone<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.420> once<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.780> an

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to purchase this phone and once I got an

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.770 
to purchase this phone and once I got an
invite<00:01:40.140> i<00:01:40.400> bought<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> phone<00:01:41.729> now<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.689> i've

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
invite i bought the phone now that i've

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
invite i bought the phone now that i've
been<00:01:42.810> using<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.470> device<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> last

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
been using this device for the last

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.609 
been using this device for the last
couple<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.210> days<00:01:45.420> i<00:01:45.659> would<00:01:46.110> say<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.530> I've

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
couple of days i would say that I've

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.260 
couple of days i would say that I've
definitely<00:01:46.890> gotten<00:01:47.369> used<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> size<00:01:48.000> it's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
definitely gotten used to the size it's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.240 
definitely gotten used to the size it's
not<00:01:48.360> too<00:01:48.689> big<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.110> certainly<00:01:49.740> pocketable

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
not too big it's certainly pocketable

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.469 
not too big it's certainly pocketable
still<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.509> doesn't<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.890> feels<00:01:53.329> about<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
still it doesn't it's it feels about the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.999 
still it doesn't it's it feels about the
same<00:01:54.630> thickness<00:01:54.930> you'll<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> video

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
same thickness you'll see on the video

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.469 
same thickness you'll see on the video
that<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.460> practically<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.060> same<00:01:57.270> thickness

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that is practically the same thickness

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
that is practically the same thickness
even<00:01:57.810> though<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> specs<00:01:58.290> say<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:59.070> it's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
even though the specs say that it's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.240 
even though the specs say that it's
slightly<00:01:59.460> thicker<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.899> I've<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:01.860> gotten

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
slightly thicker and I've just gotten

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.639 
slightly thicker and I've just gotten
used<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.700> size<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.360> now<00:02:04.049> holding<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
used to this size and now holding the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.080 
used to this size and now holding the
Nexus<00:02:05.210> feels

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
Nexus feels

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.040 
Nexus feels
quite<00:02:09.080> unbelievably<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.800> little<00:02:10.069> bit<00:02:10.220> small<00:02:10.610> so

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
quite unbelievably a little bit small so

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.170 
quite unbelievably a little bit small so
you<00:02:12.050> know<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.709> actually<00:02:13.340> feels<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.000> is

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
you know it actually feels that this is

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.780 
you know it actually feels that this is
too<00:02:14.420> small<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.959> screen<00:02:15.230> having<00:02:15.709> spent<00:02:16.580> any

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
too small of a screen having spent any

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.280 
too small of a screen having spent any
time<00:02:16.849> with<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.330> device<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.750> think<00:02:17.930> five<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.260> a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
time with this device I think five and a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.229 
time with this device I think five and a
half<00:02:18.319> inches<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.920> definitely<00:02:19.819> pushing<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
half inches is definitely pushing the

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.089 
half inches is definitely pushing the
boundaries<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:20.810> that's<00:02:21.200> about<00:02:21.379> as<00:02:21.440> far<00:02:21.739> as<00:02:21.920> I

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
boundaries but that's about as far as I

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.339 
boundaries but that's about as far as I
would<00:02:22.849> probably<00:02:22.970> take<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.540> screen<00:02:23.780> size<00:02:23.989> and

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
would probably take the screen size and

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.800 
would probably take the screen size and
now<00:02:25.310> I'm<00:02:26.120> quite<00:02:26.629> used<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:29.360> terms<00:02:29.599> of

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
now I'm quite used to it so in terms of

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.600 
now I'm quite used to it so in terms of
the<00:02:29.959> other<00:02:30.140> areas<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.920> you'll<00:02:31.040> notice<00:02:31.430> in

quality<00:03:11.450> between<00:03:11.780> these<00:03:12.079> two<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.500> that's<00:03:12.680> a

quality between these two so that's a

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.020
