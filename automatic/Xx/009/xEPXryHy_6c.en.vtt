of course I've tried to make this look
pretty<00:02:36.459> for<00:02:36.940> video<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.569> thing<00:02:38.440> broke<00:02:38.740> on<00:02:38.950> me

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
don't know a name for it but it's just a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.440 
don't know a name for it but it's just a
great<00:03:05.560> way<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:05.830> use<00:03:06.040> up<00:03:06.070> your<00:03:06.250> leftover<00:03:06.970> quinoa

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.350 
great way to use up your leftover quinoa
rice<00:03:08.019> or<00:03:08.290> couscous<00:03:08.739> or<00:03:08.890> whatever<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.250> got<00:03:09.400> so

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
rice or couscous or whatever you got so

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.690 
rice or couscous or whatever you got so
you<00:03:10.420> got<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> serving<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.320> protein<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.430> a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
you got a serving of protein and a

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.059 
you got a serving of protein and a
serving<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.440> complex<00:03:14.440> carbs

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
serving of complex carbs

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.979 
serving of complex carbs
now<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.580> nutritional<00:03:16.209> value<00:03:16.480> is<00:03:16.630> going<00:03:16.810> to

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
now the nutritional value is going to

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.670 
now the nutritional value is going to
depend<00:03:17.350> on<00:03:17.709> how<00:03:18.580> much<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.819> use<00:03:19.080> in<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.200> cup<00:03:20.410> of

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
depend on how much you use in a cup of

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.190 
depend on how much you use in a cup of
egg<00:03:21.040> whites<00:03:21.310> you've<00:03:21.760> got<00:03:21.910> 25<00:03:22.510> grams<00:03:22.989> of

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
egg whites you've got 25 grams of

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.229 
egg whites you've got 25 grams of
protein<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.920> in<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.760> cup<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.239> quinoa<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.350> have

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
protein and in a cup of quinoa you have

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.509 
protein and in a cup of quinoa you have
40<00:03:28.239> grams<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.840> carbs<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.440> about<00:03:29.920> 8<00:03:30.100> grams<00:03:30.370> of

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
40 grams of carbs and about 8 grams of

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.990 
40 grams of carbs and about 8 grams of
protein<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.600> it's<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.319> nice<00:03:32.470> mix<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.250> protein

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
protein so it's a nice mix of protein

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.390 
protein so it's a nice mix of protein
and<00:03:34.209> complex<00:03:34.480> carbs<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.290> if<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.070> want<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400
