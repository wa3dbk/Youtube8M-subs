00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 no no 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.889
 and very good to all I am fury we are going to 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.380
 see how to duplicate the improved canes 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.599
 and apart from getting infinite ammunition is 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.330
 very simple for this we will need 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.099
 build two canes and improve them if 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.320
 you do not know how to do it , you still have it 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.090
 in the links in the description and also 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.470
 I have them uploaded in the channel the four 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.630
 sticks how to build them and how 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.360
 improve them now once you already 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.700
 we have everything done look good now 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.149
 here is the second player in this case 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.840
 my partner picks up the lightning rod 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.840
 improved 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.660
 and I was the first player pick the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.989
 Improved wind cane that each 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.550
 player takes on a different cane and 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.950
 once we have each player a 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.430
 cane what we do is go to 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.660
 letter in the area where you have placed the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.210
 canes on the pedestals for 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.089
 improve them in this area here 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.590
 and as you can see we will see the wind stick 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.090
 and the lightning rod in this case that 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.770
 it was the ones that we had facts is very 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.490
 simple simply as you have seen 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.189
 I had the cane of 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.049
 of wind I came to the pedestal of 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.939
 lightning rod and I have the cane 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.470
 Ray right now the player who has 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.049
 caught in the pack to punch is the player 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.390
 principal he is the one with the cane 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.270
 original and I am the one who already has the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.619
 cane duplicated now well in the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.270
 second player who is the one who has 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.649
 caught in the pack to punch 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.770
 you do not have to spend ammunition from that 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.390
 cane and I am the first player 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.909
 as you see right now I am spending 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.070
 ammunition of the lightning rod that is the 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.170
 that I took it from here was under the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.549
 pedestal and I have it duplicated 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.860
 I simply approach the pedestal 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.200
 I keep x because I'm in xbox for 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.470
 leave it on the pedestal and with the X 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.479
 to pick it up if you see that we are doing well 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.270
 just go back to pick up the cane 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.250
 that you had insist for example we still 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.959
 I could take a cane or go to alpaca 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.729
 pants that you can pick up a cane and you 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.799
 you come here and change it as you have 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.140
 seen in the video right now at 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.660
 pick it up look good I have it again 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.580
 the ammunition at the top but I'm going to put 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.680
 another example so you can see that it does not 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.750
 the poles need to be exchanged 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.180
 you just have to hold down 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.459
 x a while for you 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.909
 you can pick up the cane now that 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.069
 we make another shot veis shot reload 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.379
 look, the ammunition is going 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.560
 going down obviously and now I approach the 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.660
 I put the pedestal and when I pick it up I'll have 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.970
 again the entire ammunition 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.880
 and we have the cane duplicated 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.620
 and apart with infinite ammunition then for 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.390
 do strategy if a player wants to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 stay in the area of the titan or the area 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.810
 of this mine and another player who 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.580
 stay down here and when you stay 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.020
 without ammunition 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.690
 leave the cane and pick it up again 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.640
 to have infinite ammunition as that has 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.560
 been everything I hope you liked us 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.740
 we see in the next video and until the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.740
 next 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.090
