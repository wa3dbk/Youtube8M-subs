 Divine will care will serve you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.890
 a lot of people who play fixed 13 like 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 says in the title the fifa 13 kinect 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.610
 many said that we would be able to do 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.440
 changes alignments 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.430
 to change players from another position to 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.430
 another to ask for a center a criminal things to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.600
 city â€‹â€‹as they had said in the e3 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.670
 when he was going out 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.920
 the fifa but then we have a news 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.780
 very bad that the Mexican users of 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.079
 fifa where the 13 who want to use kinect 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.730
 to transmit bus orders they go to 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.250
 unfortunately have to learn languages 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.089
 because the edition for North America 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.180
 of fifa soccer 13 2013 distributed in 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.449
 the markets of usa mexico canada just 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.289
 Complete English and French languages 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.740
 otaku echoes this lack in a 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.890
 market where Spanish speakers are 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.409
 really massive in front of the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.440
 French-speaking Canadians to what I already 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.830
 Canada responds that they did not intend 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.869
 exclude anyone but implement the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.800
 major languages â€‹â€‹of each region a lot 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.780
 there are not many we do not have 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.730
 many of us have that fans in 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.450
 monterrey chivas cruz azul are going to have 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.250
 to dust off the French courses 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 or English is obviously something very 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.950
 difficult for a Mexican to learn English 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.260
 many like English is very easy to 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.500
 many but French is more difficult 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.110
 to learn it in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.880
 quick to do these things like 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.740
 change are few words that you have to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.020
 learn but it's not funny 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 play like this if they want to transmit their 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.100
 voice commands ' hopefully the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.960
 company and that's why he has set himself in the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.550
 13 release an update soon 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.130
 what is the video game for xbox 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.970
 because it's not funny that you 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.040
 you bought with your belief to do 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.510
 changes and things like that for 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.049
 to use your kinect and you give 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.930
