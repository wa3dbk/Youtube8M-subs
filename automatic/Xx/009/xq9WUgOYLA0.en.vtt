00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
okay sure layin take the cube hold it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.360 
okay sure layin take the cube hold it
out<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> black<00:00:43.469> trap<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.070> way

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
out so I can see the black trap that way

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.220 
out so I can see the black trap that way
when<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> test<00:00:45.210> picture<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.050> bring

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
when I do is a test picture and we bring

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
when I do is a test picture and we bring
it<00:00:46.320> back<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> studio<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> back<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
it back to the studio get it back on the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:17.230 
it back to the studio get it back on the
morrow<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:48.660> get<00:00:48.809> great<00:00:49.260> color<00:00:49.500> man

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.190 

all<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.570> we're<00:01:18.720> back<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> studio

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
all right now we're back to the studio

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
all right now we're back to the studio
we're<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> open<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.100> our<00:01:20.280> spider<00:01:20.670> three

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
we're going to open up our spider three

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
we're going to open up our spider three
studio<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.080> we're<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.250> calculate<00:01:23.400> our

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
studio and we're going to calculate our

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.420 
studio and we're going to calculate our
monitor<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:30.690> go<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.229> take<00:01:31.350> our<00:01:31.619> spider

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
monitor it go so we take our spider

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.300 
monitor it go so we take our spider
three<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.570> place<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.899> in<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.350> cool<00:01:37.770> spot

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
three and we place it in this cool spot

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
three and we place it in this cool spot
right<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:40.430> by<00:01:41.430> three<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.789> now<00:01:41.940> calibrating

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
right here by three is now calibrating

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.440 
right here by three is now calibrating
the<00:01:43.070> RGB<00:01:44.070> scale<00:01:44.789> on<00:01:45.030> our<00:01:45.479> computer<00:01:45.899> monitor

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
the RGB scale on our computer monitor

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.760 
the RGB scale on our computer monitor
it's<00:01:48.450> important<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.810> calibrate<00:01:49.170> my<00:01:49.380> monitor

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it's important to calibrate my monitor

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.520 
it's important to calibrate my monitor
because<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:51.030> colors<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.660> represent<00:01:52.289> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
because the colors will represent the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.980 
because the colors will represent the
true<00:01:52.920> colors<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:54.030> photograph<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.869> I

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
true colors of the photograph that I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.430 
true colors of the photograph that I
shot<00:01:56.240> now<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.420> our<00:01:57.509> monitor<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.899> calibrated

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
shot now that our monitor is calibrated

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.639 
shot now that our monitor is calibrated
let's<00:01:58.649> take<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.860> look<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.160> our<00:01:59.280> pictures<00:02:00.649> we

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
let's take a look of our pictures we

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.320 
let's take a look of our pictures we
want<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> find<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.310> shot<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:02.759> has<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.060> cube

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
want to find that shot that has the cube

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.719 
want to find that shot that has the cube
and<00:02:04.080> here<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.410> so<00:02:05.190> we'll<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.580> we'll<00:02:05.670> take

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and here it is so we'll do is we'll take

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.680 
and here it is so we'll do is we'll take
that<00:02:06.030> picture<00:02:06.270> put<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> into<00:02:07.409> Photoshop<00:02:08.690> zoom

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
that picture put it into Photoshop zoom

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.590 
that picture put it into Photoshop zoom
in<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.019> cube

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.590 

okay<00:02:13.230> take<00:02:13.890> our<00:02:14.070> eye<00:02:14.100> dropper<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.850> take<00:02:15.570> a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
okay take our eye dropper and take a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.400 
okay take our eye dropper and take a
grayscale<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:17.520> cube<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.600> great<00:02:19.020> also<00:02:19.260> for

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
grayscale the cube is great also for

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.250 
grayscale the cube is great also for
specular<00:02:19.980> highlights<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.670> for<00:02:21.480> making<00:02:21.960> sure

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
specular highlights and for making sure

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.620 
specular highlights and for making sure
that<00:02:22.410> your<00:02:22.530> blacks<00:02:22.920> are<00:02:23.700> not<00:02:23.880> two<00:02:24.030> black<00:02:24.300> guys

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
that your blacks are not two black guys

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.140 
that your blacks are not two black guys
in<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:24.960> great<00:02:25.700> black<00:02:26.700> trap<00:02:27.050> all<00:02:28.050> right<00:02:28.140> great

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
in this great black trap all right great

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.770 
in this great black trap all right great
so<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.570> we'll<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.260> will<00:02:32.300> save<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.450> as

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
so what we'll do is we will save this as

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.620 
so what we'll do is we will save this as
a<00:02:34.110> preset<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:37.820> now<00:02:38.820> what<00:02:39.000> we<00:02:39.120> need<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:39.480> is

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
a preset and now what we need to do is

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.690 
a preset and now what we need to do is
find<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.620> image<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> we<00:02:41.130> want<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.370> print

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.400 

okay<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.630> think<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.110> image<00:02:49.290> that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
okay and I think this is the image that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.930 
okay and I think this is the image that
we<00:02:49.620> want<00:02:50.210> put<00:02:51.210> that<00:02:51.360> into<00:02:51.510> Photoshop<00:02:52.940> okay

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
we want put that into Photoshop okay

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.730 
we want put that into Photoshop okay
great<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.780> what<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.020> do<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.530> go<00:02:55.680> to

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
great and what we do is we just go to

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.620 
great and what we do is we just go to
that<00:02:55.950> preset<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.950> apply<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.510> going

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
that preset we apply it and it's going

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.930 
that preset we apply it and it's going
to<00:03:00.690> make<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.960> image<00:03:01.700> exactly<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> way<00:03:02.910> we

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
to make that image exactly the way we

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.410 
to make that image exactly the way we
want<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:05.250> we<00:03:05.340> did<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.580> test<00:03:05.790> print<00:03:06.030> earlier

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
want so we did a test print earlier

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.090 
want so we did a test print earlier
today<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.050> I'm<00:03:07.290> really<00:03:07.320> not<00:03:07.620> happy<00:03:07.770> with<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
today and I'm really not happy with the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.890 
today and I'm really not happy with the
colors<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.790> now<00:03:08.910> we<00:03:08.970> have<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> calibrate<00:03:09.420> our

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
colors so now we have to calibrate our

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.400 
colors so now we have to calibrate our
printer<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:12.450> we<00:03:12.510> printed<00:03:12.810> out<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> color<00:03:13.140> chart

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
printer so we printed out a color chart

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.680 
printer so we printed out a color chart
here<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.820> just<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.030> easy<00:03:15.540> to

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
here and it's just really easy to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.150 
here and it's just really easy to
calibrate<00:03:16.080> your<00:03:16.970> printer<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.380> goes

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
calibrate your printer it just goes

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.720 
calibrate your printer it just goes
right<00:03:20.490> across<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.450> like<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:25.730> all

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
right across here just like that all

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.850 
right across here just like that all
right<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.090> we<00:03:27.180> open<00:03:27.420> up<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.690> raw<00:03:27.960> image

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.199 

and<00:03:32.860> now<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.099> have<00:03:33.280> an<00:03:33.430> image<00:03:33.610> in<00:03:33.730> Photoshop

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
and now I have an image in Photoshop

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.320 
and now I have an image in Photoshop
that<00:03:34.870> we<00:03:34.959> can<00:03:35.170> adjust<00:03:35.739> further<00:03:36.700> if<00:03:36.910> we<00:03:37.030> want<00:03:37.239> to

what<00:03:38.019> we<00:03:38.140> can<00:03:38.230> print<00:03:38.440> just<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.800> way<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.480> I'm

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
