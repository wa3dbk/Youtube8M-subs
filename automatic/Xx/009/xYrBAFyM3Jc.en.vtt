00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.190 

then<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.920> add<00:01:11.219> in<00:01:11.549> working<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.359> arpeggios<00:01:13.020> now

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
then we add in working on arpeggios now

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.350 
then we add in working on arpeggios now
this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.469> a<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:13.859> good<00:01:14.579> song<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> learn<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
this is a really good song to learn to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:26.020 
this is a really good song to learn to
play<00:01:15.509> your<00:01:15.659> arpeggios<00:01:15.929> with

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.300 

and<00:01:26.570> just<00:01:26.750> getting<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:27.050> really<00:01:27.290> constant<00:01:28.130> flow

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and just getting a really constant flow

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.110 
and just getting a really constant flow
of<00:01:28.340> getting<00:01:29.090> notes<00:01:29.270> nice<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:29.720> clean<00:01:29.930> and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
of getting notes nice and clean and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.630 
of getting notes nice and clean and
precise<00:01:32.120> then<00:01:32.750> we<00:01:32.840> also<00:01:33.020> take<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:33.890> ones<00:01:34.430> that

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
precise then we also take this ones that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.950 
precise then we also take this ones that
would<00:01:34.700> take<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:34.970> two<00:01:35.210> steps<00:01:35.450> further<00:01:35.660> in<00:01:35.870> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
would take this two steps further in the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.190 
would take this two steps further in the
lesson<00:01:36.290> one<00:01:36.830> of<00:01:36.950> them<00:01:37.070> is<00:01:38.080> introducing<00:01:39.080> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
lesson one of them is introducing the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.810 
lesson one of them is introducing the
idea<00:01:39.260> of<00:01:39.590> randomly<00:01:40.130> hitting<00:01:40.400> notes<00:01:40.610> in<00:01:40.760> the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
idea of randomly hitting notes in the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.160 
idea of randomly hitting notes in the
arpeggio<00:01:41.210> which<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.450> started<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.870> do<00:01:41.960> they're<00:01:42.140> a

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
arpeggio which I started to do they're a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.540 
arpeggio which I started to do they're a
little<00:01:42.320> bit<00:01:42.470> kind<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.830> accidentally<00:01:43.340> but

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
little bit kind of accidentally but

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.010 
little bit kind of accidentally but
that's<00:01:44.060> because<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.270> was<00:01:44.300> thinking<00:01:44.510> thinking

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
that's because I was thinking thinking

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.350 
that's because I was thinking thinking
ahead<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:46.220> not<00:01:46.400> keeping<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.820> arpeggios

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
ahead and not keeping the arpeggios

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.120 
ahead and not keeping the arpeggios
regular<00:01:47.900> but<00:01:48.080> just<00:01:48.260> just<00:01:48.410> mixing<00:01:48.830> them<00:01:48.979> up

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
regular but just just mixing them up

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.520 
regular but just just mixing them up
with<00:01:49.490> occasional<00:01:50.140> balances<00:01:51.140> on<00:01:51.260> different

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
with occasional balances on different

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.620 
with occasional balances on different
strings<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:52.460> also<00:01:52.940> looking<00:01:53.180> at<00:01:53.300> some<00:01:53.450> more
