00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello people and welcome back to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.720
 another gta4 murder conceptions 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.010
 yes again today with a user request 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.450
 she asks a wish what kind of a 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.250
 Imagine just asking 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.349
 link in the compost or just names 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 and then it confirms that the in 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.619
 the next weeks or over in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.930
 the next wish before these days 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.609
 is presented 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.500
 scratch first, nico always says good 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.080
 idea yes again exactly nice the camera 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.220
 today we have the new weapons mod and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.510
 though the g36 c out of battlefield fourth too 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.410
 several versions with different 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.380
 but I have the first time 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.239
 city put 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:44.070
 and yes, what we will do quickly 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 is out and watching as she is 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.980
 very close so I'm not exactly the best 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.110
 I'm sorry, I 'm sorry 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.520
 also have weapons as always 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.039
 changed 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.239
 I may change the city so 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.129
 a bit more adapted 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.800
 the link to this is in the description 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:09.270
 but is only the corresponding passage 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:12.420
 in the way you find it in the web infopunkt 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.280
 Find and change xml 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.869
 yes I have the total range 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 down a bit and easily hurt 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.670
 down for that she has more ammo than 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.220
 stabilizes and we already see it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.680
 the stands replace me quickly moderately 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.780
 the em-fourth never exactly like the ak 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.400
 I changed it to the recommendation there 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.670
 I find you better because I think 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.590
 directly it is not a good kind replacement so 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.090
 but you see it is actually 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.979
 now pretty good weapon even if you 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 but doing less harm in itself does it 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.850
 actually unbelievably much and it has 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.000
 just less small reach and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.470
 shoots even slower and is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.720
 inaccurate so actually the field but 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.630
 really not that easy a good one 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.900
 weapon is still and as I said 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.640
 I think 60 more shots I think so 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.780
 and 60 more and they are sometimes 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.690
 but already worth gold and then see how 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.870
 a little rehearsal still lived 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.870
 never 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.790
 first machine ever shot and 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.640
 then yes, at least very nice 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.459
 car shoots it is a very good one 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.489
 Model wg looks fun in any case 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.510
 to play with it is well done and yes 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.190
 there are not really any 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.030
 a lot more to do and it would be nice if 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:40.370
 a few more cars would come no 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.150
 Do not be scared or you will 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.840
 not only from the vehicle 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.200
 except the attacker excited 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.780
 No is not so at least I 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.739
 Thank you for the audience always so 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.390
 Now we can have someone there 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:05.799
 exclude that ever arrives well 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.799
 shows up here and there do the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:20.359
 and then this highly aggressive one 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.829
 heli pilots and of course at 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.430
 get out now rather helpless 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.430
 against us 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.549
 Here you need some shot as can 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.390
 Of course you have to get on your feet again 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.390
 shoot 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.129
 Well, at least it is a time 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.040
 of course, as always, take the bottom 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.030
 description as well as mine 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.810
 probably changed 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.560
 but more realistic changes of 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.120
 statistics 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.680
 do you think you fall if you think so 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.739
 the sequel please just the video 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.129
 share firefighting tanks churches to 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.129
 next time 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.129
 rtg
