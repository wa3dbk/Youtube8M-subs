00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.790
 good morning everyone today I'm going to 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.390
 bring a video in which I will explain 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.670
 the differences of fielding and playing 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.939
 tactical that mythical phrase of I do not 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.490
 I'm a tactical game, that excuse 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.710
 have some campero if that phrase that 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.650
 they use a lot of competitive people because 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.989
 they are right and we are going to see the 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.580
 differences and I think I 'm in play that 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:45.519
 you are going to see what is in the game that I went up 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:49.900
 yesterday if yesterday in the game that went up 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:53.440
 yesterday of looking for perfection I played in 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.629
 this game and you will see that in the other 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.330
 team I will find a few 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.519
 campers but these are campers 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.379
 and I pretty much played something tactical 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.449
 and I will explain more or less the 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.400
 difference or what I think is the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.060
 difference between camping and playing 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.930
 tactical you are going to see many good many 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.970
 not a couple of them that are going to be 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.759
 lying in the middle of the map looking 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.070
 towards a lake in a good plan when I 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.620
 appear one in front can shoot 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.620
 with a slight that for me yes that is 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.950
 For me, I feel sorry but I do 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.830
 who is champion as I told him lying down 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.330
 the best if you're in a coverage 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.060
 you go very well of coverage in coverage 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.190
 that's playing tactical is not the same 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.440
 to play tactical that to champion what 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.670
 difference there is tactical play like me 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.800
 I'm playing in this game more or 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.380
 less I'm moving it little by little 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.020
 coverage coverage I'm running from time 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.150
 when I'm going through a bit is that there 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.610
 many differences between fourth 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.170
 activity and rashard you will tell me those of 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.170
 competitive champion 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.740
 Well, no 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.700
 most of campeÃ¡n juan tactical in 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.090
 plan is put on a culture you shoot 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.730
 and kill 23 change coverage not 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.590
 have another 23 are advancing little to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.350
 little what is it that you have to do go 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.320
 advancing little by little kill kill kill 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.660
 advance kill kill advance 7 if you take the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.360
 flag 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.760
 that is behind you because you give 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.410
 back try to go to the flag or 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.680
 try to defend the flag in which 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.930
 you are that is tactical play not to change in 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.210
 plan is not that I stay in this 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.820
 flag in the middle of the map in a 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.040
 hallway looking with a slight towards the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.590
 door and at the moment how to see that to 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.290
 someone shot him, no, that 's it 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 change and be with a play more in 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.540
 some stairs and you are estimating the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.760
 stairs shooting is also champion 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.680
 for example 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.659
 there are many examples of what it is to change 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.470
 I think we all know the examples of 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:05.599
 to be in a little corner and that 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.549
 that this is not call of duty that in call 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.409
 of duty is already more more specimens of 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.720
 but the truth is that I think 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.579
 it's a phrase that many many champions 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.120
 example is not that I do not change the game 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.129
 tactical had more tactical if you play as 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.260
 those of competitive or you play as to what 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.980
 better is that when I now how are you 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.470
 seeing they meet those using coverages and 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.060
 raseando from time to time it is to play 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.859
 tactical is not to go, do not see 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.159
 tactical how to camp because it's not what 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.530
 same is not at all the same because 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:45.170
 you see god fuck showed and moving in 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.889
 every moment that is always moving and 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.260
 I'm tracking a lot but in moments 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.819
 I know that maybe there will be two or 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.849
 three waiting for me as a hedge 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.730
 and he tried to kill them, it's normal that 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:02.930
 change us and many people see that as 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.090
 change and it's not like that it's not like that and it's good 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.410
 I hope you liked the video if 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.510
 you liked that minister want me 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.260

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.260
 and see you
