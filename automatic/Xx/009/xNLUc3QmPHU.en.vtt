00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.820
 hi today i want to make a video for you 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.599
 He on two means for nails one ok 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.570
 smart enamel 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.890
 super drying and second remedy for asus 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.980
 top coating for quick drying 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.260
 varnish 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:29.710
 Here they are on the super drying and the second from 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.830
 from the top cover for fast 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.629
 varnish drying here just want to say 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.089
 Here is the means of clever enamel I did not 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.940
 I liked it because in the first place 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:42.309
 some butter from such picket to all this 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.440
 somehow not very convenient to apply for 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:49.869
 drying varnish authors when I applied even 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.530
 in the morning I applied in the evening even in the morning 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:54.190
 Well , somehow not dried up because the arm 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.360
 your elbow 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.629
 I did not see the result even in the morning as 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.269
 I even had nunca te printed in this one 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.010
 finger in this elbow which has not dried 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.070
 so I do not advise this tool well 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.969
 certainly not very expensive but something can be 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.240
 This budget does not buy but the series and the second 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:18.789
 medium from with coating top for 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.369
 quick drying varnish here it is this 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.359
 I really liked the text but it 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.770
 looks like a fist 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:29.079
 such a brush is not very wide 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.770
 and but in principle acceptable for such 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.770
 varnish type 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:39.909
 watery not like smart enamel 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.340
 liquid but also a prayer after all as oil 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.289
 on strengthening goes as soon as take 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.729
 my not noticed 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.859
 used literally a couple of times and somehow 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.299
 not this effect I really liked and 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:54.249
 then I donâ€™t even know maybe 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.899
 throw it away and here is this remedy against 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.030
 we are very decent good to me 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.829
 I like how he dried his nails lacquer 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.499
 very well makes varnish more sustainable 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.479
 gives glamorous shine to dry it out 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.250
 Five seconds, well, maybe not in 30 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.590
 seconds, but it dries dry 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.690
 fast enough that is literally there 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.780
 five minutes have passed shipments I painted 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.810
 nails and on top here this little thing and nails u 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.420
 I have already been 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.050
 on the nails already dried so I advise everyone 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:30.709
 Now that's it's creed drei 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:34.010
 the cat is a cat that way much 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.220
 cheaper is much cheaper than super 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.230
 smart enamel shavings 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.230
 all thanks for watching all bye bye
