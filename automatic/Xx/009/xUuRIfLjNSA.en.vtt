your<00:01:49.590> bunion<00:01:49.950> from<00:01:50.159> getting<00:01:50.490> worse<00:01:50.729> first<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
your bunion from getting worse first a

splint you can wear at night and
essentially<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> hold<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
essentially it's just going to hold the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.450 
essentially it's just going to hold the
big<00:01:55.950> toe<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.810> right<00:01:58.020> position<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.920> a

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
some sort of art support this will also

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.800 
some sort of art support this will also
increase<00:02:09.310> stability<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.239> bone<00:02:10.420> doesn't

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
increase stability so the bone doesn't

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.140 
increase stability so the bone doesn't
move<00:02:10.959> further<00:02:11.319> you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.069> also<00:02:12.250> try<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> toe

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
move further you can also try a toe
