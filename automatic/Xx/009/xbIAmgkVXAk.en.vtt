00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hello, you with a piston 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.450
 and today we play in the tanks do and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.400
 Today review on tank header 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.130
 I have it already improved as 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.560
 here is a gun installed 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.019
 good engine caterpillar and we will 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.710
 today play it and kill 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.730
 try all knead the action and do 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:38.719
 the output is good this tank or bad tank 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.719
 German tank German here we have it 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:49.920
 let's see its characteristics well 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.780
 here's a maximum speed of 42 well into this for 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 goose and pulled Zhenya too good 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.360
 say turning the chassis they gave me 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.510
 like 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.050
 average damage per minute is big enough 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.100
 for the fourth level, the variation is 100 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:09.409
 meter well, at least I do not understand about the bath room 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.740
 armor penetration base 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.340
 4880 but also when normal let's 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340
 let's go fight 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.950
 mind will seek our fight 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.840
 so come and heh-heh-heh-heh-heh but that's found 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.189
 severomorsk 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.500
 and probably fasting because 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:52.030
 will be loaded for a long time as I shoot video 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.150
 and here it is heavy again so we 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.570
 continue now I probably will 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.570
 a little bit of a lie 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.170
 memory utilization rate so no 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.630
 move around with went kill so 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.769
 so we have a standard battle to the base of 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.310
 we are not there over there we will go 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.310
 like this 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.470
 Nathan of course slowly goes but she 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.920
 scuffle 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.920
 it's ok for him 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:44.840
 so amkarom djali are both banned of course for 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.590
 spam but it doesn't matter to me I won't be able to him 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.800
 write anything that went after me i like 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.910
 need to stick with him 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.910
 Donat podlagivaet of course 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:08.260
 because all amkara is not already fast 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:13.170
 merged trail merge final 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.700
 bypass let's go like this 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:21.760
 can if not even in this battle 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:25.170
 can kill so 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.170
 one our friend is worth 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.360
 yes I destroyed it like there are some two 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.360
 dude ate 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.400
 also destroyed 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.010
 fast enough plum 350 lives i'm with 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:55.090
 first strike but I have such a projectile 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:59.220
 just very armored 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:03.220
 energy is good more precisely very good and 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.000
 it merges quickly therefore still with big 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.000
 plus guns 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.160
 so so so so so so so so so 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.730
 so all we bring we bring we bring we take we take we take we take we take 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.019
 valim valim valim 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:25.090
 come on let's all all all all 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:28.870
 merge merge merge because 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.870
 will recharge very long 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.430
 damn shorter need now put no 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.750
 high-explosive 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.750
 way charges 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.940
 so come here come here 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.150
 so we we win weighs 3 it's big 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.720
 account all along the bottom of 2 I killed one by one 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.720
 until 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.110
 hit there so us he has not yet broken 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:15.530
 still charging let's charge 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:17.840
 charge so I saved in short now 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.370
 my engine is recovering and 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.370
 beat wait 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.950
 so let's let's fly and enough 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.950
 a lot well, a little bit not merged 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.670
 so i will now slowly move it 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:45.070
 it's bad enough very very bad 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:51.810
 it moves very slowly it is not for me 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.810
 like if merge means merge 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.980
 one more tank left to make 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:05.900
 sits we try to get around it but go 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.590
 will not work we went slowly tank u 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:14.660
 I'm probably ahead in this battle I leaked 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:19.690
 only 1 well damage big enough 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.690
 struck at a time we all won 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.919
 So 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.980
 victory gave us 938 experience and such 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.070
 awards as a sign of class 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.210
 And they gave us an armor-piercer even if I killed 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:43.400
 one well 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:45.800
 prices are good enough to get this 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.800
 we had a good fight well we got 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.550
 quite a lot of experience 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.810
 the wind survived let's see let's command 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:59.000
 the result is detailed right now, we demolished everything 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:04.450
 just three hit we 451 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.860
 splinter win but without damage 2 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:14.960
 potential he 43 s 330 obtained with 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:18.050
 premium and would get 1406 nails at 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.130
 I recently ended positivity 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.630
 fight 4 minutes 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:28.010
 Well, the battle for the accrued 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:31.390
 so reward for the first victory in the day yes i 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.470
 the first time we connect our lie repaired 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.810
 I do not like minus the fact that 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:39.290
 the matron is very expensive with like 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.460
 now and not died here he is a student of all 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.280
 only one and a half thousand 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.880
 and when I died he was valued for two s 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.350
 half a thousand benefits its minus all in 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.140
 thank you all for watching 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:54.940
 it was a review of the haziran world of tanks 

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.940
 good luck everyone all bye
