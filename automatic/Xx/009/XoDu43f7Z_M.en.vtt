00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
we're gonna do a c-sharp

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.340 
we're gonna do a c-sharp
to<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.870> sharp<00:01:12.320> down<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> f-sharp<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
to an a sharp down to the f-sharp and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.580 
to an a sharp down to the f-sharp and
then<00:01:16.350> back<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.620> to<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.400> G<00:01:17.730> sharp<00:01:18.030> our<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.260> hand

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
then back up to a G sharp our right hand

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.800 
then back up to a G sharp our right hand
is<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.010> keep<00:01:20.190> that<00:01:20.370> same<00:01:20.580> position

go<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.240> an<00:01:37.390> f-sharp

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
go to an f-sharp

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.830

Sam<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.650> tell<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.430> point<00:01:41.790> when<00:01:42.720> we

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
Sam up here and tell this point when we

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.050 
Sam up here and tell this point when we
hit<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.140> g-sharp<00:01:43.829> we're<00:01:44.430> gonna<00:01:44.579> lift<00:01:44.820> our

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
hit this g-sharp we're gonna lift our

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.050 
hit this g-sharp we're gonna lift our
thumb<00:01:45.420> from<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.810> c-sharp<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> d<00:01:47.220> sharp<00:01:47.520> so

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
thumb from a c-sharp to the d sharp so

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.730 
thumb from a c-sharp to the d sharp so
it'll<00:01:48.240> sound<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.080> last<00:01:49.259> one

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
we've had this pattern we get to this G

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.800 
we've had this pattern we get to this G
sharp<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.880> where<00:02:32.030> we<00:02:32.180> transition

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
sharp and this is where we transition

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.360 
sharp and this is where we transition
into<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:34.150> pre-chorus<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.070> when<00:02:37.070> we<00:02:37.190> get<00:02:37.310> to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
this G sharp we've just done as

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.860 
this G sharp we've just done as
brilliant<00:02:39.560> as<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:39.740> million<00:02:40.430> stars<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.780> on

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.100 
stars we hit our first note of the
pre-chorus<00:02:43.970> which<00:02:44.960> will<00:02:45.200> be<00:02:45.350> an<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.190> sharp<00:02:47.110> as

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
pre-chorus which will be an a sharp as

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.010 
pre-chorus which will be an a sharp as
brilliant<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> million<00:02:49.790> stars<00:02:51.580> then

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
brilliant as a million stars then

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.790 
brilliant as a million stars then
everybody

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
everybody

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.960 
everybody
just<00:02:55.310> go<00:02:55.460> down<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.850> g-sharp<00:02:57.280> after<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.790> on

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
just go down to the g-sharp after and on

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.670 
just go down to the g-sharp after and on
all<00:02:59.300> we<00:02:59.600> move<00:02:59.810> up<00:03:00.080> from<00:03:00.500> C<00:03:00.770> sharp<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:01.190> d<00:03:02.000> sharp

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
all we move up from C sharp to d sharp

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.810 
all we move up from C sharp to d sharp
so<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.740> will<00:03:03.980> sound<00:03:04.190> like<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.690> as<00:03:06.820> brilliant

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
so it will sound like this as brilliant

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.410 
so it will sound like this as brilliant
as

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.309 

start

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
top and even though the chords will be

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.710 
top and even though the chords will be
different<00:03:34.250> we<00:03:34.430> get<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.730> do<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.970> same<00:03:35.209> trick<00:03:35.540> we

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
different we get to do the same trick we

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.559

will do C sharp G sharp through the
whole<00:03:38.750> thing<00:03:39.080> on<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.410> last<00:03:39.650> chord<00:03:40.069> it<00:03:40.400> will

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
whole thing on the last chord it will

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.730 
whole thing on the last chord it will
actually<00:03:41.090> again<00:03:41.660> land<00:03:42.050> in<00:03:42.260> such<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.500> way<00:03:42.709> that

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
actually again land in such a way that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.110 
actually again land in such a way that
we<00:03:43.010> can<00:03:43.190> use<00:03:43.490> our<00:03:44.350> d<00:03:45.350> sharp<00:03:45.680> lift<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:47.000> we're

we can use our d sharp lift so we're

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.640 
we can use our d sharp lift so we're
gonna<00:03:47.209> keep<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.630> pattern<00:03:47.870> but<00:03:48.350> we're<00:03:48.560> gonna

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650
