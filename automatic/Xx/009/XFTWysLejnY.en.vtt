00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hi all today i have one again 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.279
 shoplog for you because I am 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.589
 Been to Amsterdam today and I am 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.690
 really just back it is now 7 pm so it 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.940
 is already dark but I just have a lamp 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.429
 turned on which makes me a little blinded 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.500
 so I hope it is light as yet 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.920
 is good but I think so so 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.109
 nice 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.900
 because yes I did shop and it was 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.240
 very nice in Amsterdam I was with 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.109
 my mother with my sister and with my 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.120
 aunt 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.710
 so my mother and her sister and me and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.950
 My sister actually was very 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.110
 nice 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.350
 we also had a nice dinner at 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.489
 one show franchois it was argentinian 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.920
 whim 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.570
 at the Rembrandtplein and we have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.120
 also enjoyed nice starbucks with the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
 large starbucks on the Rembrandtplein 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.210
 and we just have some nice ones 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.980
 bought things so I'm going now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 show what i have bought 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.730
 first I have two items of clothing 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 bought the h &amp; m and they have very nice ones 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.750
 new bags from the h &amp; m 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.789
 I think this is a bit Christmasy 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.920
 bags are full of, by the way, long 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.869
 since I've shown clothing 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.430
 a shoplog because I don't buy that much 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.229
 often clothing because I am very difficult 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.570
 with clothing I always find it too 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.760
 expensive or it is not comfortable or so so 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.200
 anyway i have this kind first 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.299
 purchased from sweater 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.970
 this is what he looks like 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.220
 gray mixed screen and learns or something 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.900
 well i think the dust is just that whole 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.390
 nice it looks pretty good on me too 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 here is a kind of small detail 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.490
 chest pocket 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.659
 these cost only 10 euros 995 it's size 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.579
 m 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.729
 so it's nice and slightly oversized 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.270
 and he also has a looser normal say 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.710
 but the armpits are not clothing 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.829
 is not right against your armpits 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.329
 is a bit looser so this friend 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.689
 really very nice the dust is very 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.610
 thin but sometimes you still have warmer ones 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.869
 days in winter then is such a thin one 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.060
 sweater quite chill 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.810
 then i bought a simple pair of jeans and this is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.500
 the super skinny superlow waist jeans from 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.090
 the h &amp; m of 30 euros and this is 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.450
 pants I already have but then something 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.369
 lighter and this one is so nice stretchy 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.680
 look i don't know if you can see that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.920
 where you can really stretch far out 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.940
 because of that I also makes a 29 and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.500
 length dimension 34 29 is quite small 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.970
 but he was well suited he was slightly 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.600
 tight but it's a whole stretch 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.370
 ski pants so that will stretch a bit 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.440
 ver is just very simple dark blue 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.510
 pants and because he is so stretchy closes 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.860
 which is quite nice to look this one 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.600
 I already had 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.040
 but mine is a bit on it 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.140
 I found wear out 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.720
 yes i bought i just wanted one more 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.709
 so buy this one time 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.660
 then if I just go to the donkeys and I have 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.890
 keep it bought because I have a bubble gum 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.590
 in my bag and I just wanted a package 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.970
 and I bought two sheets of it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.480
 rimmel to this savills my new one 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.790
 space and touch follow me through the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.400
 space tast collection 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.140
 and I don't know if they are visible 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:10.220
 but this is a purple purple glitter me 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.470
 hope it focuses and is called 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.989
 moonwalking so a purple glitter 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.890
 moonwalking and this one is mine too 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.090
 sister 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.860
 but I will just show it because 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.010
 it is a very nice polish and this is one 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.769
 some lighter color too and glitter it 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.380
 this one is called aurora 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.890
 so moonwalking and aurora and the wax of 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.840
 rimmel second degree is therefore the lacquer 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.150
 costs 7 euros each 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.940
 but because the second one was free 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.920
 only 350 each, so the two afterwards 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.160
 we went to the gardens for a moment and me 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.019
 have you ever told about 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.900
 mask of himalayan herbals and that was 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.090
 a face mask him against pimples and 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.440
 against oily skin and now I want this 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.180
 So again he shrimp mine 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.920
 is almost finished but they no longer had it 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.230
 because at the gardens they just want 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.820
 sell products where no parabens 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.440
 in sitting and in the mask 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.299
 apparently parabens and that kind 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.190
 junk so that the gardens no longer want 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.019
 sell what I find so very sorry what 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.220
 I found the mask super fine then 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.810
 an employee has something else 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.000
 recommended and that was just from gardens 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.150
 own the gardens 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.400
 brand and that is this mask this is a tea 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.220
 tree mask and this is a tea tree 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.780
 I did not scrub really more a 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.510
 scrub cream for my face 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.560
 so that I anyway do need and what 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.560
 it was too 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.310
 as second free on products from the 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.900
 gardens 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.780
 so for these two products I was 9 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.460
 euro instead of 18 so that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.260
 is of course rather true 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.560
 And yes tea tree is just a tasty one 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.910
 smell in between I find and a scrub cream 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.000
 is nice 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.760
 it softens and refreshes and the mask 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.260
 cleans and normalizes 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.900
 so i hope the mask is just as good 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.060
 works like me I really enjoy now 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.650
 smell that mask works just as well as 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.450
 the mask I had from himalayas 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.070
 herbals 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.110
 so I'm going to test this and it 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.450
 was a long time ago since me 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.160
 what I bought 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.720
 did not know yet and what I want to go 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.669
 so I am very curious about it 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.590
 I also went to these products for a while 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.230
 the river island because i knew them 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.180
 Barry M was selling there and I really had to 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.030
 just buy a coat from barry m 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.580
 this is also a glitter polish I hope so 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.520
 He is good to see they have it 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.010
 nowadays a lot of polishes at the 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.810
 river island from barry m also other 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.160
 by the way, make-up from barry m can do it 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.860
 not buy anywhere else in the Netherlands 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.120
 except at the river island or you must 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.419
 order it online 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.380
 well such a polish costs 5 euros which I do not 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.680
 find quite pricey 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.590
 and this really is such a beautiful glitter 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.440
 a little brown with all colors 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.840
 glitter green and golden red red 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.490
 glitter really so beautiful 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:55.090
 so yes and what is the name of that he suffered 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.270
 countess contes i hope to see it 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.270
 is 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.240
 so this coat of 5 euros from the river 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.490
 island we also went to the 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.440
 large body shop on the Kalverstraat want 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.120
 These two body shop at night 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.919
 me one on the nieuwendijk one 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.320
 calf street and that is quite one 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.400
 great for the shop and my sister has 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.650
 there one 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.630
 bought mango body mist and i thought is 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.600
 also nice to show 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.210
 because of the body mists of the body shop 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.410
 I really have a great invention and 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.880
 mango I just sat oh yes mango never 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.320
 just delicious and I love it 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.770
 bodymist is delicious because you have one 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.780
 nice and large and I find a body 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.220
 misses taking that nice in your bag and 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.900
 you spray it nice throughout the day 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.520
 nice on your body 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.660
 so if you come out of the shower or something 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.990
 then you smell nice 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.940
 and yes so this body costs most 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.169
 originally 12 euros 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.270
 and you can see it in the bag too 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:50.860
 all test strips are there 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.840
 she has added four more , I have here 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.650
 two colijn 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:00.789
 my two body scrubs and fines 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.260
 cocoa ar no coconut body scrubs 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.520
 I am not warm so much about it 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.020
 but maybe that's because we 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.789
 the four of us in the store where the so 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.620
 maybe for everyone 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.150
 so I'm going to make it my own 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.919
 I think I have that olive body scrub there 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.150
 nice find and the rest please specify 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.860
 my mother and after my aunt to my 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.360
 sister and that was all again it was 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.430
 not very much but I have again 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.080
 nice talk so I hope you 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.849
 did not like it 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.530
 well then this was a big thank you 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:27.630
