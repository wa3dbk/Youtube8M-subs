00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
difference is that for the first time in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.290

Sam's career he's not ballon operative

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.970 
Sam's career he's not ballon operative
anymore<00:00:51.660> now<00:00:51.870> he's<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> leader<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> group

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
anymore now he's the leader of the group

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
anymore now he's the leader of the group
so<00:00:53.280> he's<00:00:53.430> been<00:00:53.579> put<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.879> charge<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so he's been put in charge and it's a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.660 
so he's been put in charge and it's a
small<00:00:55.079> team<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.010> still<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> challenge

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
small team but it's still a challenge

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.220 
small team but it's still a challenge
for<00:00:56.850> him<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.180> he<00:00:57.329> doesn't<00:00:58.079> necessarily

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
for him because he doesn't necessarily

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.229 
for him because he doesn't necessarily
have<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.859> temperament<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.670> leadership<00:01:00.059> he's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
have the temperament for leadership he's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
have the temperament for leadership he's
more<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.719> solo<00:01:01.289> operator<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.340> he<00:01:02.520> has<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
more of a solo operator so he has to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.549 
more of a solo operator so he has to
learn<00:01:02.940> how<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> deal<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.809> people<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.409> learns

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
learn how to deal with people he learns

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.899 
learn how to deal with people he learns
needs<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.979> learn<00:01:05.100> how<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.309> manage<00:01:05.670> them<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
needs to learn how to manage them and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.789 
needs to learn how to manage them and
get<00:01:06.510> them<00:01:06.630> linked<00:01:06.840> together<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.680> that's

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
get them linked together so that's

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.830 
get them linked together so that's
obviously<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.369> story<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
obviously on the story side and from a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.359 
obviously on the story side and from a
gameplay<00:01:10.049> perspective<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> main

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
gameplay perspective I think the main

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520 
gameplay perspective I think the main
thing<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.970> we've<00:01:12.119> taken<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
thing is that we've taken a lot of the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.750 
thing is that we've taken a lot of the
lessons<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.040> learned<00:01:14.220> from<00:01:14.310> conviction

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
lessons that we learned from conviction

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.460 
lessons that we learned from conviction
some<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> innovations<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:16.049> conviction

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
some of the innovations from conviction

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
some of the innovations from conviction
mechanically<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> also<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.390> brought<00:01:18.750> back

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
mechanically and also then brought back

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990 
mechanically and also then brought back
in<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> lot<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.890> were<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.310> core<00:01:20.549> concepts

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
in a lot of what were the core concepts

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370 
in a lot of what were the core concepts
from<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> original<00:01:21.570> Splinter<00:01:21.869> Cell<00:01:22.049> series

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
from the original Splinter Cell series

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.050 
from the original Splinter Cell series
obviously<00:01:22.770> updated<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> current

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
obviously updated for for the current

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.510 
obviously updated for for the current
platforms<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.680> allowed<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> kind<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
platforms and allowed them to kind of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490 
platforms and allowed them to kind of
work<00:01:26.759> together<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> very<00:01:27.509> seamless<00:01:28.110> fluid

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
work together in a very seamless fluid

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
work together in a very seamless fluid
way<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.159> idea<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.579> Sam<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.090> always<00:01:30.390> you

know one step ahead of his enemies he's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
know one step ahead of his enemies he's
always<00:01:32.460> able<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.880> things<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.270> movement

should<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.000> lot<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.210> fluid<00:01:37.009> one<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
should be a lot more fluid one of the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.850 
should be a lot more fluid one of the
main<00:01:38.549> problem<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.180> conviction<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
main problem of conviction is that the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.789 
main problem of conviction is that the
story<00:01:41.040> mode<00:01:41.340> mode<00:01:41.909> was<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.689> short<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
story mode mode was really short and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
story mode mode was really short and
left<00:01:43.979> me<00:01:44.189> wanting<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.729> how<00:01:45.689> long<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
left me wanting more how long is the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
left me wanting more how long is the
campaign<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> bracket<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.180> hard<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
campaign in the bracket it's hard to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
campaign in the bracket it's hard to
give<00:01:48.630> an<00:01:48.750> exact<00:01:49.079> hour<00:01:49.290> figure<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> can

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
give an exact hour figure but what I can

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
give an exact hour figure but what I can
say<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.079> substantially<00:01:52.079> longer<00:01:52.259> than

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
say is it's substantially longer than

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.319 
say is it's substantially longer than
the<00:01:52.829> campaign<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.490> conviction<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.180> mean

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the campaign in conviction I mean

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.789 
the campaign in conviction I mean
basically<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.350> from<00:01:55.380> our<00:01:55.619> play

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
basically what we can see from our play

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.530 
basically what we can see from our play
test<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.369> people<00:01:56.670> are<00:01:56.820> putting<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.299> a

test is that people are putting in a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.109 
test is that people are putting in a

of the game you feel like there's a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.300 
of the game you feel like there's a
sense<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.080> he<00:02:54.350> wants<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.770> have<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> chance<00:02:55.190> to

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
sense that he wants to have a chance to

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.280 
sense that he wants to have a chance to
build<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.730> new<00:02:55.880> life<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.600> get<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.840> know<00:02:57.080> his

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290

daughter and be reunited with her and I

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.120 
daughter and be reunited with her and I
think<00:02:59.060> that's<00:02:59.360> an<00:02:59.510> important<00:02:59.960> place<00:03:00.800> for<00:03:00.830> him

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
think that's an important place for him

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.680 
think that's an important place for him
to<00:03:01.280> be<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.700> particularly<00:03:02.150> at<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> start<00:03:02.630> of

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
to be and particularly at the start of

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.480 
to be and particularly at the start of
blacklist<00:03:03.170> we<00:03:03.350> were<00:03:03.770> dealing<00:03:03.950> with<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> Sam

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
blacklist we were dealing with a Sam

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.100 
blacklist we were dealing with a Sam
that's<00:03:04.700> in<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.880> very<00:03:05.090> different<00:03:05.420> place<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
that's in a very different place you

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.530 
that's in a very different place you
know<00:03:06.200> he's<00:03:06.380> got<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> more<00:03:06.800> positive<00:03:06.980> outlook

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
know he's got a more positive outlook

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.880 
know he's got a more positive outlook
but<00:03:08.540> when<00:03:08.690> things<00:03:08.900> start<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.170> go<00:03:09.320> wrong<00:03:09.350> then

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
but when things start to go wrong then

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.590 
but when things start to go wrong then
he<00:03:10.040> has<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.370> obviously<00:03:10.490> confront<00:03:11.180> some<00:03:11.360> fairly

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
he has to obviously confront some fairly

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.650 
he has to obviously confront some fairly
dark<00:03:11.900> moments<00:03:12.350> as<00:03:12.500> well<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.040> also<00:03:13.970> in<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.450> best

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
dark moments as well so also in the best

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.560 
dark moments as well so also in the best
installment<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.860> game<00:03:16.040> stick<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.270> was<00:03:17.540> a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
installment of the game stick it was a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.960 
installment of the game stick it was a
staff<00:03:17.989> heavy<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.130> conviction<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.790> was

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
staff heavy but in conviction it was

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.030 
staff heavy but in conviction it was
more<00:03:20.150> than<00:03:20.239> an<00:03:20.390> action<00:03:20.720> game<00:03:20.840> what<00:03:21.620> does<00:03:21.800> black

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
more than an action game what does black

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.420 
more than an action game what does black
the<00:03:22.220> split<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.570> think<00:03:23.690> in<00:03:24.620> blacklist<00:03:25.220> we've

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the split so I think in blacklist we've

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.300 
the split so I think in blacklist we've
definitely<00:03:26.110> sort<00:03:27.110> of<00:03:27.200> embraced<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:28.040> stealth

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
definitely sort of embraced the stealth

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.220 
definitely sort of embraced the stealth
aspect<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.000> game<00:03:29.030> again<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.870> obviously

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
aspect of the game again and obviously

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.530 
aspect of the game again and obviously
there's<00:03:30.590> still<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:31.100> lot<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.550> core

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
there's still a lot of the core

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.970 
there's still a lot of the core
mechanics<00:03:32.989> from<00:03:33.110> conviction<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.650> have

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
mechanics from conviction that have

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.830 
mechanics from conviction that have
continued<00:03:34.820> on<00:03:34.940> into<00:03:35.120> black<00:03:35.390> lists<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:35.810> are

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
continued on into black lists that are

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.650 
continued on into black lists that are
that<00:03:36.200> have<00:03:36.260> been<00:03:36.640> updated<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.820> can<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.420> know

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
that have been updated and can you know

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.800 
that have been updated and can you know
add<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.709> onto<00:03:39.860> but<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.700> feeling<00:03:41.330> is<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.510> we

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
add it onto but the feeling is that we

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.870 
add it onto but the feeling is that we
are<00:03:41.840> supporting<00:03:42.290> multiple<00:03:43.040> styles<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.760> play

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
are supporting multiple styles of play

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.729 
are supporting multiple styles of play
and<00:03:44.239> I'd<00:03:44.540> say<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.080> know<00:03:45.110> two<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.470> those

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
and I'd say that you know two of those

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.100 
and I'd say that you know two of those
core<00:03:46.070> styles<00:03:46.459> are<00:03:46.610> very<00:03:46.640> stealthy<00:03:47.390> there's

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
core styles are very stealthy there's

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.930 
core styles are very stealthy there's
this<00:03:48.290> sort<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.530> true<00:03:48.769> ghosts<00:03:49.250> player<00:03:49.610> who<00:03:49.910> is

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
this sort of true ghosts player who is

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.699 
this sort of true ghosts player who is
probably<00:03:50.540> more<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.870> traditional<00:03:51.050> Splinter

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
probably more the traditional Splinter

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.440 
probably more the traditional Splinter
Cell<00:03:51.890> player<00:03:52.100> who<00:03:52.550> will<00:03:52.820> try<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.060> enter<00:03:53.420> a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
Cell player who will try to enter a

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.960 
Cell player who will try to enter a
space<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.050> be<00:03:54.200> never<00:03:54.980> detected<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.760> never

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
space and be never detected and never

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.670 
space and be never detected and never
leave<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.269> mark<00:03:56.570> you<00:03:57.080> know<00:03:57.170> then<00:03:57.380> you<00:03:57.500> have

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
leave a mark you know then you have

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.080 
leave a mark you know then you have
maybe<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.190> player<00:03:58.370> who's<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.640> little<00:03:58.850> more

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
maybe the player who's a little more

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.490 
maybe the player who's a little more
aggressive<00:03:59.269> with<00:03:59.660> their<00:03:59.780> stealth<00:04:00.080> who<00:04:00.290> sort

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
aggressive with their stealth who sort

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.320 
aggressive with their stealth who sort
of<00:04:00.530> strikes<00:04:00.830> from<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.100> shadows<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.489> is<00:04:02.090> quite

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
of strikes from the shadows and is quite

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.960 
of strikes from the shadows and is quite
lethal<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:03.500> then<00:04:03.830> of<00:04:03.920> course<00:04:04.100> we<00:04:04.220> also<00:04:04.370> we

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
lethal and then of course we also we

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.250 
lethal and then of course we also we
still<00:04:05.180> need<00:04:05.300> to<00:04:05.390> deal<00:04:05.540> with<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.840> scenario

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
still need to deal with the scenario

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.690 
still need to deal with the scenario
where<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.470> player<00:04:06.650> gets<00:04:06.800> detected<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.459> finds

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
where the player gets detected and finds

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.610 
where the player gets detected and finds
themselves<00:04:08.000> in<00:04:08.150> combat<00:04:08.570> so<00:04:08.750> it's<00:04:09.260> true<00:04:09.470> that

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
themselves in combat so it's true that

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.949 
themselves in combat so it's true that
we<00:04:09.739> support<00:04:10.100> you<00:04:10.700> know<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.239> cover<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:11.720> shoot

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
we support you know the cover and shoot

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.330 
we support you know the cover and shoot
mechanics<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.739> game<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.040> we<00:04:13.100> want<00:04:13.280> to

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
mechanics of the game and we want to

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.160 
mechanics of the game and we want to
make<00:04:13.430> sure<00:04:13.459> those<00:04:13.640> feel<00:04:13.880> good<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:14.870> I'd<00:04:14.989> say

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
make sure those feel good but I'd say

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.900 
make sure those feel good but I'd say
that<00:04:15.320> as<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.440> general<00:04:15.650> rule<00:04:15.860> blacklist<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
that as a general rule blacklist the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.229 
that as a general rule blacklist the
ships<00:04:17.150> more<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.630> emphasis<00:04:17.989> back<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.350> stone

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
ships more of the emphasis back to stone

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.850 
ships more of the emphasis back to stone
last<00:04:20.239> question<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.019> most<00:04:21.170> important<00:04:21.709> for

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
last question and the most important for

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.730 
last question and the most important for
us<00:04:21.980> we<00:04:22.640> saw<00:04:22.880> some<00:04:23.240> Arab<00:04:23.780> countries<00:04:24.230> in<00:04:24.440> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
us we saw some Arab countries in the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.620 
us we saw some Arab countries in the
trailer<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.640> also<00:04:26.000> in<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.300> one<00:04:26.420> of<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
trailer and also in the one of the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.290 
trailer and also in the one of the
mission<00:04:27.220> does<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.400> mean<00:04:28.640> an<00:04:28.790> intention<00:04:29.210> of

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
mission does that mean an intention of

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.140 
mission does that mean an intention of
localizing<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:30.020> game<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:30.470> Arabic<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.150> actually

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
localizing the game in Arabic I actually

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.510 
localizing the game in Arabic I actually
don't<00:04:32.450> know<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.750> answer<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.140> that<00:04:33.170> we<00:04:33.860> do<00:04:34.100> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
don't know the answer to that we do the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.730 
don't know the answer to that we do the
localization<00:04:34.970> strategy<00:04:35.240> for<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.900> game<00:04:36.110> is

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
localization strategy for the game is

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.430 
localization strategy for the game is
kind<00:04:37.040> of<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.250> it's<00:04:37.910> complex<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.750> has<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.020> big

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
kind of a it's complex and has a big

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.560 
kind of a it's complex and has a big
scope<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:39.950> so<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.760> don't<00:04:40.820> know<00:04:41.060> all<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.330> the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
scope to it so I don't know all of the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.180 
scope to it so I don't know all of the
languages<00:04:41.900> actually<00:04:42.350> that<00:04:42.770> it's<00:04:42.890> going<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.070> be

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
languages actually that it's going to be

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.770 
languages actually that it's going to be
translated<00:04:43.700> into<00:04:43.790> but<00:04:44.240> it's<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.450> good<00:04:44.600> question

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
translated into but it's a good question

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.900 
translated into but it's a good question
and<00:04:45.200> definitely<00:04:45.770> something<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.130> should<00:04:46.220> you

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
and definitely something you should you
