00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
with Zorro I just love the fact that

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.080 
with Zorro I just love the fact that
they<00:02:29.140> have<00:02:29.290> opponents<00:02:29.799> which<00:02:30.129> truly<00:02:30.489> reflects

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
them in almost every single way and

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.949 
them in almost every single way and
almost<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.640> extremes<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.480> their<00:02:34.629> actual

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
almost to the extremes of their actual

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.899 
almost to the extremes of their actual
personalities<00:02:35.859> I<00:02:36.040> think<00:02:36.459> that's<00:02:36.640> pretty

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
personalities I think that's pretty

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.729 
personalities I think that's pretty
great<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.569> animation<00:02:38.019> between<00:02:38.379> Zorro<00:02:38.650> and

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
great the animation between Zorro and

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.470 
great the animation between Zorro and
pika<00:02:39.069> was<00:02:39.220> also<00:02:39.459> pretty<00:02:39.670> cool<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.209> it's

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
pika was also pretty cool and it's

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.819 
pika was also pretty cool and it's
basically<00:02:40.659> just<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.139> teaser<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.560> what<00:02:41.680> we're

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
basically just a teaser to what we're

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.589 
basically just a teaser to what we're
eventually<00:02:42.220> going<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.459> see<00:02:42.670> same<00:02:43.209> thing<00:02:43.420> with

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
forward to see almost more than any

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.899 
forward to see almost more than any
other<00:02:50.500> battle<00:02:50.920> that's<00:02:51.040> probably<00:02:51.400> been<00:02:51.639> one<00:02:51.819> of

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
other battle that's probably been one of

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.670 
other battle that's probably been one of
my<00:02:51.970> favorite<00:02:52.480> fights<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.319> entire

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
my favorite fights in the entire

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.979 
my favorite fights in the entire
dressrosa<00:02:54.220> art<00:02:54.669> so<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.090> really<00:02:55.480> hope<00:02:55.659> they<00:02:55.810> can

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
dressrosa art so I really hope they can

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.780 
dressrosa art so I really hope they can
do<00:02:56.139> it<00:02:56.290> justice<00:02:56.680> but<00:02:57.099> there's<00:02:57.310> still<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.489> lot<00:02:57.760> of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
do it justice but there's still a lot of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.429 
do it justice but there's still a lot of
really<00:02:58.060> big<00:02:58.269> interesting<00:02:58.840> developments<00:02:59.319> they

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
really big interesting developments they

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.899 
really big interesting developments they
haven't<00:02:59.709> even<00:02:59.769> gotten<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.189> quite<00:03:00.639> yet

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
haven't even gotten to quite yet

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.670 
haven't even gotten to quite yet
otherwise<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.780> was<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> pretty<00:03:02.200> decent

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
otherwise this was a pretty decent

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.710 
otherwise this was a pretty decent
episode<00:03:02.829> of<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:03.700> piece<00:03:03.909> which<00:03:04.359> had<00:03:04.510> some
