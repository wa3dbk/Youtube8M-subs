00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.729
 pull start our story from space 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.730
 I think you know that the earth is on 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.070
 which we live is a huge ball 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.090
 forested mountains 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.310
 oceans and seas do this ball billions 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.539
 years exists in infinite space 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.779
 among other planets and stars 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:31.400
 By the way, remember the star is burning and shining. 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.310
 and the planet is off and not the lights 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.260
 so they rotate in the cosmic 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.020
 space 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.710
 some planets around some stars 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.370
 here our planet earth revolves around 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.300
 the sun the sun warms the earth i 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.130
 light it in the afternoon it that half of the land 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.190
 which remains in the shadows night comes 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:02.120
 there the sun rays do not reach and therefore 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.790
 it's cooler at night than we beat but the earth is all 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.540
 equal turns to the sun then one 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.110
 the sides of the other and light evenly 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.380
 therefore from all sides she has a day 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.550
 night replace each other and around the earth 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.790
 rotates another planet smaller moon and 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.440
 look how interesting it is when there where you are 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.500
 now you are night in the sky visible moon 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.000
 it's because the rays of the sun seem to be 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.300
 because of our back 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.970
 illuminate one side 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.240
 but you certainly noticed that the moon in the sky is not 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.930
 always round it sometimes seems 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.229
 and naser but maybe you don't know what 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.690
 such a Serbian is such an iron thing 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.990
 once a wooden handle 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.229
 sickles people gathered wheat in the field but 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.950
 about it after now see the truth 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.670
 It seems about this well, they say in the sky 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.340
 month shines 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.130
 now if you looked to the telescope you 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.390
 would see that the moon is not becoming so 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.959
 narrow strip 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.110
 it still stays round just on 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.950
 black sky background and and not illuminated 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.220
 part is not visible and what is a telescope you 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.709
 probably already understood it is such a pipe with 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.380
 magnifying and glass in which 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.100
 scientists look when they study distant 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.100
 stars and planets
