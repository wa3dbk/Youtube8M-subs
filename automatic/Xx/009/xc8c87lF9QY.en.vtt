00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.970
 look 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello everyone today we are going to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.199
 prepare a spectacular pork loin 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.199
 in sauce and gruyere cheese 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.760
 The first thing we do is put oil 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.760
 olive a frying pan 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.370
 and we are going to learn 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.790
 no more calls him as such and as we give 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.199
 account already the oil is hot and what 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.010
 what we are going to do is that we are going to seal 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.010
 our loin 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.690
 Now let's add white wine to 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.690
 extract the juices from the loin 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.220
 and then what we 're going to do is we 're going 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.780
 to begin to place our 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.780
 ingredients in order of consistency 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.730
 what we have done with the vegetable is a 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.070
 quick sautéing we finish pepper salt 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.830
 and we're going to bring our loin as much as 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.230
 place over traditional that we're going to 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.620
 take advantage of the juices that we extracted with 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.620
 the White wine 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.220
 let's add chicken broth 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.390
 we 're just not going to take the oven 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.820
 remember that the oven has to be 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.470
 preheated to 160 degrees and we're going to 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.470
 take our back for 20 minutes 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.119
 as we call our tenderloin in the oven 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.650
 let's prepare our accompaniment 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.650
 which is sautéed chicken 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.189
 all right 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 or 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:18.599
 now 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.599
 let's apply butter at the end 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.110
 let's find 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.550
 we already have the purple cabbage ready 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.180
 and let's viewing 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.710
 by doing a quick jump and then we're going to 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.710
 Apply the rest of the ingredients 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.099
 we have our pork loin ready 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.469
 Now what we're going to do is we're going 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.239
 to remove the loin and we will use the 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.430
 juices left by the tenderloin the wine 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.430
 white and chicken stock to prepare 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.430
 our sauce the ingredients are cream 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.239
 alpine milk crunch alpina and cheese 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.239
 alpine cream 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.250
 we have everything on our plate list 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.690
 We left shoulder and now what 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.040
 they do is we're going to serve 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.349
 we are going to place our cabbage in the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.090
 base of the plate and if we are not going to place 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.590
 the loin already portioned and we 're going to 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.920
 finish with our cheese sauce 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.920
 gruyere 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.270
 to decorate we are going to place cheese 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.680
 Gruyere alpina grated and we will decorate 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.120
 with parsley 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.950
 well we have our dish ready as 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.810
 most important here is that you are 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.459
 preparing it with their families and that 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.720
 use alpine products a 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.630
 recommendation to accompany this 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.630
 Dish is a red wine and good profit
