00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 ahead of two but a fast Peru 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.589
 100 tracks like marcelo bielsa su 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 technician daniel ahmed is a disciple of 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.960
 crazy from here came the first emotion 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.210
 of the party at minute 19 to policemen to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
 jordi queens winning the backs with the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800
 fantastic filtered ball and number 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.930
 17 marked the first goal of the game 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.520
 The first of Peru's South American 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.950
 put up 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.520
 against a Uruguay that marking 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.430
 steels 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.290
 uruguay insisted uruguay tried not to 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.440
 societies appeared but finally 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.450
 a barbarous play between three of those who 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.120
 better play before scratching and for rubén 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.430
 betancourt and the filtered pass so that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.870
 nico lopez the one from la roma for a touch 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 smooth between the legs of the archer 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.650
 angel ocampos mark the deserved 1 to 1 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.250
 the celestial celebrated but Peru had 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.310
 something else and it was a little something a bomb 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.010
 riflazo an unstoppable zurdazo I hit him 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.600
 edwin gómez on that side where they are that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.980
 Uruguay suffered the right side of the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.980
 serious defense 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.230
 and again a bad move from the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.260
 selection but now there is a fast 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.300
 Uruguayan exit maybe every minute 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.800
 that I see it seems more like 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.650
 cavani by the way to run by the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.560
 way to define and by definition and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.180
 for the celebration deserved result another 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.450
 once the ball passes between the legs 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.670
 of the archer evangelize the excellent field what 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.730
 from uruguay the play is born in the feet 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.340
 that ends up defining the roland player 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.430
 the entered one now discards a 0 the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.680
 head butt of number 9 and said 14 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.619
 not because the three above have marked 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.590
 goals first conical lopez then 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.280
 betancourt dialing 2 to 2 and now 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 I say roland as 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.240
 and finally I hit him 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.780
 but 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.000
 believes that the end to win with the 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.000
 tie
