00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
about planks yes we know that they're a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.200 
about planks yes we know that they're a
good<00:00:34.830> way<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.070> measure<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:35.489> core<00:00:35.820> strength

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
good way to measure your core strength

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.060 
good way to measure your core strength
and<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.870> lot<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.080> people<00:00:37.260> use<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.710> time<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and a lot of people use it as a time to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
and a lot of people use it as a time to
test<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.670> how<00:00:38.940> long<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.420> hold<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.750> for

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
test to see how long you can hold it for

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
test to see how long you can hold it for
but<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.650> me<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.100> doesn't<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.460> matter<00:00:41.790> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
but to me it doesn't really matter so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
but to me it doesn't really matter so
much<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.750> kind<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.320> plank<00:00:43.650> that<00:00:43.770> you're

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
much it's the kind of plank that you're

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.160 
much it's the kind of plank that you're
doing<00:00:44.340> because<00:00:44.820> slight<00:00:45.420> variations<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.110> your

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
doing because slight variations in your

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
doing because slight variations in your
body<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.220> way<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> position<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
body and the way that you position it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.030 
body and the way that you position it
can<00:00:48.870> make<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> exercise<00:00:49.559> completely

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
can make the exercise completely

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.650 
can make the exercise completely
different<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.940> let<00:00:51.030> me<00:00:51.120> take<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
different so let me take you down and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.740 
different so let me take you down and
show<00:00:51.720> you<00:00:51.840> exactly<00:00:51.989> how<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.680> works<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
show you exactly how this works out and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
show you exactly how this works out and
how<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.080> make<00:00:55.290> a<00:00:55.320> more<00:00:55.590> challenging<00:00:56.160> as

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
how you can make a more challenging as

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.100 
how you can make a more challenging as
you<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.550> stronger<00:00:56.880> and<00:00:57.180> remember<00:00:57.989> that's

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
you get stronger and remember that's

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.380 
you get stronger and remember that's
what<00:00:58.530> athlean-x<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.130> all<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.550> it's<00:01:00.149> not

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
what athlean-x is all about it's not

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
what athlean-x is all about it's not
just<00:01:00.660> throwing<00:01:00.960> some<00:01:01.260> program<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.860> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
just throwing some program at you and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.310 
just throwing some program at you and
saying<00:01:02.190> hey<00:01:02.790> go<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.420> guys<00:01:03.450> good<00:01:04.290> luck

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
saying hey go get them guys good luck

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.070 
saying hey go get them guys good luck
it's<00:01:05.009> about<00:01:05.250> matching<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:06.360> ability<00:01:06.750> levels

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it's about matching your ability levels

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
it's about matching your ability levels
so<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.229> showing<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.520> science<00:01:08.880> behind

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
so that showing you the science behind

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.460 
so that showing you the science behind
the<00:01:09.240> strength<00:01:09.270> since<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.020> always<00:01:10.200> make

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the strength since you can always make

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.680 
the strength since you can always make
an<00:01:10.649> exercise<00:01:11.100> more<00:01:11.640> difficult<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.270> continue

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
an exercise more difficult and continue

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.480 
an exercise more difficult and continue
to<00:01:12.810> grow<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.259> program<00:01:13.649> not<00:01:14.220> about

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to grow with the program not about

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.249 
to grow with the program not about
having<00:01:14.910> just<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:15.180> 90-day<00:01:15.509> program<00:01:15.899> that<00:01:16.080> you're

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
having just a 90-day program that you're

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.670 
having just a 90-day program that you're
done<00:01:16.440> without<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.860> 90<00:01:17.070> days<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.680> first

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
done without for 90 days so now first

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
done without for 90 days so now first
and<00:01:19.890> foremost<00:01:20.280> we've<00:01:20.550> seen<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.149> mean<00:01:21.360> as

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and foremost we've seen like I mean as

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.200 
and foremost we've seen like I mean as
basic<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.259> gets<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.710> rehab<00:01:23.190> someone<00:01:24.000> trying

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
basic as it gets in rehab someone trying

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.580 
basic as it gets in rehab someone trying
to<00:01:24.270> try<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.170> bit<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.410> core

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to try to get back a little bit of core

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.320 
to try to get back a little bit of core
strength<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:26.369> start<00:01:26.670> off<00:01:26.789> in<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.090> quadrant

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
strength they start off in that quadrant

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
strength they start off in that quadrant
head<00:01:27.660> position<00:01:28.110> hands<00:01:28.350> knees<00:01:29.220> straight<00:01:29.670> down

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
head position hands knees straight down

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.040 
head position hands knees straight down
now<00:01:30.090> what's<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.450> main<00:01:30.660> difference<00:01:31.020> between

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
now what's the main difference between

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.010 
now what's the main difference between
this<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.830> we<00:01:32.640> put<00:01:32.850> your<00:01:33.000> feet<00:01:33.179> out<00:01:33.300> behind<00:01:33.690> you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
this and we put your feet out behind you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.380 
this and we put your feet out behind you
it's<00:01:34.679> just<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.039> length<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.490> lever<00:01:35.670> arm<00:01:35.910> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's just the length of the lever arm so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.320 
it's just the length of the lever arm so
that<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.750> by<00:01:37.470> bringing<00:01:38.009> my<00:01:38.280> feet<00:01:38.580> back<00:01:38.910> more

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
that now by bringing my feet back more

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.199 
that now by bringing my feet back more
behind<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.899> that<00:01:40.380> lever<00:01:40.740> arm<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.670> ABS<00:01:41.849> are

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
behind me that lever arm on the ABS are

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.109 
behind me that lever arm on the ABS are
doing<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.539> work<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.130> longer<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.580> now<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.819> have

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
doing the work is longer so now I have

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.059 
doing the work is longer so now I have
to<00:01:45.360> work<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.380> bit<00:01:46.560> harder<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.009> this

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
to work a little bit harder in this

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.249 
to work a little bit harder in this
position<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.390> you're<00:01:48.509> trying<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.080> is

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
position and what you're trying to do is

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.960 
position and what you're trying to do is
you're<00:01:49.410> trying<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.740> sort<00:01:50.039> of<00:01:50.099> just<00:01:50.280> keep<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
you're trying to sort of just keep the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.320 
you're trying to sort of just keep the
back<00:01:51.209> of<00:01:51.420> your<00:01:51.479> head<00:01:51.720> flat<00:01:52.619> level<00:01:53.429> you<00:01:54.240> know

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
back of your head flat level you know

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.419 
back of your head flat level you know
with<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.630> shoulder<00:01:54.899> blades<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.679> with<00:01:55.890> your

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
with your shoulder blades and with your

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.419 
with your shoulder blades and with your
tailbone<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.179> everything<00:01:57.539> sort<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> sits

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
tailbone so that everything sort of sits

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.520 
tailbone so that everything sort of sits
straight<00:01:59.429> this<00:01:59.990> angle<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.349> have<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
straight this angle now if you have a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.690 
straight this angle now if you have a
little<00:02:01.709> bit<00:02:01.800> longer<00:02:01.950> arms<00:02:02.429> you're<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.640> to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
little bit longer arms you're going to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.699 
little bit longer arms you're going to
angle<00:02:02.819> up<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.179> little<00:02:03.360> bit<00:02:03.539> but<00:02:03.720> that's<00:02:03.869> still

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
angle up a little bit but that's still

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:05.510 
angle up a little bit but that's still
as<00:02:04.860> long<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.099> you're<00:02:05.220> keeping<00:02:05.459> everything

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
as long as you're keeping everything

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.389 
as long as you're keeping everything
straight<00:02:06.090> you're<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.840> allowing<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:07.530> ABS<00:02:07.709> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
straight you're not allowing the ABS to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.410 
straight you're not allowing the ABS to
break<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.090> sag<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.679> should<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.009> okay

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
break and sag down you should be okay

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.320 
break and sag down you should be okay
now<00:02:12.770> people<00:02:13.770> ask<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.370> more<00:02:14.640> difficult<00:02:14.790> or

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
now people ask is this more difficult or

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.479 
now people ask is this more difficult or
why<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.900> more<00:02:16.110> difficult<00:02:16.290> or<00:02:16.739> less

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
why is this more difficult or less

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.280 
why is this more difficult or less
difficult<00:02:17.970> than<00:02:18.030> any<00:02:18.390> other<00:02:18.599> variation<00:02:18.870> well

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
difficult than any other variation well

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.510 
difficult than any other variation well
if<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.440> bring<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.739> straight<00:02:19.860> down<00:02:20.160> into<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
if you bring it straight down into the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.080 
if you bring it straight down into the
ground

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
ground

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.449 
ground
now<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.870> have<00:02:22.140> another<00:02:22.260> another<00:02:22.920> aspect

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
now you have another another aspect

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.170 
now you have another another aspect
that's<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.390> play<00:02:24.599> now<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:26.280> are<00:02:26.580> taking<00:02:26.849> out

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that's in play now you are taking out

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.839 
that's in play now you are taking out
the<00:02:27.450> strength<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.110> chest<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.849> mechanical

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
the strength of the chest and mechanical

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.569 
the strength of the chest and mechanical
advantage<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.420> had<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.870> here<00:02:31.430> right<00:02:32.430> if

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
advantage that you had up here right if

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.190 
advantage that you had up here right if
you<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.879> our<00:02:33.030> chest<00:02:33.329> in<00:02:33.510> play<00:02:33.719> that<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.049> help

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you have our chest in play that can help

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.740 
you have our chest in play that can help
out<00:02:34.409> a<00:02:34.439> lot<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.010> our<00:02:35.760> shoulder<00:02:36.180> blade

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
out a lot and our shoulder blade

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.200 
out a lot and our shoulder blade
are<00:02:37.080> supported<00:02:37.800> by<00:02:37.980> our<00:02:38.010> arms<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.820> other<00:02:39.030> words

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
are supported by our arms in other words

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.380 
are supported by our arms in other words
the<00:02:39.270> structure<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.960> our<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:41.010> our<00:02:41.550> back<00:02:41.820> here<00:02:42.210> in

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the structure of our of our back here in

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.550 
the structure of our of our back here in
our<00:02:42.480> shoulder<00:02:42.810> blades<00:02:42.990> can<00:02:43.200> pretty<00:02:43.380> much

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
our shoulder blades can pretty much

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.710 
our shoulder blades can pretty much
almost<00:02:43.740> rest<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.550> joint<00:02:44.850> right<00:02:45.390> here<00:02:45.600> it's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
almost rest in the joint right here it's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.150 
almost rest in the joint right here it's
actually<00:02:45.960> going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> compress<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.890> floor

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
actually going to compress on the floor

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.980 
actually going to compress on the floor
so<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:47.850> easier<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.360> hold<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.810> position

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
so it's easier to hold that position

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.590 
so it's easier to hold that position
than<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.100> here<00:02:50.130> now<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.700> take<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> chest<00:02:51.330> out

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
than it is here now I take the chest out

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.320 
than it is here now I take the chest out
of<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.230> most<00:02:52.440> part<00:02:52.580> now<00:02:53.580> relying<00:02:54.180> a

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
of it for the most part now relying a

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.480 
of it for the most part now relying a
lot<00:02:54.480> more<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.900> abs<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.470> hold<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:56.220> plank

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
lot more of the abs to hold the plank

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.920 
lot more of the abs to hold the plank
and<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.600> kind<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.410> area<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.640> here<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.270> now

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
and this kind of area in here is now

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.870 
and this kind of area in here is now
more<00:03:01.260> dependent<00:03:02.040> as<00:03:02.100> well<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.700> inner

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
more dependent as well the inner

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.480 
more dependent as well the inner
scapular<00:03:03.450> area<00:03:03.780> because<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.380> don't<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
scapular area because I don't have the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.730 
scapular area because I don't have the
ability<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.940> sort<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.210> again<00:03:06.570> rest<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.560> lock

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
ability to sort of again rest and lock

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.560 
ability to sort of again rest and lock
into<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.130> joints<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.850> now<00:03:09.180> have<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.390> rely

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
into the joints and now have to rely

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.740 
into the joints and now have to rely
more<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.140> strength<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:12.000> area<00:03:12.570> between

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
more on the strength in the area between

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.460 
more on the strength in the area between
my<00:03:12.930> shoulder<00:03:13.200> blades

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
my shoulder blades

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.940 
my shoulder blades
so<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.520> more<00:03:14.760> difficult<00:03:14.880> variation

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
so this is a more difficult variation

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.760 
so this is a more difficult variation
now<00:03:17.180> if<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.630> want<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.020> make<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.440> little<00:03:19.560> bit

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
now if I want to make that a little bit

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.250 
now if I want to make that a little bit
harder<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.280> got<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.730> change<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.720> elevation

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
harder I got to change the elevation

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.220 
harder I got to change the elevation
angle<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.860> now<00:03:23.070> up<00:03:23.370> onto<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> bench<00:03:24.240> what

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
angle so that now up onto a bench what

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.370 
angle so that now up onto a bench what
this<00:03:25.440> does<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:26.870> increases<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.170> likelihood

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
this does is increases the likelihood

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.770 
this does is increases the likelihood
that<00:03:29.240> I<00:03:30.240> would<00:03:30.600> sag<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.920> succumb<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:33.510> you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
that I would sag to succumb to the you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.620 
that I would sag to succumb to the you
know<00:03:33.900> gravity<00:03:34.140> basically<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.400> now<00:03:35.730> I've

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
know gravity basically so that now I've

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.760 
know gravity basically so that now I've
got<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> bigger<00:03:37.140> potential<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:39.710> resent<00:03:40.710> you

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
got a bigger potential to resent you

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.890 
got a bigger potential to resent you
know<00:03:40.860> cave-in<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.940> now<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> got<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.660> even

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
know cave-in so now I got to just even

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.170 
know cave-in so now I got to just even
more<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.830> core<00:03:44.070> in<00:03:44.640> order<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.880> be<00:03:44.970> able<00:03:45.030> to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
more to the core in order to be able to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.680 
more to the core in order to be able to
hold<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:46.160> ok<00:03:47.160> another<00:03:47.550> element<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.300> you

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
hold that ok another element that you

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.190 
hold that ok another element that you
can<00:03:48.840> continue<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.800> progress<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.640> your<00:03:51.630> base

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
can continue to progress to is your base

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.380 
can continue to progress to is your base
of<00:03:52.440> support<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.430> wider<00:03:53.730> your<00:03:54.000> base<00:03:54.210> of

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
of support the wider your base of

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.800 
of support the wider your base of
support

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
support

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.660 
support
I'll<00:03:54.930> come<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.230> way<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.590> can<00:03:55.710> see<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:55.980> the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
I'll come this way so you can see it the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.540 
I'll come this way so you can see it the
easier<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.600> exercise<00:03:58.080> is<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.100> if<00:03:59.190> I'm<00:03:59.340> having

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
easier the exercise is so if I'm having

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.700 
easier the exercise is so if I'm having
my<00:03:59.700> hands<00:03:59.970> out<00:04:00.210> here<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.810> my<00:04:00.960> feet<00:04:01.200> wide

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
my hands out here and my feet wide

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.020 
my hands out here and my feet wide
I'm<00:04:02.040> going<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.280> be<00:04:02.340> able<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.490> hold<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:02.880> lot

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
I'm going to be able to hold it a lot

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.330 
I'm going to be able to hold it a lot
longer<00:04:03.210> than<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.780> can<00:04:04.080> if<00:04:04.530> everything<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.190> in

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
longer than I can if everything is in

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.520 
longer than I can if everything is in
nice<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.790> close<00:04:05.820> together<00:04:06.350> because<00:04:07.350> now<00:04:07.500> I

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
nice and close together because now I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.880 
nice and close together because now I
have<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.800> tendency<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.520> rock<00:04:09.180> side<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.110> side<00:04:10.260> and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
have a tendency to rock side to side and

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.610 
have a tendency to rock side to side and
I<00:04:11.040> have<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.430> prevent<00:04:12.240> that<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:12.930> more<00:04:13.200> muscles

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
I have to prevent that so more muscles

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.820 
I have to prevent that so more muscles
more<00:04:14.870> more<00:04:15.870> work<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.290> do<00:04:16.440> that

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
more more work to do that

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.670 
more more work to do that
and<00:04:16.920> same<00:04:17.910> thing<00:04:17.940> back<00:04:18.299> up<00:04:18.330> here<00:04:18.690> too<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.470> is

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
and same thing back up here too this is

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.680 
and same thing back up here too this is
an<00:04:19.770> easier<00:04:20.040> version<00:04:20.220> than<00:04:20.820> everything

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
an easier version than everything

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.720 
an easier version than everything
stacked<00:04:21.930> together<00:04:22.109> so<00:04:22.800> we<00:04:23.370> talked<00:04:23.610> about

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
stacked together so we talked about

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.850 
stacked together so we talked about
lever<00:04:24.060> arm<00:04:24.300> we<00:04:24.690> talked<00:04:24.900> about<00:04:24.990> base<00:04:25.650> of

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
lever arm we talked about base of

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.840 
lever arm we talked about base of
support<00:04:26.360> what<00:04:27.360> if<00:04:27.510> we<00:04:27.720> did<00:04:27.930> one<00:04:28.500> killer

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
support what if we did one killer

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.970 
support what if we did one killer
variation<00:04:29.850> you<00:04:30.420> know<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:30.780> no<00:04:31.440> exercise<00:04:31.950> no

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980

variation you know that no exercise no
athlean-x<00:04:32.700> video<00:04:33.450> is<00:04:33.750> complete<00:04:34.440> without<00:04:34.830> one

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
athlean-x video is complete without one

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.670 
athlean-x video is complete without one
so<00:04:35.520> let's<00:04:36.360> get<00:04:36.570> ourselves<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:37.230> little<00:04:37.440> bit<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.650> a

so let's get ourselves a little bit of a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.530 
so let's get ourselves a little bit of a
challenge<00:04:38.100> here<00:04:38.390> we're<00:04:39.390> going<00:04:39.480> to

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
challenge here we're going to

incorporate all that we're going to
narrow<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.250> base<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.550> support<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.210> we're

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
narrow the base of support and we're

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.719 
narrow the base of support and we're
going<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.930> lengthen<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.890> lever<00:04:44.100> arm<00:04:44.400> we're

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
going to lengthen that lever arm we're

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.610 
going to lengthen that lever arm we're
going<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:44.910> do<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.210> by<00:04:45.900> taking<00:04:46.080> out<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> weight

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
going to do that by taking out a weight

we had a suspension about hands up off
the<00:05:06.690> ground<00:05:07.070> suspension<00:05:08.070> so<00:05:08.250> there's<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.430> lot

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
the ground suspension so there's a lot

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.340 
the ground suspension so there's a lot
more<00:05:08.730> work<00:05:08.910> being<00:05:09.090> done<00:05:09.210> this<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:10.020> kind<00:05:10.230> of<00:05:10.290> a

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
more work being done this is kind of a

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.800 
more work being done this is kind of a
combination<00:05:10.650> of<00:05:10.950> all<00:05:11.160> those<00:05:11.310> things<00:05:11.810> right

you got a stabilizes plate down so next

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.820 
you got a stabilizes plate down so next
time<00:05:36.600> someone<00:05:36.870> ask<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.290> how<00:05:37.440> long<00:05:37.500> can<00:05:37.770> you

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
right they're going to gauge how strong
