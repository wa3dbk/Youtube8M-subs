 how do you know 

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:02.479
 3 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:04.290
 in recuperate 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.580
 include serving 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.319
 the honor yes the real geerinck 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.919
 if it goes well with feyenoord he will no longer be extended hollandia t 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.059
 shirts from 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.579
 pot that these kids from group b with two who may already have the first letter of it 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.150
 a civil servant 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 a church 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.050
 3 it is often thought that children fit in group 3 start learning to read and 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.370
 writing but much earlier if a four or five are discovered is the connection 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.800
 between sounds 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.890
 and letters in the beginning with the first letter of your own name is there 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 the game letters in motion based on 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.890
 I stop 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.110
 evs 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.110
 X 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 the game letters in motion has been developed in collaboration with the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.440
 University of Leiden 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.230
 and it's all about being aware of more news 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.020
 be aware for lewis, that is, children 10 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.710
 signs and sounds 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.670
 In other words 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.719
 that they realize 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.110
 that this is not just like that 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.730
 there are but then for example 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.160
 because you are standing in front of the shelves 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.660
 a round with the couples is on 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.120
 for the sound 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.860
 turn 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.150
 for a minor mood 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
 the reason for the rise many women 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.660
 very good the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.160
 he just looks at it 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.910
 research shows that the development of 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.530
 formal is being aware 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.950
 an important step 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.760
 in learning to read we write how exactly that is, I say 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.670
 baarn 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.880
 emmeloord is from porto educational institute modern art 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.720
 if you can distinguish those sounds in one word then you can in a next one 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 get the letters that buy it back on the shelf 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.430
 and hears people on board as a whole and does not know that there 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.900
 different sounds to be in yes then messier a very essential 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.899
 learning to read skills 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 roj 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.819
 scientific research has established that it is the first 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.279
 letter or first sounds of your own name that is actually the first one 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.419
 children learn 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:35.540
 and therefore it is so good to start with it because it fits 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:40.900
 at the eu there is just the normal order in which children themselves automate that 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:45.439
 This is also a very nice build in building with natural learning 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.439
 of children follows 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.299
 it is 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.399
 it is very efficient 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.929
 nothing great that those contacts 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:57.729
 a child
