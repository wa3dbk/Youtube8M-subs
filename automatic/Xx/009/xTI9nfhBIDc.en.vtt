00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.780 

so<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.690> accelerator<00:00:06.690> again<00:00:07.200> but<00:00:08.010> ever

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
so this is a accelerator again but ever

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.549 
so this is a accelerator again but ever
since<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.270> did<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.540> first<00:00:09.719> video<00:00:10.020> which

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
since I did that first video which

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.900 
since I did that first video which
wasn't<00:00:10.800> too<00:00:11.070> long<00:00:11.220> ago<00:00:11.280> at<00:00:11.550> all<00:00:11.700> he<00:00:11.880> was

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
wasn't too long ago at all he was

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.940 
wasn't too long ago at all he was
actually<00:00:12.150> updating<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.870> game<00:00:13.080> as<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.679> did<00:00:13.920> that

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
actually updating the game as I did that

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.030 
actually updating the game as I did that
video<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.929> didn't<00:00:16.200> know<00:00:16.290> about<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.710> so

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
video and I didn't know about it so

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.560 
video and I didn't know about it so
that's<00:00:17.400> why<00:00:17.550> there<00:00:17.700> wasn't<00:00:17.820> any<00:00:18.000> blue<00:00:18.210> squares

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
that's why there wasn't any blue squares

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.380 
that's why there wasn't any blue squares
in<00:00:18.779> part<00:00:19.020> 1<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:19.380> part<00:00:19.560> 2<00:00:19.739> I<00:00:20.009> mean<00:00:20.970> he<00:00:21.090> sends

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
in part 1 or part 2 I mean he sends

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630 
in part 1 or part 2 I mean he sends
added<00:00:21.630> sensitivity<00:00:22.230> options<00:00:22.560> inverting<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
added sensitivity options inverting the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
added sensitivity options inverting the
y<00:00:23.790> axis<00:00:24.329> two<00:00:25.050> different<00:00:25.380> mouse<00:00:25.529> modes<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
y axis two different mouse modes the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400 
y axis two different mouse modes the
quality<00:00:26.700> image<00:00:27.119> effects<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.840> roll<00:00:28.200> back

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
quality image effects you can roll back

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.990 
quality image effects you can roll back
and<00:00:28.649> forth<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.040> can<00:00:29.099> pause<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.550> game<00:00:29.579> you<00:00:29.849> can

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000

and forth you can pause the game you can
mute<00:00:30.270> it<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:31.079> better<00:00:31.680> ranking<00:00:32.189> system<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.669> can

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
mute it a better ranking system you can

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.190 
mute it a better ranking system you can
actually<00:00:32.910> start<00:00:33.390> at<00:00:33.540> whatever<00:00:33.720> your<00:00:33.960> last

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200

speed was that you achieved it's got

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.880 
speed was that you achieved it's got
competitive<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.140> practice<00:00:37.469> mode<00:00:37.679> where<00:00:37.859> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
competitive and practice mode where you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.099 
competitive and practice mode where you
can<00:00:37.949> go<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> maximum<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.449> it's<00:00:39.840> pretty

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
can go up to maximum and it's pretty

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.860 
can go up to maximum and it's pretty
nuts<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:41.039> pretty<00:00:41.250> nuts<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.750> want

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.260 
competitive again where I'm ranked three
thousand<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:41.550> really<00:01:41.610> sure<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
thousand so I'm not really sure what the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.150 
thousand so I'm not really sure what the
rolling<00:01:42.600> feature<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> mean

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
rolling feature actually is for I mean

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.740 
rolling feature actually is for I mean
beside<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.640> giving<00:01:44.880> more<00:01:45.030> control<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.630> it's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
beside just giving more control but it's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.060 
beside just giving more control but it's
like<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.990> haven't<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.290> seen<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.590> use<00:01:46.830> for<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
like I haven't really seen a use for it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
like I haven't really seen a use for it
yet<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.340> gameplay<00:01:47.540> besides<00:01:48.540> big<00:01:48.869> having

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
yet in gameplay besides big having

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.359 
yet in gameplay besides big having
bragging<00:01:49.650> rights<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> could<00:01:50.250> basically

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
bragging rights so you could basically

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.920 
bragging rights so you could basically

it<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.130> every<00:02:02.340> 100<00:02:03.200> every<00:02:04.200> 100<00:02:04.770> whatever<00:02:05.160> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it but every 100 every 100 whatever it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.880 
it but every 100 every 100 whatever it
is<00:02:05.490> distance<00:02:06.300> marker<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:07.110> shit<00:02:07.470> glows<00:02:07.860> a

is distance marker your shit glows a
little<00:02:08.220> bit<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.460> then<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.640> gets<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.819> different

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
little bit and then it gets a different

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.820 
little bit and then it gets a different
color<00:02:09.240> which<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.479> kind<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.690> cool<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.360 
here I barely have to like move the
mouse<00:02:18.780> at<00:02:18.990> all<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.800> that's<00:02:19.920> really<00:02:20.040> helpful

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
mouse at all so that's really helpful

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.309 
mouse at all so that's really helpful
and<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.420> yeah<00:02:21.600> now<00:02:21.780> there's<00:02:21.930> these<00:02:22.080> blue

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
and so yeah now there's these blue

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.770 
and so yeah now there's these blue
tunnels<00:02:22.709> with<00:02:22.800> big-ass<00:02:23.040> squares<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.760> which<00:02:24.630> is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
tunnels with big-ass squares in which is

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.750 
tunnels with big-ass squares in which is
definitely<00:02:24.959> kind<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.380> breaks<00:02:25.650> up<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.920> game

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
definitely kind of breaks up the game

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.970 
definitely kind of breaks up the game
like<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.810> mean<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.110> good<00:02:28.140> way<00:02:28.319> kind<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.830> like

mouse<00:04:02.430> gets<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> certain<00:04:03.390> point<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.990> you

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
mouse gets to a certain point like you

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.960 
mouse gets to a certain point like you
keep<00:04:04.350> on<00:04:04.530> moving<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.070> know<00:04:05.190> because<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
keep on moving it you know because the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.940 
keep on moving it you know because the
maze<00:04:06.180> is<00:04:06.390> like<00:04:06.570> moving<00:04:06.750> maybe<00:04:07.440> that's<00:04:07.740> what

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
maze is like moving maybe that's what

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.370 
maze is like moving maybe that's what
role<00:04:08.220> would<00:04:08.370> be<00:04:08.430> good<00:04:08.670> for<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.300> like<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.230> could

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
role would be good for is like you could

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.480 
role would be good for is like you could
roll<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:10.800> then<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.040> can<00:04:11.190> just<00:04:11.310> basically

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
roll it and then you can just basically

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.680 
roll it and then you can just basically
move<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.880> other<00:04:12.000> way<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.240> know<00:04:12.330> what<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.540> mean

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
move the other way you know what I mean

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.510 
move the other way you know what I mean
like<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.560> start<00:04:13.800> having<00:04:13.890> stuff<00:04:14.190> like<00:04:14.310> come

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
like you start having stuff like come

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.090 
like you start having stuff like come
the<00:04:14.610> other<00:04:14.730> way<00:04:15.440> like<00:04:16.440> stake<00:04:16.739> here<00:04:16.859> like<00:04:17.010> you

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
the other way like stake here like you

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.140 
the other way like stake here like you
know<00:04:17.190> something<00:04:17.340> like<00:04:17.549> moving<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.000> right

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
know something like moving to the right

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.880 
know something like moving to the right
a<00:04:18.209> lot<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:18.720> now<00:04:19.170> it's<00:04:19.320> like<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.500> could<00:04:19.650> roll<00:04:19.859> a

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
a lot and now it's like I could roll a

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.890 
a lot and now it's like I could roll a
maze<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.640> then<00:04:20.670> I<00:04:21.150> could<00:04:21.359> move<00:04:21.540> back<00:04:21.600> the

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
maze and then I could move back the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.300 
maze and then I could move back the
other<00:04:21.930> way<00:04:22.170> if<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.560> makes<00:04:22.590> any<00:04:22.800> sense<00:04:22.950> but

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
other way if that makes any sense but

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.500 
other way if that makes any sense but
you<00:04:23.430> kind<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.640> have<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.790> know<00:04:23.970> what's<00:04:24.180> coming

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
you kind of have to know what's coming

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.150 
you kind of have to know what's coming
too<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.290> don't<00:04:25.410> know<00:04:25.470> how<00:04:25.500> much<00:04:25.680> since<00:04:25.950> that

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
too so I don't know how much since that

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.030 
too so I don't know how much since that
would<00:04:26.280> make<00:04:27.500> kind<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.560> be<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.680> gamble

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.680 

I<00:04:32.100> see<00:04:32.760> I'm<00:04:32.820> moving<00:04:33.060> similar<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.420> the<00:04:33.510> right

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
I see I'm moving similar to the right

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.760 
I see I'm moving similar to the right
now<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.050> I'm<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.230> kind<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.410> running<00:04:34.650> out<00:04:34.710> of
