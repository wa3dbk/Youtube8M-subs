lipo with the Millennium the XLT it is
currently<00:00:21.810> running<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:27.470> I<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
currently running a I think it's a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.979 
currently running a I think it's a
fourteen<00:00:29.840> on<00:00:30.840> 87<00:00:31.650> ratio<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.840> teeth<00:00:34.110> are<00:00:35.989> not

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
fourteen on 87 ratio the teeth are not

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.540 
fourteen on 87 ratio the teeth are not
in<00:00:37.230> great<00:00:37.500> condition<00:00:37.620> they're<00:00:38.340> pretty

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
in great condition they're pretty

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
in great condition they're pretty
rounded<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:41.510> worn<00:00:42.510> down<00:00:42.690> spot

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
rounded you can see that worn down spot

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.590 
rounded you can see that worn down spot
through<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> middle<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
through the middle of it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.959 
through the middle of it
so<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.780> during<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.170> video<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:47.460> starts<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so if during this video it starts to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.439 
so if during this video it starts to
slip<00:00:49.610> that'll<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.850> alright<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.360> I'm

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
slip that'll be it alright so I'm

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.090 
slip that'll be it alright so I'm
filming<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.260> hand<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.620> driving<00:00:52.980> with

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
filming with one hand and driving with

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:47.160 
filming with one hand and driving with
the<00:00:53.219> other

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:02:25.429 

Oh

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.899 

my<00:02:26.439> honest<00:02:26.739> guess<00:02:26.980> would<00:02:27.189> be<00:02:27.219> about<00:02:27.519> 50

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
my honest guess would be about 50

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.209 
my honest guess would be about 50
mile-an-hour<00:02:28.799> that's<00:02:29.799> with<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.849> gear<00:02:31.180> ratio

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
mile-an-hour that's with this gear ratio

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.339 
mile-an-hour that's with this gear ratio
probably<00:02:33.219> did<00:02:33.310> about<00:02:33.489> 65<00:02:34.030> with<00:02:34.359> the<00:02:34.480> 25<00:02:34.900> pinion

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
probably did about 65 with the 25 pinion

00:02:35.349 --> 00:03:24.290 
probably did about 65 with the 25 pinion
on<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:39.870> yeah<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.109> guess<00:02:41.590> about<00:02:42.129> 50

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:42.199 

so<00:03:25.300> this<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:29.340> three<00:03:30.340> cell<00:03:31.260> 35<00:03:32.260> C<00:03:32.560> battery<00:03:33.100> I

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209
