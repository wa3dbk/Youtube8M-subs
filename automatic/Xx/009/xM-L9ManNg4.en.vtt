difference<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:30.060> spelunky<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:30.689> I'm

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
difference with spelunky because I'm

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
difference with spelunky because I'm
actually<00:00:30.900> playing<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> 1280<00:00:32.040> by<00:00:32.189> 720

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
window so it wouldn't really be that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.970 
window so it wouldn't really be that
much<00:00:34.829> better<00:00:35.300> it'd<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.630> scaled<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.140> very

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
