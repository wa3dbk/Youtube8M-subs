the<00:00:17.670> god<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:18.000> comes<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.199> apparently

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the god was comes out and apparently

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.490 
the god was comes out and apparently
it's<00:00:20.369> impossible<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> get<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.810> right<00:00:21.990> now

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
it's impossible to get it right now

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.310 
it's impossible to get it right now
I'm<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.920> sad<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> checked<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> wiki<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.900> no

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
I'm just sad I checked the wiki and no

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.080 
I'm just sad I checked the wiki and no
it's<00:00:25.500> not<00:00:25.680> possible<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.550> if<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.849> lost

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's not possible to get it if you lost

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.900 
it's not possible to get it if you lost
it<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.840> not<00:00:28.080> possible<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.279> guess<00:00:29.760> I'll

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it it's not possible so I guess I'll

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.550 
it it's not possible so I guess I'll
have<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> wait<00:00:30.390> until<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.929> god<00:00:31.080> words<00:00:31.320> come

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
have to wait until the god words come

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.220 
have to wait until the god words come

didn't actually have like a proper poll
yet<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.409> may<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.799> pass<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.700> be

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
yet and it may not pass which would be

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
yet and it may not pass which would be

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
really sad because currently I'm so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.620 
really sad because currently I'm so
excited<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.670> god<00:01:17.820> words<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.479> know

I just want them to come out and the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.880 
I just want them to come out and the
reason<00:01:21.570> why<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> kill<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> animal

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
reason why I want to kill the animal

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
reason why I want to kill the animal
boss<00:01:23.220> instead<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> something<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.240> Bandos

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
boss instead of something like Bandos

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.800 
boss instead of something like Bandos
it's<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.369> hilt<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.909> worth<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's not because the hilt is worth the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.010 
it's not because the hilt is worth the
most<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.619> ok<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.520> may<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.509> case<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
most which ok that may be the case a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140 
most which ok that may be the case a
little<00:01:31.229> bit<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.520> reason<00:01:32.790> why<00:01:32.909> I'm<00:01:32.970> gonna

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
little bit but the reason why I'm gonna

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
little bit but the reason why I'm gonna
kill<00:01:33.390> armadale<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.619> not<00:01:34.740> really

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
kill armadale is because it's not really

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.609 
kill armadale is because it's not really
crowded<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.720> gonna<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.020> crowded

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
crowded I know it's not gonna be crowded

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.890 
crowded I know it's not gonna be crowded
at<00:01:37.799> all<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> kill<00:01:39.150> account<00:01:39.390> takes<00:01:39.630> so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
at all because the kill account takes so

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.170 
at all because the kill account takes so

should<00:03:02.889> do<00:03:02.980> something<00:03:03.189> about<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.639> and<00:03:03.939> they

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
should do something about it and they

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.360 
should do something about it and they
should<00:03:04.629> implement<00:03:05.019> some<00:03:05.470> kind<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.709> system<00:03:06.159> so

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
should implement some kind of system so

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.210 
should implement some kind of system so
we<00:03:06.639> can<00:03:06.849> clearly<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:08.139> if<00:03:08.230> somebody<00:03:08.560> got<00:03:09.159> a
