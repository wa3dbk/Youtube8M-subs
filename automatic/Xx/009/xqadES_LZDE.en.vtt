00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
obviously a skin for Lucian so we have a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.780 
obviously a skin for Lucian so we have a
skin<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.630> Yasuo<00:02:09.990> is<00:02:10.290> skin<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.100> Lucian<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
skin for Yasuo is skin for Lucian a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.030 
skin for Yasuo is skin for Lucian a
project<00:02:12.420> skin<00:02:12.660> through<00:02:12.900> Zed<00:02:13.140> let's<00:02:13.680> check<00:02:13.920> it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
project skin through Zed let's check it

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.860 
project skin through Zed let's check it
out<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.310> these<00:02:14.670> are<00:02:14.880> all<00:02:15.120> different<00:02:15.480> colors

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
out and these are all different colors

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.920 
out and these are all different colors
so<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.460> project<00:02:17.730> skins<00:02:18.360> you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
so I think that the project skins you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.870 
so I think that the project skins you
know<00:02:19.080> how<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.740> know<00:02:19.860> how<00:02:19.890> project<00:02:20.490> Yasuo<00:02:20.760> is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
know how you know how project Yasuo is

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.590 
know how you know how project Yasuo is
Orange

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
Orange

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.940 
Orange
I<00:02:21.630> think<00:02:22.080> these<00:02:22.200> are<00:02:22.260> all<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.770> have

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
I think these are all going to have

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.430 
I think these are all going to have
different<00:02:23.130> colors<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.960> Leona

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
different colors so this is for Leona

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.050 
different colors so this is for Leona

scarlet<00:02:51.240> now<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.660> think<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.800> fiora

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220

because<00:02:53.730> when<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.330> looked<00:02:54.540> at<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> trace<00:02:55.110> it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
because when we looked at the trace it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.410 
because when we looked at the trace it
said<00:02:55.650> about<00:02:55.770> blade<00:02:56.250> welding<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:56.970> using<00:02:57.300> her

said about blade welding and using her

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.390 
said about blade welding and using her
blade<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> think<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.830> confirmed

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
blade so I think this is a confirmed

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.510 
blade so I think this is a confirmed
skin<00:02:59.820> for<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.780> aura<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.260> because<00:03:01.739> pink<00:03:02.310> is

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
skin for the aura and because pink is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.000 
skin for the aura and because pink is

a lot of people think that this is his
zuo's<00:04:22.669> brother<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.689> was<00:04:23.810> supposed<00:04:24.259> to<00:04:24.349> be

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
zuo's brother that was supposed to be

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.179 
zuo's brother that was supposed to be
killed<00:04:24.770> but<00:04:25.280> if<00:04:25.370> we<00:04:25.490> look<00:04:25.669> at<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:25.879> chase<00:04:27.189> the

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:28.189 
killed but if we look at the chase the

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.700 
killed but if we look at the chase the
memory<00:04:28.550> traces<00:04:28.879> still<00:04:29.150> us<00:04:29.509> every<00:04:30.229> other<00:04:30.259> trace

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
memory traces still us every other trace

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.100 
memory traces still us every other trace
can<00:04:30.949> be<00:04:31.099> found<00:04:31.370> except<00:04:32.300> for<00:04:32.509> this<00:04:32.629> one<00:04:32.689> this<00:04:33.050> is

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
can be found except for this one this is

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.350 
can be found except for this one this is
the<00:04:33.409> trace<00:04:33.650> that's<00:04:33.860> lost<00:04:34.189> so<00:04:34.729> I<00:04:34.759> don't<00:04:35.120> think

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
the trace that's lost so I don't think

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.390 
the trace that's lost so I don't think
it's<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:35.629> skin<00:04:35.930> for<00:04:36.199> a<00:04:36.379> champion<00:04:37.009> we<00:04:37.129> already

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
it's the skin for a champion we already

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.209 
it's the skin for a champion we already
have<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.879> think<00:04:38.479> it's<00:04:38.629> a<00:04:38.780> new<00:04:39.020> champion<00:04:39.710> maybe

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:40.219 
have I think it's a new champion maybe

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.159 
have I think it's a new champion maybe
maybe<00:04:40.939> it's<00:04:41.180> used<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.509> us<00:04:41.629> brother

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
maybe it's used to us brother

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.290 
maybe it's used to us brother
maybe<00:04:42.439> it's<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.919> creator<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:44.060> project

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
maybe it's the creator of the project

maybe it's the creator of the project
