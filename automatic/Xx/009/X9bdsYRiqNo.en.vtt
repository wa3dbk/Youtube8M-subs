00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.559
 well this is the first tutorial of 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.469
 requintos with open and we will learn 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:14.620
 the white page requinto that I 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.689
 taught that I learned and good 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.750
 Well this is because they already know all this well with 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:25.610
 a guitar requinto but they do not have a 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.800
 example in my case and you put a hood in 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.669
 the fifth back then to represent 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.669
 how do you integrate fifth 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.060
 being the page 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.060
 the guitar is this 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.520
 and the enclosure after a round 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.520
 circle makes 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.839
 and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.380
 ok let's start then with the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:24.510
 requinto put the first finger in the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:27.930
 3rd fret and third finger 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.790
 on the fifth fret remember that 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.540
 we have the capon we started to count here 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.990
 it's my first techniques and we play 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.990
 second and first down 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.700
 and then with the index 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.049
 we are giving the fifth behind the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.049
 first rope like this 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.670
 it's ones and 11 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.790
 and 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.090
 then we run 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.960
 and we went to the first fret 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.960
 the same 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.780
 then 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.610
 this finger we had 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.030
 to the second string first fret and 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.030
 we make 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.640
 I repeat 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.270
 and there comes a small scale easy for 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.510
 finish the requinto and it's 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.370
 first 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.380
 third 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.370
 first 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.750
 and 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.180
 first third and first 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.609
 free 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.609
 according to second first 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.069
 and we repeat the same action only that 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:37.310
 this time we're going to make a bass in the 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:51.230
 third string and it should sound like that is what 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:53.980
 same but with this low first is 10 and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.980
 the rhythm 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.150
 and now 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.220
 I 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.980
 Well, I hope it works for them and then if 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.160
 have a comment or something is the same 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.390
 it would be good to see in that if they fail and 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.390
 Well that would be all for
