00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.759
 a bit more receptive to her 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.369

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.130
 ask yourself just how I of the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.769
 secret compartment in her closet knows how it is 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.440
 goes to the side and that reveals that 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.170

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.090
 Suit this year sitting on the hands 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.260

 Peter young to fall in love with me 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.530
 At least they should be tempted to do that 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.320
 they would not make an effort to fall 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.120
 I explained only the wish she 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.720
 safely escorted by hacking city 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.940

 blood to feet really lie then tear 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.580
 I shut the mask and see 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.950
 his expressionless dying eyes 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.490
 in that moment he will realize 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 that I have defeated him grandson and 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.180
 Find out who he is 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.310

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.830
 actually not equal 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.080
 Well, they are of the same kind 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.570
 Batman obsessed like me but im 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.050
 Contrary to me , theirs is true to them 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:48.390
 identity a puzzle 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:50.310
 if I'm right what I know you're lying 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.420
 strange never in life will you 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.340
 found out 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.620
 it has to be some kind of trick for sure 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.820
 where i still use tricks again 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.580
 childish riddles 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.709
 i have a psychological profile of 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.690
 mannes does not create it anymore 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.450
 most likely as batman would have imagined 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.960
 can and it with the most obvious 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.590
 Candidates compared 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.870
 Of course I was right and who is it 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.730
 but that's what I would do to them 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.340
 spoil whole fun 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.250
 they have to tell me I read ans 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.040
 trains so i recognized it when i got it 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.480
 It had to find out for them 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.270
 to be a child play but me 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.800
 Interestingly, they say they have something for me 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.120
 riddler and a still unprinted 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.960

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.960
