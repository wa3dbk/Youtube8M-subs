00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.590 
result for sequential data the reading
speed<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.380> around<00:03:47.560> 20<00:03:48.280> megabyte<00:03:48.850> per<00:03:49.090> second

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
speed is around 20 megabyte per second

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.979 
speed is around 20 megabyte per second
as<00:03:49.810> for<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.770> writing<00:03:51.190> speed<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.640> around<00:03:51.989> 8.6

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
as for the writing speed is around 8.6

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.310 
as for the writing speed is around 8.6
megabyte<00:03:53.530> per<00:03:53.709> second<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:55.239> that's<00:03:55.480> all<00:03:55.870> for<00:03:56.140> my

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
megabyte per second so that's all for my
