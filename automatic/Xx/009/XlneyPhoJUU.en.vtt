sealed package I actually went through

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.620 
sealed package I actually went through
the<00:00:31.250> liberty<00:00:31.519> of<00:00:31.550> opening<00:00:31.759> that<00:00:32.029> up<00:00:32.300> just<00:00:32.450> to

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
the liberty of opening that up just to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.930 
the liberty of opening that up just to
save<00:00:32.870> time<00:00:32.900> on<00:00:33.290> this<00:00:33.350> video<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.670> let's<00:00:34.700> go

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
save time on this video so let's go

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.510 
save time on this video so let's go
ahead<00:00:35.060> and<00:00:35.270> take<00:00:35.510> this<00:00:35.750> out<00:00:35.960> all<00:00:36.470> right<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.490> I

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
ahead and take this out all right so I

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.730 
ahead and take this out all right so I
absolutely<00:00:38.120> love<00:00:38.630> this<00:00:38.810> not<00:00:39.020> very<00:00:39.440> very

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
absolutely love this not very very

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.970 
absolutely love this not very very
simple<00:00:40.330> now<00:00:41.330> they<00:00:41.540> say<00:00:41.780> it's<00:00:41.960> durak<00:00:42.470> on<00:00:42.650> and

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
simple now they say it's durak on and

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.310 
simple now they say it's durak on and
I'm<00:00:43.490> guessing<00:00:43.970> that<00:00:44.000> sort<00:00:44.480> of<00:00:44.540> like<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.750> Delrin

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
I'm guessing that sort of like a Delrin

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.260 
I'm guessing that sort of like a Delrin
material<00:00:45.830> it<00:00:45.950> feels<00:00:46.250> like<00:00:46.460> Dowler<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.000> but

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
material it feels like Dowler and but

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.090 
material it feels like Dowler and but
almost<00:00:47.510> like<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.720> mix<00:00:47.990> between<00:00:48.080> aluminum<00:00:48.890> and

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
almost like a mix between aluminum and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.490 
almost like a mix between aluminum and
Delrin<00:00:49.490> because<00:00:49.700> it<00:00:49.820> is<00:00:49.940> hard<00:00:50.210> it's<00:00:50.810> a<00:00:51.020> cool<00:00:51.320> to

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
Delrin because it is hard it's a cool to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.030 
Delrin because it is hard it's a cool to
the<00:00:51.620> touch<00:00:52.120> but<00:00:53.120> just<00:00:53.480> an<00:00:53.630> excellent<00:00:54.290> looking

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
the touch but just an excellent looking

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.160 
the touch but just an excellent looking
shift<00:00:55.520> not<00:00:55.670> very<00:00:56.000> very<00:00:56.240> simple<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:56.780> I've<00:00:56.960> got

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
shift not very very simple and I've got

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.380 
shift not very very simple and I've got
relatively<00:00:57.710> small<00:00:58.010> hands<00:00:58.430> but<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.000> can<00:00:59.150> see

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
relatively small hands but you can see

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.850 
relatively small hands but you can see
how<00:00:59.630> that's<00:00:59.750> just<00:01:00.110> I<00:01:00.290> mean<00:01:00.530> I'd<00:01:00.620> call<00:01:00.830> that

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
how that's just I mean I'd call that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.710 
how that's just I mean I'd call that
like<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.100> knuckleball<00:01:01.640> right<00:01:01.880> it<00:01:02.240> just<00:01:02.300> feels

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
like a knuckleball right it just feels

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.160 
like a knuckleball right it just feels
right<00:01:03.440> in<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.890> hands<00:01:04.360> it's<00:01:05.360> weighted<00:01:05.750> fairly

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
right in the hands it's weighted fairly

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.810 
right in the hands it's weighted fairly
well<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.920> may<00:01:07.010> be<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.160> little<00:01:07.430> bit<00:01:07.610> lighter

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
well you may be a little bit lighter

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.370 
well you may be a little bit lighter
than<00:01:08.030> most<00:01:08.210> stock<00:01:08.510> shift<00:01:08.750> knobs<00:01:08.960> it's<00:01:09.200> still

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
than most stock shift knobs it's still

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.080 
than most stock shift knobs it's still
not<00:01:09.470> too<00:01:09.650> bad<00:01:09.830> hazard<00:01:10.160> at<00:01:10.460> least<00:01:10.640> some<00:01:10.880> weight

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
not too bad hazard at least some weight

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.940 
not too bad hazard at least some weight
to<00:01:11.300> it<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:11.630> know<00:01:12.200> some<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.530> these<00:01:12.620> aftermarket
