00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.620
 to abdicate to leave if and still two 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.410
 people can come with us it's 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.329
 a bit just for the others not finally 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 it's still a music band 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.360
 who want to play in another country and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.469
 the members of the group decide not 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.489
 to take the drummer guitarist is bad 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.680
 it has nothing to do 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.489
 have chosen two months of reason for 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.500
 that it has nothing to do 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.979
 well already we are not a group of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.900
 music and and there is no room for 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.580
 two texts in hockey already with 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.600

 but we only have four tickets 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.299

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.670

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.770

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.979
 it 's more or less, but we want 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.569
 avoid conflict so I do not come 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.849

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.390

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.170

 polite of you to say that but left 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.670

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:33.280
 of state to someone that's for sure 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.750

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.970
 time 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.350

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.609
 the excavations knew you and not thou 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.350
 sells so much for having already done the trick 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.940
 of the world that it's impossible to pass 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.900
 beside 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.200

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.459

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.940
 way I do not need you for 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.930
 to travel at the foot I do not come either 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.459

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.170
 else 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.340
 really worship yes it's a trip 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.120
 after all I will surely have the opportunity 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.019
 to make others 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.340

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.400

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.389

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.380

 michael davie astrid and I leave on 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.530
 could not take all the clau because 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.130
 we are a little too numerous 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.660
 Sadly 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.940
 obviously I will try everything 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.769
 filming there I gave myself my old 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.540
 camcorder it's more convenient and a 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.280
 Once back I will post a video type 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.730
 vlog in one or two parts in 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.470
 vacation 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.660

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.290
 during these two weeks but I post 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.239
 two videos I've already filmed and who 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.639

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.870
 little videos during a small 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.360
 period of absence

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.090
 weeks of youtube it's going to be pretty hard 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.380

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.880
