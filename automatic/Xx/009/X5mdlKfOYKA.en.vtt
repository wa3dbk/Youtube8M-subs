the center of the mango you'll feel
Sloan<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.630> there<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.440> age<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.010> life<00:02:24.190> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
Sloan is there just age the life a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.830 
Sloan is there just age the life a
little<00:02:24.519> bit<00:02:24.700> towards<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.269> outside<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
little bit towards the outside of the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.770 
little bit towards the outside of the
mango<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:27.370> still<00:02:27.580> can't<00:02:27.850> go<00:02:28.000> through<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.480> little

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
mango we still can't go through a little

mango we still can't go through a little
bit<00:02:28.810> more<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.799> eventually<00:02:29.950> you'll<00:02:30.610> go

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
bit more and eventually you'll go

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
through the flesh so again to start in

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.509 
through the flesh so again to start in
the<00:02:33.220> center<00:02:33.540> edge<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:34.989> way<00:02:35.019> out<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.680> little

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
the center edge your way out a little
