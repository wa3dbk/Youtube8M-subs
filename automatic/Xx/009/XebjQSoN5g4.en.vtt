00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I think that's criminal the planet is a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.539 
I think that's criminal the planet is a
very<00:01:03.780> overstretched<00:01:04.500> at<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.920> time<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.430> way

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
very overstretched at this time our way

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.940 
very overstretched at this time our way
of<00:01:05.670> doing<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.780> ourselves<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.740> a

of doing what we can ourselves in a
community<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:08.729> people<00:01:09.240> should<00:01:09.479> do

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
community and I think people should do

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
community and I think people should do
this<00:01:09.810> sort<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> thing<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.890> each<00:01:11.010> other<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
this sort of thing for each other and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.490 
this sort of thing for each other and
this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> equipment<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.869> used<00:01:12.960> it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
this is the equipment that's used it's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.410 
this is the equipment that's used it's
called<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.979> radar<00:01:14.400> gun<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.880> essentially<00:01:15.210> what

called a radar gun and essentially what

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.840 
called a radar gun and essentially what
you<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.350> point<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.740> towards<00:01:17.490> an

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you do is you point it towards an
