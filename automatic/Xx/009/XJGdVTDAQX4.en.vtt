00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.820
 7 thousand eight hundred milliamper hours here 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.700

 that is, again what your tested 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.090
 I have written a firm, I tested it as 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.399
 That is , I looked really charging 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.889
 there was a charge indicator written 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.469
 100% for example hawk battery 2 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:08.289
 500 battery in the phone here I put with 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.060
 scratch the phone recharged and as if full 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.890
 battery and phone from scratch that is 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.660

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.590

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.769
 overview 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.980
 I understand that the charge indicator and 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.069
 here's a button there are even two sticks in total 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.200
 in vain, half the less 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.319
 rather all the half I threw it while 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.629
 charging in order to charge to the end 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:50.599
