00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.130
 hi friends with you hook and today 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.799
 I continue my marathon by tag 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.980
 British heavy tanks and the next 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.140
 worth 7 churchill if you watched my 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.420
 review of the first one that came out 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.670
 yesterday it is not difficult to guess that i am 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.369
 maximum skeptical about this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.859
 tank honestly I got ready for 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.560
 suffering because the sixth level is not 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.739
 so just skip like 5 but all 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360
 same prospect deflate terrific 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.170
 very high British strands 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.750
 temptingly 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.180
 and therefore gritting my teeth I rolled out 7 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
 draw in his first fight before that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.670
 Naturally for the free experience I learned everything 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 modules 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.350
 put the equipment and charge more 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.199
 Golda you understand it all for this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.180
 so that not so much suffer well 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.270
 all the same with the branch of medium tanks 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 passed the top gun after the first 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.920
 a dozen fights I felt the very 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.589
 nostalgia for the family of churchill and from 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.840
 the computer version of the tanks is exactly that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.390
 the feeling itself was very lacking 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.580
 on the first church and from the management of which 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.530
 I got absolutely nothing 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.560
 pleasure but here's the seventh 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.409
 modification of this tank is undoubtedly very 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 fit in blitz conditions cheered up 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.869
 but 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.909
 and breathed a new batch of enthusiasm 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.759
 continue to pump this thread 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.659
 but let's still objectively evaluate what 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.790
 is this a tank 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.650
 so I hope you have poured yourself 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.350
 hot tea and wish you have a nice 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.960
 viewing and as always I will be glad to hear 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.530
 your opinion about this tank in the comments 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.540
 so feel free to share it 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.670
 The most important difference 7 Churchill from 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.710
 first in my opinion is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.960
 that the British designers are finally 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.329
 developed a tower with a decent frontal 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.820
 booking 152 millimeters 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.570
 may they still failed decent 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.909
 tilt angles 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.930
 but the very fact of not shooting and already 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.390
 not so profitable 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.850
 very much adds the survivability of the Church 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.159
 and the enemy is trying to shoot him in 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 corps where you can already set it 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.369
 rhombus thereby increasing the angle 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.920
 reduced armor 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.580
 Outstanding front rollers cover 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.980
 a vulnerable lower 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.530
 my item hit the chassis 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.870
 if under it there is no main tank armor 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.970
 takes away strength points you only 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.610
 make it damaged or knocked down 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.710
 a caterpillar that quickly mend if 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.260
 you have downloaded the skill of the crew to repair 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.660
 modules therefore finding yourself a list xy 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.060
 it becomes really interesting to tank 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.670
 because concentration is required 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.920
 on the position of the hull and the tower and and by the way 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.930
 after the shot, they advise a little too 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.420
 turn away from the enemy degrees on 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.100
 ten to increase the angle of entry 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.840
 shells that add a couple more 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.880
 millimeters and given that 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.230
 armor penetration among Soviet classmates 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.230
 is 167 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.010
 and 175 millimeters, respectively, at t-150 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.410
 and apt-1s 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.170
 it is clearly not an extra couple of millimeters of armor 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.690
 which have a thickness of 152 may well 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.610
 useful given a 25 percent 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.040
 the spread of the great Belarusian random 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.920
 when calculating armor penetration on the first 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.560
 Churchill and 5 leveled not attacks tanking 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.780
 and speech can not be flimsy his tower 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.150
 We are about all opponents since 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.730
 the fourth level declination tool 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.220
 in the top tower is all the same 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.920
 four degrees down but for the time of pumping 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.200
 1 drawing you can already get used to the fact that 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.000
 all cats need to go around even 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.739
 found some interesting positions on 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.180
 multiple cards as soon as them 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.680
 typed into separate videos then 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.650
 be sure to share with you and 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.600
 this information as for the instrument 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.790
 then it does not seem to differ from 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.650
 predecessor because if fast 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.989
 look at tth top down 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.300
 the only difference is that 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.370
 increases armor penetration on some three 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.280
 millimeter base armor piercing projectile 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.470
 and by 6 millimeters subcaliber also 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.950
 gun gets greater rate of fire 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.720
 at 0.38 shells per minute compared to 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.820
 the instrument that stood on the ground 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.769
 Churchill but do not forget that 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.860
 rate of fire depends not only on 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.739
 gun itself but also from the tower in more 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.060
 perfect and spacious tower 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.370
 it is easier for the loader to serve shells 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.080
 mechanism and therefore the real increase in 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.930
 rate of fire compared to the fifth 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.030
 level is already two point and 14 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.340
 a hundred shells a minute that displays 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.229
 top gun 7 Churchill top in 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.030
 potential damage per minute 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.440
 among classmates 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.870
 but realize it on armor piercing 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.590
 projectiles sure can only be at the top 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.360
 list 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.669
 by eighth levels you need 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.760
 use sabot shells 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.250
 sometimes even by the way they are missing if to 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.530
 enemy's example to you hid the bottom 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.900
 frontal part and turned the body a little 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.790
 and therefore knowledge of the positions of which 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.370
 a scenic view of the board 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.410
 opponents will significantly increase your 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.930
 the pleasure of driving this tank 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.669
 about the rest of the gun 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.760
 I will not because they stayed 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.800
 completely the same as a whole tool can not 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.800
 call very comfortable as an example 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.390
 woman halka t-150 or conic gun 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.669
 3601 Henschel 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.919
 but the feeling of helplessness even before 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.070
 armored tanks do not occur 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.860
 As for the dynamics, then 7 Churchill 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.229
 like a typical englishman meticulous and 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.350
 moves slowly around the map 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.200
 Yes, and why should he hurry if according to the standard 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.810
 there was a kettle in every tank 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.860
 so the crew obviously found something to do 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.200
 during marches 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.210
 seriously promise to english tank not 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.550
 was tested for suitability battle 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.640
 You can do and so my zaguglit 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.010
 jokes about drinking tea a little ulterior motive 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.169
 turning increases by 3 degrees 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.990
 a second but still the devil remains 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.720
 extremely clunky tank horses per tonne 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.490
 he has eight and a half but considering 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.080
 that maximum speed fell to 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.510
 twenty kilometers per hour 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.090
 it accelerates to her tank very quickly 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.520
 of course with boxes on the hill 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.320
 he is clearly so much difficulty 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.050
 max speed can be developed only on 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.720
 a flat surface or what gorochki 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.419
 in general, you can say about 7 Churchill 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.419
 to an experienced tankman he will deliver a mass 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.880
 pleasure not from the fact that the bendable from 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.789
 the fact that it is really interesting to play 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.970
 because it is laid out should be in full 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.370
 while all the church is very calm and 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.979
 pacified so if tired 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.289
 fingers from maneuvering combat on st then 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.750
 I advise you to roll out the battle and a little bit 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.090
 rest for a cup okay I will not 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.970
 I feel more about tea 7 times 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.020
 already a bit fed up with so 7 Churchill 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.629
 this is the right churchill 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.690
 not that the first in terms of blitz what 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:43.009
 As for tactics, it is almost as usual here 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.470
 all British tyazh 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.539
 these are tanks of one direction in the seventh 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.800
 more often you can feel comfortable 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.289
 yourself on the first line 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.509
 when younger brother will shyly 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:56.509
 stand behind and always at the bottom of the list 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:59.120
 all tanks, including ours, suffer 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.979
 try to discuss today 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.379
 choose the shortest route 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.509
 him moving there immediately in 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.050
 general hold on from your heavy tanks 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.990
 teams 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.210
 I do not advise the hero to be heroic 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.509
 in cover and therefore a platoon he 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.770
 shows much better results 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:17.630
 I hope you will not forget to like 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.819
 if you like my review 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.940
 and share it with your friends 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:24.770
 well and you had a Fox subscribe to 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.159
