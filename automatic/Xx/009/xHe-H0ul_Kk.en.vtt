with<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.740> built-in<00:00:28.039> alarm<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:28.970> you<00:00:29.300> set<00:00:29.690> the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
with the built-in alarm so you set the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.380 
with the built-in alarm so you set the
maximum<00:00:30.740> temperature<00:00:31.160> that's<00:00:31.699> typically<00:00:32.150> run
