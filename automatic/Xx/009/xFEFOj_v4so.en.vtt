with a couple of punches but that nice
outlet<00:01:18.480> cap<00:01:18.690> would<00:01:19.050> help<00:01:19.260> him<00:01:19.440> little<00:01:19.860> left<00:01:20.310> as

they<00:01:20.670> split<00:01:21.470> talks<00:01:22.470> down<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:22.980> a<00:01:23.010> lot

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
they split talks down to that one a lot

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.820 
they split talks down to that one a lot
easier<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> slow<00:01:25.080> sort<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.530> looping

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
easier it was a slow sort of looping

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
easier it was a slow sort of looping
left<00:01:26.010> hand<00:01:26.250> though<00:01:26.810> yeah<00:01:27.810> well<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> use

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
left hand though yeah well the use

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.649 
left hand though yeah well the use
movement<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.460> opposed<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.390> their

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
movement there as opposed to just their

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.620 
movement there as opposed to just their
reflexes<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> he<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.580> himself<00:01:32.730> out<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.210> trouble

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
reflexes so he got himself out a trouble

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.260 
reflexes so he got himself out a trouble
and<00:01:33.780> he<00:01:33.870> heard<00:01:34.050> their<00:01:34.340> fence<00:01:35.340> swinging<00:01:35.790> wildly

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and he heard their fence swinging wildly

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.500 
and he heard their fence swinging wildly
which<00:01:37.010> it's<00:01:38.010> always<00:01:38.400> good<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.640> us

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
which it's always good to us

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.860 
which it's always good to us
that's<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:40.140> better<00:01:40.470> from<00:01:40.860> him<00:01:41.690> but<00:01:42.690> he's<00:01:42.840> not

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
that's much better from him but he's not

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.510 
that's much better from him but he's not
all<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.740> B's<00:01:43.920> defense

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
all of the B's defense

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.660 
all of the B's defense
I<00:01:44.990> think<00:01:45.990> he's<00:01:46.170> relying<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.800> reflexes<00:01:47.520> are

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
I think he's relying and reflexes are

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.030 
I think he's relying and reflexes are
not<00:01:47.909> quite<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.540> used<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> be
