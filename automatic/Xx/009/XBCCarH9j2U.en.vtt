00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello with you flex ah and in this video I 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.540
 I will tell about the new heading under 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.430
 name correct laziness by the way not yet 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.119
 came out the first video you can offer 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.100
 own option 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 write options like maybe 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 I will really like your offer 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.849
 more the main condition is that she 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.640
 fit the specifics 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.070
 and also not offended and was censored 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.649
 what does she represent her essence 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.390
 is to show that here 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.270
 a person with an average or not even 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.160
 statistics can drag the fight and in fact 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.140
 statistics figures do not always give 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.649
 correct ability information 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.050
 player 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.370
 and this is only the average value for 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.289
 a certain number of battles 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 1 and statistics as we all know 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.270
 constantly merge younger brother or dad 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 but perhaps in this particular battle the player 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.379
 can show what he is capable of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.379
 Yes, he suddenly wanted to play for the sake of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.809
 victory they are fun new idea is clear 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.320
 so you can proceed to the conditions 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.119
 selection 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 I will make videos with 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.049
 comments of battles with which you are not 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 will send 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.840
 to comply with the idea of ​​a heading restriction 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.020
 will be the following first point and general 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.880
 the winning percentage must be 49 and below 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.610
 the number of battles from 1 thousand and above 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.920
 number of frags in battle 7 and higher still battle 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.320
 should be interesting to me and show 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.810
 actions that led to victory and not 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.250
 that option when a person just waited 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.720
 to get frags 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.140
 more dynamic and interesting 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.829
 actions will occur and even more 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.810
 the number of frags you killed will be by 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.320
 the outcome of the battle the higher the likelihood that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.149
 exactly your replay will be on the screen 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.520
 I will also take into account the lower 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.130
 performance statistics and less 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.020
 adapted for the so-called Naguib 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.969
 tanks allowed fighting platoon if all 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.310
 the participants 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.130
 fits the conditions of statistics 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.370
 that is, they will also have a winning percentage 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.280
 49 and lies and so on the platoon must 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.190
 kill 12 more enemies and thereby bringing 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.959
 in a decisive contribution to the game, I think that you 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.569
 not so interesting to watch 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.130
 sandy feet would and so I decided 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.890
 to make 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.459
 level limit at least level 4 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.160
 and above that is all tanks that are below 1 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.910
 2 3 level there and the number of players 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.310
 who can play much lower and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.400
 accordingly easier to make a lot of frags 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.780
 and not so interesting to watch 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.680
 this video 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.120
 Well, was that the conditions are clear to you and if 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.310
 there will be adequate questions I am happy 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.489
 I will answer in the comments to the video 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.459
 and now I'll talk about where to get and 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.709
 how to send your battle record for 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.640
 start we go into the game section 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.430
 settings and 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.010
 the first bookmark we check the game started 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.010
 check mark opposite but sharp lines 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.019
 record battles for replay 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.620
 be sure to include this way 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.880
 all battles you played will be 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.390
 automatically saved to the world folder 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.600
 of tanks 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.239
 replace and in case you succeeded 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.579
 fulfill all the above conditions 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.180
 your statistics also fit 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.530
 requirements 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.630

 wargaming companies are therefore not 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.359
 worry about passwords i would 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:02.430

 more difficult that will secure your account

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.080

 here you can specify the sorting by 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:42.539
 map and game versions and and so on now 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.849
 when you upload your replay you need 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.550
 copy this reference 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.180

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.659
 go to your mail then we write 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.490

00:04:53.659 --> 00:05:00.449
 u2f replace 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.719
 Dzhimile dog in the subject of the letter you need 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.740
 will indicate the name of the rubric and 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:10.650
 number of frags well, for example, 8 further 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.400
 indicate your gaming nickname 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.620
 or you can put your name in brackets 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.500
 interrupt and also it would be nice if 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.460
 you made a brief description of what 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.589
 occurs in battle for about 5 minutes 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.020
 the fun begins to not 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:30.599
 It took a huge amount of time to 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.789
 view all replays to 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.759
 then you shoot more interesting 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.009
 videos I think you understand and third 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.699
 point you need to copy this link 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:45.360
 which you took a similar replace push 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:48.509
 control n and it turns out the rate as well 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:54.270
 you must specify the name of the tank on which 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:57.240
 You played for example from 7 and I hope you 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.080
 liked the idea of ​​my new heading and you 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.060

 fights 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.469
 which other players will be something 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.000
