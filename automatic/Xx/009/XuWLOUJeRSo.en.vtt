00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:14.889
 Let's actually plant it This time we will plant using the beast and planter 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:20.210
 There are 4 blocks of 12 liters for 4 minutes and 6 minutes in this. 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:28.060
 There are not enough to grow tomatoes, so more 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:28.060
 Grow tomato with 1 block min. Of soil about 24 l 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.230
 Hmm 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:41.530
 I steel I pretty full tomato 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:44.130
 If it does not have a certain amount of soil it just grows bigger and bigger than it is a tomato 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.620
 Can not harvest a lot 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:53.199
 Because 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.199
 Please put in the soil so firmly that there is a little amount of house 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.449
 It was just one full minute 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 here 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.810
 I will plant a tomato 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.740
 Tomato seedlings are 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.880
 And as much as possible clogged wealth Shima color me black 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.509
 There is no good tomatoes that are packed with length of here 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.890
 And when I pull it out, I have no choice 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:32.510
 In this way, push around and make it easy to catch your eyes 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:40.700
 In this way we will deliver tomato seedlings 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:48.460
 And I plant, but the real is it have a point at the time of planting also tomato 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.460
 Here is a small bud If you look at the Tomato 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:59.900
 Do you understand this is a small trap 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.740
 You should plant this moth so that it is facing you. Why is that? 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.170
 Speaking of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:13.000
 Tomatoes, while extending in the direction with a bud 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:20.560
 I will grow and grow while growing so it will be fruity if the harvest is right for me 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.900
 So, we plant the tomato which has a bud to oneself towards you 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.190
 Because it is no good for deep planting 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.140
 Almost the height of the house in front 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:38.590
 Please plant at the same height and hold firmly 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.590
 And since it falls down in this state, it stands upright and moves firmly 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.860
 And 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.860
 Let's keep firmly 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:03:00.480
 If you tie the tomato tightly, the stem of the tomato will be damaged, so when you tie it to some extent 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:08.700
 I put tomato in the ground so that there is a gap 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.620
 After this, keep water well until it comes out and manage in a place where children hit 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.930
 Please give me 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.930
 This continuation is another fun tree
