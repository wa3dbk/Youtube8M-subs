00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.180
 hello and welcome to gillett 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.080
 point fr shopping.com and tuning help 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.689
 we will introduce you to this 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.689
 video the module this reversible robot so 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.980
 it's a plug and play system we 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.860
 so let's introduce you with 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.480
 several models in pool in 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.200
 the occurrence of lenticular ampoules 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.690
 with ugly and smd girl system with or 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.960
 without integer rural and color and bone 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.770
 choice in white or blue for the model 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.640
 here in 25 watts of power and 5 watts 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.640
 for other models 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.280
 so this one the model in 5 watts so 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.079
 there lenticular front hen 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.510
 we will introduce you first 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.930
 ignition in version 25 watts of 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.360
 power so on this strobo module 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.630
 reversible so that is to say in the image 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.170
 fixed then you turn off your friends but 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.930
 they pass underneath too beautiful 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.500
 you turn off you turn on again his 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.229
 goes into fixed mode and so on 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.140
 so a connectivity w5 w to illustrate 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.310
 if this use 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.409
 but they can be 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.500
 delivered in v 9 aces wcw the ax 9s 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.789
 correspond to ages 6w etc 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.869
 so you can see in our 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:43.750
 description different different 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:47.819
 possible input base so here we 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.819
 realizes again in this mode 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.120
 some do it 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.950
 in 12 volts others in 24 volts so 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.479
 can be used on truck the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 small module suits him for both 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.409
 applications 12 and 24 7 depending on 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.120
 the leder that can be used 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.000
 soft or 24 volt system 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.000
 so here you can see consul 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.430
 extinction on the coast 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.510
 so for motorcycles also so you 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.240
 will see in the description of 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.970
 the article on our shop senji 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.130
 help points like that there is also 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.460
 the version with a little coup tonight for 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.140
 the motorcycles so the motors the motorcycles 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.650
 equipped with an ignition system 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.150
 automatic fire you will have a 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.650
 little push button that will allow us 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.410
 to move from one mode to the water all 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.450
 so just ignition directly 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.540
 from the motorcycle the engine sets and then 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.030
 you turn on pro bowl at each 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.920
 pressure on the little bit choice then 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.920
 here it's the whole rome version 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.180
 power that they are powerful enough 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.290
 but I projected that previous models 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.290
 with screaming help 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.500
 the previous model is suitable 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.959
 especially for vehicles with 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.579
 detection of roasted bulbs 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:28.180
 we would have no error message to 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:31.260
 the on-board computer is only one and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.260
 his patience too beautiful 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.120
 we extinguish we have the limbs fix and 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.980
 and so on 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.090
 so the system is very simple easy to 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.000
 universal place that come like that 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.780
 requires no modification of your 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.030
 original vessel 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.610
 and so you have powerful bulbs 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.450
 at the top you can see on the images 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.160
 up between other bulbs of 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.950
 vigilant what they are and proposed in 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.590
 integrated modules alan poul ie 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.980
 that there is no wiring these are 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.690
 nightlights crowds automatically 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.690
 reversible is too beautiful fixed 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.480
 so as you can see here 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.169
 also on the transformer we 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.850
 have therefore nor its bulbs 24 volt 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.009
 out 24 flights because it's the model 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.229
 which is recommended for trucks 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.169
 also so it can be used to him 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.380
 in soft and 24 flights without any 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.380
 change 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:40.660
 to finish 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:43.630
 we specified wcw 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.260
 the 5 watts of lenticular power 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.590
 so they have a projection only 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.590
 front 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.650
 very powerful also 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.970
 senna are available 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.800
 and in blue on how we can 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:06.320
 also realize by connecting red back 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:10.510
 so extraction ignition lauterbourg 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.510
 shutdown still images m 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.040
 there is enough wiring 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.690
 and left and right the night lights 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.160
 so you take one side only to 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.440
 ignition 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.220
 is to distribute on all 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.220
 two optics 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.190
