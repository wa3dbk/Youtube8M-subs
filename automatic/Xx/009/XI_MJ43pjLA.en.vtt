 not yet the judge to the competent authority. 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.000
 judiciary has not yet manifested 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:32.940

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.300
 hours and the pickup guide is issued 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.730
 then it is not necessarily necessary that 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.330
 immediately with the prisoner is 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.430
 I accept a 24-hour deadline in those 24 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.580
 hours if the judge did not sped 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.330

 science of its terms to the condemned 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:13.230
 then convicted signs the guides and 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.750
 authority initiative the director of 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.000
 prison unit or that agent 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.460

 you are in that situation 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.610
 paragraph according to the 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.139

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.540
 according to the chronological order of the 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.060

 the calculation of emissions and other 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:49.770
 Subsequent rectifications that we with knots 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.870
 we can often understand the prisoner 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.960
 that citizen is imprisoned 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.220
 he committed various crimes and spoke 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.070
 it was worth it 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:02.460
 suddenly another conviction comes . 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.130
 a theft and you're stuck there cohabiting here 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.350
 but time comes another condemnation 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.190
 by traffic another conviction by maria 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.150
 of the rock 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.850
 then these guides will be shaken 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.030
 in the special book in chronological order 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:22.350
 short with the order of arrival and will 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:26.310
 be attached to the condemned oil and 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:28.710
 course of evolution is if and 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.650
 condemned to see working then 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.020
 there may be remission or there may be a 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.310
 generation worth the pain of others 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.380
 situations then all these 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:42.740
 claims of these changes will be 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.740
 edited in the year book itself
