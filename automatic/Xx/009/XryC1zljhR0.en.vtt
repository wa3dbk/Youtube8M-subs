00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.240
 we are forgetting the team giving him 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.980
 follow up to all players 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.300
 eligible Mexicans who are 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.400
 participating and attacking in 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.369
 our league as abroad we go 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.050
 to bring these two parties to the best 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.610
 let's see what the last two are 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.740
 games we have to prepare 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.050
 prior to matches to tournaments that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.370
 let's play then on this date 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.890
 above we will bring those who are 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.750
 physically well and healthy to the best 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.730
 these three parties that come that are 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.320
 two of fifa date and one that our 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.719
 challenge to the best against us it 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.560
 they think Antonio will give us the possibility 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.570
 of in these three games define or treat 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.880
 to define the almost one hundred percent 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.130
 by 90 percent each of the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.570
 lists that we have obviously thought 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.670
 we will have to first give the list of 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.320
 america cup that will be the first days 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.079
 May because the concentration begins 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.020
 May 17 add concentrated 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.760
 for the cup of America then we will have to 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.820
 give this list before the first 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.010
 days are the first days of May 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.470
 start giving the list of 23 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.320
 selected how are they going to be arriving 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.150
 how are those teams going in Mexico 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.120
 and how they also finish their 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.440
 participation in europe go in europe 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.270
 or where the player today is that 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.970
 select we will be incorporating the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.619
 selection of the team after 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.259
 the three parties that we have now with 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.350
 two of the fifa date and the one of usa we're going 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.290
 to have three matches 2 almost tied 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.320
 a third who is looking for three of the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.600
 copa america one currently in mexico and 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.700
 and two others that could be but and 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.860
 brazil as he said vector that they are 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.410
 trying to close that would be very good 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.840
 to later arrive in chile and start the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.090
 tournament and with the gold cup will be searched 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.970
 more or less the same play a game in 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.880
 Mexico and try to look for one or two more 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.590
 here in the USA the difficulty that puts us 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.510
 states is that you can not be in the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.120
 venues where they are going to do 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.860
 of gold cup then you have to be 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.780
 looking if it can be done and in that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.150
 moment there are many alive who are 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.460
 unemployed have no season are in 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.390
 rests things you hardly grab 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.100
 rivals 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.380
 LML probably get rivals 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.300
 that is that the team may have some 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.460
 previous matches get to that tournament of 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.730
 the golden cup and start the tournament and 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.980
 asia cup impossible after America 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.540
 next standard we want a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.910
 end we always win we will be in 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.130
 our head and if obligation to call 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.930
 gold cup because if we want to play that 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.980
 final match with the us to look for the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.840
 idea 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.190
 the confederation we have the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.190
 obligation to win the gold cup
