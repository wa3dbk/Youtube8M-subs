tire changer they came in pretty similar
times<00:00:59.320> though<00:00:59.590> so<00:00:59.980> we<00:01:00.070> might<00:01:00.250> be<00:01:00.340> able<00:01:00.400> to

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
times though so we might be able to

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.460 
times though so we might be able to
judge<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.000> by<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.150> naked<00:01:01.450> eye<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.290> looks

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
judge it by the naked eye and it looks

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.470 
judge it by the naked eye and it looks
like<00:01:02.590> a<00:01:02.710> deca<00:01:03.130> mucho<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.490> Newman<00:01:03.880> hast<00:01:04.090> he's
