human way and and what we're seeing now

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.570 
human way and and what we're seeing now
is<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.420> result<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:02.929> using<00:01:03.320> guns<00:01:03.769> instead<00:01:04.370> of

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
is the result of using guns instead of

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.420 
is the result of using guns instead of
diplomacy<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.630> suspect<00:01:06.290> since<00:01:07.040> we've<00:01:07.250> seen

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
diplomacy and I suspect since we've seen

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.890 
diplomacy and I suspect since we've seen
such<00:01:07.670> an<00:01:07.790> increase<00:01:08.120> in<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.360> past<00:01:08.540> couple<00:01:08.780> of

up and down the border all over the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.240 
up and down the border all over the
place<00:01:41.180> we<00:01:41.300> have<00:01:41.420> thousands<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.140> armed<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:43.220> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
place we have thousands of armed to the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.310 
place we have thousands of armed to the
teeth<00:01:43.660> guards<00:01:44.660> that<00:01:44.810> are<00:01:44.870> aiming<00:01:45.080> their

teeth guards that are aiming their
weapons<00:01:45.620> at<00:01:45.800> Mexico<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.730> feels<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.090> war

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
weapons at Mexico so it feels like a war

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.370 
weapons at Mexico so it feels like a war
zone<00:01:47.360> down<00:01:47.690> there<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:47.990> think<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.290> going

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
zone down there and I think it's going

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.080 
zone down there and I think it's going
to<00:01:48.440> get<00:01:48.620> a<00:01:48.650> little<00:01:48.920> bit<00:01:49.130> worse
