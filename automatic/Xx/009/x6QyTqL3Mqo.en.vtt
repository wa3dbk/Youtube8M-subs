most is what people's musts are not
saying<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.119> required<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> human<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
saying that it's required for a human to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.499 
saying that it's required for a human to
go<00:01:26.130> through<00:01:26.369> these<00:01:26.490> paces<00:01:26.939> before<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.330> step

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
go through these paces before they step

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.880 
go through these paces before they step
out<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> door<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.500> their<00:01:28.680> opinion

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
out the door but what in their opinion

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
out the door but what in their opinion
are<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.640> must<00:01:29.970> steps<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.259> often

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
are your must steps because more often

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.140 
are your must steps because more often
than<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.920> completely<00:01:32.430> disagree<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:33.000> them

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
than not I completely disagree with them

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.960 
than not I completely disagree with them
and<00:01:33.360> that's<00:01:33.840> fine<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.259> healthy<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.970> even

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and that's fine and healthy and even

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
and that's fine and healthy and even
more<00:01:36.240> interesting<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:37.500> are

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
more interesting I think that there are

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.230 
more interesting I think that there are
some<00:01:37.710> stages<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.310> where<00:01:38.549> Alexa<00:01:39.090> goes

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
some stages here where Alexa goes

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.420 
some stages here where Alexa goes
through<00:01:39.479> her<00:01:39.630> mas<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.380> various<00:01:40.829> cases<00:01:41.040> or

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
through her mas in various cases or

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
through her mas in various cases or
whether<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.759> makeup<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.509> clothes<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.110> on

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
whether that's makeup or clothes or on

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.020 
whether that's makeup or clothes or on
the<00:01:43.380> floor<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.860> whether<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.399> wear<00:01:44.579> them<00:01:44.759> i
