 which proposes are from the south 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.630
 that lasts from the south is a local company 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.769
 that operate different activities with advanced technology 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:12.760
 knowing 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.240
 Excellent quality in its products and the best customer service 1 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.430
 lamentable concrete this plant pierre limits manufactured in united states brand 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.530
 rex ready-mix concrete 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.630
 activity that complements the construction service area 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.620
 we do not think and design concrete with a resistance required by the client 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.890
 and also special concrete 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.670
 as well as its transfer in mixer trucks the quality of that product 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.050
 finished is guaranteed by the good quality of our materials the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.399
 adequate dosage and constant improvement of our processes and 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.410
 personal 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.950
 In our environment it has become very popular that the use of concrete 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.480
 ready-mixed as it provides many advantages over manually produced concrete 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.600
 this concrete is sold guaranteed the mixture is homogeneous can be 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.410
 transport practically at any distance that our plant 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.210
 well with the current technology of the additives 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.390
 the concrete is manipulated to achieve greater resistances furibestia retardo 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.830
 in the setting among other qualities no less important 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.080
 In addition to the mixer trucks for transporting the concrete we have 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.430
 equipment for pumping and placing manual dosing devices with band 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.290
 Conveyor to prepare the concrete at the placement site 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.500
 the aggregates are deposited in the hoppers that for this purpose the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.609
 dosing 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.409
 prior to this a laboratory analysis is made of the aggregates the water 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.539
 we admit that they were invented they are dosed according to the potito resistance of 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.289
 concrete required by the client the respective mix design is programmed 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.700
 Inda dosing according to the weight of each material which by means of a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.539
 automatic process makes the concrete and deposits it in the trucks 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.540
 mixers 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.930
 a sampling of fresh concrete 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.930
 reception in concrete of hydraulic cement 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.569
 practice to be and cure concrete specimens for field testing 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.460
 global compressive strength sealed 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.400
 the benefits indicated are concrete 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.870
 Our concrete is made in compliance with AP ST standards and a 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.230
 Strict quality control
