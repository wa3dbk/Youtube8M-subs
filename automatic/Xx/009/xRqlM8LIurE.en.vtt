the center the only way to stop them is

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.300 
the center the only way to stop them is
for<00:01:31.700> someone<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:32.060> go<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.450> after<00:01:32.810> them<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:34.130> can

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
for someone to go in after them you can

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.160 
for someone to go in after them you can
use<00:01:34.459> my<00:01:34.640> porygon<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.240> enter<00:01:35.450> my<00:01:35.569> the<00:01:35.810> digital

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
use my porygon to enter my the digital

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.070 
use my porygon to enter my the digital
world<00:01:36.319> ready<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.580> off<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.030> go<00:01:38.300> what<00:01:38.959> the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.960

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
porygon zero which was which enabled

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.330 
porygon zero which was which enabled
them<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:30.000> actually<00:04:30.180> get<00:04:30.570> into<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:31.340> digital

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
them to actually get into the digital

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.680 
them to actually get into the digital
system<00:04:32.729> it's<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:32.910> port<00:04:33.150> again<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.510> level<00:04:33.750> 40<00:04:35.690> and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
system it's a port again in level 40 and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.200

they can't lose accuracy I got a
critical<00:04:53.460> hit<00:04:53.729> on<00:04:53.850> Pidgeotto<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.570> froze<00:04:54.900> it

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
critical hit on Pidgeotto and froze it

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.750 
critical hit on Pidgeotto and froze it
so<00:04:55.970> that's<00:04:56.970> cool<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.539> guess<00:04:58.260> not<00:04:58.740> really<00:04:58.770> I'll

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
so that's cool I guess not really I'll

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.969 
so that's cool I guess not really I'll
just<00:04:59.910> send<00:05:00.090> up<00:05:00.180> Pikachu<00:05:00.630> here<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:04.830> have<00:05:04.919> a

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
just send up Pikachu here you have a

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.379 
just send up Pikachu here you have a
poor<00:05:05.160> game<00:05:05.310> is<00:05:05.430> pretty<00:05:05.550> chill<00:05:05.820> I'd<00:05:06.000> actually

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
poor game is pretty chill I'd actually

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.370 
poor game is pretty chill I'd actually
love<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.720> use<00:05:07.139> app<00:05:07.289> Oregon<00:05:08.210> in<00:05:09.210> like<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.080> let's

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
love to use app Oregon in like a let's

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.370 
love to use app Oregon in like a let's
play<00:05:11.479> but<00:05:12.479> really<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.810> think<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.080> only<00:05:13.260> time

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
play but really I think the only time

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.070 
play but really I think the only time
you<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.770> really<00:05:13.950> get<00:05:14.130> a<00:05:14.190> porygon<00:05:14.550> is<00:05:14.970> from<00:05:15.510> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
you can really get a porygon is from the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.870 
you can really get a porygon is from the
gaming<00:05:18.139> you<00:05:19.139> know<00:05:19.260> like<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.620> gaming<00:05:19.889> place<00:05:20.490> in

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
gaming you know like the gaming place in

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.360 
gaming you know like the gaming place in
celadon<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.169> think<00:05:22.740> that's<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:22.979> only<00:05:23.010> place

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
celadon I think that's the only place

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.220 
celadon I think that's the only place
you<00:05:23.550> can<00:05:23.669> get<00:05:23.760> them

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.030 

but<00:05:28.230> I've<00:05:28.320> never<00:05:28.440> gotten<00:05:28.680> one<00:05:28.830> because

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
but I've never gotten one because

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.580 
but I've never gotten one because
they're<00:05:29.130> too<00:05:29.280> damn<00:05:29.400> expensive

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
they're too damn expensive

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.340 
they're too damn expensive
but<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.620> think<00:05:31.860> that'd<00:05:31.980> be<00:05:32.070> cool<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.310> use<00:05:32.460> or<00:05:33.450> or

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
but I think that'd be cool to use or or

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.930 
but I think that'd be cool to use or or
even<00:05:34.680> maybe<00:05:34.830> do<00:05:35.010> like<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.220> solo<00:05:35.550> run<00:05:35.790> or

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
even maybe do like a solo run or

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.700 
even maybe do like a solo run or
something<00:05:36.120> who<00:05:36.450> knows<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:37.350> feels<00:05:37.650> bad<00:05:39.710> don't

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
something who knows this feels bad don't

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.040 
something who knows this feels bad don't
