00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.019
 It was a wonderful experience it was at the beginning of the year 2002 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.519
 I escaped summoned for the first time. 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.379
 He did not play here in Goiânia, Brazil, Bolivia. I'm not alone. 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.589
 she feels like she has no way to convey in words why she is 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.550
 very strong first time I heard the national anthem for the selection 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.979
 however, singing stage and I there 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:35.120
 standing at the time noting national anthem is also a very great emotion is 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 a great blessing lawn of god 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.740
 In my life Jesus makes all the difference. 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.240
 eduardo good news of the gospel of jesus christ is that jesus died on the cross of 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.270
 Calvary 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.130
 for our sins so that we could 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.880
 today a lot of people trying 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.330
 and jesus died 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.810
 exactly to get rid of us 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.060
 of sin 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.430
 so that's for sure I'm sure 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.540
 what we have to have every day our life because we have a father of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.090
 love that we are here on this earth with a purpose of God 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.140
 and jesus passed through this world is of how man a god in the form of man to 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.800
 show to people who think yes how he got us can also get 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.719
 through that of that power that acted in us today of the holy spirit of God 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.890
 the people 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.260
 I have to be against 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.020
 all works 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.820
 the older one is right then 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.280
 it's the truth of 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.520
 of the gospel these are the good news jesus christ is the only and sufficient 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 savior 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.710
 tel 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.610
 I see how this marriage can travel according to the values 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.509
 spiritual values ​​and drunk people often look at us 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.150
 and so if our little thing they were manipulated they went away to 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.510
 they do not know what they are doing 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.159
 I know very well what I did. 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:13.339
 and I know very well what that represented in my personal life in the 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.819
 my spiritual life in my family life the speed of my marriage 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.679
 so I know I made this choice conscious 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.749
 because I know of the importance of this in the spiritual world 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:26.839
 so my 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.729
 to give advice to today's young people 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:34.679
 ctc is a great blessing from god so read with what happened is that 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:39.059
 the people who made sex a banality, and it is not so. 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.249
 the saints is a grass with a blessing of god 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:47.379
 the husband and father the wife the pleasures of the husband with the wife 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.489
 so the importance of sex after marriage and not so that the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.409
 process becomes a banality with the 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.409
 questioned today 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:05.569
 It was one of the great challenges of my life so it's because we 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.959
 choice is not easy, I will not tell you that it's easy, there are many 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.989
 straight in temptation yesterday at the beach 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.620
 the flesh is weak but the spirit vivifies then all the time we 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.620
 I was always always looking 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:29.789
 having this certainty was a great challenge but it was great to have arrived where 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:30.539
 I arrived 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.929
 I married the wife in 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.619
 in 2005 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:41.130
 and to our era once again and repeat a five-fan tactical experience 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.539
 really a one 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.760
 the spiritual secret that I 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.549
 I tell you that those who have come back are sure that I am going 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.219
 to live major illnesses in marriage in family life
