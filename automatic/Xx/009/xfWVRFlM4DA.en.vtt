will happen this week you know I think

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.479 
will happen this week you know I think
it's<00:02:36.500> gonna<00:02:36.590> be<00:02:36.680> really<00:02:36.769> hard<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.040> stop<00:02:37.310> us

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
it's gonna be really hard to stop us

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.070 
it's gonna be really hard to stop us
because<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.239> how<00:02:38.420> our<00:02:38.450> defense<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:38.930> playing

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
because of how our defense is playing

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.070 
because of how our defense is playing
out<00:02:39.410> Marshawn<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.310> running<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.580> football<00:02:41.080> and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
out Marshawn is running the football and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.020 
out Marshawn is running the football and
so<00:02:42.319> there's<00:02:42.890> been<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.130> lot<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.370> opportunities

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
so there's been a lot of opportunities

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.190 
so there's been a lot of opportunities
you<00:02:44.300> know<00:02:44.360> that's<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.780> good<00:02:44.930> thing<00:02:45.050> there's

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
you know that's a good thing there's

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.150 
you know that's a good thing there's
been<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.319> lot<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.470> opportunities<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.069> we

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
been a lot of opportunities that we

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.280 
been a lot of opportunities that we
could<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.610> capitalized<00:02:47.090> on<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.810> we<00:02:47.870> haven't

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
could have capitalized on and we haven't

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.990 
could have capitalized on and we haven't
you<00:02:48.440> know<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.769> think<00:02:49.250> some<00:02:49.489> of<00:02:49.519> that's<00:02:49.610> on<00:02:49.819> me

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
you know I think some of that's on me

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.610 
you know I think some of that's on me
and<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.600> look<00:02:50.930> forward<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.290> those<00:02:51.380> moments

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
and I look forward to those moments

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.440 
and I look forward to those moments
again<00:02:52.069> whenever<00:02:52.640> they<00:02:52.819> come<00:02:52.940> back<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.299> I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
again whenever they come back up I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.059 
again whenever they come back up I
believe<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.780> those<00:02:54.319> game<00:02:54.530> altering<00:02:54.890> plays

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069

I'm going to make you talked before
about<00:02:56.840> footwork<00:02:57.440> being<00:02:57.799> one<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> main

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
about footwork being one of the main

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.220 
about footwork being one of the main
culprits<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.660> find<00:02:59.870> that<00:02:59.989> still

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
culprits is that you find that still

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.410 
culprits is that you find that still
being<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.530> case<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:01.040> mean<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.700> think<00:03:02.000> sometimes

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
being the case I mean I think sometimes

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.270 
being the case I mean I think sometimes
you<00:03:02.870> know<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.110> think<00:03:03.440> someone's<00:03:03.890> I'm<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:04.160> been

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
you know I think someone's I'm just been

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.430 
you know I think someone's I'm just been
footwork<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.849> sometimes<00:03:05.660> maybe<00:03:05.870> just<00:03:06.140> just

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
footwork and sometimes maybe just just

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.259 
footwork and sometimes maybe just just
rushing<00:03:06.830> just<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.250> little<00:03:07.459> bit<00:03:07.580> too<00:03:07.700> fast<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.209> I

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
rushing just a little bit too fast and I

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.780 
rushing just a little bit too fast and I
think<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.690> one<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.620> my<00:03:09.709> one<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.250> my<00:03:10.340> strengths

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
think that one of my one of my strengths

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.580 
think that one of my one of my strengths
is<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.330> being<00:03:11.480> poisoned<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:12.080> certain<00:03:12.380> times

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
is just being poisoned in certain times

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.009 
is just being poisoned in certain times
and<00:03:12.799> I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.640> just<00:03:14.120> had<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.239> always<00:03:14.690> go

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
and I think that I just had to always go

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.750 
and I think that I just had to always go
back<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.500> always<00:03:15.769> going<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.220> being<00:03:16.489> calm

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
back to that always going to being calm

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.539 
back to that always going to being calm
as<00:03:16.910> possible<00:03:16.940> just<00:03:18.099> being<00:03:19.099> smooth<00:03:19.400> as

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
as possible just being smooth as

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.160 
as possible just being smooth as
possible<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:20.180> making<00:03:20.420> those<00:03:20.599> throws<00:03:20.930> and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
possible and making those throws and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.979 
possible and making those throws and
just<00:03:21.320> hit<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.470> when<00:03:21.739> it's<00:03:21.859> there<00:03:22.390> Russell<00:03:23.390> you

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
just hit it when it's there Russell you

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.300 
just hit it when it's there Russell you
have<00:03:24.109> consecutive<00:03:24.440> running<00:03:24.859> plays<00:03:25.070> whether

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
have consecutive running plays whether

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.000 
have consecutive running plays whether
it's<00:03:25.489> scramble<00:03:26.120> or<00:03:26.209> by<00:03:26.359> design<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.989> there<00:03:27.200> is

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
it's scramble or by design is there is

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.009 
it's scramble or by design is there is
if<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.579> third<00:03:28.790> plays<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.180> past<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.720> little

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
if the third plays the past is a little

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.259 
if the third plays the past is a little
harder<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.530> compose<00:03:31.430> yourself<00:03:31.790> after<00:03:32.000> running

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
harder to compose yourself after running

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.809 
harder to compose yourself after running
in<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.480> hitting<00:03:32.950> no<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:33.980> don't<00:03:34.489> think<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:34.670> I

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
in the hitting no I don't think so I

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.580 
in the hitting no I don't think so I
don't<00:03:35.030> think<00:03:35.209> about<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.569> at<00:03:35.780> least<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:36.170> don't

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
don't think about it at least I don't

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.970 
don't think about it at least I don't
think<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:36.890> makes<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.220> difference<00:03:37.400> in<00:03:37.670> terms<00:03:37.880> of

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
think it makes a difference in terms of

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.960 
think it makes a difference in terms of
obviously<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.220> know<00:03:40.310> I've<00:03:40.400> had<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.700> run<00:03:40.850> the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
obviously you know I've had to run the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.870 
obviously you know I've had to run the
ball<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> few<00:03:41.329> more<00:03:41.480> times<00:03:41.750> than<00:03:41.930> normal<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.880> in

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
ball a few more times than normal and in

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.150 
ball a few more times than normal and in
terms<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.390> in<00:03:44.810> terms<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.530> does<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.799> affect<00:03:46.069> the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
terms of in terms of does it affect the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.559 
terms of in terms of does it affect the
passing<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.579> map<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.850> don't<00:03:47.000> think<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:47.359> do

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
passing a map I don't think so I do

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.090 
passing a map I don't think so I do
think<00:03:47.870> your<00:03:48.319> adrenaline<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:48.739> going<00:03:48.889> a<00:03:49.010> little

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
think your adrenaline is going a little

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.090 
think your adrenaline is going a little
bit<00:03:49.250> more<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:50.660> we<00:03:50.720> kept<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.049> naturally<00:03:51.530> and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
bit more and so we kept it naturally and

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.620 
bit more and so we kept it naturally and
I've<00:03:52.190> done<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:52.519> you<00:03:52.790> know<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:52.970> solves<00:03:53.359> a

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
I've done this you know it solves a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.590 
I've done this you know it solves a
young<00:03:53.989> kid<00:03:54.260> haven't<00:03:54.829> been<00:03:54.950> honest<00:03:55.190> Graham

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
young kid haven't been honest Graham

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.290 
young kid haven't been honest Graham
all<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.620> think<00:03:57.130> I'm<00:03:57.310> used<00:03:57.550> to<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.850> but

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
all that so I think I'm used to it but

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.670 
all that so I think I'm used to it but
one<00:03:58.450> thing<00:03:58.600> you<00:03:58.630> have<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:58.930> kind<00:03:59.170> of<00:03:59.290> figure<00:03:59.440> out

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
one thing you have to kind of figure out

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.680 
one thing you have to kind of figure out
and<00:03:59.890> make<00:04:00.520> sure<00:04:00.550> that<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.850> know<00:04:01.000> it's<00:04:01.540> just

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
and make sure that you know it's just

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.340 
and make sure that you know it's just
stay<00:04:02.440> calm<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.920> stay<00:04:03.010> poised<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.820> I<00:04:04.690> think

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
stay calm and stay poised and I think

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.600 
stay calm and stay poised and I think
that's<00:04:05.500> part<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:05.860> because<00:04:06.160> your<00:04:06.370> drill

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
that's part of it because your drill

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.670 
that's part of it because your drill
running<00:04:06.910> so<00:04:07.120> high<00:04:07.270> from<00:04:08.080> running<00:04:08.350> around<00:04:08.560> from

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
running so high from running around from

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.820 
running so high from running around from
all<00:04:08.800> those<00:04:08.890> big<00:04:09.100> guys<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.930> know<00:04:11.020> we<00:04:11.170> get

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
all those big guys so you know we get
