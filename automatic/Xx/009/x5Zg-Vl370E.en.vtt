 creamy fruity or aromatic 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.990
 varieties from the new collection of yes 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.789
 Naturally 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.220
 occasion for the organic team on the yes 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.109
 of course, roof terrace the eight cups 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.830
 with curiosity and passion too 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.760
 taste 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.710
 who is behind the Kremstal ice maker 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.689
 Krems as a maker is a small one 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.460
 dairy in Upper Austria 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.469
 Grimstad is located near by 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.640
 Schlierbach with whom we are very 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.800
 of course for a long time 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.260
 Working together, he supplies us 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.730
 sheep goat products behind the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.420
 new supplier is in the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.210
 family business the morning in arzberg 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.670
 the krems has been around for several years 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.370
 of course, very good rates 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.289
 The company made experiences 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.340
 there are now more than 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.010
 15 years 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.830
 It was founded by experienced and we 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.660
 are united 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.320
 Milk market watch in Austria have us 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.780
 in this work of special milk on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.960
 the processing of organic bio 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 quite specialized why has so 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:39.900
 of course for an Austrian 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:41.160
 Producers 2000 started and at that time 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.350
 It was actually like that in Austria 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.790
 yes hardly as competence were available 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.070
 actually for the Austrian too 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.720
 good quality as 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.660
 actually synonymous with Italian 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.100
 what has happened is what they draw now 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.890
 as an ice cream maker like a bit 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.280
 rest because the ice production is also in 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.250
 the past the domain of the crane 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.149
 he was insisted on greenpeace 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.070
 is milk and therefore it was 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.290
 the dairies later than that 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.620
 But I did not produce until the end of 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.150
 globalization and are central 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.130
 Specialization is then actually one 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.530
 sewn industrial states 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.180
 we brought that back where it is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.650
 comes namely in 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.439
 3 and have started 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.750
 making ice cream that important ms 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.939
 make was to the kidnapping we 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.510
 Of course, a company was wanted with 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.609
 the hygienically perfect works that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.109
 we have very good experience with 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.530
 Of course, they have dairy too 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:50.340
 a lot of know how in hygiene and 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.900
 management and processes also petra 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.829
 pour essential 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.780
 food production to another 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.470
 But they also distinguish themselves by this 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.840
 that you have quality food too 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.299
 appreciate and using quality raw materials 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.189
 to know how to deal with high-quality tv materials 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.019
 no mass producers are by them 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.560
 it is a small regional one 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.549
 anchored operation with a very high 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.290
 degree of innovation above all 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.260
 many years of experience in the field of 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.969
 Milk processing paired with fruit and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.219
 and tastes of all kinds features 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.840
 what is the secret of the great 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:28.919
 make art of ice 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.340
 It is good craftsmanship and first 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.659
 line good raw materials and we have 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.150
 yes, of course, that too 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.470
 possibility of feeling the best raw materials 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.359
 to use 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.609
 yes, there are of course several important ones 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.150
 factors to good sex to produce 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.030
 can 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.079
 as with any food best 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.169
 raw materials 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.710
 the second is a high-quality recipe 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.720
 that he 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.210
 that comes into what has to go inside 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.360
 and the real art of the market 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.810
 is then actually in 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.100
 Manufacturing process 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.820
 We know the raw material milk and know 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.550
 has with this very valuable but also 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.110
 very delicate raw material best possible to the 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.120
 best food in the case 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.700
 Best food can be processed 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.510
 what is it all in the ice or 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.030
 better asked what is with bring so 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.650
 as always we work on how 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.430
 with fresh milk and not with him 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.310
 Milk powder are only natural 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.380
 containing raw materials is a super 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.360
 weight keep beet sugar partially 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.600
 positive that that is necessary with it 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.450
 no ice crystals form and it 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.950
 keep Munich by doing it 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:49.830
 variants and that makes a special 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:54.260
 good creaminess and what we naturally 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.910
 not events decidedly democratically 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.910
 new regulators artificial 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.860
 Additives in general is still 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.990
 no one where my differences showed 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.750
 significant 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:13.570
 determines the varieties strawberry yogurt poppy 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.090
 and change have only 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.500
 Austrian products sounds 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.060
 maybe it is natural 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.000
 but not what is here 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:27.940
 achievement so to speak the 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.680
 challenges for the first begins 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.450
 that many fruits of Austria are not 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.260
 More can be grown and choose 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.360
 they are not grown for the 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.580
 Processing offered but for the 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.440
 fresh market the problem is only for 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.350
 fresh offer that the processing 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.100
 peace and there it is , so to speak 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.900
 challenges farmers again or 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.970
 Processing companies to find the the 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.820
 in austria , the varieties make 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.530
 chocolate vanilla coffee come here yes 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.560
 the ingredients not as austria 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.320
 Of course, there are the details 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.120
 Consumers and consumers anyway 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.250
 rely on that here socially 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.820
 fair conditions have prevailed 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.130
 in the cultivation and the harvest on 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.780
 every case so both the cocoa and 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.860
 also the vanilla and the coffee 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.960
 are socially secured we pay 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.610
 also the fairtrade serves we are allowed 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.830
 we do not cite the fair trade seal 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.780
 hungry on our park because we 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.540
 just too low a share 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:33.210
 have fairtrade ingredients in the overall product 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.210
 what is your favorite place 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.690
 think my guys it there is in 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.560
 this shape and not so often is one 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.460
 special 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:52.900
 It is an Austrian varietal one 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:55.060
 typical Austrian just knows what 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.280
 very new was very intense after moon 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:02.610
 tastes yes that will be my companion 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:06.870
 should be opinion is the first ice 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:09.550
 because it's easy 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.280
 I mean a lot too 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.030
 who always compares this with distance 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.030
 best harder
