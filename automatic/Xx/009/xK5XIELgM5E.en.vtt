perhaps<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.259> most<00:02:04.380> simple<00:02:04.770> calendar<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
perhaps the most simple calendar is the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.089 
perhaps the most simple calendar is the
48<00:02:06.119> 96<00:02:06.360> which<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> total<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.619> six<00:02:07.890> days

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
48 96 which is a total of six days

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.260 
48 96 which is a total of six days
they'll<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.179> two<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.539> one

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
they'll do two on one

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.560 
they'll do two on one
two<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:11.320> four<00:02:11.350> off<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.120> mentioned<00:02:13.480> we're

two and four off as I mentioned we're

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.180 
two and four off as I mentioned we're
