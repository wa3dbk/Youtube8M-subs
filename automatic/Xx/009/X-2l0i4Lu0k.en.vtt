what<00:00:40.329> you<00:00:40.360> actually<00:00:40.540> paint<00:00:40.899> on<00:00:41.020> somebody<00:00:41.410> is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
what you actually paint on somebody is

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.560 
what you actually paint on somebody is
how<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.550> makes<00:00:42.700> them<00:00:42.850> feel<00:00:42.910> that<00:00:43.149> they<00:00:43.390> walk

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
how it makes them feel that they walk

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.630 
how it makes them feel that they walk
around<00:00:43.719> how<00:00:43.930> people<00:00:44.320> respond<00:00:44.739> to<00:00:44.860> them<00:00:45.100> that's

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
around how people respond to them that's

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.819 
around how people respond to them that's
the<00:00:45.879> transformation<00:00:46.600> is<00:00:46.750> how<00:00:47.050> people<00:00:47.079> respond

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
the transformation is how people respond

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.040 
the transformation is how people respond
to<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.100> even<00:00:49.059> though<00:00:49.149> it's<00:00:49.300> a<00:00:49.360> temporary<00:00:49.719> art

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
to you even though it's a temporary art

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.650 
to you even though it's a temporary art
it<00:00:50.379> gives<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.520> different<00:00:51.910> perspective<00:00:52.120> on

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
it gives you a different perspective on

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.299 
it gives you a different perspective on
your<00:00:52.809> own<00:00:52.930> identity<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.680> walk<00:00:53.829> around<00:00:54.010> with<00:00:54.219> a

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
your own identity to walk around with a

your own identity to walk around with a
mask<00:00:54.640> on<00:00:54.820> at<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.780> heart<00:00:56.050> of<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.260> though<00:00:56.469> is

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
mask on at the heart of it though is

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.799 
mask on at the heart of it though is
this<00:00:56.829> idea<00:00:57.219> of<00:00:57.309> transforming<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.239> identity

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
this idea of transforming the identity

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.639 
this idea of transforming the identity
and<00:00:59.219> doing<00:01:00.219> it<00:01:00.370> through<00:01:00.699> a<00:01:01.030> design<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.260> piece<00:01:02.590> of

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
and doing it through a design a piece of

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.550 
and doing it through a design a piece of
art<00:01:02.949> before<00:01:03.910> we<00:01:04.119> ever<00:01:04.299> painted<00:01:04.899> a<00:01:05.019> cave<00:01:05.259> wall

primary purpose of tribal face painting

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.239 
primary purpose of tribal face painting
is<00:01:54.849> to<00:01:55.179> baffle<00:01:55.599> or<00:01:55.719> remove<00:01:56.139> personal<00:01:56.679> identity

is to baffle or remove personal identity
which<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.119> why<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.359> uses<00:01:58.840> lines<00:01:59.109> and<00:01:59.469> geometric

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
which is why it uses lines and geometric

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:02.399 
which is why it uses lines and geometric
