west needle and you may mister get along
in<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:06.240> video<00:00:06.660> I'm<00:00:06.930> going<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.200> demonstrate

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.810 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate
how<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.099> purl<00:00:08.610> through<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:08.970> back<00:00:09.059> loop<00:00:10.820> so

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
how to purl through the back loop so

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.220 
how to purl through the back loop so
just<00:00:12.059> send<00:00:12.210> me<00:00:12.389> something<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.840> work<00:00:13.019> with<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
just send me something to work with and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.509 
just send me something to work with and
we'll<00:00:13.469> go<00:00:13.559> ahead<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.769> purl<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.250> first

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
we'll go ahead and purl this first

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.849 
we'll go ahead and purl this first
stitch<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.529> normal<00:00:16.529> purl<00:00:21.199> now<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:22.710> going

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
stitch just a normal purl now I'm going

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.259 
stitch just a normal purl now I'm going
to<00:00:22.920> take<00:00:23.070> these<00:00:23.220> next<00:00:23.490> two<00:00:23.730> stitches<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.210> my

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
to take these next two stitches on my

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.240 
to take these next two stitches on my
needle<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:25.230> gonna<00:00:25.439> purl<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.920> through

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
needle and I'm gonna purl them through

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.970 
needle and I'm gonna purl them through
the<00:00:26.340> back<00:00:26.490> loop<00:00:26.760> now<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.720> technique<00:00:28.140> sounds

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the back loop now this technique sounds

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.740 
the back loop now this technique sounds
a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.130> more<00:00:29.340> difficult<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.150> than<00:00:30.660> it

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
a lot more difficult that it is than it

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380 
a lot more difficult that it is than it
is<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> opposite

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
is but really all it is is the opposite

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.270 
is but really all it is is the opposite
of<00:00:33.570> knitting<00:00:34.559> two<00:00:34.710> together<00:00:34.800> through<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
of knitting two together through the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
of knitting two together through the
back<00:00:35.309> loop<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.750> first

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
back loop so what I'm going to do first

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680 
back loop so what I'm going to do first
just<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.790> little<00:00:39.300> bit<00:00:39.390> easier

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
just so you can see a little bit easier

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
just so you can see a little bit easier
what<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:39.930> doing<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.680> gonna<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.129> purl

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
what I'm doing is I'm gonna just purl

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.529 
what I'm doing is I'm gonna just purl
this<00:00:41.910> stitch<00:00:42.239> through<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> back<00:00:43.200> loop<00:00:44.030> now<00:00:45.030> in

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this stitch through the back loop now in

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.910 
this stitch through the back loop now in
the<00:00:45.719> pattern<00:00:46.079> you'll<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.320> purling<00:00:46.739> two

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the pattern you'll be purling two

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.139 
the pattern you'll be purling two
stitches<00:00:47.250> together<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.760> I'll<00:00:47.820> show<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
stitches together and I'll show you that

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
stitches together and I'll show you that
next<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.649> bit<00:00:49.770> easier<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.129> see

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
next but it's a little bit easier to see

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
next but it's a little bit easier to see
with<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.760> stitch<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.539> try<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
with one stitch so I'm going to try to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.709 
with one stitch so I'm going to try to
turn<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.079> around<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.059> this

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
turn this around so you can see and this

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.110 
turn this around so you can see and this
is<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> front<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> stitch<00:00:55.879> what's<00:00:56.879> facing

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is the front of the stitch what's facing

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.660 
is the front of the stitch what's facing
me<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.920> turn<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.640> round<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:02.489> go

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
me and so I turn this round to go

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.600 
me and so I turn this round to go
through<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.820> back<00:01:06.060> loop<00:01:07.369> we're<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.549> be

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
through the back loop we're going to be

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.100 
through the back loop we're going to be
going<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> backside<00:01:09.570> right<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
going on the backside right there and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.960 
going on the backside right there and
you're<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.610> way

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.670 

like<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> pull<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.530> back

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
like that so I'm going to pull it back

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.539 
like that so I'm going to pull it back
around<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> went<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> back

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
around so where I went in on the back

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.140 
around so where I went in on the back
side<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:21.360> around<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:23.000> it's<00:01:24.000> right

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
side as I go around like this it's right

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.039 
side as I go around like this it's right
here<00:01:24.509> come<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.720> then<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> just

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
here come on like that and then you just

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.280 
here come on like that and then you just
purl<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.610> as<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.479> usually<00:01:30.659> would<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> what

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
purl it as you usually would and what

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.230 
purl it as you usually would and what
this<00:01:31.439> does<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> controls<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:32.880> way<00:01:33.060> your

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
this does is it controls which way your

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.590 
this does is it controls which way your
decrease<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.170> lean<00:01:35.420> which<00:01:36.420> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
decrease is going to lean which is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
decrease is going to lean which is
making<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.200> design<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> lace<00:01:38.430> pattern

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
making the design and the lace pattern

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.270 
making the design and the lace pattern
pattern<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.600> our<00:01:39.720> scarf<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.710> now<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
pattern in our scarf so now I'm going to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880 
pattern in our scarf so now I'm going to
purl<00:01:41.460> two<00:01:41.700> stitches<00:01:41.729> together<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:43.680> I'm<00:01:43.770> going

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
purl two stitches together so I'm going

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.960 
purl two stitches together so I'm going
to<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.070> ahead<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.280> flip<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.759> don't

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to go ahead and flip it and you don't

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.399 
to go ahead and flip it and you don't
flip<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.329> when<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> I'm<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.079> trying

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
flip it when you do it I'm just trying

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.319 
flip it when you do it I'm just trying
to<00:01:46.590> make<00:01:46.710> sure<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.210> gonna

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.160 
the two stitches that I'm rolling
together<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.969> we<00:01:56.969> go<00:01:57.119> through<00:01:57.360> both<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.630> them

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
together so we go through both of them

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.840 
together so we go through both of them
just<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.770> that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
just like that

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.039 
just like that
go<00:02:01.850> through<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.150> back<00:02:02.270> loop<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:02.659> go<00:02:02.780> through

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
go through the back loop you go through

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.319 
go through the back loop you go through
the<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.799> second<00:02:04.250> one<00:02:04.399> on<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:04.610> needle<00:02:05.030> first

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
the the second one on the needle first

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.899 
the the second one on the needle first
and<00:02:05.750> then<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.500> first<00:02:06.649> one<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.399> I'm<00:02:07.520> gonna<00:02:07.670> Pro

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
and then the first one so I'm gonna Pro

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.539 
and then the first one so I'm gonna Pro
these<00:02:08.090> two<00:02:08.390> together
