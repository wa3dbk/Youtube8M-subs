about<00:00:06.660> how<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.680> get<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.220> edges<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.670> my<00:00:08.849> books

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
about how I get the edges of my books

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.770 
about how I get the edges of my books
nice<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.679> neat<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.099> clean<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.540> was<00:00:12.690> an

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
nice and neat and clean it was an

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.529 
nice and neat and clean it was an
example<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.940> edges<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> book

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
example of the edges of the book

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:26.420 
example of the edges of the book
completely<00:00:18.539> flush<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:25.070> here's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> book

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
completely flush and the here's a book

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.259 
completely flush and the here's a book
that<00:00:26.820> has<00:00:27.060> not<00:00:27.359> been<00:00:27.630> trimmed<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> edges

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
that has not been trimmed on the edges

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.700 
that has not been trimmed on the edges
makes<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.420> hard<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> leaf<00:00:31.050> through<00:00:31.820> pages<00:00:33.710> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
makes it hard to leaf through pages so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
makes it hard to leaf through pages so
what<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.430> use<00:00:36.649> instead<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.010> tool<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.210> would

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
what I use instead of a tool that would

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.920 
what I use instead of a tool that would
normally<00:00:39.420> cost<00:00:39.780> about<00:00:40.320> $200<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.510> this<00:00:42.510> right

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
normally cost about $200 is this right

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.790 
normally cost about $200 is this right
here<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:45.050> is<00:00:46.050> about<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> five-dollar

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here and it is about a five-dollar

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.040 
here and it is about a five-dollar
chisel<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.309> got<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> hardware<00:00:47.940> store<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.510> had

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
chisel I got at the hardware store I had

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
chisel I got at the hardware store I had
a<00:00:49.079> flat<00:00:49.879> top<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.480> took<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> table

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
a flat top on it I took it to a table

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.889 
a flat top on it I took it to a table
grinder<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:56.390> rounded<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
grinder and and rounded it and got a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.220 
grinder and and rounded it and got a
pretty<00:00:58.170> rough<00:00:58.559> edge<00:00:59.420> but<00:01:00.420> where<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> wanted<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
pretty rough edge but where I wanted it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
pretty rough edge but where I wanted it
and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.649> went<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> table<00:01:02.969> grinder

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and then I went from the table grinder

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.410 
and then I went from the table grinder
to<00:01:03.680> an<00:01:04.680> angle<00:01:05.189> grinder<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.820> smoothed<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.299> out

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to an angle grinder and smoothed it out

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.210 
to an angle grinder and smoothed it out
real<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:07.460> then<00:01:08.460> after<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.240> used

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
real bit then after that I used

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.260 
real bit then after that I used
sandpaper<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:12.150> piece<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> glass<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
but I haven't had to resharpen this and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.410 
but I haven't had to resharpen this and
it<00:01:39.530> does<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> nice<00:01:40.829> edge<00:01:41.100> I'll<00:01:41.820> show<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.150> how<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it does a nice edge I'll show you how it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.859 
it does a nice edge I'll show you how it
works<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.960> second<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.479> my<00:01:45.600> book

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
works in just second so I get my book

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.020 
works in just second so I get my book
and<00:01:46.549> line<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.119> back<00:01:49.189> between<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:50.670> boards

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and line up the back between two boards

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
and line up the back between two boards
this<00:01:52.250> front<00:01:53.250> board<00:01:53.490> acts<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:55.320> guide<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this front board acts as the guide of

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.819 
this front board acts as the guide of
where<00:01:56.159> flat<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.259> keep<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> edge

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
where flat is so you keep the edge

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.420 
where flat is so you keep the edge
always<00:01:59.070> flat<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.820> board<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:02.280> back

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
always flat on that board and the back

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.569 
always flat on that board and the back
board<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:03.229> kind<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.320> holds<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> book<00:02:05.430> all

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
board just kind of holds the book all

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.039 
board just kind of holds the book all
together<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> pages<00:02:06.450> don't<00:02:06.570> bend<00:02:06.869> when

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
together so the pages don't bend when

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.680 
together so the pages don't bend when
you<00:02:07.140> push<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.950> this

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
you push on it and you just this

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.460 
you push on it and you just this
press<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.930> made<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.860> two<00:02:14.070> pieces<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.760> 2x4<00:02:15.690> with

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
press I made just two pieces of 2x4 with

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.900 
press I made just two pieces of 2x4 with
some<00:02:16.890> through<00:02:17.280> bolts<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:19.550> these<00:02:20.550> are<00:02:20.700> some

only<00:02:42.240> need<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.660> worry<00:02:42.990> about<00:02:43.620> getting<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.100> few

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
only need to worry about getting a few

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.150 
only need to worry about getting a few
sheets<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:45.000> one<00:02:45.330> time<00:02:45.710> because<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:46.950> want<00:02:47.100> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
sheets at one time because you want to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.440 
sheets at one time because you want to
really<00:02:47.460> take<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.850> time<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:50.180> not<00:02:51.180> push<00:02:51.420> too

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
really take your time and not push too

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.740 
really take your time and not push too
hard<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:53.570> they'll<00:02:54.570> come<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:56.720> nice<00:02:57.720> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
hard and they'll come out nice and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.010 
hard and they'll come out nice and
smooth<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:59.580> always<00:03:00.060> putting<00:03:00.420> pressure<00:03:00.660> on

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
smooth that always putting pressure on

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.490 
smooth that always putting pressure on
the<00:03:01.200> board<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.760> board<00:03:03.000> stays<00:03:03.330> flat<00:03:03.720> or<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the board so the board stays flat or the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.220 
the board so the board stays flat or the
blade<00:03:04.950> stays<00:03:05.280> flat<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:12.840> start<00:03:13.140> to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
blade stays flat and you just start to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:25.560 
blade stays flat and you just start to
come<00:03:13.380> off

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.460 

little<00:03:26.570> pieces

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
little pieces

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.920 
little pieces
I<00:03:27.500> saved<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.790> paper<00:03:29.030> because<00:03:29.270> it's<00:03:29.660> a

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
I saved this this paper because it's a

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.470 
I saved this this paper because it's a
nice<00:03:31.810> acid-free<00:03:32.860> paper<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.340> am<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:35.090> saved

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
nice acid-free paper that I am I saved

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.660 
nice acid-free paper that I am I saved
all<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.690> little<00:03:35.900> scraps<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.980> eventually<00:03:37.490> try

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
all the little scraps to eventually try

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.550 
all the little scraps to eventually try
to<00:03:37.700> make<00:03:37.940> some<00:03:38.210> handmade<00:03:39.200> paper<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:41.560> haven't

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
to make some handmade paper I haven't

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:53.520 
to make some handmade paper I haven't
done<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.740> yet<00:03:42.770> so<00:03:44.380> see<00:03:45.380> when<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.740> get<00:03:45.890> there

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.490 

it's<00:03:54.530> round<00:03:54.770> because<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.610> can<00:03:56.200> get<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.260> real

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
it's round because you can get a real

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.520 
it's round because you can get a real
smooth<00:03:58.130> cut<00:03:59.290> against<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.470> paper<00:04:02.080> no<00:04:03.080> jagged

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
smooth cut against the paper no jagged

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:14.350 
smooth cut against the paper no jagged
edge<00:04:05.290> taking<00:04:06.290> your<00:04:06.440> time

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.620 

these<00:04:15.360> making<00:04:15.720> sure<00:04:15.960> that<00:04:16.290> your<00:04:16.769> flat<00:04:17.220> on<00:04:17.630> the

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
these making sure that your flat on the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:28.490 
these making sure that your flat on the
board

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.160 

and<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.280> probably<00:04:29.670> easier<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:30.420> I<00:04:30.510> had<00:04:30.540> wider

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
and I probably easier if I had wider

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.680 
and I probably easier if I had wider
guide<00:04:31.770> board<00:04:32.160> but<00:04:32.730> this<00:04:32.910> blade<00:04:33.210> isn't<00:04:33.540> that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
guide board but this blade isn't that

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.040 
guide board but this blade isn't that
long<00:04:33.920> wouldn't<00:04:34.920> get<00:04:35.250> much<00:04:35.400> out<00:04:35.790> of<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.810> I'm

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
long wouldn't get much out of it I'm

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.870 
long wouldn't get much out of it I'm
probably<00:04:37.410> going<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.680> be<00:04:37.740> doing<00:04:38.310> another<00:04:38.550> one

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
probably going to be doing another one

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.970 
probably going to be doing another one
of<00:04:38.970> these<00:04:39.060> blades<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:40.590> it's<00:04:40.710> going<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.890> be

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
of these blades that it's going to be

of these blades that it's going to be
out<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.400> longer<00:04:41.820> piece<00:04:55.460> this<00:04:56.460> is<00:04:56.640> really

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
out of a longer piece this is really

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.200 
out of a longer piece this is really
thin<00:04:57.860> easy<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:59.190> work<00:04:59.340> with<00:04:59.580> paper<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.910> called

looking to get tres on this it's really
thin<00:05:39.060> like<00:05:39.270> Bible<00:05:39.660> pin<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:41.419> but<00:05:42.419> if<00:05:42.570> you're<00:05:42.720> a

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
thin like Bible pin and but if you're a

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.370 
thin like Bible pin and but if you're a
fountain<00:05:43.169> pen<00:05:43.200> user<00:05:43.530> it's<00:05:44.160> great<00:05:44.610> because<00:05:44.880> it

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
fountain pen user it's great because it

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.270 
fountain pen user it's great because it
holds<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.710> ink<00:05:47.660> well<00:05:48.660> enough<00:05:49.020> on<00:05:49.290> the<00:05:49.800> surface

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
holds the ink well enough on the surface

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.840 
holds the ink well enough on the surface
too<00:05:50.669> so<00:05:50.970> you<00:05:51.060> can<00:05:51.800> see<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.979> coloration<00:05:53.729> of

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
too so you can see the coloration of

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.719 
too so you can see the coloration of
your<00:05:54.060> ink<00:05:54.240> really<00:05:54.570> nice<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.460> at<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.580> same

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
your ink really nice and at the same

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.280 
your ink really nice and at the same
time<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.390> ink<00:05:57.570> doesn't<00:05:57.900> really<00:05:58.020> bleed

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
time the ink doesn't really bleed

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:05.150 
time the ink doesn't really bleed
through<00:05:58.560> it's<00:05:58.919> it<00:05:59.280> has<00:05:59.700> a<00:06:00.080> lot<00:06:01.080> of<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:04.160> don't

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
through it's it has a lot of I don't

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.950 
through it's it has a lot of I don't
know<00:06:05.280> what<00:06:05.430> cause<00:06:05.610> of<00:06:05.640> that<00:06:05.880> if<00:06:06.120> it's<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.450> way

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
know what cause of that if it's the way

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.370 
know what cause of that if it's the way
that<00:06:07.110> they<00:06:07.320> sized<00:06:07.979> the<00:06:08.220> paper<00:06:08.460> or<00:06:09.380> what

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
that they sized the paper or what

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.030 
that they sized the paper or what
probably<00:06:11.870> I'm<00:06:12.870> going<00:06:13.140> back<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.560> getting<00:06:13.680> some

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
probably I'm going back and getting some

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.300 
probably I'm going back and getting some
of<00:06:14.070> these<00:06:14.330> edges<00:06:15.560> there's<00:06:16.560> some<00:06:16.710> ridges<00:06:17.100> that

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
of these edges there's some ridges that

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.240 
of these edges there's some ridges that
I<00:06:17.340> missed<00:06:17.669> and<00:06:17.910> so<00:06:18.120> I'm<00:06:18.210> just<00:06:18.240> kind<00:06:18.570> of<00:06:18.630> like
