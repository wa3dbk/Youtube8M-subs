 hello how about friends of people and means 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.490
 This is your channel and I'm going to show you 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.779
 best casual games for this month 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.779
 and good, we started 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.750
 very good guys if you're curious about 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.610
 that these are protectors I will take a 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.260
 video of those protective moments and of 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.300
 some other accessories if it's me 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.700
 I'm taking and I'm not sumo video is for 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.020
 that because by editing this video of the 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.480
 accessories for you can 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.550
 enjoy them and soon they will have 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.290
 I hope that in 12 good days we are going to 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.660
 start with the selection of games that 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.610
 they are casual games for any 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.490
 device and they do not really occupy 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.650
 as a high- end device 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.160
 somehow the first game is called 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.560
 no break and good means no brakes 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.420
 and good what we have to do is like 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.420
 drive a stroller with clicks 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.690
 and then we can put the right side to 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.370
 left side and have to go good no 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.290
 is learning and we have to reach the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.380
 highest possible speed 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.899
 here we have 39 40 miles per hour 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.520
 We do not have to touch the edges 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.350
 obvious reasons then here what 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.189
 we have to do is try to practice 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.350
 my record from 82 if someone achieves 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.479
 surpass my record in any of the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.000
 games that I'm going to show you then 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.950
 please can feel free of 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.130
 post it on my twitter as android 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.439
 staff so I can see 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.720
 your tweeting scores is a game 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.179
 pretty simple pretty simple 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.399
 does not have super demanding graphics 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.549
 really because nothing of graphics has 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.140
 they are flat, that is, your appearance and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.700
 that makes it pretty fast pretty 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.979
 fluid and for any device 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.360
 Mobile that does not want to play is pretty 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.549
 simple would simply have to be done 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.799
 that avoid crashing and well let's move on 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.020
 to the second game the second game is 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.020
 called milk 10.29 leave in description 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.240
 in this it is practically like a tetris 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.280
 you have to arm like tetris and get to the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.170
 higher score putting the chips that 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.539
 they are putting us here on this side of 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.970
 down after certain chips as we 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.860
 they will give other three chips then 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.359
 where comes the hard part is that 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.340
 after a while it's going to 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.080
 complicate the matter a bit 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.750
 because we're going to run out of squares 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.480
 available and good our mind does 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.730
 the highest score but if you do not meet 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.260
 with what are the three tabs or 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.060
 putting the three tabs you're going to 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.580
 lose I'm going to explain a little bit 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.349
 better if I for example here I have this 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.390
 space and I have it vacated and then 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.950
 I put this but in the end I do not have 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.400
 time to put this for example this 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.750
 good point here to release 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.819
 obviously you have to put in rows not 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.670
 matter whether it's horizontal or vertical and 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.560
 good to what I mean to lose is 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.239
 that if you can not put all the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.160
 chips three you're going to lose 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.230
 automatically example if they do not come out 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.569
 larger or curved figures that do not 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.549
 we can fulfill in a certain aspect and what 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.530
 automatically detects the game 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.930
 we will have lost and our score will be 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.810
 the greatest and good is practically this 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.099
 of what the 1.010 game consists of and 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.019
 well, it's pretty simple, it's 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.940
 pretty easy pretty practical is 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.069
 entertaining to be able to hang out and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.629
 why not play with friends challenge them 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.849
 but I'm going to leave it down here in the 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.590
 description that is totally free and 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.170
 I think here I'm going to lose where they 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.209
 I showed and I will be able to put this piece 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.430
 to lose and that's what this 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.060
 game the next game is called heads 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.130
 soccer and it's a soccer game that's 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 quite entertaining of what it consists 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.910
 this game that we can select to 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.290
 our favorite team any team 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.260
 for example we have selected 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.030
 in this case they are from this game consists 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.350
 of the Spanish league then for example 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.020
 let's select the real madrid 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.390
 against Barcelona we can choose the 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.640
 favorite player that we want 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.500
 we want to take then take the 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.819
 'chicharito' let's give it next and 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.170
 they will automatically face them in a 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.940
 party we can improve our 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.220
 skills we are going to give you play we can 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.019
 squeeze leagues cups et cetera etcetera 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.750
 already after a while then we can 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.190
 go putting in more tournaments and here 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.810
 Well, we can move our character 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.640
 from left to right we can give a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.560
 meter kick to score a goal of making a 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.160
 jump we can jump and try to 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.080
 head 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.820
 and we can after a while put 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.610
 our change that I just put a goal 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:22.640
 with chicha goodbye and good for this from 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.640
 what that game gives you and I'm a barbarian 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.100
 of the screw is simple and do not occupy 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.500
 a high - range as 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.270
 the graphics are not as demanding as 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.530
 in other versions of games and it's 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.330
 pretty entertaining after a 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.740
 time it can be a special and 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.590
 You can buy them if they fit 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.870
 doing so more scores here there 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.220
 that try to avoid this goal and good 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.660
 I'm also going to leave you here habit in 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.570
 the decision so you can enjoy it 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.880
 on your phone our fourth game is 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.980
 ultra flow and it's a game well enough 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.050
 entertaining here what we have to 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.330
 to do is to try to put what is this 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.830
 piece and destroy what is this 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.300
 circulito let's put a level 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.370
 pretty simple let's put the 5 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.830
 to be able to explain what it consists of 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.300
 we have a little ball and here in the middle 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.800
 have a number that number is going to 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.720
 tell us how many times the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.610
 little ball in this case can only collide 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.390
 once we have to destroy this 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.520
 circle that is on the other side 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.500
 as you can see, he played more than once 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.830
 then how can not crash more than one 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.990
 time 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.060
 we have to send it for what then 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.710
 destroy this circle and be able to go 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.240
 advancing to the levels is can 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.430
 crash ten times 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.349
 he left two and well let's go to a 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.720
 much harder level the complicated 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.190
 so you can see that it's going 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.250
 making it difficult in a way I here 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.310
 come to 25 there are not many 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.900
 really then here they give us little 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.660
 for example let's bring double is 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.090
 let's try to be able to enter as they are 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.080
 five rebounds and there he did it and also 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.520
 of not leaving in the description is 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.190
 pretty simple pretty simple to go 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.110
 to hang out at ease when you go in 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.940
 public transport because like me if you 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.160
 you go to a public sport because you have to 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.659
 kill time somehow and I would 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.940
 I download these games to bring them and 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.680
 so as not to bore the truck and you 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.120
 I'm going to leave the last game down here 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.729
 I'm going to show you the limbo that is a 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.130
 Pretty pretty award-winning game 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.659
 Well, he already had several mentions and I 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.310
 I'm going to show you here, let's give it 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.110
 touch to continue is pretty 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.509
 simple and quite simple and has a 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.699
 thematic that catches you from a point 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.949
 incredible you can advance you can jump 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.840
 holding up and good what 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:29.120
 we have to do is avoid all kinds of 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.120
 obstacles to not die 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.360
 there has to die and well then get 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.150
 objectives is to move forward in the 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.430
 adventure is quite simple is a 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.930
 quite simple adventure that then 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.000
 we can go adapting 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.920
 then requires a little bit of skill 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.050
 and good to think a little to go 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.820
 advancing has as it is some puzzles 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.100
 or some puzzles that we 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.410
 we will have to go thinking to be able to go 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.810
 advancing in then our adventure 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.880
 avoid some dangers such as 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.550
 spider monsters and so on that will try 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.750
 to marry or kill us and us what 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.210
 we have to do obviously is 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.460
 survive is a pretty useful game and 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.620
 It is not so heavy any device 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.900
 they can lift it the graphics are very 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.570
 flat but it's quite stopped very 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.390
 fun and totally recommended for 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.530
 any device all games 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.690
 I will leave them in the description 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.760
 so you can just click here 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.650
 down and good as this has been all 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.360
 I hope you liked that if you 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.680
 liked me leave a little hand up that you 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.660
