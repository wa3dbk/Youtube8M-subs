in<00:01:50.260> when<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.040> start<00:01:51.280> getting<00:01:51.460> upwards<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.720> 10

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
in when you start getting upwards of 10

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.240 
in when you start getting upwards of 10
or<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:53.230> farms<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.650> think<00:01:53.770> it's<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> good<00:01:53.980> idea<00:01:54.070> to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
or so farms I think it's a good idea to

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.850 
or so farms I think it's a good idea to
keep<00:01:54.310> record<00:01:54.760> of<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.830> guess<00:01:56.830> a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
keep record of that and and I guess a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.200 
keep record of that and and I guess a
