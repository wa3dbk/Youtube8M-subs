my<00:00:14.789> factory<00:00:15.830> gauge<00:00:16.830> bezel<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.430> my<00:00:17.550> 77<00:00:17.940> c10<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
my factory gauge bezel for my 77 c10 and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.900 
my factory gauge bezel for my 77 c10 and
this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> brand<00:00:19.320> new<00:00:19.529> gauge<00:00:20.310> bezel<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
this is a brand new gauge bezel that I

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.240 
this is a brand new gauge bezel that I
bought<00:00:21.120> I<00:00:21.450> had<00:00:22.290> to<00:00:22.380> buy<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> new<00:00:22.740> one<00:00:22.860> my<00:00:23.040> last

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
bought I had to buy a new one my last

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.980 
bought I had to buy a new one my last
one<00:00:23.870> it<00:00:24.920> like<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.010> said<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.280> a<00:00:26.340> 77<00:00:27.030> previous

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
one it like I said it's a 77 previous

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.080 
one it like I said it's a 77 previous
owner<00:00:28.170> put<00:00:28.289> one<00:00:28.620> in<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:29.039> an<00:00:29.130> 81<00:00:29.550> through<00:00:29.730> 87

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
owner put one in from an 81 through 87

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.670 
owner put one in from an 81 through 87
so<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.510> wasn't<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> right<00:00:30.930> one<00:00:31.050> anyway<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
so it wasn't the right one anyway and it

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.560 
so it wasn't the right one anyway and it
was<00:00:31.710> junk<00:00:32.510> as<00:00:33.649> well<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.940> had<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> buy<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> new

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
was junk as well so I had to buy a new

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.380 
was junk as well so I had to buy a new
one<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.900> is<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.440> hundred<00:00:37.860> dollar<00:00:38.010> one

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.740 
one this is just the hundred dollar one
nothing<00:00:39.390> fancy<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.810> got<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:40.440> silver<00:00:41.750> on

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
nothing fancy just got it some silver on

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.700 
nothing fancy just got it some silver on
some<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.390> writing<00:00:45.750> other<00:00:45.960> net<00:00:46.410> it's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
some of the the writing other net it's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.049 
some of the the writing other net it's
just<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> basic<00:00:47.870> black<00:00:48.870> plastic<00:00:49.820> gauge<00:00:50.820> bezel

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
just the basic black plastic gauge bezel

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.130 
just the basic black plastic gauge bezel
so<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.230> am<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:53.040> with<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.399> quality<00:00:54.140> Auto

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
so but I am going with the quality Auto

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.049 
so but I am going with the quality Auto
Meter<00:00:55.260> gauges<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.550> basically<00:00:56.790> what<00:00:56.969> I'm

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
Meter gauges and basically what I'm

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.160 
Meter gauges and basically what I'm
going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:58.739> I'm<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> mount<00:00:59.219> them

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
going to do is I'm going to mount them

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.950 
going to do is I'm going to mount them
behind<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:02.239> just<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:03.840> these

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
behind there just like this now these

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.800 
behind there just like this now these
are<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.140> two<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> five-eighths<00:01:05.009> inch<00:01:05.219> gauges

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
are the two and five-eighths inch gauges

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.209 
are the two and five-eighths inch gauges
so<00:01:06.810> they're<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.409> bit<00:01:07.530> big<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
so they're a little bit big if you

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.660 
so they're a little bit big if you
wanted<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.639> you<00:01:08.789> could<00:01:09.060> probably<00:01:09.689> use<00:01:10.139> the<00:01:10.289> two

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
wanted to you could probably use the two

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.999 
wanted to you could probably use the two
and<00:01:11.670> 1/16<00:01:12.179> gauges<00:01:12.719> I<00:01:12.899> think<00:01:13.469> I've<00:01:13.590> measured

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
and 1/16 gauges I think I've measured

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.849 
and 1/16 gauges I think I've measured
I<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.999> I've<00:01:15.270> measured<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.530> diameter

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
I know I've measured out this diameter

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.480 
I know I've measured out this diameter
to<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.939> 1<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.420> 3/4<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> two<00:01:19.889> two<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to be about 1 and 3/4 so the two two and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.209 
to be about 1 and 3/4 so the two two and
one<00:01:20.579> sixteenths<00:01:21.179> could<00:01:21.749> work<00:01:21.899> just<00:01:22.079> fine<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
one sixteenths could work just fine and

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.149 
one sixteenths could work just fine and
then<00:01:23.340> I'm<00:01:23.399> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.729> 5-inch

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
then I'm going to have 5-inch

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.429 
then I'm going to have 5-inch
speedometer<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.369> tachometer<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.359> here<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.779> lot

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
speedometer and tachometer in here a lot

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.639 
speedometer and tachometer in here a lot
of<00:01:28.529> people<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.939> I've<00:01:30.060> seen<00:01:30.649> they'll

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
of people from what I've seen they'll

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.410 
of people from what I've seen they'll
make<00:01:31.859> like<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:32.849> aluminum<00:01:33.149> cover<00:01:34.789> it<00:01:35.789> may<00:01:36.240> not

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
make like an aluminum cover it may not

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.639 
make like an aluminum cover it may not
go<00:01:36.599> all<00:01:36.749> the<00:01:36.840> way<00:01:36.869> over<00:01:36.959> to<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
go all the way over to here but it

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.800 
go all the way over to here but it
certainly<00:01:37.770> goes<00:01:38.039> from<00:01:38.219> here<00:01:38.579> over<00:01:39.389> to<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.659> end

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
certainly goes from here over to the end

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
certainly goes from here over to the end
then<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:40.920> cut<00:01:41.159> out<00:01:41.279> the<00:01:41.429> plastic<00:01:41.670> behind

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
then they cut out the plastic behind

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.629 
then they cut out the plastic behind
there<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.929> they<00:01:43.740> take<00:01:43.920> their<00:01:44.099> gauges<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
there and they take their gauges and

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:46.699 
there and they take their gauges and
they<00:01:44.729> drop<00:01:44.939> them<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.270> from<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.289> front<00:01:46.560> like

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
they drop them in from the front like

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.699 
they drop them in from the front like
this<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.209> all<00:01:48.389> that<00:01:48.539> bad<00:01:48.810> except

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
this and that's not all that bad except

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.539 
this and that's not all that bad except
the<00:01:49.799> problem<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:52.289> gauges<00:01:52.709> they<00:01:53.189> need<00:01:53.429> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the problem is the gauges they need to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.149 
the problem is the gauges they need to
point<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:54.469> so<00:01:55.469> when<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.740> sitting<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.039> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
point up so when you're sitting in the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
point up so when you're sitting in the
truck<00:01:56.459> they<00:01:57.299> need<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.599> point<00:01:57.749> up<00:01:58.020> kind<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.349> at

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
truck they need to point up kind of at

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.179 
truck they need to point up kind of at
your<00:01:58.619> face<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.069> when<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.249> mount<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.270> flat

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
your face and when you mount this flat

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.679 
your face and when you mount this flat
the<00:02:02.189> gauges<00:02:02.579> are<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.789> kind<00:02:03.209> of<00:02:03.270> pointing<00:02:03.569> at

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the gauges are now kind of pointing at

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.719 
the gauges are now kind of pointing at
your<00:02:03.840> stomach<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.349> that<00:02:04.590> or<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:05.520> need<00:02:05.669> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.850 
you know a lot of this is going to be my
design<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:20.760> basically<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.569> saw<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.470> online

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
design but basically I saw this online

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.880 
design but basically I saw this online
on<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.640> message<00:02:24.090> board<00:02:24.270> or<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.440> home<00:02:25.650> page

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
of a message board and I believe it was

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.610 
of a message board and I believe it was
