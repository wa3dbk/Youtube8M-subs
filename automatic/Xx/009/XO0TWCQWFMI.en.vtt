here that's that's high power if you're

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.309 
here that's that's high power if you're
gonna<00:01:52.069> use<00:01:52.280> sideband<00:01:52.880> there's<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.929> switch<00:01:54.170> in

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
gonna use sideband there's a switch in

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.479 
gonna use sideband there's a switch in
the<00:01:54.409> back<00:01:54.439> for<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.310> relay<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.090> life<00:01:57.489> this
