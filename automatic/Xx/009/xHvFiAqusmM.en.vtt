vinyl and fabric spray the unique thing
about<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.130> well<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> has<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> denver

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
about this as well as it has a denver

about this as well as it has a denver
nozzle<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.909> what<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:27.540> with

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
nozzle on it and what we can do with

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.980 
nozzle on it and what we can do with
this<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.670> since<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> dashboard<00:01:30.240> has<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.810> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this is since the dashboard has a lot of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.630 
this is since the dashboard has a lot of
areas<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> might<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:31.979> difficult<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.490> get

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
areas that it might be difficult to get

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.060 
areas that it might be difficult to get
to<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> standard<00:01:33.470> nozzle<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.040> can

to it the standard nozzle you can

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.370 
to it the standard nozzle you can
actually<00:01:35.700> change<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.600> direction<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:37.290> the

the nozzle you can rotate it right there

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.380 
the nozzle you can rotate it right there
hit<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.189> again<00:02:03.409> then<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.530> shoots<00:02:05.390> horizontal

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
hit it again then it shoots horizontal

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
hit it again then it shoots horizontal
pattern<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.920> any<00:02:08.130> little<00:02:08.430> area

that you that you cannot get into with
the<00:02:10.200> standard<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.800> that's<00:02:10.979> unique<00:02:11.220> thing

and we've already hit it with some

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.100 
and we've already hit it with some
adhesion<00:03:17.740> promoter<00:03:18.100> now<00:03:18.370> typically<00:03:19.020> when<00:03:20.020> you

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
adhesion promoter now typically when you

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.900 
adhesion promoter now typically when you
use<00:03:20.200> vinyl<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.710> fabric<00:03:20.740> after<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.520> clean<00:03:21.760> it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
use vinyl and fabric after you clean it

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.430

that's really all you need because there

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.260 
that's really all you need because there
is<00:03:23.590> adhesion<00:03:23.890> promoter<00:03:24.370> built<00:03:24.700> in<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
is adhesion promoter built in to the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.750 
is adhesion promoter built in to the
paint<00:03:25.540> however<00:03:26.290> due<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.800> age<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.340> this

automobile we want to make sure that
that<00:03:29.980> paints<00:03:30.280> really<00:03:30.640> going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.850> stick<00:03:31.120> now

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
that paints really going to stick now

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.130 
that paints really going to stick now
we're<00:03:31.990> using<00:03:32.140> vinyl<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.800> fabric<00:03:33.090> because

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
we're using vinyl and fabric because

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.880 
we're using vinyl and fabric because
obviously<00:03:35.140> this<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.890> vinyl<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:37.530> also<00:03:38.530> because

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
obviously this is vinyl but also because

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.880 
obviously this is vinyl but also because
this<00:03:39.160> paint<00:03:39.490> is<00:03:40.020> flexible<00:03:41.020> it<00:03:41.230> won't<00:03:41.440> crack<00:03:41.710> or

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
this paint is flexible it won't crack or

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.230 
this paint is flexible it won't crack or
chip<00:03:41.920> with<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.460> expanding<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.120> contracting

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.930 
chip with the expanding and contracting
of<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.930> vinyl<00:03:44.290> here<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.680> also<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.610> UV

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
of the vinyl here and also it's UV

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.090 
of the vinyl here and also it's UV
resistant<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.930> it's<00:03:47.350> not<00:03:47.470> going<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.709> fade<00:03:47.920> in

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.960 

so<00:04:03.300> I'm<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.830> opposite<00:04:05.340> direction<00:04:05.400> on

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
so I'm going the opposite direction on

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.490 
so I'm going the opposite direction on
the<00:04:06.030> piece<00:04:06.330> just<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.780> can<00:04:06.959> make<00:04:07.110> sure<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.290> get

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
the piece just so I can make sure I get

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.860 
the piece just so I can make sure I get
all<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.830> cracks<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.670> crevices<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.239> may

vinyl fabric
vinyl<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:44.430> fabric<00:05:44.460> perfect<00:05:45.390> application<00:05:45.720> for

vinyl and fabric perfect application for

00:05:46.050 --> 00:06:08.040 
vinyl and fabric perfect application for
this<00:05:46.200> will<00:05:46.830> show<00:05:47.010> exactly<00:05:47.280> how<00:05:47.520> well<00:05:47.700> it<00:05:47.820> works

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.690 

all<00:06:08.560> right<00:06:08.650> brides<00:06:08.920> gonna<00:06:09.160> start<00:06:09.370> hitting<00:06:09.610> the

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
all right brides gonna start hitting the

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.520 
all right brides gonna start hitting the
fabric<00:06:10.150> first<00:06:10.420> because<00:06:10.720> the<00:06:10.810> fabric<00:06:11.200> is<00:06:11.320> gonna

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
fabric first because the fabric is gonna

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.920 
fabric first because the fabric is gonna
take<00:06:11.710> a<00:06:11.740> lot<00:06:11.980> more<00:06:12.180> than<00:06:13.180> what<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.450> vinyl<00:06:13.810> will

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
take a lot more than what the vinyl will

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.480 
take a lot more than what the vinyl will
because<00:06:14.230> it's<00:06:14.350> gonna<00:06:14.500> soak<00:06:14.800> in<00:06:15.070> so<00:06:15.340> we're

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
because it's gonna soak in so we're

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.190 
because it's gonna soak in so we're
really<00:06:15.670> gonna<00:06:15.850> hit<00:06:16.060> that<00:06:16.090> first<00:06:16.630> make<00:06:16.960> sure<00:06:16.990> we

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
really gonna hit that first make sure we

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.420 
really gonna hit that first make sure we
have<00:06:17.350> that<00:06:17.380> covered<00:06:17.890> then<00:06:18.010> we're<00:06:18.100> gonna<00:06:18.190> go

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
have that covered then we're gonna go

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.210 
have that covered then we're gonna go
around<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:19.210> vinyl<00:06:19.660> and<00:06:19.750> hit<00:06:19.960> that<00:06:20.160> yeah<00:06:21.160> you

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
around the vinyl and hit that yeah you

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.800 
around the vinyl and hit that yeah you
can<00:06:21.400> see<00:06:21.550> it<00:06:21.640> is<00:06:21.730> soaking<00:06:22.090> up<00:06:22.240> quite<00:06:22.510> a<00:06:22.540> bit

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
can see it is soaking up quite a bit

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.320 
can see it is soaking up quite a bit

as well because all the different fibers
in<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.520> fabric<00:06:28.260> with<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:29.290> danwon<00:06:29.560> nozzle

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
in the fabric with the danwon nozzle

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.320 
in the fabric with the danwon nozzle
like<00:06:30.160> I<00:06:30.310> showed<00:06:30.550> earlier<00:06:30.580> you<00:06:30.970> can<00:06:31.120> go<00:06:31.210> ahead

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
like I showed earlier you can go ahead

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.690 
like I showed earlier you can go ahead
and<00:06:31.450> switch<00:06:31.950> switch<00:06:32.950> it<00:06:33.130> vertical<00:06:33.610> to

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
and switch switch it vertical to

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.120 
and switch switch it vertical to
horizontal<00:06:34.560> to<00:06:35.560> get<00:06:35.680> all<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:35.860> different

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
horizontal to get all the different

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:51.420 
horizontal to get all the different
areas<00:06:36.370> of<00:06:36.430> five

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430
