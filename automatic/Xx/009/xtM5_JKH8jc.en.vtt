00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 always stir 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:21.299
 here it is 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.329
 stamp duty now 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.549
 since it boils 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.319
 let's lower the fire immediately 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.349
 let's put a medium fire 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.240
 we go around from time to time to mix everything 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.100
 so as not to let the mixture stick to the bottom of ours for the lovers 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.709
 let it cook for about 20 minutes 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.069

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.520
