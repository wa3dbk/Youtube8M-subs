what's<00:00:00.870> going<00:00:01.050> on<00:00:01.140> guys<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:02.040> just<00:00:02.550> let<00:00:02.669> the

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
what's going on guys so just let the

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.260 
what's going on guys so just let the
mechanics<00:00:03.240> not<00:00:03.389> too<00:00:03.570> long<00:00:03.750> ago<00:00:04.670> he<00:00:05.670> said<00:00:05.970> that

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
mechanics not too long ago he said that

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.509 
mechanics not too long ago he said that
he<00:00:06.480> felt<00:00:06.720> as<00:00:06.990> though<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.710> was<00:00:07.890> definitely

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
he felt as though it was definitely

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.080 
he felt as though it was definitely
inside<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.900> transmission<00:00:10.730> he<00:00:11.730> said<00:00:11.940> he's

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
inside the the transmission he said he's

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.490 
inside the the transmission he said he's
heard<00:00:12.389> something<00:00:12.750> like<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:12.960> before<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.380> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
heard something like this before in a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.290 
heard something like this before in a
larger<00:00:13.860> band<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.990> transmission<00:00:15.990> pump

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
larger band it was the transmission pump

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.000 
larger band it was the transmission pump
I'm<00:00:18.300> getting<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.810> solenoid<00:00:19.289> reading<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.800> my

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
I'm getting a solenoid reading on my

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.410 
I'm getting a solenoid reading on my
coats<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.699> i<00:00:20.730> don't<00:00:20.970> know<00:00:21.060> if<00:00:21.240> that's

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
coats so i don't know if that's

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.830 
coats so i don't know if that's
correlated<00:00:21.990> i<00:00:23.000> mean<00:00:24.000> i<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.330> mechanics

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
correlated i mean i know with mechanics

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.859 
correlated i mean i know with mechanics
and<00:00:25.170> some<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.439> them<00:00:25.619> are<00:00:25.910> kind<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.119> ashamed<00:00:27.720> he

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and some of them are kind of ashamed he

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.450 
and some of them are kind of ashamed he
can't<00:00:28.050> listen<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.890> they're<00:00:29.099> saying<00:00:29.130> but

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
can't listen to what they're saying but

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.479 
can't listen to what they're saying but
this<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.029> they<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:31.650> certified<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.099> all<00:00:32.369> that

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this one they are certified and all that

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
this one they are certified and all that
good<00:00:32.640> stuff<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.079> good

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
good stuff and they have really good

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200 
good stuff and they have really good
reviews<00:00:34.500> around<00:00:35.010> town<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.489> i<00:00:35.520> mean<00:00:35.820> i<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.000> i

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
reviews around town so i mean i think i

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.880 
reviews around town so i mean i think i
can<00:00:36.270> take<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.440> he<00:00:37.469> says<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.610> truth<00:00:39.890> at

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
can take what he says as as truth at

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.790 
can take what he says as as truth at
this<00:00:41.070> point<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:41.489> don't<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
this point I really don't know do like I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
this point I really don't know do like I
kind<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.460> had<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:45.210> head<00:00:45.510> where<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.809> was

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
kind of had it in my head where I was

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
kind of had it in my head where I was
like<00:00:45.989> well<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.469> otherwise<00:00:46.829> we'll<00:00:47.100> just

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
like well you know otherwise we'll just

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.090 
like well you know otherwise we'll just
keep<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> band<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.000> know<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.989> always<00:00:49.739> runs

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
keep the band you know it always runs

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.420 
keep the band you know it always runs
good<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.140> never<00:00:52.140> any<00:00:52.500> problems<00:00:52.770> why<00:00:53.190> worry

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
good and never any problems why worry

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
good and never any problems why worry
about<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> decent<00:00:54.149> thing<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.079> like

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
about the decent thing but now it's like

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.799 
about the decent thing but now it's like
it's<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:56.940> step<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.210> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it's just right back at step one in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.830 
it's just right back at step one in
terms<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.129> i<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.879> like

terms of what i want to do it's like

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.700 
terms of what i want to do it's like
he<00:01:02.410> quoted<00:01:02.920> me<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:04.120> about<00:01:04.510> 700<00:01:05.230> hours<00:01:05.290> labor

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
he quoted me for about 700 hours labor

the<00:01:17.140> transmission<00:01:17.890> pump<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.400> checked<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.450> food

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
the transmission pump I checked the food

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.640 
the transmission pump I checked the food
the<00:01:20.229> food<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.770> like<00:01:21.340> pink<00:01:21.820> no<00:01:22.240> flakes<00:01:22.660> no

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
the food is like pink no flakes no

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.859 
the food is like pink no flakes no
little<00:01:24.040> silver<00:01:24.400> flakes<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.940> in<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.600> fluid

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
little silver flakes and in the fluid

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.300 
little silver flakes and in the fluid
that<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.590> solved<00:01:26.950> from<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.130> two

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
that I that I solved from the two

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.790 
that I that I solved from the two
readings<00:01:27.550> I<00:01:27.790> did

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.670 

I<00:01:31.860> mean<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.110> like<00:01:34.110> I'm<00:01:34.260> driving<00:01:34.590> right

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
I mean it's just like I'm driving right

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.150 
I mean it's just like I'm driving right
now<00:01:34.940> right<00:01:35.940> there<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.690> it<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.010> you<00:01:38.010> know

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
now right there there it is you know

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.720 
now right there there it is you know
it's

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.350 

I<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:42.630> know

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.850 

I<00:01:45.480> really<00:01:46.260> don't<00:01:46.380> know<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.800> to<00:01:46.830> do

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.130 

I<00:01:51.920> mean<00:01:52.490> honestly<00:01:53.120> it<00:01:53.300> doesn't<00:01:53.510> it<00:01:54.080> doesn't

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
I mean honestly it doesn't it doesn't

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.990 
I mean honestly it doesn't it doesn't
shift<00:01:54.560> any<00:01:54.830> different<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.310> doesn't<00:01:55.340> do

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
shift any different it doesn't do

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.430 
shift any different it doesn't do
anything<00:01:56.300> different<00:01:56.750> like<00:01:56.870> it<00:01:56.990> doesn't<00:01:57.170> like

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
anything different like it doesn't like

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.040 
anything different like it doesn't like
stall<00:01:57.920> or<00:01:58.310> anything<00:01:58.670> at<00:01:58.790> all<00:01:58.910> it's<00:01:59.570> good<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.870> go

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
stall or anything at all it's good to go

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.260 
stall or anything at all it's good to go
just<00:02:00.260> big<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.680> noise<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.250> I'm<00:02:01.940> between<00:02:02.180> a

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
just big that noise so I'm between a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.530 
just big that noise so I'm between a
rock<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.890> hard<00:02:03.920> book<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.430> is<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.880> torque

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
rock and a hard book so it is the torque

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.600 
rock and a hard book so it is the torque
converter<00:02:05.870> what<00:02:06.560> i<00:02:06.590> understand<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.340> won't<00:02:07.430> do

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
converter what i understand it won't do

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.859 
converter what i understand it won't do
anything<00:02:07.790> bad<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.210> transmission<00:02:08.570> that

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
anything bad to the transmission that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.960 
anything bad to the transmission that
door<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.350> going<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.619> wine<00:02:10.220> until<00:02:10.460> it<00:02:10.729> just

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
door is going to wine until it just

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.450 
door is going to wine until it just
eventually<00:02:11.180> goes<00:02:11.600> out<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.920> i<00:02:12.950> mean<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:13.340> not

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
eventually goes out but i mean it's not

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.160 
eventually goes out but i mean it's not
one<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.760> those<00:02:13.940> things<00:02:14.240> where<00:02:14.510> if<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:14.990> don't

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
one of those things where if I don't

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.720 
one of those things where if I don't
change<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.500> right<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:16.550> not

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.929 
change it right now like it's not
damaging<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.480> transmission

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
damaging the transmission

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.230
