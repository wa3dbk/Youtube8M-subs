ADB<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.510> fastboot<00:00:57.800> that's<00:00:58.800> because<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.190> be

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
ADB and fastboot that's because to be

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
ADB and fastboot that's because to be
safe<00:00:59.609> you'll<00:01:00.149> need<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.329> make<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> backup<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
safe you'll need to make a backup of a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.290 
safe you'll need to make a backup of a
file<00:01:01.320> that's<00:01:01.350> already<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.250> system<00:01:02.579> it's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
file that's already on your system it's

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.479 
file that's already on your system it's
a<00:01:03.420> PID<00:01:03.750> file<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> easiest<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
a PID file so the easiest way to get a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
a PID file so the easiest way to get a
copy<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> use<00:01:06.570> adb<00:01:06.960> commands

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
copy of it would be to use adb commands

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.620 
copy of it would be to use adb commands
but<00:01:08.430> I've<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.610> those<00:01:08.760> commands<00:01:09.090> listed<00:01:09.570> out

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
