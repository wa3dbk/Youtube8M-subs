for use on a broadband service you

probably don't want to use it if you're

probably don't want to use it if you're
using<00:00:31.349> DSL<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.360> run<00:00:33.899> into<00:00:34.200> issues<00:00:34.350> if

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
using DSL you will run into issues if

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.420 
using DSL you will run into issues if
you<00:00:36.030> don't<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.570> sufficient<00:00:36.870> bandwidth<00:00:37.620> more

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you don't have sufficient bandwidth more

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.340 
you don't have sufficient bandwidth more
bandwidth<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> better<00:00:39.210> especially<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
bandwidth the better especially if you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.500 
bandwidth the better especially if you
have<00:00:41.510> like<00:00:42.510> devices<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.620> laptops<00:00:44.510> tablets

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
have like devices like laptops tablets

have like devices like laptops tablets
smartphones<00:00:46.410> anything<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.879> runs

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
smartphones anything that that runs

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
smartphones anything that that runs
using<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.280> high<00:00:50.489> bandwidth

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
using a high bandwidth

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.880 
using a high bandwidth
this<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.879> bandwidth<00:00:53.879> sensitive<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.710> you're

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this is bandwidth sensitive so if you're

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770 
this is bandwidth sensitive so if you're
streaming<00:00:56.190> something<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> TV<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
streaming something on the TV and you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.340 
streaming something on the TV and you
don't<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:59.370> router<00:00:59.969> that's<00:01:00.329> that's<00:01:00.989> smart

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
don't have a router that's that's smart

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.880 
don't have a router that's that's smart
enough<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> basically<00:01:02.449> differentiate<00:01:03.449> which

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
enough to basically differentiate which

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.179 
enough to basically differentiate which
which<00:01:05.240> devices<00:01:06.240> need<00:01:06.479> bandwidth<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.439> what

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
which devices need bandwidth at what

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.539 
which devices need bandwidth at what
times<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:09.060> you're<00:01:09.330> gonna<00:01:09.479> run<00:01:09.750> into<00:01:09.780> issues

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
times then you're gonna run into issues

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.020 
times then you're gonna run into issues
I'd<00:01:11.549> recommend<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.150> least<00:01:12.510> 20<00:01:13.140> byte<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
I'd recommend at least 20 byte to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.550 
I'd recommend at least 20 byte to
service<00:01:15.030> which<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> roadrunner<00:01:15.960> that's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
service which for a roadrunner that's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.080 
service which for a roadrunner that's
the<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.720> turbo<00:01:19.140> tier<00:01:19.650> which<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.130> pretty<00:01:20.850> much

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the the turbo tier which is pretty much

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.990 
the the turbo tier which is pretty much
a<00:01:21.150> middle<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> road<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:23.130> recommend

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
a middle of the road I would recommend

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
a middle of the road I would recommend
if<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.420> afford<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.290> higher<00:01:25.530> maybe<00:01:26.009> go

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
if you can afford it go higher maybe go

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
if you can afford it go higher maybe go
to<00:01:26.280> their<00:01:26.460> extreme<00:01:27.000> service<00:01:27.650> which<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to their extreme service which is a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.460 
to their extreme service which is a
thirty<00:01:29.159> by<00:01:29.369> five<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.450> first<00:01:30.990> tier

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
that offers the five megabyte upload

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.910 
that offers the five megabyte upload
that<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.630> price<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.259> service<00:01:37.590> actually

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that the price for that service actually

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.039 
that the price for that service actually
isn't<00:01:38.250> too<00:01:38.369> bad<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.909> only<00:01:39.000> about<00:01:39.479> ten<00:01:39.900> bucks

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
isn't too bad it's only about ten bucks

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
isn't too bad it's only about ten bucks
more<00:01:40.320> than<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.650> turbo<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.520> getting

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
more than the turbo and you're getting

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
more than the turbo and you're getting
quite<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.450> more<00:01:42.840> speed<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.500> both<00:01:43.799> ends<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
quite a bit more speed on both ends of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.030 
quite a bit more speed on both ends of
uploading<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> download<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.920> it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
uploading and download I think it's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.550 
uploading and download I think it's
worth<00:01:47.220> it

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
worth it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.700 
worth it
definitely<00:01:49.560> look<00:01:50.399> into<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:52.200> think

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
definitely look into that if you think

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
definitely look into that if you think
you're<00:01:53.070> gonna<00:01:53.220> go<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.610> something<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.030> this

cheap I purchased the maximum allowable

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.380 
cheap I purchased the maximum allowable
purchase<00:02:44.730> which<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.060> four<00:02:45.330> years<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.050> it's

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
purchase which is four years and it's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.910 
purchase which is four years and it's
estimated<00:02:48.470> probably<00:02:49.470> around<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.800> hundred

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920

bucks

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.840

basically breaks down to two dollars and
eight<00:02:57.450> cents<00:02:58.010> versus<00:02:59.010> forty<00:02:59.520> dollars<00:03:00.020> not

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
lag but maybe it away there's like a one

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.660

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
might throw you off I would recommend

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.380 
might throw you off I would recommend
once<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.850> week<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.330> reset<00:03:37.170> your<00:03:37.290> network

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
once a week that you reset your network

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.380 
once a week that you reset your network
after<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.959> while<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:42.450> does<00:03:42.810> get<00:03:43.140> kind<00:03:43.620> of

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
after a while this this does get kind of

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.449 
after a while this this does get kind of
kind<00:03:45.390> of<00:03:45.480> glitchy<00:03:45.830> so<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:46.860> would<00:03:47.340> reset<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.239> once

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
kind of glitchy so I would reset it once

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.460 
kind of glitchy so I would reset it once
every<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.820> two<00:03:50.850> weeks<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:52.019> thing<00:03:52.260> you'll

every one to two weeks one thing you'll

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.670 
every one to two weeks one thing you'll
notice<00:03:52.799> if<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:54.060> has<00:03:54.239> been<00:03:54.450> on<00:03:54.630> too<00:03:54.900> long<00:03:55.170> and

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
notice if this has been on too long and

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.720 
notice if this has been on too long and

this<00:05:41.970> device<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.659> fussy<00:05:43.590> when<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:43.949> comes<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:45.050> to

this device is fussy when it comes to to

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.680 
this device is fussy when it comes to to
your<00:05:46.229> network<00:05:46.590> stability<00:05:47.280> I<00:05:47.460> keep<00:05:48.300> saying

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
your network stability I keep saying

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.779 
your network stability I keep saying
that<00:05:48.930> because<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:50.610> really<00:05:51.889> it<00:05:52.889> really<00:05:52.919> can<00:05:53.580> be

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
that because it really it really can be

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.080 
that because it really it really can be
a<00:05:53.820> pain<00:05:54.150> yes<00:05:54.479> so<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.169> just<00:05:55.500> want<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.909> stand<00:05:56.909> on

a pain yes so you just want to stand on
top<00:05:57.389> of<00:05:57.720> your<00:05:58.440> network<00:05:59.159> so<00:05:59.550> I<00:05:59.880> think<00:05:59.940> it's

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330
