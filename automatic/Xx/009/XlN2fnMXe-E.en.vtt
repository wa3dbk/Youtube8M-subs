fascinating our world can be maybe you
could<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.619> an<00:00:22.710> explorer<00:00:23.100> too<00:00:23.900> hey<00:00:24.900> globey

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
could be an explorer too hey globey

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.550 
could be an explorer too hey globey
what's<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.660> got<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.840> new<00:00:27.990> brain<00:00:28.230> bender

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
what's that you got a new brain bender

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.359 
what's that you got a new brain bender
for<00:00:28.710> me<00:00:28.769> today<00:00:31.040> right<00:00:32.040> know<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
for me today right know what a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.530 
for me today right know what a
paleontologist<00:00:32.850> does<00:00:38.090> well<00:00:39.090> maybe<00:00:39.239> some<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
paleontologist does well maybe some of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
paleontologist does well maybe some of
you<00:00:39.750> already<00:00:39.899> know<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.649> here's<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> hint<00:00:41.190> for

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you already know but here's a hint for

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
you already know but here's a hint for
those<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> who<00:00:41.879> don't<00:00:42.620> paleontologists

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
those of you who don't paleontologists

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
those of you who don't paleontologists
dig<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> earth<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.789> learn<00:00:44.910> more<00:00:45.090> about<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
dig in the earth to learn more about the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.010 
dig in the earth to learn more about the
history<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> past<00:00:47.899> paleontologists<00:00:48.899> look

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
history of the past paleontologists look

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740 
history of the past paleontologists look
for<00:00:49.200> prehistoric<00:00:49.520> life-forms<00:00:50.520> before<00:00:51.329> human

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
for prehistoric life-forms before human

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
for prehistoric life-forms before human
history<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.920> dinosaurs<00:00:54.289> pretty<00:00:55.289> cool<00:00:55.500> job<00:00:55.680> -

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
history like dinosaurs pretty cool job -

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.580 
history like dinosaurs pretty cool job -
huh

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.190 

I<00:00:58.650> also<00:00:59.490> know<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.940> folks<00:01:00.150> at<00:01:00.330> NASA<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.840> giving

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
I also know the folks at NASA are giving

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.070 
I also know the folks at NASA are giving
paleontologists<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> lot<00:01:02.400> of<00:01:02.550> help<00:01:03.080> NASA

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
paleontologists a lot of help NASA

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
paleontologists a lot of help NASA
helping<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:04.980> underground<00:01:05.309> research<00:01:05.730> that's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
helping with underground research that's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.580 
helping with underground research that's
right<00:01:07.880> nASA<00:01:08.880> uses<00:01:09.150> many<00:01:09.510> tools<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.110> study<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
right nASA uses many tools to study and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
right nASA uses many tools to study and
look<00:01:10.680> at<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.890> earth<00:01:11.180> one<00:01:12.180> tool<00:01:12.390> remote

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
look at the earth one tool remote

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.660 
look at the earth one tool remote
sensing<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.800> be<00:01:13.890> used<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> help<00:01:14.220> find<00:01:14.520> where

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
sensing can be used to help find where

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.530 
sensing can be used to help find where
fossils<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.119> most<00:01:15.270> likely<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.660> be<00:01:17.540> remote

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
fossils are most likely to be remote

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.910 
fossils are most likely to be remote
sensing<00:01:18.930> allows<00:01:19.170> us<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> gather<00:01:19.680> information

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
sensing allows us to gather information

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.469 
sensing allows us to gather information
about<00:01:20.400> something<00:01:20.910> without<00:01:21.150> actually

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
about something without actually

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.170 
about something without actually
touching<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.080> object<00:01:22.369> these<00:01:23.369> remote<00:01:23.729> sensors

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
touching the object these remote sensors

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
touching the object these remote sensors
are<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.600> impressive<00:01:25.020> tools<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.860> did<00:01:25.979> you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
are very impressive tools but did you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.680 
are very impressive tools but did you
know<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:27.000> remote<00:01:27.270> sensors

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
know that you and I have remote sensors

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.830 
know that you and I have remote sensors
as<00:01:27.840> well<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.830> right<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.580> about<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> your

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
as well that's right think about it your

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.030 
as well that's right think about it your
eyes<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.320> at<00:01:34.440> something<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:34.920> get

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
eyes you can look at something and get

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.440 
eyes you can look at something and get
tons<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> information<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.360> without

tons of information about it without

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
tons of information about it without
even<00:01:36.690> touching<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.070> remote

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
even touching it now that's remote

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.570 
even touching it now that's remote
sensing<00:01:39.800> there<00:01:40.800> are<00:01:40.920> lots<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.250> different

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
sensing there are lots of different
