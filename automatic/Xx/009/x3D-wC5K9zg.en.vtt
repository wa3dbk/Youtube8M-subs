00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.440
 put a can to form look I already 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 I put it here in the container that already 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.920
 for the oven is now we go 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.920
 put the mino pasta 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.560
 put it all over a refractory 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.030
 It's cool to close up, okay? 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.229
 Every space has 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.229
 just gets stuffed 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.770
 it looks like O now I'm seeing with 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.830
 curd and we put a spoon 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.080
 inside each noodle also if it were 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.860
 a bad stuffing right? 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.899
 So stay that way he will not stay 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.210
 all right but no problem 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.300
 because after not it will melt 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.680
 so you just put it on top and caprice 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.680
 it is well stuffed 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.290
 now profession I put a little bit 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.030
 not because I love I think 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.300
 that will add a special touch 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.260
 You can put grass you want and 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.690
 Look, folks, I have 60 ml of water and 2 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.650
 beef broth is the one that we 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.950
 same 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.140
 You let him heat water backyards. 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.130
 melts here and now we'll think of 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.130
 top of the pasta 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.000
 this water that will make it 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:41.019
 even to end place 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.350
 enough to show her grated over 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.350
 all 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.020
 only this is the end result remembering 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.780
 that you can put what you 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.030
 they are attached together grated can 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.260
 put the corn in the corn makes the filling 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.790
 that you want 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:13.400
 now we'll cover with paper 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:15.620
 aluminum side and just put 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.520
 in the oven for 40 million 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.070
 we look at it here until it bubbles 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.600
 I just took it politely. 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.360
