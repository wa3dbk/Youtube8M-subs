because of its actual design but I still

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.370 
because of its actual design but I still
kind<00:06:03.470> of<00:06:03.560> think<00:06:03.620> that<00:06:04.330> 20<00:06:05.330> bucks<00:06:05.570> is<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.930> little

kind of think that 20 bucks is a little

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.990 
kind of think that 20 bucks is a little
bit<00:06:06.470> over<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.740> top<00:06:06.770> I<00:06:07.250> really<00:06:07.550> don't<00:06:07.640> think<00:06:07.760> it

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
bit over the top I really don't think it

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.750 
bit over the top I really don't think it
competes<00:06:08.420> with<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:09.050> GoPro<00:06:09.610> but<00:06:10.610> then<00:06:10.730> again
