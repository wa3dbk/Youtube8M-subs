60-minute timer and this particular one
also<00:00:24.119> has<00:00:24.510> convection<00:00:25.140> baking<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.769> you're<00:00:25.949> not

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
also has convection baking if you're not

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.670 
also has convection baking if you're not
familiar<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.730> convection<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:28.019> swirls<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
familiar with convection it swirls the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.890 
familiar with convection it swirls the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
to clean from the inside so we have

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.970 
to clean from the inside so we have
actually<00:00:55.649> taken<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.520> turned<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.120> in

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
actually taken this and turned it in

actually taken this and turned it in
into<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> water<00:00:59.370> tank<00:00:59.730> that's<00:00:59.910> removable<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
into a water tank that's removable so

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.330 
into a water tank that's removable so
you<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.050> pull<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.010> take<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you just pull this out you can take it

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.759 
you just pull this out you can take it
over<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.760> sink<00:01:03.030> wash<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.080> add<00:01:04.320> fresh

can have clean fresh water every single
time<00:01:10.040> another<00:01:11.040> important<00:01:11.760> feature<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
time another important feature of a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
time another important feature of a
great<00:01:12.780> cup<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.140> coffee<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.680> how<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> caught

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
great cup of coffee is how the caught

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
great cup of coffee is how the caught
how<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> water<00:01:15.030> touches<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> coffee<00:01:15.960> grinds

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
how the water touches the coffee grinds

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.249 
how the water touches the coffee grinds
so<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> Reebok<00:01:17.790> refined<00:01:18.450> showerhead

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so we have a Reebok refined showerhead

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.160 
so we have a Reebok refined showerhead
and<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.860> goes<00:01:20.009> into<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.369> flat<00:01:20.759> basket<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and it goes into a flat basket so you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
and it goes into a flat basket so you
can<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.590> perfect<00:01:22.950> disbursement<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
can get perfect disbursement of the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.170 
can get perfect disbursement of the
water<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.810> coffee<00:01:25.170> grinds<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.520> then

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
water on the coffee grinds and then

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
water on the coffee grinds and then
lastly<00:01:27.659> sometimes<00:01:28.590> when<00:01:28.799> you're<00:01:28.950> using<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.310> big

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
lastly sometimes when you're using a big

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.730 
lastly sometimes when you're using a big
pot<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.240> using<00:01:30.659> only<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.290> will<00:01:31.409> only<00:01:31.560> want

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pot for using only as you will only want

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.039 
pot for using only as you will only want
to<00:01:31.829> make<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> few<00:01:32.340> cups<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.729> coffee<00:01:33.049> it's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
to make a few cups of coffee it's

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.429 
to make a few cups of coffee it's
difficult<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> perfect<00:01:37.020> grind

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
difficult to get the the perfect grind

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.190 
difficult to get the the perfect grind
usually<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.400> little<00:01:38.640> bit<00:01:38.790> too<00:01:39.570> weak<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
usually it's a little bit too weak and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
usually it's a little bit too weak and
so<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:40.860> we've<00:01:40.979> done<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.340> we've<00:01:41.520> adjusted<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so what we've done is we've adjusted the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.710 
so what we've done is we've adjusted the
brew<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.840> brew<00:01:43.020> time<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> 1<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> 4<00:01:44.640> cup<00:01:44.939> so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
brew the brew time for a 1 to 4 cup so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359 
brew the brew time for a 1 to 4 cup so
that<00:01:45.960> way<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.140> still<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> perfect<00:01:47.220> cup<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
that way you still get a perfect cup of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.080 
that way you still get a perfect cup of
coffee<00:01:47.640> even<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.360> only<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:49.020> 2<00:01:49.229> cups

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
coffee even if you only want 2 cups

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.889 
coffee even if you only want 2 cups
