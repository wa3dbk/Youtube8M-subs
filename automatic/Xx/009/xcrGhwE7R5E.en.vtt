00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
about two seconds in the pan you give it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.319 
about two seconds in the pan you give it
a<00:00:57.960> fold<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.559> tongs<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.180> goes

a fold with your tongs and it goes

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.780 
a fold with your tongs and it goes
completely<00:01:00.540> under<00:01:01.199> once<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.250> sauce<00:01:02.489> gets

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
completely under once the sauce gets

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.100 
completely under once the sauce gets
down<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.269> fact<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.629> making<00:01:03.960> some

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
down to the fact that that's making some

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
down to the fact that that's making some
audio<00:01:04.500> disturbance<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.670> move<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.970> off<00:01:06.149> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
audio disturbance you move it off the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.200 
audio disturbance you move it off the
heat<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.619> ready<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.399> finish<00:01:08.549> mr.
