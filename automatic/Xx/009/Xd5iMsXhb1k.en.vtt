 I will make super peaceful I do not fight 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.209
 you are not going to fight then therefore it is not 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.580
 that we have learned that birds fight 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.800
 it does not work for them because of course and 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.510
 lately I have not fought anything 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.360

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.680

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.870
 I'm not going to do it or it's going to 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.770
 touching you we were about to not turn 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.140
 but already in the middle missing 30 seconds 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.270
 I felt you already delivered what are your 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.670
 Favorite fingers that you like to sing pop 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.850
 in English Spanish and ballads we can 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.610

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.420

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.170

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.270
 very nice and good this time I'm not going 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.610
 to discuss so much with my classmates 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.000
 the decision is yours arkham who you 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.000

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.760
 there is another 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:07.150

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.150
 Well, if I could not all of all 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.479
 my brother has helped me quite well 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.190
 it's worth it because look where I am now 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.110
 she will surprise you are not girls 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.389
 when I looked at my super pretty super chair 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.740
 sympathetic I think that with her we can be 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:07.930
 something different you were life is 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.449
