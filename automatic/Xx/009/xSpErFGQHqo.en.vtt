00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello to all welcome to the method 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.360
 mouth today we touched on a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.490
 subject of which too few people 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.840
 communicate and it's about dogs that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.580
 would be according to an American study 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.730
 published in the columns of new york 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.970
 times that dogs would also be 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.590
 people professor gregory bronn 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 room explains after studying 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.380
 scan for two years the brain of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 several dogs 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.090
 he concluded that dogs are also 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.800
 people 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.020
 the dogs would have the same level of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.770
 awareness and sensitivity that the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.040
 young children 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.920
 you imagine a little the same level of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.270
 aware that a child this study has 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.070
 been published 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 unfortunately unfortunately too little 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.210
 echo on this information though 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.980
 capital 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 dogs can feel 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.750
 emotions in the same way as the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.660
 humans to tell you about my shepherd 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.690
 my my gun hill and word and d in 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.739
 least a communication expert 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.090
 bodily and emotional in one of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.799
 my videos I recommended you 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.710
 to learn to dissect the expression 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.470
 physical of your dog remember I 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.530
 will just end up with a little advice 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 learn to observe and dissect d 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.390
 physical expression of your dog 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.509
 know that your animal as unique and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.490
 10 understand when we talk to them 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.170
 all mammals have 7 6 themes 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.259
 basic emotional that allows them to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.810
 react to the brain through the senses 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.450
 it's this system includes a system of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 search for fear of gambling the system of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.549
 care I explain the system of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.180
 research allows the animal to detect 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.000
 the food 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.220
 the system of fear to answer a 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.579
 unfamiliar event in order to anticipate 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.490
 avoid the danger the game system there 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.200
 acts on the stimulation and finally the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.540
 care system to manage 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.969
 raise offspring and form links 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.930
 when you communicate with 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.570
 your pet 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.110
 it is essential to capture his 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.680
 Warning 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.110
 but in what way 8 speak or 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.750
 use the simple words the technique 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.510
 communication that I established with 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.620
 guns allowed me to establish a complicity 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.900
 extraordinary 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.520
 hence the need to teach your 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.730
 bad advice to dissect the human body 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.780
 From the earliest age 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.430
 the use of the dog's name before a 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.910
 order is a spontaneous passion of the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.060
 prevent 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.730
 but know how to surprise her she is not 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.320
 the only one at your disposal you can 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.220
 enrich your resources like whistling 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.459
 the snap of the fingers 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.980
 the change of tone the dog is a 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.060
 to be alive and not to be treated 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.180
 in a routine 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.440
 he feels the need to question himself 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.090
 to learn to understand and you 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.959
 would encourage him he is currently living with 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.430
 an enthusiasm a little forced at the beginning 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.230
 when he has finished a desired act it is 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.630
 the repetition of a sequence 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.610
 of actions that will be used in the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.560
 learning sought during 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.200
 education we'll see in this 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.390
 following excerpt in a video where 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.120
 I gave two orders in pub that has 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.730
 little longer indeed I ordered with 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.900
 a sentence is a simple order but 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.610
 she wanted you 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.350
 give him a year 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.870
 it is natural of course but two 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.030
 orders at the same time that you searched 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.670
 all play yes okay but that did not 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.110
 the air is 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.010
 after we go home agree 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.959
 I'm going to look for angola 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.069
 where is the chain 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.069
 Natural suffered erects 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.680
 towards the price 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.680
 it's not thibault all that frankly 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.490
 there I am asked 2 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.480
 crossing 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.950
 are you pushing the door you found 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.440
 the two orders that were communicated 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.450
 at the same time gunn went to get his 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.540
 toy to the subjects whistle the end of the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.070
 part we told him when that was the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.680
 last time she went to get 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.370
 his toy despite order to return to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.640
 home 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.770
 she did not return immediately 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.050
 why since she is aware that 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.290
 our order must be given to be able to 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.660
 execute the first order 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.480
 what order is it it's about 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.820
 the order to cross a road in any 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.570
 security 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.280
 regular use of sentences 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.860
 equivalent will obviously help the dog 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.140
 identify them the coherence between the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.510
 posture the tone the words and the meaning of 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.480
 message fall sytral the understanding of 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.210
 your dog I will broadcast you a 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.220
 extract indicating hagen clearly in 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.540
 sign language what she does is 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.460
 not what I expected from her 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.930
 hence the importance of having a postion and 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.480
 of corporal punishment allowing for 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.220
 to release information that the animal 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.990
 will assimilate look carefully 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.990
 the physical expression that will follow 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.460
 a consistent posture with a 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.560
 accompaniment from China will allow you 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.020
 to help you convey a message 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.610
 that your high band will associate with the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.340
 contact to clear one 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.570
 meaning 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.160
 I will show you a name an example 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.530
 of feeling that I will convey 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.120
 hagen while she was in the yard 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.120
 quietly in his basket 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.090
 me 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.999
 this excerpt is short but enough 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:35.199
 speaking you saw I expressed a 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:37.729
 worry by face mimicry 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.770
 mouth is good barking and yet he 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.819
 there was no noise no passage a 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.249
 took advantage of the door 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:46.340
 a simple expression of the face was enough 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:48.379
 to make gun react you have it 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.860
 found of yourself you have it 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.180
 proof here gun despite my worry 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.099
 imaginary instrumentalized for this 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.870
 video she did not remain indifferent 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.150
 with respect to my limits to who you are 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.009
 sit misa see to detect it and 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.680
 understood without any difficulty my 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.719
 expression the dog and mauritius 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.879
 situations associates the concatenations 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.830
 then uses his benchmarks for 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.110
 anticipate events this is how 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.639
 is constituted rituals that become 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.270
 quickly real codes of 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.589
 communication between you and him 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.279
 observe your companion during 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:23.749
 interactions and respect those messages 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.460
 especially those of appeasement I 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:28.550
 take an example your dog is doing a 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.860
 stupidity you are about to reprimand him and 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.710
 the cros produced without saying anything 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.659
 either you see it adopted in a 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.520
 position of appeasing ears and that 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.949
 base tending to fold sometimes 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.550
 exploding his side or belly 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.689
 what are you doing there your dog express 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.300
 of appeasement 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.169
 they seek to stop the situation of 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.870
 reprimand 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.669
 in fact they answer to be too much 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.879
 messages like a puppy facing his mother 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.169
 the dialogue is then over in the 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:59.300
 case where you try to explain to your 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.310
 dog long he might forget 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.439
 the beginning of the ban ie 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.729
 the reason for the reprimand and to see each other 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.669
 overwhelmed by negative emotions 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:09.259
 is not recommended the memorization of 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:12.259
 the situation is then compromised 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:14.629
 the humor dog situations to 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:16.629
 this the sequences nothing has to be 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:19.180
 neglected in education 

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:21.680
 the dog misses him just the word 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.139
 companion do not judge us from us 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.539
 betray not looking at any moment of 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.600
 harm your satisfaction 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:30.810
 will be the stop 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.760
 we think of his actions yes our friends to 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.850
 four legs are also people 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.280
