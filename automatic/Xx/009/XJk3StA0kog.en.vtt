00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.190 

the<00:00:08.519> design<00:00:08.820> concept<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.510> Delta<00:00:09.780> Skydeck

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
the design concept of the Delta Skydeck

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.320 
the design concept of the Delta Skydeck
was<00:00:10.830> very<00:00:11.280> simple<00:00:11.730> actually

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
was very simple actually

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.600 
was very simple actually
we<00:00:12.719> wanted<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> give<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.830> different<00:00:13.980> look<00:00:14.219> a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
we wanted to give it a different look a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.250 
we wanted to give it a different look a
different<00:00:14.639> feel<00:00:15.240> create<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> different

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
different feel create a different

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.310 
different feel create a different
experience<00:00:17.390> we<00:00:18.390> were<00:00:18.510> first<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.990> foremost

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
experience we were first and foremost

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
experience we were first and foremost
thinking<00:00:19.619> about<00:00:19.830> comfort<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.490> function<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
thinking about comfort and function and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.480 
thinking about comfort and function and
then<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.289> thinking<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:22.769> how<00:00:23.430> do

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
then it was really thinking about how do

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.640 
then it was really thinking about how do
we<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.480> space<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.960> way<00:00:25.080> where<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> felt

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
we use the space in a way where it felt

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.480 
we use the space in a way where it felt
like<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.859> were<00:00:25.890> traveling<00:00:26.460> through

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
like you were traveling through

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.849 
like you were traveling through
something<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.420> opposed<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:27.930> ending<00:00:28.740> up

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
something as opposed to just ending up

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.510 
something as opposed to just ending up
in<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.580> kind<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.240> rectilinear<00:00:30.689> space<00:00:31.520> we

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
in this kind of rectilinear space we

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
in this kind of rectilinear space we
wanted<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.940> create<00:00:33.270> these<00:00:33.420> spaces<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.930> people

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
wanted to create these spaces so people

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.690 
wanted to create these spaces so people
could<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.590> social<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.430> they<00:00:35.520> could

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
could be social so that they could

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
could be social so that they could
actually<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> little<00:00:36.660> bit<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> private

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
actually have a little bit of private

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.150 
actually have a little bit of private
time<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.829> they<00:00:37.980> could<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.309> work<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
time or they could actually work and

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.100 
time or they could actually work and
then<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.280> would<00:00:41.460> mix<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.750> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110

to me we decided to work with sort of
shade<00:00:49.980> sales<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> concept<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.360> audience

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
shade sales or the concept of audience

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
shade sales or the concept of audience
and<00:00:52.199> when<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:52.980> first<00:00:53.160> started<00:00:53.520> really

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and when we first started really

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.459

branding and looking at that triangle

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.700 
branding and looking at that triangle
first<00:00:57.750> thing<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.050> thought<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.500> these

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710

exploring new materials when we were

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.810 
exploring new materials when we were
looking<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> wall<00:01:40.740> systems<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.430> had<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> few

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820

walls<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.420> wanted<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.930> bring<00:01:43.290> into<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
walls that we wanted to bring into the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
walls that we wanted to bring into the
space<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.399> kind<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> make<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.880> feel<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.479> though

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
space to kind of make it feel as though

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.109 
space to kind of make it feel as though
you're<00:01:46.020> being<00:01:46.229> protected<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.700> wanted<00:01:48.030> it

destination I think the traditional

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.680 
destination I think the traditional
Delta<00:02:24.250> concept<00:02:24.760> in<00:02:24.940> terms<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.270> what<00:02:25.510> they<00:02:25.630> were

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
Delta concept in terms of what they were

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.840 
Delta concept in terms of what they were
going<00:02:25.750> for<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.470> very<00:02:26.530> sophisticated<00:02:26.920> it's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
going for it's very sophisticated it's

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.900 
going for it's very sophisticated it's
about<00:02:28.210> convenience<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:29.260> about<00:02:29.500> comfort

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
about convenience it's about comfort

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.120 
about convenience it's about comfort
what<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.060> tried<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.630> do<00:02:31.810> was<00:02:32.080> translate<00:02:32.800> what

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
what I tried to do was translate what

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.710 
what I tried to do was translate what
they've<00:02:33.430> been<00:02:33.730> doing<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.270> what<00:02:34.390> makes<00:02:34.630> sense

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
they've been doing and what makes sense

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.630 
they've been doing and what makes sense
for<00:02:34.959> them<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.350> brand<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.890> their<00:02:36.070> colors<00:02:36.459> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
for them as a brand and their colors and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.140 
for them as a brand and their colors and
also<00:02:37.270> introduce<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.530> outdoors<00:02:39.150> we

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
also introduce that to the outdoors we

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.660 
also introduce that to the outdoors we
wanted<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.600> feel<00:02:40.690> natural<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:42.010> also<00:02:42.040> very

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
wanted it to feel natural but also very

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.280 
wanted it to feel natural but also very
modern<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.180> sophisticated<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.050> felt

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
modern and sophisticated so it felt

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.930 
modern and sophisticated so it felt
connected<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.860> airport<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.820> was

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
connected to the airport so it was

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.910 
connected to the airport so it was
really<00:02:46.330> about<00:02:46.540> melding<00:02:47.440> all<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.800> those

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
really about melding all of those

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.890 
really about melding all of those
different<00:02:48.370> ideas<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:49.120> connecting<00:02:49.630> all<00:02:49.720> those

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
different ideas and connecting all those

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.460 
different ideas and connecting all those
dots<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:51.270> think<00:02:52.270> it's<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.450> really<00:02:52.630> great<00:02:52.870> looking

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
dots I think it's a really great looking

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.870 
dots I think it's a really great looking
design<00:02:53.739> but<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:53.980> also<00:02:54.130> think<00:02:54.430> it's<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.700> great

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
design but I also think it's a great

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.330 
design but I also think it's a great
function
