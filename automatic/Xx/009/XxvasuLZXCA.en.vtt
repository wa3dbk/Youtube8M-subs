00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:17.980
 force of fear that I have, do not 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:21.810
 to see him tired of the death of everything in 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.810
 believe in a step the ears and mouth 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:31.540
 because half of me I scream 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:35.079
 but the other half to the silence that the 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:39.190
 music I hear so far is beautiful that 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:44.740
 sadness that the woman that obama is to 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:49.270
 always loved even if distant because 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.290
 half of my departure but the other 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.290
 half missed 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.310
 and the words that I speak are not 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.820
 heard as tracey emin 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.820
 fervor 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.759
 just respected 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.070
 as the only thing this is a man 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:17.740
 in a state of feelings because half 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:24.259
 from me what the u 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:26.179
 but the other half is my 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.520
 willingness to leave becomes 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:33.530
 calm and at Easter beauty and may this 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.909
 tension that eats me from the inside is 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:44.619
 where he is rewarded because half of me 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.619
 what do you think but the other half a volcano 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.340
 that the fear of loneliness moves away and that 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.380
 cohabited with myself became less 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.750
 unbearable that the mirror made in my 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.369
 Face a sweet smile that I remember 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.360
 having given up childhood because half of me 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.360
 I remember what I went 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.179
 the other half do not know 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.330
 that it takes no more than one 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:21.739
 simple joy and make the afternoon 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.640
 spirit and let your silence tell me 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.640
 increasingly 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.420
 because half of me is shelter but the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:37.400
 other half is tired castilhos point 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.500
 an answer even if she does not know is 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.740
 that no one will complicate because it is 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:49.310
 I take simplicity to make France 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.300
 because half of my audience and the other 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.300
 half to tired 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:02.560
 Rick, my madness be forgiven. 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:07.530
 because half of me love and the other 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.530
 also half
