00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
done this tire is a 50/50 so this side

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.050 
done this tire is a 50/50 so this side
is<00:02:06.659> coated<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> black<00:02:07.950> pearl<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.819> other

the Black Pearl to the Tiguan so let's

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.910 
the Black Pearl to the Tiguan so let's
see<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.819> results<00:03:30.299> now<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.439> decided<00:03:31.709> with
