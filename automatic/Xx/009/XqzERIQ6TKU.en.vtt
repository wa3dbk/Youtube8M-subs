00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.080
 hi i am 42 and if you want to know 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.080
 how to make these figurines this is a 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.710
 heart up chocolate chips 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.710
 keep watching this video 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.850
 ok for this we're going to need two 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.670
 plastic bags a spoon and one of 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.050
 these peaks that are like for bitumen for 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.970
 make it more beautiful and we will need 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.420
 chocolate good me here I have it 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.070
 ready for the bain-marie and good what 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.280
 next that I will explain is 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.770
 do this from the water bath expose water 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.570
 in one container and in another one over 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.070
 this chocolate and good we are going to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.070
 light the stove 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.160
 and good and slowly after barbie the 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.960
 water and it melts chocolates and we go 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 to wait until the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.270
 chocolate 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.940
 and well here and more or less my chocolate 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.060
 it's melting the truth I was 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.090
 bain-marie is made with a little 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.150
 slow but I'm mixing it like 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.850
 so that it melts sooner you can 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.280
 do this and supervising some 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.979
 good adult if you are small and arab 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.260
 or you can heat it in the microwave 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.920
 as we did in the scap pops but the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.320
 truth is good the two ways is very 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.940
 delayed 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.280
 but I recommend more to the water bath but 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.970
 if we say you can not use the stove 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.010
 for reasons I do not know why you can do it 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.250
 in the microwave but the truth is 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.490
 to put what the microwave say what 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.479
 you have to do for breaks because 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.660
 let's say it's very slow in the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.910
 microwave for example right now it's already 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.920
 a little more time that is more 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.070
 fast in a bain-marie but the microwave 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.150
 you have to put as we say more than 10 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.790
 minutes because it does not melt well 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.590
 good this chocolate can be 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.890
 any kind of chocolate but I 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.650
 I am using the chocolate that is used 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.819
 normally so for forest kitchen what 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.910
 you put and it melts and dries very fast 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.800
 that says 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.800
 and well, it's almost ready 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:43.110
 so good for the bags I put two 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.989
 bags of the same size only that is the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.810
 cut in half because let's say that 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.620
 we are going to occupy a smaller one we are going to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.620
 go turning off this 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.780
 for your breed class 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.090
 and well already after it melts 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.370
 We will put everything in full 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.849
 small bag 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.849
 Y 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.819
 and oh well in fact it's already 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.370
 and good here is our chocolate 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.799
 melted and we're going to put the institute 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.319
 before it gets hot and we're going to 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.100
 start making figures as well 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.510
 we would like 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.310
 ok ok I recorded it like I did it but 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.960
 Well, let's say, no, you're not 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.270
 recording and that 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.470
 and well I'm giving you the last 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.110
 touches 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.450
 and well we're going to do this on 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.660
 other plastic 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.400
 so that they are then cold and 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.970
 we can eat our figurines of 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.970
 chocolate 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.120
 and good when it comes to removing the fret 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.010
 with chocolate be very careful because 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.830
 the spoon as the fret will be 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.250
 super hot and also where you put 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.870
 is water and a lot of smoke coming out all 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.800
 the smoke that did not come out because it was 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.830
 covered and good I'm still waiting for them to dry 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.690
 since they arrive like fast chocolate and 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.780
 that could be done by these two figures of 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:22.940
 you can do many more laps 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.580
 of chocolate and sorry because I did not record 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.770
 how did you do you already know how we 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.780
 tells the truth of this little tip of 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.950
 metal is to be made as more 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.110
 faithful so it will be very nice 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.390
 because otherwise they will not be like that 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.600
 ball 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.260
 Well, that's how my little heart stays 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.860
 uy ready to eat 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.730
 and how rich and good if you achieve 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.440
 do this but better done to 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:56.300
 send me a photo you already know how to administer 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.629
 on facebook and twitter 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.150
 and well I'm already in the video and if I 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:04.280
 like such and subscribe is the 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.900
 first time they make the videos 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.360
 this is a very short video the truth 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.379
 it was just like an experience so that 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.080
 you may do it better than me and 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:17.840
 Well I send greetings to Leslie that the 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.699
 truth has supported us a lot of truth 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.419
 your comments the truth help me 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:27.080
 a lot and when you said you were my fan 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.509
 the truth and I admire my reward more 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.669
 in making videos and now I also send 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.809
 Greetings to a friend called Carlos 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.759
 he asked me to send greetings 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:41.210
 and good as promised is debt as they 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:44.029
 I said must say the 5 lies of the video 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.420
 previous of 25 with him about me I did not 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:49.630
 surprise that he writes it here 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:53.710
 the first lie is when I was little 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:56.080
 I had asthma I never took at 5 o'clock 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:01.690
 much in perfumes does not spend much in 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:04.980
 perfumes but the lie 12 I have had 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.980
 like 50 dollars 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:14.900
 3 and 16 I'm wrong saving money now yes 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.820
 saves a lot of money and as I told them 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.100
 that I made six lies the sixth lie 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.160
 that I added is how to keep my 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.390
 breathing then I can stay 10 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.170
 minutes without studying 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:33.050
 the expression tab something like that and good 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.050
 see you until the next video chat
