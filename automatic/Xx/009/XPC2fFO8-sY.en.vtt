00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
backwards skating backwards may seem

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.070 
backwards skating backwards may seem
like<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.650> very<00:00:14.400> simple<00:00:14.849> thing<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.870> one

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
like the very simple thing but it's one

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.570 
like the very simple thing but it's one
of<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> most<00:00:16.379> important<00:00:16.830> things<00:00:17.039> when<00:00:17.400> you're

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
of the most important things when you're

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.060 
of the most important things when you're
aggressive<00:00:18.000> inline<00:00:18.270> skating<00:00:18.859> most<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.980> your

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
aggressive inline skating most of your

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.740 
aggressive inline skating most of your
tricks<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:21.000> done<00:00:21.210> going

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
tricks are going to be done going

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
tricks are going to be done going
forwards<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.619> once<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.920> start<00:00:23.100> getting<00:00:23.430> in

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
forwards but once you start getting in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.830 
forwards but once you start getting in
the<00:00:23.699> upper<00:00:23.939> levels<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.300> skating<00:00:24.630> you're<00:00:24.720> going

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the upper levels of skating you're going

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.109 
the upper levels of skating you're going
to<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.230> using<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:26.310> backwards<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> lot<00:00:26.880> more

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
to be using going backwards a lot more

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.630 
to be using going backwards a lot more
to<00:00:27.269> your<00:00:27.359> advantage<00:00:27.570> whether<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.109> being

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
to your advantage whether it's being

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.859 
to your advantage whether it's being
grinding<00:00:29.640> whether<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.480> over<00:00:30.630> launch

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
grinding whether it's going over launch

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.359 
grinding whether it's going over launch
ramps<00:00:31.380> you're<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.920> need<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.219> utilize

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
ramps you're going to need to utilize

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700 
ramps you're going to need to utilize
both<00:00:32.969> directions<00:00:33.510> forward<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> backwards<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
both directions forward and backwards so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.630 
both directions forward and backwards so
that's<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> talk<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that's what I'm going to talk to you

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.479 
that's what I'm going to talk to you
about<00:00:35.730> today<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:37.739> thing<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.370> do

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
about today so the first thing to do

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.220 
about today so the first thing to do
when<00:00:38.670> anybody<00:00:39.030> starts<00:00:39.329> skating<00:00:39.600> backwards<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
when anybody starts skating backwards is

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.510 
when anybody starts skating backwards is
they<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:40.920> feet<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.430> going

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
they think that your feet are just going

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
they think that your feet are just going
to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.790> directly<00:00:42.860> directly<00:00:43.860> facing<00:00:44.280> backwards

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to be directly directly facing backwards

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
to be directly directly facing backwards
like<00:00:44.850> parallel<00:00:45.390> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> case<00:00:46.800> at

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
like parallel which is not the case at

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.350 
like parallel which is not the case at
all<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.370> first<00:00:47.579> thing<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.850> always<00:00:48.000> need<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
all the first thing you always need to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
all the first thing you always need to
remember<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:49.020> whatever<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.680> shoulder<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
remember is whatever your shoulder you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.650 
remember is whatever your shoulder you
choose<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.670> look<00:00:50.789> over<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.539> be

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
choose to look over and it can be

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.850 
choose to look over and it can be
whatever<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:52.350> people<00:00:52.590> throw<00:00:52.770> with

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
whatever one some people throw with

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.410 
whatever one some people throw with
their<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.190> arm<00:00:53.430> some<00:00:53.820> people<00:00:54.059> throw<00:00:54.210> their

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
their right arm some people throw their

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
their right arm some people throw their
left<00:00:54.629> arm<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.590> basically<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.280> whatever

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
left arm so you basically do whatever

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.990 
left arm so you basically do whatever
feels<00:00:56.910> comfortable<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.469> me<00:00:58.620> my<00:00:59.520> dominant

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
feels comfortable so for me my dominant

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.250 
feels comfortable so for me my dominant
shoulder<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.390> my<00:01:00.510> left<00:01:00.750> shoulder<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.109> look

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
shoulder is my left shoulder to look

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
shoulder is my left shoulder to look
over<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.550> only<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> look

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
over so not only are you going to look

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
over so not only are you going to look
over<00:01:03.809> your<00:01:03.960> left<00:01:03.989> shoulder<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:05.159> your<00:01:05.309> left

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
over your left shoulder but your left

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.340 
over your left shoulder but your left
your<00:01:05.939> left<00:01:06.119> leg<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.840> staggered<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
your left leg is going to be staggered a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.050 
your left leg is going to be staggered a
little<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.680> from<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.909> this

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
little bit from your right and what this

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.850 
little bit from your right and what this
does<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.780> allows<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.560> cover<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
does it allows you just to cover a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
does it allows you just to cover a
little<00:01:10.950> more<00:01:11.070> surface<00:01:11.939> area<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.810> you're<00:01:12.960> not

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
little more surface area so you're not

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.990 
little more surface area so you're not
just<00:01:13.260> parallel<00:01:13.650> covering<00:01:14.130> covering<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
just parallel covering covering a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.270 
just parallel covering covering a
smaller<00:01:15.240> distance<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.680> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
smaller distance so when you do that you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
smaller distance so when you do that you
just<00:01:17.490> open<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.909> your<00:01:18.000> shoulders<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.479> bit

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
just open up your shoulders a little bit

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.320 
just open up your shoulders a little bit
more<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> more<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.850> further

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
more you have more you can see further

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.080 
more you have more you can see further
behind<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.710> also<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.939> also

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
behind you and you also have you also

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
behind you and you also have you also
have<00:01:24.330> more<00:01:24.509> stability<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
have more stability so that that's the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.539 
have more stability so that that's the
right<00:01:26.549> thing<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> guess<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
right thing to do and so I guess the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.310 
right thing to do and so I guess the
next<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.150> next<00:01:30.360> point<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.689> basically<00:01:30.990> showing

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
next the next point is basically showing

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.039 
next the next point is basically showing
you<00:01:31.439> how<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.950> roll<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.840> like<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.990> said

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
you how you would roll and like I said

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.600 
you how you would roll and like I said
the<00:01:34.650> first<00:01:34.799> thing<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.070> you're<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> do

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the first thing that you're going to do

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.460 
the first thing that you're going to do
is<00:01:35.790> you're<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> stagger<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:36.960> feet<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
is you're going to stagger your feet and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.359 
is you're going to stagger your feet and
you're<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:37.860> over<00:01:37.979> your<00:01:38.189> dominant

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you're going to look over your dominant

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.090 
you're going to look over your dominant
shoulder<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.500> also<00:01:40.680> want<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> have

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
shoulder and and you also want to have

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.710 
shoulder and and you also want to have
your<00:01:41.220> knees<00:01:41.460> bent<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.759> little<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:42.180> obviously

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
your knees bent a little bit obviously

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.319 
your knees bent a little bit obviously
which<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> main<00:01:43.530> parts<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.460> I'm

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
which is one of the main parts so I'm

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.700 
which is one of the main parts so I'm
going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> start<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.170> roll<00:01:46.409> across

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
going to start here and just roll across

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.609 
going to start here and just roll across
as<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:48.180> I'm<00:01:48.450> looking<00:01:48.960> over<00:01:49.170> my<00:01:49.380> left

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
as you see I'm looking over my left

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.460 
as you see I'm looking over my left
shoulder<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:50.460> knees<00:01:50.970> slightly<00:01:51.270> bent<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
shoulder with knees slightly bent and I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.929 
shoulder with knees slightly bent and I
have<00:01:52.619> my<00:01:52.740> shoulders<00:01:53.130> open<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> direction

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
have my shoulders open to the direction

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.300 
have my shoulders open to the direction
I'm<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.439> everything<00:01:55.799> behind

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
I'm going so I can see everything behind

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.039 
I'm going so I can see everything behind
me

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
me

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.840 
me
okay<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.409> there's<00:01:58.590> many<00:01:58.740> mistakes<00:01:59.159> associated

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
okay so there's many mistakes associated

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.969 
okay so there's many mistakes associated
with<00:01:59.969> skating<00:02:00.180> backwards<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.899> many<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
with skating backwards and many of the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.639 
with skating backwards and many of the
things<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.759> even<00:02:03.329> pros<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:04.439> don't

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
things that I see even pros they don't

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.959 
things that I see even pros they don't
stagger<00:02:04.920> their<00:02:05.189> feet<00:02:05.430> when<00:02:05.610> they're<00:02:05.729> skating

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
stagger their feet when they're skating

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.760 
stagger their feet when they're skating
backwards<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> lose<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> lot<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.380> surface

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
backwards so you lose a lot of surface

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.070 
backwards so you lose a lot of surface
area<00:02:08.069> when<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> main<00:02:09.840> thing

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
area when you do that so the main thing

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.869 
area when you do that so the main thing
is<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.470> always<00:02:10.649> remember<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.310> always<00:02:11.700> want

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
is you always remember you always want

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.790 
is you always remember you always want
to<00:02:11.940> remember<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.480> one<00:02:12.720> foot<00:02:12.989> staggered

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to remember to have one foot staggered

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.930 
to remember to have one foot staggered
when<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.070> when<00:02:14.310> you're<00:02:14.460> skating<00:02:14.670> backwards

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
when you when you're skating backwards

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.820 
when you when you're skating backwards
like<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.660> you'll<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.290> happen<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.710> lot

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
like this you'll see this happen a lot

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.040 
like this you'll see this happen a lot
where<00:02:17.010> people<00:02:17.040> aren't<00:02:17.760> staggered<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.600> they

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
where people aren't staggered and they

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.540 
where people aren't staggered and they
look<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.410> they're<00:02:19.590> almost<00:02:19.740> there<00:02:20.340> almost

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
look like they're almost there almost

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.160 
look like they're almost there almost
struggling<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.300> see<00:02:21.450> where<00:02:21.630> they're<00:02:21.810> going

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
struggling to see where they're going

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.590 
struggling to see where they're going
and<00:02:22.320> just<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> little<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.250> balance<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:23.880> instead

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
and just a little off balance so instead

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.820 
and just a little off balance so instead
of<00:02:24.660> being<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.080> where<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.680> don't

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
of being like this where you don't

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.650 
of being like this where you don't
really<00:02:25.980> know<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.180> makes<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.450> lot<00:02:27.600> more

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
really know it just makes a lot more

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600 
really know it just makes a lot more
sense<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.590> open<00:02:28.770> up<00:02:29.010> your<00:02:29.130> stance<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.580> little

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
sense to open up your stance a little

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.760 
sense to open up your stance a little
bit<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.210> give<00:02:30.660> yourself<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> opportunity<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
bit and give yourself the opportunity to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.440 
bit and give yourself the opportunity to
see<00:02:31.860> fully<00:02:32.220> behind<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.820> which<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> what<00:02:33.300> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
see fully behind you which is what you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.160 
see fully behind you which is what you
do<00:02:33.600> when<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.930> when<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> stagger<00:02:34.650> your<00:02:34.920> stance

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
do when you when you stagger your stance

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.450 
do when you when you stagger your stance
another<00:02:37.170> common<00:02:37.560> mistake<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.980> most<00:02:38.100> people

so I'm just going to show you right now
the<00:03:36.540> tips<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.320> said<00:03:37.590> have<00:03:38.190> your<00:03:38.340> knees<00:03:38.490> bent

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
the tips I said have your knees bent

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.940 
the tips I said have your knees bent
your<00:03:39.120> legs<00:03:39.660> open<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.350> looking<00:03:40.650> over<00:03:40.740> your

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
your legs open and looking over your

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.860 
your legs open and looking over your
shoulder<00:03:41.340> which<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.180> basically<00:03:42.570> what<00:03:42.780> I'm

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
shoulder which is basically what I'm

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.830 
shoulder which is basically what I'm
doing<00:03:43.170> here<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:47.310> then<00:03:47.580> I'll<00:03:47.700> get<00:03:47.850> up<00:03:47.910> I'll<00:03:48.660> get

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
doing here and then I'll get up I'll get

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.740 
doing here and then I'll get up I'll get
up<00:03:48.959> here<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.200> drop<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.250> fake

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.390 

okay<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:56.380> just<00:03:56.740> as<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:56.950> was<00:03:57.070> saying<00:03:57.310> before

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
okay so just as I was saying before

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.610 
okay so just as I was saying before
you're<00:03:57.850> dealing<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.360> slight<00:03:59.320> grade

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
you're dealing with the slight grade

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.290 
you're dealing with the slight grade
here<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.100> it's<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.640> little<00:04:00.850> different<00:04:01.210> than

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
here so it's a little different than

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.330 
here so it's a little different than
just<00:04:01.450> doing<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.690> on<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.870> flat<00:04:02.110> ground<00:04:02.380> but<00:04:02.560> all

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
just doing it on the flat ground but all

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.610 
just doing it on the flat ground but all
the<00:04:03.550> same<00:04:03.730> all<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.480> same<00:04:04.660> steps<00:04:05.020> are<00:04:05.290> required

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
the same all the same steps are required

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.710 
the same all the same steps are required
to<00:04:05.800> do<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:07.120> first<00:04:07.390> I'm<00:04:07.570> going<00:04:07.660> to

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
to do this so first I'm going to

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.230 
to do this so first I'm going to
remember<00:04:07.990> stagger<00:04:08.860> my<00:04:09.100> feet<00:04:09.340> open<00:04:10.000> up<00:04:10.090> my

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
remember stagger my feet open up my

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.880 
remember stagger my feet open up my
shoulders<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:10.840> keep<00:04:10.960> my<00:04:11.110> knees<00:04:11.170> bent

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
shoulders and keep my knees bent

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.920 
shoulders and keep my knees bent
especially<00:04:12.700> because<00:04:13.030> now<00:04:13.300> you're<00:04:13.600> dealing

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
especially because now you're dealing

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.319 
especially because now you're dealing
with<00:04:14.050> a<00:04:14.080> bank<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.040> flat<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:16.030> you're<00:04:16.150> going<00:04:16.269> to

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
with a bank to a flat so you're going to

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.970 
with a bank to a flat so you're going to
need<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.690> have<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.870> little<00:04:17.140> absorption<00:04:17.769> rather

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
need to have a little absorption rather

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.060 
need to have a little absorption rather
than<00:04:18.160> just<00:04:18.459> be<00:04:18.579> straight<00:04:18.940> leg<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.180> pop<00:04:19.510> out<00:04:20.070> so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
than just be straight leg and pop out so

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.830 
than just be straight leg and pop out so
basically<00:04:21.430> what<00:04:21.670> you<00:04:21.790> do<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.090> drop<00:04:22.300> in<00:04:22.450> fakie

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
basically what you do to drop in fakie

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.200 
basically what you do to drop in fakie
you're<00:04:23.170> going<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.350> jump<00:04:23.670> open<00:04:24.670> up<00:04:24.910> your<00:04:25.030> legs

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
you're going to jump open up your legs

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:35.760 
you're going to jump open up your legs
and<00:04:25.450> open<00:04:25.660> up<00:04:25.720> your<00:04:25.870> shoulders<00:04:34.560> though<00:04:35.560> this

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
and open up your shoulders though this

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.350 
and open up your shoulders though this
seems<00:04:35.980> like<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.190> really<00:04:36.460> simple<00:04:36.940> step<00:04:37.180> in

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
seems like a really simple step in

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.720 
seems like a really simple step in
rollerblading<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.170> it's<00:04:38.770> very<00:04:38.920> important<00:04:39.640> no

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730
