00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello to all and all friends so 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.270
 it's my cakes at 60 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.290
 today we find ourselves for the new 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.250
 n aux-in regarding so then we're going 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.259
 call him I do not know how we're going 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.920
 to call it that's a kind of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.550
 articulated arms for the blue yeti that is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.830
 there then I will put the link of for 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.350
 buy it if you wish so it is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.240
 normally then excuse me he has he 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.359
 is on amazon here I bought on 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.099
 amazon and patricia were 80 bullets 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.079
 can the door costs did 89 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.640
 euros simply but I think that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.020
 if you buy it on the base at nuc is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.420
 so American or English 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.739
 it can be a little cheaper here 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.469
 that the euro is stronger than the dollar 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.450
 so regarding so I'm going to put 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.800
 just like that so regarding this 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.350
 apparatus so it's a kind of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.870
 articulated arms so it's the ps1 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.750
 the weapons studio which is really rather 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.910
 not bad and interesting frankly he 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.579
 me really is pretty good with the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.379
 saying a 360 degree rotation so that's 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.899
 rather not bad 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.939
 what do we have they lose up to 2 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.189
 kg here it reduces by 4% your decibels the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.229
 noise we have it's pretty good so 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.270
 we went around the owner 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.130
 simply because I propose 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.200
 we are going to unpack everything 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.070
 just here we'll go to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.470
 live unpacking 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.729
 so I tell you right now for the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.920
 unpacking just has them all from 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.159
 following the friends at once then a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.600
 friend so we find ourselves here 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.159
 regarding the other the unpacking same 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.090
 boxing of our famous ps has a studio 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 arms 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.259
 so it's a kind of little arm 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 articulated rats which is rather 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.380
 professional still that allows us 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.110
 so to get things 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.759
 interesting facts about the blue yeti 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490
 so I specify that it works surely 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.399
 with other other studio mics 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.170
 so I specify anyway I see 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.270
 as we are then I specify 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.270
 even though the cork 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.009
 if these endemics too much here see if it's 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.200
 this in any way the framework so the budget 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.590
 when I say friends it's one of the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.789
 micro m like that here it is perfect the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.769
 told him as I say I repeat it 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.030
 it's one of the studio's microwaves 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.340
 cheaper are the market today 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.769
 a job that is not expensive good I 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.110
 find point but it is not so 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.090
 excessive that that there is already a 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.150
 count of stuff for can not see the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.150
 friends that kind of articulated arms 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.620
 this is my kind of arm holder I 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:44.690
 think it will really be the heart of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:45.410
 the house as I like to say we at the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.410
 good franklin 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.269
 I tell you how to go 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:57.739
 So here we have an I do not know 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:03.620
 what does it really serve to bring out 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:09.250
 point here is a pair of screws so here 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.250
 so here what is good 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.800
 and shows you at the same time the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.190
 support 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:23.190
 tech so that's maybe its for 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.540
 put the blue yeti then you have to me this 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.210
 that I propose to you friends is that we 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.490
 can be found 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.420
 we have all the pieces you see that at 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.830
 the less they go not put a good 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.420
 Packing me what I propose to you 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.950
 friends is that we can meet 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.440
 right after where I'm going 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.920
 installed by the blue yeti on this 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.790
 apparatus 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.330
 oh yes I live then so friends so 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.390
 after several galley to be able to 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.440
 mount this thing 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.480
 here is psa microphone rod here after 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.700
 have it mounted there are some stuff that 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.880
 are useless because they were in 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.510
 the bus dedicated to the base so that I hope 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.970
 you see it well this is it and the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:13.010
 foot of course the small screens she is 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.010
 there is the host etc you go here 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.859
 quite simply 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.350
 so I did not do the editing at 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.680
 it's pretty complicated anyway 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.959
 say 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 but overall it's rather 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.800
 interesting 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.230
 you can see that it's pretty good 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.640
 after really after there of course lavier 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.360
 we could very well there was a 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.360
 another way 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.669
 that makes it our way actually fake 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.770
 with that thing that allows you to do 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.120
 a hole in your talent me 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.470
 sincerely it's wood 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.790
 so I do not have so much to make a hole 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.560
 of water at table and that everyone 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.880
 respect the mouth suddenly they have 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.850
 put a trick it's a kind of 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.190
 suckers that we stick and that we live 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.080
 it's the only thing that wants to go fast and 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.520
 strong to really see the end your mouth 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.100
 my voice welcome there that screen that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.360
 move and have it's pretty good but we 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.040
 can put it super or so it serves 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.330
 not to put a superhero because we 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.510
 will waste my time but for example there 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.340
 we can lower blue yeti like that and in 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.620
 lying there that you want more you see 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.660
 you play abf you play abf was 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.810
 quiet it's pretty good 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.350
 for example in tac bessin putting 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.760
 like that it can really give you 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.340
 rather interesting stuff but the real 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.719
 that it is not very useful for example 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.219
 joris do small live even for 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.499
 my videos it's really great 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.930
 that is to say that there I put you by 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:30.120

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.889

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:49.080
 where I'm going to get the stuff 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.449
 so good today we ended up 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.120
 so that was for the unboxing of this 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.319
 device simply 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.050

 can put a screw it's really 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.300
 great editing is pretty simple but 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.289
 it is true that it may seem a little 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.259
 complicated simply so I hope
