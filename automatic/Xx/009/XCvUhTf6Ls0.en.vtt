I've ever seen these shocks here guys
it's<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.350> one-piece<00:01:10.710> same<00:01:11.070> aelu-menium<00:01:11.930> system

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it's a one-piece same aelu-menium system

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.539 
it's a one-piece same aelu-menium system
and<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.260> actually<00:01:13.409> build<00:01:13.830> from<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> bottom

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and you actually build from the bottom

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.969 
and you actually build from the bottom
upwards<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.979> me<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.729> upside<00:01:18.299> down

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979

purely for competition you should I

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.699 
purely for competition you should I
wanted<00:03:12.989> something<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:14.269> was<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.480> reliable<00:03:16.230> I

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
wanted something that was a reliable I

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.670 
wanted something that was a reliable I
wanted<00:03:17.069> more<00:03:17.489> reliable<00:03:18.090> components<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.290> but

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
wanted more reliable components that but

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.589 
wanted more reliable components that but
same<00:03:20.069> back<00:03:21.000> home<00:03:21.150> with<00:03:21.299> hand<00:03:21.540> high<00:03:21.870> speeds<00:03:22.349> and

same back home with hand high speeds and

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.259 
same back home with hand high speeds and
and<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:26.400> purely<00:03:26.819> does<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.629> I've<00:03:28.440> I

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
and this purely does that in I've I

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.030 
and this purely does that in I've I
haven't<00:03:30.269> tested<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.780> properly<00:03:31.440> yet<00:03:31.709> because

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
haven't tested it properly yet because

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.949 
haven't tested it properly yet because
when<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> got<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.849> come<00:03:33.090> with<00:03:33.120> black<00:03:33.629> in

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
when I got it it come with black in

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.470 
when I got it it come with black in
Saudi<00:03:34.560> gret<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.040> grey<00:03:35.280> belt<00:03:35.579> on<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.909> back<00:03:36.120> there

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
Saudi gret a grey belt on the back there

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.800 
Saudi gret a grey belt on the back there
on<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.470> left<00:03:37.889> hand<00:03:38.130> side<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.180> was<00:03:39.540> for

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
on the left hand side and that was for

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.170 
on the left hand side and that was for
in<00:03:39.959> stock<00:03:40.769> motors<00:03:41.280> obviously<00:03:41.790> there's<00:03:42.000> some

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
in stock motors obviously there's some

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.940 
in stock motors obviously there's some
other<00:03:42.329> fire<00:03:42.660> motor<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.470> ripped<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.859> a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
other fire motor and it just ripped in a

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.339 
other fire motor and it just ripped in a
path<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:44.910> I've<00:03:45.030> got<00:03:45.209> I've<00:03:45.660> got<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.959> black<00:03:46.109> one

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
path so I've got I've got the black one

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.629 
path so I've got I've got the black one
in<00:03:46.470> there<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:48.319> did<00:03:49.319> have<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.500> radio<00:03:49.950> system<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.549> it

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
in there I did have a radio system in it

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.390 
in there I did have a radio system in it
but<00:03:50.819> since<00:03:51.150> their<00:03:51.419> name<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.930> took<00:03:52.889> that<00:03:53.069> out<00:03:53.129> and

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
but since their name I took that out and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400 
but since their name I took that out and
put<00:03:53.549> into<00:03:53.790> another<00:03:53.879> model<00:03:54.389> on<00:03:54.510> shoulder<00:03:55.109> so

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
put into another model on shoulder so

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.129 
put into another model on shoulder so
I'm<00:03:55.739> open<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.099> get<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.220> spectrum<00:03:56.900> system<00:03:57.900> into

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
I'm open to get a spectrum system into

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.039 
I'm open to get a spectrum system into
this<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.470> want<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.709> reliable<00:03:59.359> and<00:04:00.359> gigahertz

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
this I want to reliable and gigahertz

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.909 
this I want to reliable and gigahertz
system<00:04:01.799> in<00:04:01.919> this<00:04:02.099> because<00:04:02.430> if<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:03.660> goes<00:04:03.959> it

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
system in this because if it goes it

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.280 
system in this because if it goes it
goes<00:04:05.160> really<00:04:05.459> quick<00:04:05.879> nuts<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.329> see<00:04:06.540> us<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.019> will
