a<00:05:24.820> balanced<00:05:25.330> beer<00:05:25.750> I<00:05:25.930> wouldn't<00:05:26.290> say<00:05:26.530> it's<00:05:26.710> the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
a balanced beer I wouldn't say it's the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.950 
a balanced beer I wouldn't say it's the
most<00:05:26.890> balanced<00:05:27.729> West<00:05:27.970> Coast<00:05:28.240> IPA<00:05:28.450> I've<00:05:28.780> ever

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
most balanced West Coast IPA I've ever

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.040 
most balanced West Coast IPA I've ever
had<00:05:31.410> what<00:05:32.410> I<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:32.740> know<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.160> I<00:05:33.400> can't<00:05:34.090> say<00:05:34.360> that<00:05:34.390> I

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
had what I you know I I can't say that I

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.920 
had what I you know I I can't say that I
don't<00:05:35.290> enjoy<00:05:35.380> it<00:05:35.729> I've<00:05:36.729> had<00:05:37.000> better<00:05:37.060> IPAs<00:05:37.720> I

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
don't enjoy it I've had better IPAs I

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.600 
don't enjoy it I've had better IPAs I
think<00:05:38.140> green<00:05:38.410> flash<00:05:38.740> brewing<00:05:38.770> their<00:05:39.400> West

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
think green flash brewing their West

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.370 
think green flash brewing their West
Coast<00:05:39.669> IPA<00:05:39.940> kind<00:05:40.510> of<00:05:40.570> compete<00:05:40.840> with<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:41.169> one

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
Coast IPA kind of compete with this one

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.900 
Coast IPA kind of compete with this one
I<00:05:41.410> think<00:05:41.770> that<00:05:42.040> one<00:05:42.220> actually<00:05:42.370> is<00:05:42.640> a<00:05:42.669> little

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
I think that one actually is a little

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.719 
I think that one actually is a little
better<00:05:43.030> than<00:05:43.270> this<00:05:43.360> one<00:05:44.310> but<00:05:45.310> still<00:05:45.460> it's<00:05:45.669> an

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
better than this one but still it's an

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.220 
better than this one but still it's an
excellent<00:05:45.970> tasting<00:05:46.450> Russian<00:05:46.810> River<00:05:46.930> be

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.290 

I<00:05:49.290> think<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.310> balance<00:05:50.520> is<00:05:50.820> a<00:05:50.880> little<00:05:50.940> bit<00:05:51.180> off

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
I think the balance is a little bit off

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.960 
I think the balance is a little bit off
I'm<00:05:51.690> getting<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:52.050> lot<00:05:52.170> of<00:05:52.200> hop<00:05:52.500> bitterness<00:05:52.970> I'd

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
I'm getting a lot of hop bitterness I'd

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.020 
I'm getting a lot of hop bitterness I'd
look<00:05:54.270> a<00:05:54.300> little<00:05:54.930> bit<00:05:55.170> more<00:05:55.320> malt<00:05:55.710> in<00:05:56.010> there<00:05:56.910> to

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
look a little bit more malt in there to

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.160 
look a little bit more malt in there to
kind<00:05:57.150> of<00:05:57.270> balance<00:05:57.420> it<00:05:57.660> out<00:05:57.720> getting<00:05:58.050> some

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
kind of balance it out getting some

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.250 
kind of balance it out getting some
roast<00:05:58.560> roasty<00:05:59.430> roasted<00:06:00.360> malt<00:06:00.570> in<00:06:00.900> it<00:06:01.020> which

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
roast roasty roasted malt in it which

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.510 
roast roasty roasted malt in it which
not<00:06:02.190> a<00:06:02.220> huge<00:06:02.550> fan<00:06:02.850> of<00:06:02.910> an<00:06:03.240> IPAs<00:06:03.720> I<00:06:04.620> think<00:06:05.430> it's

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
not a huge fan of an IPAs I think it's

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.820 
not a huge fan of an IPAs I think it's
kind<00:06:05.640> of<00:06:05.730> a<00:06:05.850> weird<00:06:05.880> kind<00:06:06.780> of<00:06:06.990> taste<00:06:07.410> to<00:06:07.590> put<00:06:07.710> in

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
kind of a weird kind of taste to put in

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.190 
kind of a weird kind of taste to put in
there<00:06:08.030> but<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.150> yeast<00:06:09.360> definitely<00:06:09.900> drives

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
there but the yeast definitely drives

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.810 
there but the yeast definitely drives
the<00:06:10.410> hell<00:06:10.590> out<00:06:10.740> of<00:06:10.770> this<00:06:10.950> one<00:06:11.190> which<00:06:11.430> I<00:06:11.610> really

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
the hell out of this one which I really

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.790 
the hell out of this one which I really
like<00:06:12.120> some<00:06:12.540> people<00:06:12.810> don't<00:06:12.900> like<00:06:13.020> that<00:06:13.290> in<00:06:13.440> IPAs

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
like some people don't like that in IPAs

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.860 
like some people don't like that in IPAs
I<00:06:13.830> really<00:06:14.250> like<00:06:14.430> this<00:06:14.610> one<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:15.300> east<00:06:15.510> whatever
