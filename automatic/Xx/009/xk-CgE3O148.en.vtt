what<00:04:04.349> she<00:04:04.470> has<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.769> black<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.519> is<00:04:05.669> the<00:04:05.760> one

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
what she has is black so this is the one

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.420 
what she has is black so this is the one
I<00:04:06.060> got<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.599> you<00:04:07.049> just<00:04:07.200> minimize<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.919> shedding
