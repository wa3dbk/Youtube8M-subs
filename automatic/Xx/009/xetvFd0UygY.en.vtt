pieces<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.930> styrene<00:03:32.349> in<00:03:32.439> order<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.680> get<00:03:32.829> that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
pieces of styrene in order to get that

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.520 
pieces of styrene in order to get that
distance<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.090> on<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:34.720> Junction's<00:03:35.170> here<00:03:35.349> I'll

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
distance and on the Junction's here I'll

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.360 
distance and on the Junction's here I'll
just<00:03:35.650> cut<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.920> little<00:03:36.069> piece<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:38.069> strip<00:03:39.069> from

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
just cut a little piece of strip from

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.270 
just cut a little piece of strip from
some<00:03:39.579> scrap<00:03:39.760> styrene<00:03:40.299> and<00:03:40.799> then<00:03:41.799> I'll<00:03:42.129> just

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
some scrap styrene and then I'll just

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.220 
some scrap styrene and then I'll just
apply<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.909> back<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.599> glue<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.049> on

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
apply that to the back and glue that on

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.350 
apply that to the back and glue that on
in<00:03:44.530> place<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.370> works<00:03:45.610> really<00:03:45.879> great<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.299> the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
in place it works really great on the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.869 
in place it works really great on the
vertical<00:03:46.629> on<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.379> vertical<00:03:48.190> groove<00:03:48.459> section

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
vertical on the vertical groove section

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.280 
vertical on the vertical groove section
you<00:03:48.970> can't<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.299> tell<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:49.900> there's<00:03:50.200> a

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
you can't really tell that there's a

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.949 
you can't really tell that there's a
seam<00:03:50.470> too<00:03:50.680> much<00:03:50.890> on<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.849> flat<00:03:52.090> piece<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:52.810> can

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
seam too much on the flat piece you can

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.500 
seam too much on the flat piece you can
you<00:03:53.530> can<00:03:53.650> see<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.920> seam<00:03:54.099> a<00:03:54.370> little<00:03:54.549> better<00:03:54.970> but

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
you can see the seam a little better but

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.729 
you can see the seam a little better but
it's<00:03:55.900> not<00:03:56.079> going<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.260> matter<00:03:56.379> because<00:03:56.530> it's

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
it's not going to matter because it's

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.119 
it's not going to matter because it's
going<00:03:56.859> away<00:03:56.950> from<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.609> viewer<00:03:57.879> I<00:04:01.709> add<00:04:02.709> point

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
going away from the viewer I add point

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.190 
going away from the viewer I add point
one<00:04:03.310> two<00:04:03.519> five<00:04:03.549> by<00:04:04.000> point<00:04:04.299> one<00:04:04.450> two<00:04:04.629> five<00:04:04.659> stock

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
one two five by point one two five stock

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.589 
one two five by point one two five stock
all<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.560> way<00:04:05.769> around<00:04:06.099> this<00:04:06.549> building<00:04:06.970> to

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
all the way around this building to

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.940 
all the way around this building to
really<00:04:07.900> make<00:04:08.049> sure<00:04:08.079> nothing<00:04:08.590> warps

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
really make sure nothing warps

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.059 
really make sure nothing warps
especially<00:04:09.639> with<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.209> length<00:04:10.420> that<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.690> is

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
especially with the length that it is

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.860 
especially with the length that it is
it's<00:04:12.069> great<00:04:12.400> if<00:04:12.670> I<00:04:12.790> didn't<00:04:13.060> add<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.389> stock<00:04:13.690> it

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
it's great if I didn't add that stock it

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:38.439 
it's great if I didn't add that stock it
would<00:04:13.959> really<00:04:14.139> work<00:04:14.349> overtime

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:05:07.380 

you

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.450
