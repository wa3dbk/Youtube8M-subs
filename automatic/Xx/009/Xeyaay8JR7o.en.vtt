pretty<00:00:23.789> well<00:00:24.000> anyway<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.539> don't<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.930> it's

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
pretty well anyway so I don't think it's

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.929 
pretty well anyway so I don't think it's
a<00:00:25.140> matter<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.470> keeping<00:00:26.400> guys<00:00:26.699> fresh<00:00:28.880> you<00:00:29.880> know

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939

and so I think for from myself it's it's
just<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.090> whole<00:02:12.270> years<00:02:12.569> being<00:02:12.810> a

about what they've accomplished in

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.180 
about what they've accomplished in
making<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.950> playoffs<00:03:24.620> what<00:03:25.620> stands<00:03:25.950> out<00:03:26.130> to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
making the playoffs what stands out to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.080 
making the playoffs what stands out to
me<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:28.220> certain<00:03:29.220> times<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.549> look<00:03:29.730> at<00:03:29.850> teams

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
me is certain times you look at teams

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.660 
me is certain times you look at teams
and<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.290> they<00:03:31.500> win<00:03:31.709> games<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.310> they

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and you and they win games that they

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.259 
and you and they win games that they
probably<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.420> paper<00:03:33.720> shouldn't<00:03:34.200> win<00:03:34.610> just<00:03:35.610> the

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
probably on paper shouldn't win just the

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.090 
probably on paper shouldn't win just the
nature<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.690> schedule<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.260> how<00:03:37.860> they're

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
nature of the schedule just how they're

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.220 
nature of the schedule just how they're
playing<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:39.480> team<00:03:39.750> has<00:03:39.870> had<00:03:40.049> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
playing and this team has had the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.020 
playing and this team has had the
ability<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.829> win<00:03:40.980> games<00:03:41.280> where<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.730> think

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
ability to win games where you think

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.849 
ability to win games where you think
well<00:03:42.239> they're<00:03:42.450> not<00:03:42.630> they're<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.320> going<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
well they're not they're not going the

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.110 
well they're not they're not going the
right<00:03:43.980> way<00:03:44.040> right<00:03:44.430> now<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:44.790> going<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.940> be<00:03:45.090> a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
right way right now it's going to be a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.060 
right way right now it's going to be a
tough<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:46.200> think<00:03:46.410> whenever<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.799> have<00:03:47.010> a

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
tough and I think whenever you have a

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.979 
tough and I think whenever you have a
team<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.970> makes<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.690> little<00:03:48.840> bit

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
team like that it makes it a little bit

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.590 
team like that it makes it a little bit
special<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:50.880> think<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.239> team<00:03:51.420> has

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
special and so I think this team has

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.539 
special and so I think this team has
found<00:03:51.840> some<00:03:52.140> ways<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.500> find<00:03:52.709> win<00:03:53.220> some<00:03:53.430> big

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
found some ways to find win some big

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.819 
found some ways to find win some big
games<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.870> me<00:03:54.959> that's<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.260> real<00:03:55.470> good<00:03:55.500> sign

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
games and to me that's a real good sign

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.380 
games and to me that's a real good sign
on<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.130> team<00:03:56.280> when<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.549> look<00:03:56.700> back<00:03:56.730> at<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.150> it

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
on the team when you look back at it it

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.630 
on the team when you look back at it it
said<00:03:57.630> they<00:03:58.530> found<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:59.010> way<00:03:59.100> when<00:03:59.280> things<00:03:59.459> get

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
said they found a way when things get

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.509 
said they found a way when things get
tough<00:03:59.820> to<00:04:00.090> get<00:04:00.690> wind<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.769> found<00:04:02.040> ways<00:04:02.280> this

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
tough to get wind you found ways this

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.060 
tough to get wind you found ways this
season<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.030> win<00:04:03.150> on<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.329> road<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.989> all<00:04:04.739> mice

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
season to win on the road is all mice

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.120 
season to win on the road is all mice
advantage<00:04:05.760> as<00:04:06.090> important<00:04:07.079> then<00:04:07.320> with

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
advantage as important then with

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.150 
advantage as important then with
considering<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.760> success<00:04:09.420> on<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.630> road<00:04:10.160> I

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
considering you success on the road I

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.030 
considering you success on the road I
don't<00:04:12.060> know<00:04:12.150> if<00:04:12.269> it's<00:04:12.420> as<00:04:12.890> important<00:04:13.890> because

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
don't know if it's as important because

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.390 
don't know if it's as important because
of<00:04:14.220> our<00:04:14.400> road<00:04:15.030> record<00:04:15.799> but<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.829> know<00:04:16.979> I'd<00:04:17.190> rather

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
of our road record but I know I'd rather

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.699 
of our road record but I know I'd rather
open<00:04:17.820> up<00:04:17.970> at<00:04:18.150> home<00:04:18.329> like<00:04:18.570> if<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.840> if<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.350> person

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
open up at home like if you if a person

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.520 
open up at home like if you if a person
could<00:04:19.799> ever<00:04:19.859> get<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.280> opportunity<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:21.500> but<00:04:22.500> I

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
could ever get that opportunity so but I

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.080 
could ever get that opportunity so but I
do<00:04:22.680> think<00:04:22.979> that<00:04:23.099> we're<00:04:23.400> probably<00:04:23.640> just<00:04:23.820> as

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
do think that we're probably just as

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.200 
do think that we're probably just as
comfortable<00:04:24.360> playing<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.050> road
