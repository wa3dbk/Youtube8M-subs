00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
available for that car will be the

6-speed automatic transmission but the

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.410 
6-speed automatic transmission but the
cool<00:02:51.040> fact<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:51.700> got<00:02:51.849> a<00:02:51.879> manual<00:02:52.390> shift

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
cool fact is that you got a manual shift

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.690 
cool fact is that you got a manual shift
control<00:02:53.079> which<00:02:53.650> just<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.099> case<00:02:54.280> you're<00:02:54.430> towing

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
all-wheel drive when and when we're

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.960 
all-wheel drive when and when we're
talking<00:03:15.690> about<00:03:15.900> economy<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:17.430> really<00:03:17.670> doesn't

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
talking about economy it really doesn't

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.520 
talking about economy it really doesn't
make<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.090> big<00:03:18.360> difference<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.840> between<00:03:18.960> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
make a big difference in between the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.260 
make a big difference in between the
front<00:03:19.800> or<00:03:19.950> all-wheel<00:03:19.980> drive<00:03:20.610> when<00:03:21.180> you're

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
front or all-wheel drive when you're

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.760 
front or all-wheel drive when you're
talking<00:03:21.540> about<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.870> all-wheel<00:03:22.080> drive<00:03:22.530> you're

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
talking about the all-wheel drive you're

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.170 
talking about the all-wheel drive you're
talking<00:03:22.980> about<00:03:23.070> 18<00:03:23.520> miles<00:03:23.700> per<00:03:23.820> gallon

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
talking about 18 miles per gallon

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.880 
talking about 18 miles per gallon
combining<00:03:24.690> City<00:03:24.960> and<00:03:25.140> highway<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.710> when<00:03:25.830> you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
combining City and highway and when you

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.620 
combining City and highway and when you
talk<00:03:26.040> about<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.340> front-wheel<00:03:26.730> drive<00:03:26.760> we're

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
talk about the front-wheel drive we're

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.480 
talk about the front-wheel drive we're
looking<00:03:27.930> at<00:03:28.020> 19<00:03:28.410> miles<00:03:28.620> per<00:03:28.770> gallon<00:03:29.130> combined

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
looking at 19 miles per gallon combined

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.220 
looking at 19 miles per gallon combined
so<00:03:29.940> it's<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.240> not<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.480> big<00:03:30.690> difference<00:03:30.870> in

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
so it's really not a big difference in

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.540 
so it's really not a big difference in
between<00:03:31.350> all<00:03:31.620> wheel<00:03:31.770> drive<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.190> front-wheel

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
between all wheel drive and front-wheel

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:45.410 
between all wheel drive and front-wheel
drive<00:03:43.280> when<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.400> talk<00:03:44.580> about<00:03:44.700> safety<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.300> the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420
