00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.299
 for me the quality of which the first 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.430
 quality although this is not for me a 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.980
 fundamental criterion despite all that 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.270
 strikes and in use because 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.949
 I have a gérard guitar that is not 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.109
 this one is a model of concerts 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.110
 that's a study model 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:24.410
 it was the power the projection then 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.600
 there is a real happiness example 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.390
 the anecdote I can tell is that 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.830
 good this principle of having the return in 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.480
 ears 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.180
 the fault is that the night in the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.989
 silence and sometimes sometimes I have 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.640
 almost too much where going when I give 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.800
 when I'm with my students 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.510
 condé small guitar not well they 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.089
 know not projected the are finally I 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.760
 do not take the gérard guitar that I 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.229
 am obliged to suzhou and what I 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.649
 so the crush is so frustrating 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:57.229
 I take my normal standard guitar 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.510
 so that's for the default which is a 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.889
 quality at the same time the anecdote that 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.629
 I want to tell is that as soon as 

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:05.120
 I play with another instrumentalists 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.850
 they can violin flute flute 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.960
 accordionist cross always I'm 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.909
 meaning crushed there are two solutions to that or 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.000
 I take an amp the problem is solved 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.340
 or finally I start playing more 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.490
 strong has tense all this and my game is 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.409
 degraded then with that guitar I 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.030
 not at all that much more than I have 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.280
 a ride the incredible impression that is 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.590
 a real happiness is that as are 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.390
 partially restored by the lesson of 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.189
 the other instrumentalists get into my 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.600
 guitar and spring by there and mix 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.969
 already mixed is much more very 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.840
 nice feeling and suddenly I 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.130
 can play and I want earth 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.689
 normally when I play with a duo that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.070
 it's a thing 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:55.429
 the other thing aubin the winged who them 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.789
 problems of two stamps that's more 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:04.789
 a matter of taste I like the 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:07.429
 stamp by some sides he and he is 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:12.200
 rather hard enough in the game I find 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.540
 that's personal in the islands and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.600
 net inflows 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.470
 I find and for all of a bunch of 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:26.570
 music is really great here I 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.130
 think that otherwise playability just everything 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.510
 it looks good it may seem 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.610
 weird but I like it's true 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.120
 that it's a bit iconoclastic as a way 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.540
 but I'm for the attempts and 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.800
 I find it rather successful the good bin 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.660
 head it's been a long time since 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.380
 experienced is what I think 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.630
 it's a success 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.310
 then I think that there is unanimous 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.250
 on sabin the classical guitarists 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.450
 are a little more disturbed by her that's me 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.220
 do not bother me I like it 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.780
 contrary especially since ben there it is 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.080
 great because it's a little cut 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.330
 without being one so that's twenty on 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.100
 twenty seven stories 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.380
 I like the fact that a rosette is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.150
 true it's beautiful but it's true that 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:14.080
 without rose associates with an aesthetic side 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:18.890
 and the plain is full of us 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.690
 how's going and the guitar cd from high of 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.170
 range the giant tell me even the guitars 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.320
 study 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.610
 finally quite to my eyes 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.840
 for me this same concert guitar 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.840
 if the men's banks study sting
