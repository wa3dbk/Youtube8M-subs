00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to see visually what they look like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.960 
to see visually what they look like
side-by-side<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> pedal<00:01:35.130> trimco<00:01:35.340> isn't

side-by-side the pedal trimco isn't

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.539 
side-by-side the pedal trimco isn't
actually<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:37.890> much<00:01:38.280> bigger<00:01:40.100> height<00:01:41.100> wise

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
actually that much bigger height wise

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.760 
actually that much bigger height wise
it's<00:01:41.909> about<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.360> big<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> pedal<00:01:43.049> train<00:01:43.259> 3

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it's about as big as the pedal train 3

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.060 
it's about as big as the pedal train 3
and<00:01:44.540> it's<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.290> wider<00:01:46.740> than

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and it's just a little bit wider than

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.410 
and it's just a little bit wider than
the<00:01:47.100> pedal<00:01:47.610> train<00:01:47.850> 3<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.860> um<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:51.210> still

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the pedal train 3 so um I'm still

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.850 
the pedal train 3 so um I'm still
debating<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.140> actually<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.829> it

really<00:02:02.399> couldn't<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:02.790> past<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.240> deal<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.719> even

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
really couldn't go past the deal up even

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.050 
really couldn't go past the deal up even
if<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.409> don't<00:02:05.100> end<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.399> using<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.759> I'll<00:02:05.909> probably

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
if I don't end up using it I'll probably

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.719 
if I don't end up using it I'll probably
end<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.890> using<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> pedal<00:02:08.310> board<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
end up just using the pedal board and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.510 
end up just using the pedal board and
you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.420> keeping<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> hardshell<00:02:10.289> case<00:02:10.560> for

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
you know keeping the hardshell case for

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.510 
you know keeping the hardshell case for
something<00:02:11.790> else

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
something else

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.360 
something else
but<00:02:12.670> as<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.840> see<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> fair<00:02:15.250> amount

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
but as you can see it is a fair amount

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.750 
but as you can see it is a fair amount
bigger<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.650> backside<00:02:18.190> kind<00:02:18.670> of

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
bigger this is a backside kind of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.760 
bigger this is a backside kind of
showing<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.270> wiring<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.140> did<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.790> looks<00:02:21.790> pretty

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
showing the wiring I did I looks pretty

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.040 
showing the wiring I did I looks pretty
it<00:02:23.770> looks<00:02:23.950> decent<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:24.640> nothing<00:02:25.030> too<00:02:25.420> crazy<00:02:25.630> I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
it looks decent it's nothing too crazy I

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.410 
it looks decent it's nothing too crazy I
try<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.740> keep<00:02:26.890> my<00:02:27.010> cables<00:02:27.490> somewhat<00:02:28.360> tidy<00:02:28.690> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
try to keep my cables somewhat tidy and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.640 
try to keep my cables somewhat tidy and
that's<00:02:31.420> one<00:02:31.630> thing<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:31.930> don't<00:02:32.140> really<00:02:32.320> want<00:02:32.560> to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
that's one thing I don't really want to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.500 
that's one thing I don't really want to
do<00:02:32.830> if<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.190> do<00:02:33.250> switch<00:02:33.640> over<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.090> pro<00:02:34.270> is

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
do if I do switch over to the pro is

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.750 
do if I do switch over to the pro is
having<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:35.080> probably<00:02:35.980> put<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.250> another<00:02:36.550> voodoo

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
having to probably put in another voodoo

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.200 
having to probably put in another voodoo
lab<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.450> then<00:02:37.810> rewire<00:02:38.260> again<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.070> now<00:02:39.910> here

is a the pedal train to softshell case

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.740 
is a the pedal train to softshell case

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
beside the pedal train Pro hardshell

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.920 
beside the pedal train Pro hardshell
case<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.320> as<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.310> see<00:02:48.520> there's<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:49.060> huge

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
case and as you can see there's a huge

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.740 
case and as you can see there's a huge
difference<00:02:50.580> I've<00:02:51.580> never<00:02:51.880> actually<00:02:52.090> seen<00:02:52.300> the

difference I've never actually seen the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.720 
difference I've never actually seen the
soft<00:02:53.110> shell<00:02:53.290> case<00:02:53.530> but<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> point<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
soft shell case but a point for the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.220 
soft shell case but a point for the
federal<00:02:55.060> trade<00:02:55.210> and<00:02:55.360> pro<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.780> can't<00:02:56.080> really

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
federal trade and pro so I can't really

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.390 
federal trade and pro so I can't really
comment<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.210> but<00:02:58.210> as<00:02:58.480> far<00:02:58.510> as<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.950> soft

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
comment on that but as far as the soft

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.970 
comment on that but as far as the soft

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
in and kind of do a weight comparison as

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.800 
in and kind of do a weight comparison as
well<00:04:45.690> between<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:47.400> soft<00:04:48.030> shell<00:04:48.240> case<00:04:48.570> of<00:04:48.750> the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
well between the soft shell case of the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.770 
well between the soft shell case of the
pedal<00:04:49.080> chain<00:04:49.110> -<00:04:49.500> fully<00:04:49.980> loaded<00:04:50.510> versus<00:04:51.510> an

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
pedal chain - fully loaded versus an

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.920 
pedal chain - fully loaded versus an
empty<00:04:52.700> pedal<00:04:53.700> chain<00:04:53.730> so<00:04:54.240> in<00:04:54.420> a<00:04:54.450> hard<00:04:54.690> shell

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
empty pedal chain so in a hard shell

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.380 
empty pedal chain so in a hard shell
case<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.790> him<00:04:56.790> can<00:04:57.600> zip<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:58.020> up<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:58.820> I<00:04:59.820> mean

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
case so him can zip it up and I mean

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.570 
case so him can zip it up and I mean
I've<00:05:00.630> been<00:05:00.750> using<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.560> pedal<00:05:01.830> train<00:05:02.040> -<00:05:02.280> pedal

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
I've been using the pedal train - pedal

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.270 
I've been using the pedal train - pedal
board<00:05:02.790> now<00:05:02.970> for<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.360> couple<00:05:03.900> months<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:04.410> it's

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
board now for a couple months so it's

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.300 
board now for a couple months so it's
still<00:05:05.490> fairly<00:05:05.760> new<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.180> me<00:05:06.330> but<00:05:07.040> now<00:05:08.040> I<00:05:08.070> can

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
still fairly new to me but now I can

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.110 
still fairly new to me but now I can
still<00:05:08.520> make<00:05:08.880> make<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.980> to<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.010> bad<00:05:11.430> package<00:05:11.880> in

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
still make make it to a bad package in

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.180 
still make make it to a bad package in
one<00:05:12.420> trip<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:12.960> if<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.290> did<00:05:13.470> switch<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:13.890> pedal

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
one trip so if I did switch to a pedal

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.800 
one trip so if I did switch to a pedal
turn<00:05:14.310> pro<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:14.580> definitely<00:05:15.000> have<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.210> take<00:05:15.570> two

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
turn pro I definitely have to take two

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.240 
turn pro I definitely have to take two
trips<00:05:16.190> two<00:05:17.190> trips<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.790> car<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:19.560> as<00:05:20.040> you

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
trips two trips to the car but as you

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.100 
trips two trips to the car but as you
can<00:05:20.340> see<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.730> is<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.090> pedal<00:05:21.330> train<00:05:21.750> Pro<00:05:22.290> and

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
can see this is the pedal train Pro and

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.200 
can see this is the pedal train Pro and
with<00:05:25.110> with<00:05:25.680> nothing<00:05:26.430> in<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:26.610> except<00:05:27.000> for<00:05:27.150> the
