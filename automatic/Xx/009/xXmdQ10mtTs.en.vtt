00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.970 
get the update going as you can see here
if<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.299> do<00:02:51.540> probably<00:02:51.870> had<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.019> copter<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
if you do probably had a copter just a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.650 
if you do probably had a copter just a
few<00:02:53.190> meters<00:02:53.400> above<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.640> water<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.540> your

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
few meters above the water then your

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.759 
few meters above the water then your
teammate<00:02:54.989> would<00:02:55.139> be<00:02:55.260> able<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.620> a

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
teammate would be able to get a

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.650 
teammate would be able to get a
helicopter<00:02:55.920> us<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> see<00:02:56.579> there<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.630> is

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
helicopter us to see there but that is

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.180 
helicopter us to see there but that is
only<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.170> lift<00:02:58.349> at<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.470> helicopter<00:02:58.739> just

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
only if you lift at the helicopter just

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.500 
only if you lift at the helicopter just
above<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.519> water<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.970> they<00:03:00.060> press<00:03:00.269> white

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
above the water and they press white

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.509 
above the water and they press white
again<00:03:00.840> or<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.440> believe<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.859> triangle<00:03:02.310> for

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
again or I believe is triangle for

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.240 
again or I believe is triangle for
PlayStation<00:03:03.000> 3<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> said<00:03:04.799> if<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.069> do

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
PlayStation 3 but like I said if you do

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.680 
PlayStation 3 but like I said if you do
Park<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.700> inside<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.090> water<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.510> float

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
Park it inside the water and just float

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.870 
Park it inside the water and just float
it<00:03:07.019> around<00:03:07.290> no<00:03:07.859> one<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.190> get<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:08.700> they

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
it around no one can get in it and they

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.640 
it around no one can get in it and they
have<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.060> higher<00:03:09.329> chance<00:03:09.359> of<00:03:09.750> dying<00:03:09.989> just

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
have a higher chance of dying just

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.110 
have a higher chance of dying just
because<00:03:10.859> you<00:03:11.069> keep<00:03:11.280> getting<00:03:11.459> your<00:03:11.639> helicopter

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
because you keep getting your helicopter

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240 
because you keep getting your helicopter
into<00:03:12.329> them<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:13.349> is<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> really<00:03:13.950> good

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
into them and so this is a really good

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.339 
into them and so this is a really good
trick<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.150> really<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.540> recommend<00:03:15.690> doing<00:03:16.079> if

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
trick and I really do recommend doing if

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.420 
trick and I really do recommend doing if
you<00:03:16.440> want<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.739> just<00:03:16.859> have<00:03:17.010> some<00:03:17.160> fun

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
you want to just have some fun

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.339 
you want to just have some fun
but<00:03:18.000> until<00:03:18.269> Rockstar<00:03:18.720> make<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.109> that<00:03:19.230> your

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
but until Rockstar make it that your

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.870 
but until Rockstar make it that your
teammates<00:03:19.769> can<00:03:20.040> get<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:20.430> got<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.730> while

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
teammates can get in there got to while

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.949 
teammates can get in there got to while
you're<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.150> water<00:03:21.269> because<00:03:21.750> that's<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
you're in the water because that's the

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.750 
you're in the water because that's the
whole<00:03:22.109> point<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.620> trick<00:03:22.919> then<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.579> don't

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
think it's very useful but nevertheless

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.930 
think it's very useful but nevertheless

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.040 
most useful trick Locker I've added to
the<00:03:53.980> game<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.430> date<00:03:54.640> now<00:03:55.330> this<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.750> dlc

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
the game of to date now this is a dlc

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.930 
the game of to date now this is a dlc
trick<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.740> once<00:03:56.950> again<00:03:57.070> this<00:03:57.400> hasn't<00:03:57.760> actually

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
trick so once again this hasn't actually

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.010

guess DLC just came out today and this

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.300 
guess DLC just came out today and this
is<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.450> very<00:04:04.720> hidden<00:04:05.050> trick<00:04:05.440> because<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:06.040> can't

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
is a very hidden trick because I can't

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.250 
is a very hidden trick because I can't
see<00:04:06.520> anyone<00:04:06.820> reporting<00:04:07.360> on<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.600> now<00:04:08.110> it<00:04:08.170> was

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
see anyone reporting on it now it was

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.380 
see anyone reporting on it now it was
only<00:04:08.440> until<00:04:08.710> I<00:04:08.830> heard<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.100> subscriber<00:04:09.580> say<00:04:10.090> in

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
only until I heard a subscriber say in

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.390 
only until I heard a subscriber say in
this<00:04:10.570> Lobby<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.710> could<00:04:11.890> actually<00:04:11.980> get

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
this Lobby but you could actually get

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.270 
this Lobby but you could actually get
passenger<00:04:12.970> seats<00:04:13.180> enabled<00:04:13.780> on<00:04:13.960> two<00:04:14.230> cars<00:04:14.560> now

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
passenger seats enabled on two cars now

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.039 
passenger seats enabled on two cars now
what<00:04:15.460> this<00:04:15.580> means<00:04:15.640> is<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.209> say<00:04:16.810> for<00:04:16.870> example

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
what this means is that say for example

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.990 
what this means is that say for example
you<00:04:17.500> want<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.739> get<00:04:17.920> anyone<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.370> your<00:04:18.549> car<00:04:18.820> but

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
you want to get anyone in your car but

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.699
