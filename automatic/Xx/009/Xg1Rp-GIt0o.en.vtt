some<00:03:03.660> shadows<00:03:04.110> probably<00:03:05.010> add<00:03:05.160> two<00:03:05.700> more<00:03:05.850> LED

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
some shadows probably add two more LED

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.350 
some shadows probably add two more LED
lights<00:03:06.810> I'm<00:03:07.110> pretty<00:03:07.800> happy<00:03:08.100> with<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.880> results

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
lights I'm pretty happy with the results

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.860 
lights I'm pretty happy with the results
so<00:03:09.510> far<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:11.060> soft<00:03:12.060> white<00:03:12.450> light<00:03:12.720> LED<00:03:14.510> here<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.690> is

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
so far a soft white light LED here it is

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:26.150 
so far a soft white light LED here it is
with<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.290> LED<00:03:16.770> turned<00:03:17.610> off

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.100

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
you can see and just not getting that

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.869

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.739

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:37.749 
but once I turn on the LED light here

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.020 
but once I turn on the LED light here
