00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.230
 good for the people well good for the people 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.320
 the pure people pure people well purely 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.610
 well well by people coming in pure 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.950
 people do not have it 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.620
 and good to all youtube here trolls of 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.390
 water polo with the new mission and in this 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.910
 I bring you a little trick of 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.420
 minecraft to duplicate the iron 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.390
 mineral diamond and it's very simple okay 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.540
 the first thing we need will be a peak 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.410
 of any type and space in the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.440
 inventory we need to get first 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.239
 the diamonds we would need 9 for 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.220
 do the trick and the next thing would be 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:54.190
 when they have the 9 diamonds or 9 things 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.980
 and transform them into a cheese factory 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.500
 block 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.570
 having that block you can do that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.300
 trick and it's very simple first 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.489
 we need to place the peak of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.310
 any kind I say and a block that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.920
 we are going to duplicate in this case in the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.890
 diamond and I have a diamond peak the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.040
 Trick is chopped the diamond the block 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 diamond and when you can see it loose 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.430
 a cube you have to take it and place it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.880
 while you change the table in the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.530
 inventory and you quickly put this 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.740
 it's a bit complicated to say it but crazy 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.619
 watching you can see how he placed 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.130
 and then what I need is doubled 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.070
 is going to transform the block of 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.480
 diamond in nine diamonds and so I have 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.770
 duplicates nine diamonds 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.770
 I do it shows again 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 it's a bit difficult to do it but with 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.530
 the practice is being done and it comes 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.049
 very well for those who need 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.470
 lovers those precious diamonds in 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.240
 Minecraft 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.460
 this trick is very good and can be done 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.649
 because I say with any blog that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.840
 have they can do it 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.420
 just a matter of changing it while 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.090
 pikes and when you go down the ulna 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.030
 you pick up and put it immediately 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.269
 to find you the park is like a 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.590
 clichÃ© here that I do not know has not been fixed 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.970
 in white but that serves us 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.290
 in which of these diamonds 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.020
 beautiful 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.410
 it will not be one more time 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.430
 I break the diamond the little box falls I go 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.370
 I'll pick it up while I change these 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.010
 little squares below I'm going to quickly 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.600
 put and so I will be guided the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.690
 inventory below and then you can 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.550
 open the inventory and change it to 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.550
 Diamond 9 diamond is very simple 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.400
 I tell him he has to have a bit of 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.290
 practice to do this but already with the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.290
 practice they will be able to duplicate any 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.450
 diamond that they can and that they have in their 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.620
 power and I tell you that you can be with 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.480
 anything even if I was 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.519
 making some with wood then 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.470
 teach how it is made with wood that is 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.319
 exactly the same 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.870
 but only that here I will need 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:26.520
 an ax and wood but still wood 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.010
 tree not where he made it 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.160
 like this kind of good wood like 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.850
 cuts a way so that adam khel that 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.580
 it is very simple simple simple 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.480
 let's cut this piece of tree 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.480
 I do not have 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.720
 it is exactly the same as we are going to 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.920
 do 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.920
 let's drink 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.769
 ah 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.340
 with these diamonds 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.999
 I left that there no matter the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.999
 amount we remove it 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.680
 and this eclipse is very good the truth what 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.390
 can do then it's already going to 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.959
 spend nothing they will not hack it or anything 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.580
 it's very good and it's better ways 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.989
 of getting diamonds and he's going to do it 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.970
 with a piece of wood to see 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.970
 same the same procedure 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.210
 until the bridge is very good 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.940
 and on top we add planks and we already have 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.680
 planks 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.040
 where is wooden planks of wood 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.160
 planks of planks wood and so 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.740
 we have entities of squares and blocks 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.240
 infinities you can create and even 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.700
