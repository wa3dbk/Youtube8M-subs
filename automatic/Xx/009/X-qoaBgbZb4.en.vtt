see here in front of you is the Spyderco
super<00:00:11.460> leaf<00:00:12.200> it's<00:00:13.200> been<00:00:13.380> out<00:00:13.820> probably<00:00:14.820> about

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
super leaf it's been out probably about

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.510 
super leaf it's been out probably about
two<00:00:15.240> years<00:00:15.269> will<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.870> my<00:00:15.990> guess<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.160> got<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
two years will be my guess and I got it

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.840 
two years will be my guess and I got it
when<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.730> first<00:00:17.880> came<00:00:18.150> out<00:00:19.400> I've<00:00:20.400> never<00:00:20.609> done<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
when it first came out I've never done a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.279 
when it first came out I've never done a
video<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:22.550> in<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> past<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.840> reason<00:00:25.019> I've

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
video on it in the past the reason I've

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.769 
video on it in the past the reason I've
decided<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> video<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.300> knife<00:00:27.510> now

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
decided to do a video on this knife now

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.769 
decided to do a video on this knife now
is<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.890> Spyderco<00:00:29.640> has<00:00:29.820> discontinued<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
is that Spyderco has discontinued this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.610 
is that Spyderco has discontinued this
knife<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:33.180> will<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:34.530> available

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
knife and it will not be available

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.729 
knife and it will not be available
forever<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.440> figured<00:00:37.440> I'd<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.680> some

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
forever so I figured I'd get some

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.580 
forever so I figured I'd get some
information<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.570> indeed<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
information out on it because indeed I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.400 
information out on it because indeed I
have<00:00:40.890> always<00:00:41.100> liked<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.670> knife<00:00:45.079> it's<00:00:46.079> based

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
have always liked this knife it's based

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
have always liked this knife it's based
on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.920> super<00:00:47.370> hawk<00:00:48.020> which<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.940> knife<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
on the super hawk which was a knife that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.430 
on the super hawk which was a knife that
came<00:00:51.480> before<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> hawk<00:00:52.770> bail<00:00:53.070> blade

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
came before this with a hawk bail blade

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.920 
came before this with a hawk bail blade
and<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:56.010> where<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.719> kind<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and I think that's where this kind of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.549 
and I think that's where this kind of
hook<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.379> end<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:59.070> I<00:01:00.109> think<00:01:01.109> that's<00:01:01.289> left

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
hook at the end here I think that's left

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.380 
hook at the end here I think that's left
over<00:01:01.890> from<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> hawk<00:01:02.399> bill<00:01:02.640> design<00:01:03.000> because

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
over from the hawk bill design because

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.740 
over from the hawk bill design because
of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> hawk<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.049> you're<00:01:04.199> gonna<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.470> pulling

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
of the hawk but you're gonna be pulling

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.700 
of the hawk but you're gonna be pulling
it<00:01:06.750> doesn't<00:01:07.170> serve<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.680> much<00:01:09.229> it's<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.380> as

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it doesn't serve as much it's not as

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.499 
it doesn't serve as much it's not as
functional<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.090> design<00:01:14.180> for<00:01:15.180> obvious

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
functional in this design for obvious

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.830 
functional in this design for obvious
reasons<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> leaf-shaped<00:01:16.320> blade<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
reasons the leaf-shaped blade but it is

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.300 
reasons the leaf-shaped blade but it is
comfortable<00:01:21.110> nonetheless

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.440 

this<00:01:26.909> knife<00:01:27.149> has<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.840> big<00:01:28.829> old<00:01:29.009> slab<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.729> vg-10

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
again it's called the super leaf because

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.310 
again it's called the super leaf because
of<00:01:40.770> its<00:01:40.950> leaf-shaped<00:01:41.250> blade<00:01:45.020> black<00:01:46.020> g10

most popularly probably on the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.460 
most popularly probably on the
paramilitary<00:02:07.740> -<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> little<00:02:12.989> bit<00:02:13.110> harder

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
paramilitary - it is a little bit harder

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.350 
paramilitary - it is a little bit harder
to<00:02:13.500> access<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:17.220> compression<00:02:17.790> lock<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.180> this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
to access the compression lock on this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.979 
to access the compression lock on this
knife<00:02:18.569> because<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.470> cutout<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:20.989> isn't

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
knife because of this cutout here isn't

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.020 
knife because of this cutout here isn't
as<00:02:22.170> big<00:02:22.380> as<00:02:22.530> all<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.830> paramilitary<00:02:23.580> -<00:02:23.790> so

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
as big as all the paramilitary - so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.610 
as big as all the paramilitary - so
there's<00:02:24.209> not<00:02:24.360> quite<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:24.690> much<00:02:24.959> room<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.290> your

there's not quite as much room for your

there's not quite as much room for your

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.850 

just<00:02:32.990> get<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:34.520> tip<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.910> your<00:02:34.970> finger<00:02:35.390> in<00:02:35.510> there

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
just get the tip of your finger in there

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.980 
just get the tip of your finger in there
but<00:02:36.860> I've<00:02:37.370> never<00:02:37.580> had<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.850> problem<00:02:38.860> with<00:02:39.860> it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.350 

you<00:02:44.590> can<00:02:44.770> see<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.100> skeletonized<00:02:45.820> liners

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
you can see the skeletonized liners

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.910 
you can see the skeletonized liners
inside<00:02:46.780> there<00:02:48.210> it's<00:02:49.210> got<00:02:49.470> standoff<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.740> it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
inside there it's got standoff so it's

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.040 
inside there it's got standoff so it's
you<00:02:51.310> know<00:02:51.430> easy<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.910> clean<00:02:52.180> all<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.600> standard

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
you know easy to clean all the standard

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.750 
you know easy to clean all the standard
stuff<00:02:54.840> does<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:56.080> phosphor<00:02:56.710> bronze<00:02:56.860> washers

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
stuff does have phosphor bronze washers

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.880 
stuff does have phosphor bronze washers
so<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.150> very<00:02:58.510> smooth<00:02:59.080> a<00:03:04.440> little<00:03:05.440> bit<00:03:05.800> of

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
so it's very smooth a little bit of

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.960 
so it's very smooth a little bit of
jimping<00:03:06.280> here<00:03:06.490> but<00:03:06.640> I<00:03:06.670> find<00:03:07.000> it's<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:09.760> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
jimping here but I find it's not the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.090 
jimping here but I find it's not the
normal<00:03:10.390> Spyderco<00:03:11.140> jimping<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:11.710> not<00:03:11.890> real

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
normal Spyderco jimping it's not real

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.120 
normal Spyderco jimping it's not real
sharp<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.640> kind<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:12.970> rounded<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:16.000> also<00:03:17.130> in

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
sharp it's kind of rounded and also in

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.030 
sharp it's kind of rounded and also in
Turin<00:03:18.580> interestingly<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:20.440> sits<00:03:21.690> below<00:03:24.960> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
Turin interestingly it sits below the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.740 
Turin interestingly it sits below the
just<00:03:27.040> part<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.640> each<00:03:27.880> side<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.360> handle

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
just part of the each side of the handle

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.770 
just part of the each side of the handle
here<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.610> jimping<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.150> actually<00:03:31.570> down

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
here so the jimping is actually down

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.760 
here so the jimping is actually down
below<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:33.310> level<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.880> handle<00:03:34.270> scales<00:03:34.770> so

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
below the level of the handle scales so

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.300 
below the level of the handle scales so
again<00:03:36.040> not<00:03:36.220> super<00:03:36.460> functional<00:03:36.960> but<00:03:38.130> I'm<00:03:39.130> not

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
again not super functional but I'm not

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.860 
again not super functional but I'm not
huge<00:03:39.640> on<00:03:39.790> jimping<00:03:40.240> anyway<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:43.480> handle

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
huge on jimping anyway this handle

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.530 
huge on jimping anyway this handle
especially<00:03:44.020> kind<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.650> locked<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.190> in<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:46.480> can

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
especially kind of locked you in you can

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.250 
especially kind of locked you in you can
see<00:03:46.870> here<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:48.150> coil<00:03:49.150> up<00:03:49.450> front<00:03:49.750> more<00:03:50.020> than<00:03:50.230> a

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
see here the coil up front more than a

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:58.640 
see here the coil up front more than a
50/50<00:03:51.040> choy<00:03:54.390> so<00:03:55.390> more<00:03:55.780> than<00:03:55.990> 50%<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.220> blade

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
50/50 choy so more than 50% of the blade

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.680 
50/50 choy so more than 50% of the blade
makes<00:03:59.650> up<00:03:59.860> that<00:04:00.040> toil<00:04:01.650> again<00:04:03.540> because<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
makes up that toil again because the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.170 
makes up that toil again because the
blades<00:04:04.930> so<00:04:05.170> thick<00:04:05.470> it's

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.670 

it's<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.450> find<00:04:09.749> it<00:04:09.870> very<00:04:09.900> comfortable<00:04:10.499> this

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
it's I find it very comfortable this

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.789 
it's I find it very comfortable this
isn't<00:04:11.040> too<00:04:11.189> thin<00:04:11.519> for<00:04:11.549> your<00:04:12.260> when<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.379> grip<00:04:13.620> it

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
isn't too thin for your when you grip it

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.460 
isn't too thin for your when you grip it
or<00:04:13.920> anything

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.080 

again<00:04:19.470> this<00:04:19.620> knife<00:04:19.829> has<00:04:20.070> been<00:04:20.280> discontinued

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
again this knife has been discontinued

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.350 
again this knife has been discontinued
so<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:21.989> may<00:04:22.259> be<00:04:22.320> able<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.680> find<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.190> at<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.150> good

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
so you may be able to find it at a good

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.320 
so you may be able to find it at a good
price<00:04:24.419> if<00:04:25.349> you<00:04:25.590> look<00:04:25.770> around<00:04:26.150> although<00:04:27.150> I

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
price if you look around although I

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.839 
price if you look around although I
haven't<00:04:27.780> looked<00:04:27.870> around<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.400> don't<00:04:29.639> know<00:04:29.759> if

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
haven't looked around so I don't know if

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.540 
haven't looked around so I don't know if
that's<00:04:30.060> true<00:04:30.180> or<00:04:30.449> not<00:04:30.509> about<00:04:31.220> one<00:04:32.220> little

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
that's true or not about one little

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.029 
that's true or not about one little
design<00:04:35.900> feature<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.080> I'm<00:04:37.349> not<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:37.800> happy

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
design feature that I'm not so happy

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.640 
design feature that I'm not so happy
with<00:04:38.220> is<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.699> way<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:40.229> part<00:04:40.530> of

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
with is the way that this this part of

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.890 
with is the way that this this part of
the<00:04:40.740> Tang<00:04:40.979> here<00:04:41.280> sticks<00:04:41.639> up<00:04:41.880> kind<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.599> like<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
the Tang here sticks up kind of like the

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.980 
the Tang here sticks up kind of like the
old<00:04:43.020> paramilitary<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:45.360> when<00:04:45.570> they<00:04:45.690> came<00:04:45.870> out

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
old paramilitary and when they came out

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.490 
old paramilitary and when they came out
with<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.259> paramilitary<00:04:46.979> -<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.840> can<00:04:49.020> see<00:04:49.259> that

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
with the paramilitary - you can see that

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.770 
with the paramilitary - you can see that
they<00:04:51.289> got<00:04:52.289> rid<00:04:52.530> of<00:04:52.560> that<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.699> so<00:04:54.120> that's<00:04:54.300> just

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
they got rid of that and so that's just

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.409 
they got rid of that and so that's just
one<00:04:55.020> less<00:04:55.289> thing<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.800> kind<00:04:56.039> of<00:04:56.130> grab<00:04:56.340> your<00:04:59.419> to

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
one less thing to kind of grab your to

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.909 
one less thing to kind of grab your to
grab<00:05:00.630> onto<00:05:00.840> anything<00:05:01.349> really

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
grab onto anything really

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.659 
grab onto anything really
one<00:05:02.610> less<00:05:03.349> protrusion<00:05:06.650> but<00:05:07.650> this<00:05:08.250> knife<00:05:08.460> is

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
one less protrusion but this knife is

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.110 
one less protrusion but this knife is
rock-solid<00:05:09.139> vg10<00:05:10.139> is<00:05:10.259> a<00:05:10.320> great<00:05:10.530> steel<00:05:11.120> plenty

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
rock-solid vg10 is a great steel plenty

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.810 
rock-solid vg10 is a great steel plenty
tough<00:05:12.389> easy<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.590> sharpen<00:05:15.889> if<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:17.039> like<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.520> if

tough easy to sharpen if you like the if

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.689 
tough easy to sharpen if you like the if
you<00:05:17.909> like<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.270> knife<00:05:18.509> again<00:05:18.840> I<00:05:18.870> recommend

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
you like this knife again I recommend

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.589 
you like this knife again I recommend
getting<00:05:20.699> a<00:05:20.880> hold<00:05:21.090> of<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.300> while<00:05:21.449> you<00:05:21.479> can

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
getting a hold of it while you can

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.379 
getting a hold of it while you can
because<00:05:22.050> it<00:05:22.380> is<00:05:22.530> on<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.740> 2013<00:05:23.610> discontinued

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
because it is on the 2013 discontinued

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.320 
because it is on the 2013 discontinued
list<00:05:25.310> one<00:05:26.310> last<00:05:26.550> thing<00:05:26.759> I<00:05:26.849> wanted<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.120> mention

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
list one last thing I wanted to mention

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.610 
list one last thing I wanted to mention
is<00:05:27.659> its<00:05:28.130> similarity<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.979> SMG<00:05:32.509> a<00:05:33.509> lot<00:05:34.470> of

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
is its similarity to the SMG a lot of

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.439 
is its similarity to the SMG a lot of
similarities<00:05:35.539> as<00:05:36.539> far<00:05:36.960> as<00:05:37.080> blade<00:05:37.349> lengths

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
similarities as far as blade lengths

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.140 
similarities as far as blade lengths
they're<00:05:39.449> very<00:05:39.780> close<00:05:40.139> and<00:05:40.440> blade<00:05:40.680> length

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.629 

almost<00:05:45.150> identical<00:05:46.070> they<00:05:47.070> both<00:05:47.250> have<00:05:47.490> the

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
almost identical they both have the

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.749 
almost identical they both have the
choil<00:05:48.800> so<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:49.860> can<00:05:50.070> choke<00:05:50.310> up<00:05:52.250> very<00:05:53.250> similar

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
choil so you can choke up very similar

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.430 
choil so you can choke up very similar
in<00:05:53.940> thickness<00:05:54.479> I<00:05:56.659> will<00:05:57.659> have<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.930> measurement

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
in thickness I will have the measurement

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.830

thickness<00:06:25.409> of<00:06:25.800> these<00:06:26.360> of<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:28.139> scales<00:06:28.560> with

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
thickness of these of the scales with

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:36.140 
thickness of these of the scales with
this<00:06:29.279> liner<00:06:30.320> is<00:06:31.320> the<00:06:31.919> same<00:06:32.430> as<00:06:32.760> the<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.940> two

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
this liner is the same as the the two

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.920 
this liner is the same as the the two
sides<00:06:36.479> of<00:06:36.719> the<00:06:36.979> SMG<00:06:37.979> so<00:06:38.250> it's<00:06:38.490> very<00:06:39.270> similar<00:06:39.719> to

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
sides of the SMG so it's very similar to

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:49.550 
sides of the SMG so it's very similar to
an<00:06:40.229> SMG<00:06:42.139> obviously<00:06:43.669> much<00:06:44.669> less<00:06:44.940> expensive<00:06:48.560> but

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
an SMG obviously much less expensive but

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.719 
an SMG obviously much less expensive but
you<00:06:49.770> get<00:06:49.979> the<00:06:50.159> hard<00:06:50.909> use<00:06:51.150> lock<00:06:52.520> you<00:06:53.520> know<00:06:53.639> you

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
you get the hard use lock you know you

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.810 
you get the hard use lock you know you
get<00:06:53.940> the<00:06:54.060> nice<00:06:54.240> thick<00:06:54.510> blade<00:06:54.779> like<00:06:55.080> an<00:06:55.260> SMG<00:06:55.650> a

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:05.269 

lot<00:06:59.820> of<00:06:59.940> very<00:07:00.089> similar<00:07:00.389> features<00:07:02.330> so<00:07:03.330> that<00:07:04.279> is

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:05.279 
lot of very similar features so that is

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:09.350 
lot of very similar features so that is
the<00:07:05.490> Spyderco<00:07:06.150> super<00:07:06.630> leaf<00:07:07.940> should<00:07:08.940> still<00:07:09.210> be

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
the Spyderco super leaf should still be

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.269 
the Spyderco super leaf should still be
available<00:07:09.449> at<00:07:09.930> this<00:07:10.080> point<00:07:10.380> in<00:07:10.529> time<00:07:10.770> but
