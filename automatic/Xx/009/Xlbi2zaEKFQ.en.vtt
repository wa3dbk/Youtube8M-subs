hey whats up guys fresh / stranger with
the<00:00:02.429> theory<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.850> stringing<00:00:03.540> ballistics<00:00:04.049> and

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
the theory of stringing ballistics and

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.259 
the theory of stringing ballistics and

it<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:18.050> same<00:00:19.050> um<00:00:20.539> well<00:00:21.710> technique<00:00:22.710> i<00:00:22.890> guess

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it this same um well technique i guess

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.509 
it this same um well technique i guess
works<00:00:23.609> um<00:00:24.710> they're<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> same<00:00:25.920> pattern<00:00:26.279> really

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
works um they're the same pattern really

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.200 
works um they're the same pattern really
works<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.939> almost<00:00:27.180> any<00:00:27.390> head<00:00:27.660> um<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:29.210> you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
works for almost any head um and you

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.810 
works for almost any head um and you
know<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> nice<00:00:30.779> deep<00:00:31.109> pocket<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
know get you a nice deep pocket with a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.690 
know get you a nice deep pocket with a
channel<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.010> used<00:00:35.370> I've<00:00:35.670> used

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
channel like that this is used I've used

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.119 
channel like that this is used I've used
this<00:00:36.180> before<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.840> used<00:00:37.050> mesh<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
this before this is used mesh and it

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.970 
this before this is used mesh and it
throws<00:00:38.340> very<00:00:38.820> well<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:40.140> their<00:00:40.739> past

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
throws very well I can their past

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.180 
throws very well I can their past
midfield<00:00:41.219> easily<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.770> and<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.100> way

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
midfield easily with this on and the way

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
midfield easily with this on and the way
its<00:00:44.340> strong<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.120> great<00:00:45.360> hold<00:00:45.570> great

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
its strong just got great hold great

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.720 
its strong just got great hold great
handling<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.820> theory<00:00:48.090> behind

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
handling so here it is the theory behind

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.299 
handling so here it is the theory behind
stringing<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.969> glow<00:00:51.480> stick<00:00:51.980> normally<00:00:52.980> your

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
stringing a glow stick normally your

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.920 
stringing a glow stick normally your
shoes<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.539> really

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
shoes are going to be want to be really

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.010 
shoes are going to be want to be really
really<00:00:55.020> loose<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.940> on<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.449> they're<00:00:57.989> not

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
really loose if on if they're not

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.060 
really loose if on if they're not
tightening<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.590> measures<00:00:58.949> they're

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
tightening up the measures they're

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.290 
tightening up the measures they're
tightening<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.460> mess<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> want<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.000> be

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
tightening up the mess you want to be

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.470 
tightening up the mess you want to be
top<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.170> Titus<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.760> bottom<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
top on Titus and then the bottom and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
top on Titus and then the bottom and
then<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> bottom<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.260> loosest<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.830> then

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
then the bottom and loosest and then

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.090 
then the bottom and loosest and then
going<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.119> order<00:01:06.360> tight<00:01:07.049> too<00:01:07.260> loose<00:01:07.470> top

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
going in that order tight too loose top

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490 
going in that order tight too loose top
to<00:01:08.250> bottom<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.049> one's<00:01:10.290> really

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
to bottom because if this one's really

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.260 
to bottom because if this one's really
tight<00:01:10.799> it'll<00:01:11.280> catch<00:01:11.490> off<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.970> snap

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
tight it'll catch off of that and snap

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.520 
tight it'll catch off of that and snap
out<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.750> way<00:01:13.080> too<00:01:13.140> much<00:01:13.350> whip<00:01:13.640> again<00:01:14.640> um

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
out and have way too much whip again um

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.550 
out and have way too much whip again um
so<00:01:16.790> top<00:01:17.790> string<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.170> want<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.350> pull

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so top string you're gonna want to pull

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.910 
so top string you're gonna want to pull
the<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:20.490> tight<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.650> with<00:01:22.650> 12

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the really tight here and with 12

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.850 
the really tight here and with 12
diamond<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.490> think<00:01:23.820> we've<00:01:23.970> only<00:01:24.119> got<00:01:24.470> two<00:01:25.470> four

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
diamond I think we've only got two four

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
diamond I think we've only got two four
six<00:01:26.159> seven<00:01:26.520> holes<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.479> on

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
six seven holes here and then two on

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080 
six seven holes here and then two on
sides<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.860> leaves<00:01:29.520> us<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> couple<00:01:29.970> extra

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
sides so that leaves us a couple extra

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.210 
sides so that leaves us a couple extra
diamonds<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> work<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.950> did<00:01:32.130> an

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
diamonds to work with I think I did an

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.730 
diamonds to work with I think I did an
11<00:01:32.610> diamond<00:01:32.970> top<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.479> had<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> double<00:01:34.650> up

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
11 diamond top so I had to double up

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.429 
11 diamond top so I had to double up
here<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:36.240> top<00:01:36.450> string<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.259> did<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
here and here on top string and I did it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.109 
here and here on top string and I did it
here<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.310> normally<00:01:38.610> want<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.970> either

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
here you normally want to do that either

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.679 
here you normally want to do that either
here<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:40.159> your<00:01:41.159> hero<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> gets

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
here or here your hero here so it gets

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
here or here your hero here so it gets
pulled<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.200> tight<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.220> middle<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
pulled really tight in the middle that

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.069 
pulled really tight in the middle that
also<00:01:45.600> keeps<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.140> tight<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.409> um<00:01:47.930> takes<00:01:48.930> all

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
also keeps really tight and um takes all

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
also keeps really tight and um takes all
the<00:01:49.229> lip<00:01:49.680> off<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.189> which<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.670> hits

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the lip off of it which is when it hits

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.200 
the lip off of it which is when it hits
the<00:01:50.939> top<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.500> sidewalls<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.970> way<00:01:54.090> you're

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the top so the sidewalls the way you're

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.630 
the top so the sidewalls the way you're
gonna<00:01:54.299> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.509> string<00:01:54.689> sidewalls<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.490> was<00:01:56.490> at

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
gonna want to string sidewalls I was at

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.319 
gonna want to string sidewalls I was at
us<00:01:57.049> just<00:01:58.049> by<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.259> way<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> was<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.040> was<00:01:59.329> IDs

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
us just by the way I was up I was IDs

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
cross lace on this which weren't pretty

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.580 
cross lace on this which weren't pretty
much<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.549> well<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.409> out

want<00:02:08.610> interlock<00:02:09.149> or<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:12.330> did<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:13.110> 59

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
want interlock or not I I did I think 59

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.240 
want interlock or not I I did I think 59
one<00:02:14.130> two<00:02:14.430> three<00:02:14.820> yup<00:02:15.600> five<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.170> pulled<00:02:17.040> down

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
one two three yup five and pulled down

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.310 
one two three yup five and pulled down
really<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:17.850> tight<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.540> did<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.020> since

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
really really tight it I did not since

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.720 
really really tight it I did not since
ted<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.530> interlocks<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.160> pulled<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.460> tight<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
ted of interlocks it pulled it tight and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.580 
ted of interlocks it pulled it tight and
keeps<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> tight<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:22.260> what<00:02:22.410> creates

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
keeps it tight and that's what creates

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.320 
keeps it tight and that's what creates
this<00:02:22.920> channel<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.610> can<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:23.940> right<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.270> that

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
this channel you can see right here that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.270 
this channel you can see right here that
it's<00:02:24.570> really<00:02:24.780> tight<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.260> you're<00:02:26.100> going<00:02:26.220> to

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
it's really tight and you're going to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.770 
it's really tight and you're going to
want<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.460> really<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:26.940> tight<00:02:27.210> channel<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
want a really really tight channel on a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.870 
want a really really tight channel on a
goalie<00:02:28.020> stick<00:02:28.230> because<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:29.250> always<00:02:29.490> want

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
goalie stick because it you always want

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.180 
goalie stick because it you always want
it<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> release<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.670> arm<00:02:33.500> out<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
it to release out of the arm out of the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.560 
it to release out of the arm out of the
middle<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.640> head<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.590> when<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.710> do<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
middle of the head and when you do that

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.230 
middle of the head and when you do that
um<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:41.550> really<00:02:42.150> um<00:02:43.700> decreases<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.850> amount<00:02:44.940> of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
um it really um decreases the amount of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.150 
um it really um decreases the amount of
weird<00:02:45.660> throws<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.290> sometimes<00:02:46.680> come<00:02:46.860> off<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
weird throws that sometimes come off the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.210 
weird throws that sometimes come off the
sides<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.110> way<00:02:49.110> most<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.830> most<00:02:50.010> all

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
sides and that way most of all most all

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.940 
sides and that way most of all most all
of<00:02:50.280> your<00:02:50.520> throat<00:02:50.730> all<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.270> your<00:02:51.500> outlet<00:02:52.500> passes

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
of your throat all of your outlet passes

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
of your throat all of your outlet passes
and<00:02:53.220> everything<00:02:53.520> will<00:02:53.700> come<00:02:54.270> right<00:02:54.510> off<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
and everything will come right off the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.750 
and everything will come right off the
middle<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:56.100> has<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> really<00:02:56.490> smooth

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
middle and this has a really smooth

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.200 
middle and this has a really smooth
release<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:58.490> when<00:02:59.490> you're<00:02:59.640> stringing<00:02:59.940> a

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
release so when you're stringing a

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.000 
release so when you're stringing a
goalie<00:03:00.420> stick<00:03:00.690> you're<00:03:01.320> normally<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.680> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
goalie stick you're normally going to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.330 
goalie stick you're normally going to
want<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.990> interlock<00:03:03.990> at<00:03:04.350> least<00:03:04.680> halfway<00:03:04.980> down

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
want to interlock at least halfway down

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.400 
want to interlock at least halfway down
so<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.300> think<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.570> last<00:03:06.720> interlock<00:03:07.110> was<00:03:07.260> right

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
so I think the last interlock was right

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.130 
so I think the last interlock was right
here<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:09.230> then<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.320> did<00:03:10.500> straight<00:03:10.950> double<00:03:11.310> ups

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
here and then I did straight double ups

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.350 
here and then I did straight double ups
so<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> think<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.620> was<00:03:13.740> one<00:03:13.920> two<00:03:14.370> three<00:03:14.970> doubles

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
so I think it was one two three doubles

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.080 
so I think it was one two three doubles
but<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:16.650> want<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.090> four

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
but that you really want to get four

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.780 
but that you really want to get four
double<00:03:18.360> ups<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:19.890> did<00:03:20.100> five<00:03:20.280> interlocks<00:03:20.640> and

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
double ups so I did five interlocks and

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.240 
double ups so I did five interlocks and
four<00:03:20.940> double<00:03:21.150> ups<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:22.709> much<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.130> all

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
four double ups and that much is all

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.580 
four double ups and that much is all
doubled<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.760> that's<00:03:24.750> what<00:03:25.020> really<00:03:25.050> makes

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
doubled and that's what really makes

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.180 
doubled and that's what really makes
this<00:03:25.800> pocket<00:03:26.280> right<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.800> lower

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
this pocket right there in the lower

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.610 
this pocket right there in the lower
position<00:03:29.820> work<00:03:30.750> right<00:03:31.050> where<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.350> want<00:03:31.530> it

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
position work right where you want it

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.979 
position work right where you want it
and<00:03:31.910> that's<00:03:32.910> good<00:03:33.180> because<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.510> gives<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
and that's good because it gives it a

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
and that's good because it gives it a
lot<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.170> hold<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.980> personally<00:03:35.400> like<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.550> big

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
lot of hold and I personally like a big

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.030 
lot of hold and I personally like a big
bag<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.720> print<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.560> pretty<00:03:37.770> deep

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
bag so this is print this is pretty deep

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.330 
bag so this is print this is pretty deep
for<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> goalie<00:03:38.970> stick<00:03:39.270> most<00:03:40.020> people<00:03:40.380> kind<00:03:41.190> of

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
for a goalie stick most people kind of

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.750 
for a goalie stick most people kind of
like<00:03:42.120> one<00:03:42.680> close<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:44.489> know<00:03:44.580> not<00:03:44.730> that

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
like one close to you know not that

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.100 
like one close to you know not that
shape<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.209> I'm<00:03:45.330> pulling<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.690> down<00:03:45.840> but

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
shape but I'm pulling it down but

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.350 
shape but I'm pulling it down but
probably<00:03:46.709> about<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:47.010> depth<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:48.120> when<00:03:48.270> I'm

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
probably about that depth so when I'm

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.400 
probably about that depth so when I'm
stringing<00:03:48.570> someone's<00:03:48.870> all<00:03:49.020> strength<00:03:49.290> like

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
stringing someone's all strength like

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.010 
stringing someone's all strength like
that<00:03:49.560> but<00:03:49.739> if<00:03:49.800> they<00:03:49.890> want<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.100> bag<00:03:50.630> I'll<00:03:51.630> do<00:03:51.870> that

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
that but if they want a bag I'll do that

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.780 
that but if they want a bag I'll do that
but<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:53.130> that's<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.459> theory<00:03:53.640> behind

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
but so that's the theory behind

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.390 
but so that's the theory behind
stringing<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:55.040> pocket<00:03:56.040> like<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.640> one<00:03:56.820> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
stringing a pocket like this one and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.830 
stringing a pocket like this one and
honestly<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.580> this<00:03:59.970> one<00:04:00.150> really<00:04:00.450> didn't

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
honestly this this one really didn't

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.040 
honestly this this one really didn't
need<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.770> shooters<00:04:02.130> um<00:04:02.570> but<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.630> just<00:04:03.810> put<00:04:03.959> them

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
need the shooters um but I just put them

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.420 
need the shooters um but I just put them
in<00:04:04.170> there<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.380> put<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.860> little<00:04:05.100> more<00:04:05.220> grip

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
in there to put have a little more grip

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.500 
in there to put have a little more grip
on<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.670> ball<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.850> little<00:04:06.060> more<00:04:06.239> traction

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
on the ball a little more traction

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.500 
on the ball a little more traction
because<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.560> way<00:04:07.709> if<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.940> pull<00:04:09.150> down<00:04:09.180> tight

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
because the way if you pull down tight

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.910 
because the way if you pull down tight
enough<00:04:09.690> it's<00:04:10.019> not<00:04:10.170> going<00:04:10.320> to<00:04:10.410> hit<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.590> top<00:04:10.769> at

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
enough it's not going to hit the top at

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.470 
enough it's not going to hit the top at
all<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.280> don't<00:04:11.640> really<00:04:11.850> need<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.180> tighten

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
all so you don't really need to tighten

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.640 
all so you don't really need to tighten
up<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.840> mesh<00:04:13.650> at<00:04:13.830> all<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.670> um<00:04:15.169> anyways<00:04:16.169> that's

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
up the mesh at all so um anyways that's

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.670 
up the mesh at all so um anyways that's
the<00:04:16.799> theory<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.370> bottom<00:04:18.150> string<00:04:18.680> the

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
the theory and the bottom string the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.840 
the theory and the bottom string the
biggest<00:04:19.980> thing<00:04:20.160> with<00:04:20.280> bottom<00:04:20.549> string<00:04:20.700> on

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
biggest thing with bottom string on

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.140 
biggest thing with bottom string on
ballistics<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:23.130> find<00:04:23.340> your<00:04:23.520> happy<00:04:23.820> medium

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
ballistics is to find your happy medium

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.820 
ballistics is to find your happy medium
um<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:26.250> just

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
um I just

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.219 
um I just
a little<00:04:27.159> up<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.389> over<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:28.720> then<00:04:28.810> across

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
a little up and over and then across

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.320 
a little up and over and then across
here<00:04:29.939> cuz<00:04:30.939> um<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.520> see<00:04:33.879> what<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.060> did<00:04:34.150> there

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
here cuz um so you see what I did there

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.670 
here cuz um so you see what I did there
I<00:04:34.479> just<00:04:34.659> a<00:04:34.720> loop<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.199> then<00:04:35.319> across<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:37.680> really

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
I just a loop and then across and really

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.320 
I just a loop and then across and really
the<00:04:38.800> biggest<00:04:38.949> thing<00:04:39.219> is<00:04:39.400> keep<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.729> pocket

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the biggest thing is keep the pocket

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.709 
the biggest thing is keep the pocket
deep<00:04:40.830> keep<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.979> pocket<00:04:42.310> maintain<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.330> pocket

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:43.719 
deep keep the pocket maintain the pocket

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.529 
deep keep the pocket maintain the pocket
without<00:04:44.319> leaving<00:04:45.189> a<00:04:45.400> gap<00:04:45.639> for<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.210> ball<00:04:46.389> to

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
without leaving a gap for the ball to

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.149 
without leaving a gap for the ball to
roll<00:04:46.689> through<00:04:46.960> like<00:04:47.229> you<00:04:47.349> when<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:48.009> go<00:04:48.099> to

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
roll through like you when you go to

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.520 
roll through like you when you go to
make<00:04:48.280> an<00:04:48.370> offside<00:04:48.639> save<00:04:48.879> sometimes<00:04:49.689> you'll

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
make an offside save sometimes you'll
