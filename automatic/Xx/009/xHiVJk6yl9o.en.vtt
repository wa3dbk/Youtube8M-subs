00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello my name is sergey patin and in 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.410
 this video I would like to tell you about 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.780
 one small but very much in my opinion 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.840
 a useful device called 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.299
 log house felled speaker adapter or 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.990
 wireless adapter 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.660
 any speakers and speakers 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.760
 I've been looking for a similar solution for myself 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.609
 because I wanted to put columns 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.590
 somewhere in the closet and send them 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.019
 sound from iphone or from ipad or from 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.030
 computer wirelessly and also so i 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.660
 could adjust the speaker volume not 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.239
 twisting the handle on them and also from the device 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.780
 equipped with bluetooth technology or 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.539
 Wi-Fi and first I found such solutions 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.239
 they were equipped with technology 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.059
 airplay from apple but airplay speakers 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.910
 costs very very expensive about 10,000 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.050
 probably starting the minimum price 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.750
 such columns 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.930
 so I began to look for more budget 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.080
 alternative solution and ideally such 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.420
 same quality and I found such a solution in 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.799
 the face of this adapter loggiec valleys 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.460
 speaker adapter it is designed for 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.729
 so that we could using bluetooth technology 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 turning on the music on your phone 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.710
 smartphone tablet or computer 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 send sound to any speakers without 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.140
 wiring to connect speakers we can 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.869
 either three and a half adapter jack 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.360
 either using bell type connectors 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.460
 and another connector you see here is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.619
 power connector 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.210
 let's see how this device 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 works primarily of course in in one 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.990
 power connector turn on the power and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.990
 plug in the network 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.960
 the column is also connected to us and we 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.480
 this column should be here for me 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.450
 equipped with a three and a half jack connector and 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.140
 we plug the corresponding connector 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.600
 connector in this adapter 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.860
 ready now to connect 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.900
 with this device with your phone 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.540
 smartphone you need to click here on this 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:36.000
 a button called connect 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:40.170
 click on it and fired up flashing 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.620
 diode means that this device entered 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.450
 into search mode and now we can open 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.890
 your device is equipped with technology 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.880
 bluetooth in this case i will 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.730
 use ipad and open settings 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.700
 one more time setting and turn on bluetooth 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.400
 here in the device search I find 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.100
 a device called loggatec 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.750
 adapter and click on it to 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.400
 connection occurred 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.190
 now this adapter peeped once 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.160
 meaning he successfully connected to 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.910
 device on ipad we also see that 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.150
 the device is connected idiot caught fire 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.180
 already a constant green light now we 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.450
 we can turn on any device on your device 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.660
 music include any audiobook and sound 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.290
 will be wirelessly displayed on any 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.840
 your stereo system or speakers in this 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.209
 case I use these columns from 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.900
 firms pigs in general they stand on my 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.260
 closet I from any room on them including 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.610
 sound and catches the signal given adapter 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.850
 pretty good confident without crashing and without 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.670
 any claims seems to me for 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.459
 such a decision for the price of one and a half thousand 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.190
 rubles this adapter is ideal 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.709
 well and we wanted to include 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.739
 any music and see 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.950
 whether or not the sound will be output 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.489
 above 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.989
 data column clear ipad will do 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:22.139
 the volume is slightly larger and we hear that 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.980
 the sound comes out of the speaker itself 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:30.510
 we needed for sound quality 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.330
 which is heard in my speakers 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.110
 no complaints i read several reviews 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.320
 this adapter and the authors of these reviews 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.800
 also spoke of good quality 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.010
 which are given adapter 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.430
 gives out to the stereo system however if you 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:54.080
 use some super expensive 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.130
 stereo system of 5 10 20 speakers 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.960
 located at your floor to different corners 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.300
 rooms then i think you are all the same 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.250
 would you prefer to connect such 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.110
 stereo system by wire with 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.990
 some kind of gold plating 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.610
 Well, for those who have special claims to 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.950
 the sound has you can of course 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.100
 use this adapter and me 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.620
 It seems this is just the perfect solution. 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.530
 when i turn on my child 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.200
 cartoons look on ipad then i 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.389
 I also output the sound to these speakers and sound. 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.080
 it turns out of course more juicy 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.320
 nice and cartoon already more nice 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.320
 watch 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.900
