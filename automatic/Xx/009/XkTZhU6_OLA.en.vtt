hook sets but a lot of I mean it's
obvious<00:00:34.430> everybody<00:00:34.790> knows<00:00:34.970> braid<00:00:35.390> is<00:00:35.690> really

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
obvious everybody knows braid is really

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
they're going to a fluorocarbon leader

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.470 
they're going to a fluorocarbon leader
and<00:00:50.680> my<00:00:51.680> question<00:00:52.160> was<00:00:52.340> how<00:00:52.640> can<00:00:52.970> you<00:00:53.210> join

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
with some fluorocarbon now you see gar

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.219 
with some fluorocarbon now you see gar
red<00:01:22.159> label<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:22.909> cheap<00:01:23.240> good<00:01:23.750> for<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.020> money

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
red label it's cheap good for the money

can't beat it in my opinion and I use a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.990 
can't beat it in my opinion and I use a
just<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.590> ten<00:01:27.800> pound<00:01:28.070> braid<00:01:28.370> which<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.729> this<00:01:28.820> is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
just a ten pound braid which is this is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.910 
just a ten pound braid which is this is
actually<00:01:29.330> thirty<00:01:29.630> but<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.260> you<00:01:30.560> can<00:01:30.650> see<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:30.860> a

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
actually thirty but it you can see it a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.130 
actually thirty but it you can see it a
little<00:01:30.979> bit<00:01:31.159> better<00:01:31.479> what<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.630> do<00:01:32.780> is<00:01:33.020> you

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
little bit better what you do is you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.980 
little bit better what you do is you
take<00:01:33.320> your<00:01:33.380> leader<00:01:33.680> material<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:35.600> make<00:01:35.810> you

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
take your leader material you make you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.490 
take your leader material you make you
loop<00:01:37.840> grab<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:39.080> loop<00:01:40.360> take<00:01:41.360> your<00:01:41.390> braid<00:01:41.780> off

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
loop grab that loop take your braid off

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.010 
loop grab that loop take your braid off
your<00:01:42.830> mainline<00:01:43.210> you'll<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.360> run<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.690> back<00:01:44.840> up

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
your mainline you'll just run it back up

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.090 
your mainline you'll just run it back up
through<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.290> loop<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.560> pull<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:45.950> out

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
through that loop and pull you out

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.870 
through that loop and pull you out
pretty<00:01:46.369> good<00:01:46.580> bit<00:01:47.950> now<00:01:48.979> you're<00:01:49.610> going<00:01:49.790> to

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
pretty good bit now you're going to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.330 
pretty good bit now you're going to

all right now you went back over that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.770 
all right now you went back over that
seven<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:17.489> times<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.970> got<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> loop<00:03:18.360> up<00:03:18.540> here

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
seven more times you got a loop up here

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.960 
seven more times you got a loop up here
then<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.019> got<00:03:19.200> your<00:03:19.349> leap<00:03:19.530> down<00:03:19.709> here<00:03:20.010> with

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
then you got your leap down here with

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.309 
then you got your leap down here with
your<00:03:21.090> fluorocarbon<00:03:21.510> what<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.900> want<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.140> do<00:03:22.200> is

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
your fluorocarbon what you want to do is

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.449 
your fluorocarbon what you want to do is
take<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.560> tag<00:03:22.950> end<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:24.060> your<00:03:24.209> mainline<00:03:24.480> braid

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
take that tag end of your mainline braid

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.780 
take that tag end of your mainline braid
right<00:03:26.459> back<00:03:26.730> through<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.450> loop<00:03:30.049> pull<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.790> you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
right back through that loop pull it you

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.740 
right back through that loop pull it you
grab<00:03:33.000> these<00:03:33.180> two<00:03:33.390> lines<00:03:34.909> grab<00:03:35.909> these<00:03:36.090> two<00:03:36.360> and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
grab these two lines grab these two and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.809 
grab these two lines grab these two and
gently<00:03:37.319> pull<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.560> down<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:41.190> snug<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.610> just<00:03:41.760> a

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
gently pull it down and snug it just a

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.000 
gently pull it down and snug it just a
little<00:03:41.909> bit<00:03:42.090> all<00:03:42.360> right<00:03:42.420> now<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:43.709> can<00:03:43.829> see

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
little bit all right now you can see

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.949 
little bit all right now you can see
it's<00:03:44.310> kind<00:03:44.519> of<00:03:44.610> bunching<00:03:45.000> up<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.450> that's

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
it's kind of bunching up so that's

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.309 
it's kind of bunching up so that's
alright<00:03:46.410> once<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:46.890> do<00:03:47.040> just<00:03:47.340> pull<00:03:48.019> pull<00:03:49.019> out<00:03:49.200> a

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
alright once you do just pull pull out a

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.569 
alright once you do just pull pull out a
little<00:03:49.440> bit<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.799> pull<00:03:49.950> out<00:03:50.069> leave<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.340> and

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
little bit and pull out leave it and

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.039 
little bit and pull out leave it and
that'll<00:03:50.790> give<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.090> less<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.569> a<00:03:51.750> gap<00:03:51.900> in

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
that'll give you the less of a gap in

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.640 
that'll give you the less of a gap in
center<00:03:52.470> now<00:03:53.120> take<00:03:54.120> your<00:03:54.299> tag<00:03:54.540> ends<00:03:57.409> pull<00:03:58.409> those

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
center now take your tag ends pull those

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.589 
center now take your tag ends pull those
and<00:03:59.129> then<00:03:59.400> there<00:03:59.670> you'll<00:03:59.849> see<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.090> bunches<00:04:00.420> up

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
and then there you'll see it bunches up

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.830 
and then there you'll see it bunches up
so<00:04:00.810> you'll<00:04:00.959> slow<00:04:01.170> down<00:04:01.379> I<00:04:02.540> spread<00:04:03.540> too<00:04:03.659> far<00:04:03.690> a

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
so you'll slow down I spread too far a

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.970 
so you'll slow down I spread too far a
little<00:04:03.959> bit<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.319> take<00:04:04.440> your<00:04:04.590> main<00:04:04.769> line

little bit and take your main line

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.399 
little bit and take your main line
pulling<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.430> little<00:04:05.609> bit<00:04:06.049> once<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.140> get<00:04:07.319> it

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409

leader not more than that because

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.430 
leader not more than that because
fluorocarbon<00:06:20.620> it<00:06:20.890> does<00:06:21.100> sink<00:06:21.430> it<00:06:21.880> don't<00:06:22.090> float

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
fluorocarbon it does sink it don't float

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
the like it disappears and it goes away

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.520 
the like it disappears and it goes away
same<00:06:37.900> for<00:06:38.140> me

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
same for me

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.870 
same for me
and<00:06:38.650> you<00:06:38.860> that's<00:06:39.190> going<00:06:39.340> to<00:06:39.400> be<00:06:39.460> the<00:06:39.520> same<00:06:39.700> for

and you that's going to be the same for

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.170 
and you that's going to be the same for
the<00:06:39.940> fish<00:06:40.120> you<00:06:40.330> can<00:06:40.510> see<00:06:40.690> you<00:06:40.930> come<00:06:41.169> from<00:06:41.350> this

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
the fish you can see you come from this

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.010 
the fish you can see you come from this
to<00:06:43.180> this<00:06:44.160> so<00:06:45.160> folks<00:06:45.370> that's<00:06:45.669> why<00:06:46.150> I<00:06:46.180> now<00:06:46.600> use<00:06:46.990> a

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
to this so folks that's why I now use a

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.450 
to this so folks that's why I now use a
fluorocarbon<00:06:47.500> leader<00:06:47.770> and<00:06:48.070> that's<00:06:48.220> why<00:06:48.400> I<00:06:48.430> use

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
fluorocarbon leader and that's why I use

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.210 
fluorocarbon leader and that's why I use
the<00:06:48.820> Alberto<00:06:49.240> nut<00:06:49.450> because<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:50.800> stronger

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
the Alberto nut because the stronger

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.460 
the Alberto nut because the stronger
they're<00:06:51.370> more<00:06:51.580> I<00:06:51.610> pull<00:06:52.060> on<00:06:52.090> this<00:06:52.510> the<00:06:53.200> more<00:06:53.350> the

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
they're more I pull on this the more the

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.010 
they're more I pull on this the more the
fish<00:06:53.620> balls<00:06:53.800> on<00:06:54.010> this<00:06:54.160> that<00:06:55.090> braid<00:06:55.419> actually

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
fish balls on this that braid actually

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.380 
fish balls on this that braid actually
cuts<00:06:56.320> into<00:06:56.919> the<00:06:57.250> fluorocarbon<00:06:57.820> and<00:06:58.180> like

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
cuts into the fluorocarbon and like

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.560 
cuts into the fluorocarbon and like
practically<00:06:58.990> fuses<00:06:59.530> together<00:06:59.710> with<00:07:00.100> it<00:07:00.310> I

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
practically fuses together with it I

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.920 
practically fuses together with it I
have<00:07:01.570> break<00:07:02.200> off<00:07:02.520> ten<00:07:03.520> times<00:07:03.880> more<00:07:04.540> than<00:07:04.810> I

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
have break off ten times more than I

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.630 
have break off ten times more than I
have<00:07:05.110> this<00:07:05.290> not<00:07:05.530> come<00:07:05.770> apart<00:07:06.010> it's<00:07:06.250> not<00:07:06.400> just

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
have this not come apart it's not just

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.659
