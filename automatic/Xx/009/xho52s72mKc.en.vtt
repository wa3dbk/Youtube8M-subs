00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
excellent workout for me just because I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.570 
excellent workout for me just because I
can<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.570> body<00:01:27.810> parts<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.520> don't

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
can get all my body parts in and I don't

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.609 
can get all my body parts in and I don't
have<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.909> stuck<00:01:30.150> inside<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.450> gym<00:01:30.810> which<00:01:31.020> can

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
have to be stuck inside a gym which can

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.620 
have to be stuck inside a gym which can
be<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> little<00:01:31.830> bit<00:01:32.009> tedious<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.520> boring<00:01:32.759> and
