that what I did for my close friends is

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.330 
that what I did for my close friends is
that<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> took<00:01:28.530> them<00:01:28.710> all<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.130> dinner

that I took them all out for dinner

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
that I took them all out for dinner
because<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.360> could<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> shopping<00:01:31.470> mall

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
because I could go to the shopping mall

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.219 
because I could go to the shopping mall
and<00:01:32.040> buy<00:01:32.820> each<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.390> individual<00:01:33.900> gifts

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
and buy each of them individual gifts

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
and buy each of them individual gifts
but<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:35.880> would

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
but I really don't know what they would

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.580 
but I really don't know what they would
want<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.079> want<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> give<00:01:37.439> them

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
want or you know I want to give them

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.410 
want or you know I want to give them
something<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.250> practical<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.360> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
something that's more practical but I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.270 
something that's more practical but I
think<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.930> spending<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.409> quality<00:01:40.829> time<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
think just spending that quality time is

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
think just spending that quality time is
