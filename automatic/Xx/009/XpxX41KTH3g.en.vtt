00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
then like literally two days later it

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.550 
then like literally two days later it
was<00:03:18.859> confirmed<00:03:18.970> but<00:03:19.970> some<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:21.230> you're<00:03:21.410> gonna

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
was confirmed but some so you're gonna

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.140 
was confirmed but some so you're gonna
be<00:03:21.709> able<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:21.950> play<00:03:22.070> through<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.430> campaign<00:03:22.459> all

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
be able to play through the campaign all

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.849 
be able to play through the campaign all
in<00:03:23.329> first<00:03:23.570> person<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:24.350> going<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.620> be<00:03:24.709> pretty

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
in first person it's going to be pretty

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.259 
in first person it's going to be pretty
much<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.310> same<00:03:25.489> camp<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:25.970> think<00:03:26.150> they<00:03:26.239> have

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
much the same camp and I think they have

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.030 
much the same camp and I think they have
might<00:03:26.570> have<00:03:26.690> added<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:27.049> few<00:03:27.350> new<00:03:27.410> missions<00:03:27.859> and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
might have added a few new missions and

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.259 
might have added a few new missions and
things<00:03:28.190> like<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.370> pretty<00:03:28.880> much<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.120> same

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
things like that pretty much the same

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.910 
things like that pretty much the same
campaign<00:03:29.720> it's<00:03:30.290> just<00:03:30.500> you're<00:03:30.590> playing<00:03:30.620> in

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
campaign it's just you're playing in

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.160 
campaign it's just you're playing in
first<00:03:31.190> person<00:03:31.400> rather<00:03:32.209> than<00:03:32.329> third<00:03:32.720> person

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
first person rather than third person

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.470 
first person rather than third person
would<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:33.440> guys<00:03:33.590> want<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.250> see<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.790> kind<00:03:35.420> of

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
would you guys want to see a kind of

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.170 
would you guys want to see a kind of
like<00:03:35.660> remake<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:37.130> campaign<00:03:37.579> of<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.910> game

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
like remake of the campaign of that game

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.430 
like remake of the campaign of that game
that's<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:38.989> something<00:03:39.320> I'm<00:03:39.410> really

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
that's just it's something I'm really

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.960 
that's just it's something I'm really
struggling<00:03:39.920> with<00:03:40.070> because<00:03:40.310> it's<00:03:40.549> not<00:03:40.760> like

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
struggling with because it's not like

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.580 
struggling with because it's not like
it's<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.180> short<00:03:41.450> campaign<00:03:41.840> like<00:03:42.019> our<00:03:42.170> campaign

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
it's a short campaign like our campaign

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.840 
it's a short campaign like our campaign
series<00:03:42.920> is<00:03:43.010> like<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> hundred<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.549> fifty

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
series is like a hundred and fifty

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.910 
series is like a hundred and fifty
episodes<00:03:43.970> or<00:03:44.570> something<00:03:45.260> ridiculous<00:03:45.350> and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
episodes or something ridiculous and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.130 
episodes or something ridiculous and
like<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.280> feel<00:03:47.180> like<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.450> first<00:03:47.630> person<00:03:47.870> is

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
like I feel like the first person is

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.090 
like I feel like the first person is
really<00:03:48.350> going<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.560> make<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> pretty<00:03:48.890> big

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
really going to make a pretty big

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.229 
really going to make a pretty big
difference<00:03:49.250> like<00:03:49.609> just<00:03:49.820> watching<00:03:49.970> the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
difference like just watching the

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.030 
difference like just watching the
trailer<00:03:50.420> if<00:03:50.570> you<00:03:50.630> guys<00:03:50.750> watch<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.170> trailer<00:03:51.500> it

trailer if you guys watch the trailer it

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.920 
trailer if you guys watch the trailer it
was<00:03:52.220> like<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:53.120> almost<00:03:53.390> seemed<00:03:53.720> like<00:03:53.750> a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
was like it almost seemed like a

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.020 
was like it almost seemed like a
different<00:03:54.109> game<00:03:54.440> but<00:03:54.650> at<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.769> same<00:03:54.980> time<00:03:55.250> it's

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
different game but at the same time it's

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.340 
different game but at the same time it's
stuff<00:03:56.299> we've<00:03:56.450> already<00:03:56.480> seen<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.049> feel

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350
