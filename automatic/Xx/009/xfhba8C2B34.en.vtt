00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
fight with an orang Arland so we need to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.190

find<00:02:37.960> some<00:02:38.140> red<00:02:38.320> men<00:02:38.530> at<00:02:38.710> play<00:02:38.800> second<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:40.540> his

find some red men at play second as his

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.860 
find some red men at play second as his
random<00:02:41.890> contaminated<00:02:42.880> bond<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.420> effectively

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
random contaminated bond is effectively

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.860 
random contaminated bond is effectively
wrecked<00:02:44.350> us<00:02:44.590> right<00:02:44.860> now<00:02:46.410> right<00:02:48.870> that's

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
wrecked us right now right that's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:14.620 
wrecked us right now right that's
annoying

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:35.680 

while

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:51.230 

need<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.410> mountain

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:04:09.920 

nice<00:03:51.980> deck

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.610 

so<00:04:14.299> inquisition<00:04:15.299> seems<00:04:15.719> reasonable<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.500> this

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
so inquisition seems reasonable in this

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:29.110 
so inquisition seems reasonable in this
matchup

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:51.740 

wonder<00:04:29.900> how<00:04:30.020> many<00:04:30.080> Oren<00:04:30.590> Arlit<00:04:31.010> he<00:04:31.220> has

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.500 

sure
