let's<00:00:13.250> go

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
let's go

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.010 
let's go
show<00:00:16.340> you<00:00:16.520> how<00:00:16.700> you<00:00:17.000> can<00:00:17.180> take<00:00:17.360> the<00:00:17.570> dash<00:00:17.780> of

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
show you how you can take the dash of

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.080 
show you how you can take the dash of
your<00:00:18.080> car<00:00:18.350> apart<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:19.220> fix<00:00:19.400> any<00:00:19.580> problems

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
your car apart to fix any problems

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.630 
your car apart to fix any problems
inside<00:00:20.420> like<00:00:20.660> burned<00:00:20.900> out<00:00:21.080> light<00:00:21.260> bulbs<00:00:21.740> now<00:00:22.610> a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
inside like burned out light bulbs now a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.160 
inside like burned out light bulbs now a
lot<00:00:22.880> of<00:00:22.910> people<00:00:23.270> are<00:00:23.390> afraid<00:00:23.510> of<00:00:23.869> taking<00:00:23.960> the

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
lot of people are afraid of taking the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.839 
lot of people are afraid of taking the
dash<00:00:24.350> apart<00:00:24.740> but<00:00:25.130> in<00:00:25.250> most<00:00:25.400> cars<00:00:25.610> it's

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
dash apart but in most cars it's

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.700 
dash apart but in most cars it's
actually<00:00:26.240> pretty<00:00:26.480> simple<00:00:26.869> because<00:00:27.380> there's

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
actually pretty simple because there's

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.270 
actually pretty simple because there's
not<00:00:27.860> that<00:00:28.040> many<00:00:28.160> parts<00:00:28.550> to<00:00:28.640> take<00:00:28.849> off<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:31.130> if

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280 
not that many parts to take off and if

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.589 
not that many parts to take off and if
you<00:00:31.400> look<00:00:31.550> at<00:00:31.670> Miss<00:00:31.789> Toyota<00:00:32.180> you'll<00:00:32.449> see

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
you look at Miss Toyota you'll see

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.090 
you look at Miss Toyota you'll see
there's<00:00:32.840> two<00:00:33.320> holes<00:00:33.500> here

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
there's two holes here

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.860 
there's two holes here
they<00:00:34.460> have<00:00:34.580> Phillips<00:00:35.000> screws<00:00:35.360> in<00:00:35.600> them<00:00:35.720> so<00:00:35.840> you

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
they have Phillips screws in them so you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.410 
they have Phillips screws in them so you
get<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.080> full<00:00:36.260> screw<00:00:36.590> driver<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.790> in<00:00:38.059> this<00:00:38.180> case

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
get a full screw driver and in this case

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.360 
get a full screw driver and in this case
you<00:00:38.600> use<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:38.780> stubby<00:00:39.350> Phillips<00:00:39.739> screwdriver<00:00:40.220> a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
you use a stubby Phillips screwdriver a

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.640 
you use a stubby Phillips screwdriver a
short<00:00:40.670> one<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.360> will<00:00:41.570> fit<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.140> won't<00:00:42.290> Jam

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
short one so will fit in and won't Jam

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.860 
short one so will fit in and won't Jam
against<00:00:43.070> part<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.400> plastic<00:00:43.720> then<00:00:44.720> you

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
against part of the plastic then you

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.299 
against part of the plastic then you
just<00:00:45.050> stick<00:00:45.290> it<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.559> hole<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:45.920> take<00:00:46.160> the

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
just stick it in the hole and take the

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.590 
just stick it in the hole and take the
two<00:00:46.460> screws<00:00:46.820> out<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:48.399> out<00:00:49.399> they<00:00:49.579> come<00:00:49.610> and

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
two screws out and out they come and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.970 
two screws out and out they come and
then<00:00:50.780> if<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:50.989> have<00:00:51.110> an<00:00:51.170> adjustable<00:00:51.649> steering

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
then if you have an adjustable steering

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.910 
then if you have an adjustable steering
column<00:00:52.370> like<00:00:52.520> this<00:00:52.730> pull<00:00:53.630> it<00:00:53.809> out<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:54.770> got

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
column like this pull it out so you got

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.830 
column like this pull it out so you got
the<00:00:55.040> most<00:00:55.219> space<00:00:55.550> possible<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:56.329> get<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.630> -

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
the most space possible to get the -

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.139 
the most space possible to get the -
piece<00:00:57.140> out<00:00:57.380> then<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.430> get<00:00:58.579> your<00:00:58.730> fingers

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
piece out then you get your fingers

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.110 
piece out then you get your fingers

right<00:01:05.720> up<00:01:05.899> now<00:01:06.530> we<00:01:06.590> haven't<00:01:07.009> touched<00:01:07.130> on

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
right up now we haven't touched on

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.760 
right up now we haven't touched on
anything<00:01:07.550> electronic<00:01:08.180> yet<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.140> now<00:01:09.380> it's<00:01:09.590> time

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770

to disconnect one of the battery cables
before<00:01:11.899> we<00:01:11.990> get<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.259> electronics<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.430> we

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
before we get the electronics so we

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.550 
before we get the electronics so we
don't<00:01:13.729> short<00:01:14.060> anything<00:01:14.479> out<00:01:14.630> we'll<00:01:15.530> just

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
take that battery cable off you can't

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.790 
take that battery cable off you can't
short<00:01:32.720> anything<00:01:32.990> out<00:01:33.259> while<00:01:33.500> you're<00:01:33.649> working

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
hold the dash unit in place there's one

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.919 
hold the dash unit in place there's one
on<00:01:39.679> each<00:01:39.709> corner<00:01:40.119> then<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.149> tilt<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.599> dash<00:01:41.899> a

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
on each corner then you tilt the dash a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.070 
on each corner then you tilt the dash a
little<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.619> start<00:01:43.099> to<00:01:43.369> pull<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.700> up<00:01:43.959> then<00:01:44.959> when

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
little and start to pull it up then when

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.419 
little and start to pull it up then when
you<00:01:45.170> get<00:01:45.289> into<00:01:45.500> part<00:01:45.740> way<00:01:45.920> out<00:01:46.099> you<00:01:46.280> see

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
you get into part way out you see

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.190 
you get into part way out you see
