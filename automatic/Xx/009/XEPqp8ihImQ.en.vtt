white then this quilt it's a white on
white<00:00:31.359> as<00:00:32.199> the<00:00:33.390> graphic<00:00:34.390> that<00:00:34.539> pulls<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:34.929> all

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
white as the graphic that pulls it all

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.169 
white as the graphic that pulls it all
together<00:00:35.140> okay<00:00:35.559> so<00:00:36.489> we're<00:00:36.699> going<00:00:36.789> to<00:00:36.850> go<00:00:36.969> down

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
together okay so we're going to go down

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.479 
together okay so we're going to go down
through<00:00:37.449> all<00:00:37.839> of<00:00:37.899> your<00:00:38.319> five<00:00:39.100> inch<00:00:39.249> squares

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
through all of your five inch squares

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.219 
through all of your five inch squares
and<00:00:39.609> you're<00:00:39.729> going<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:39.999> put<00:00:40.239> two<00:00:40.629> together<00:00:40.839> and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
and you're going to put two together and

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.619 
and you're going to put two together and
you're<00:00:41.319> going<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.469> create<00:00:41.769> a<00:00:42.179> two<00:00:43.179> patch<00:00:43.359> like

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
you're going to create a two patch like

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.930 
you're going to create a two patch like
this<00:00:43.839> so<00:00:44.319> the<00:00:44.889> first<00:00:45.039> thing<00:00:45.219> you<00:00:45.280> need<00:00:45.699> to<00:00:45.729> do

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
this so the first thing you need to do

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.369 
this so the first thing you need to do
is<00:00:46.059> then<00:00:46.239> just<00:00:46.269> go<00:00:46.719> down<00:00:46.899> through<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.289> entire

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
is then just go down through the entire

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.799 
is then just go down through the entire
stack<00:00:47.859> pair<00:00:48.549> up<00:00:48.729> twos<00:00:49.059> make<00:00:49.420> sure<00:00:49.569> that<00:00:49.690> you

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
stack pair up twos make sure that you

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.299 
stack pair up twos make sure that you
don't<00:00:49.989> end<00:00:50.139> up<00:00:50.170> with<00:00:50.229> two<00:00:50.559> of<00:00:50.679> the<00:00:50.739> same<00:00:50.920> print

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
don't end up with two of the same print

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.389 
don't end up with two of the same print
at<00:00:51.999> the<00:00:52.179> end<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:53.469> you<00:00:53.769> don't<00:00:54.159> probably

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
at the end because you don't probably

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.039 
at the end because you don't probably
want<00:00:54.699> to<00:00:54.760> have<00:00:54.940> two<00:00:55.420> fabrics<00:00:55.780> together

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
want to have two fabrics together

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.930 
want to have two fabrics together
they're<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.289> same<00:00:56.559> so<00:00:57.159> once<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:57.579> get<00:00:57.760> done

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
they're the same so once you get done

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.910 
they're the same so once you get done
and<00:00:58.149> pairing<00:00:58.539> them<00:00:58.659> all<00:00:58.809> up<00:00:58.989> pressing<00:00:59.559> them

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
and pairing them all up pressing them

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.430 
and pairing them all up pressing them
nice<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:00.760> neat<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.179> can<00:01:01.479> then<00:01:01.719> stack<00:01:02.170> up

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
nice and neat you can then stack up

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.280 
nice and neat you can then stack up
three<00:01:03.309> or<00:01:03.399> four<00:01:03.429> layers<00:01:03.819> of<00:01:04.210> two<00:01:05.020> patches

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
three or four layers of two patches

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.010 
three or four layers of two patches
together<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.280> you're<00:01:06.970> going<00:01:07.150> to<00:01:07.210> be<00:01:07.390> splicing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
together and you're going to be splicing

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.050 
together and you're going to be splicing
them<00:01:08.200> down<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.710> center<00:01:09.070> so<00:01:09.460> since<00:01:09.850> this<00:01:10.000> is

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
them down the center so since this is

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.090 
them down the center so since this is
five<00:01:10.450> inches<00:01:10.690> wide<00:01:11.050> we're<00:01:11.740> going<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:11.980> be

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
five inches wide we're going to be

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.150 
five inches wide we're going to be
cutting<00:01:12.370> it<00:01:12.580> at<00:01:12.760> the<00:01:12.880> two<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.270> half<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.770> I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
cutting it at the two and a half so I

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.880 
cutting it at the two and a half so I
have<00:01:16.090> offset<00:01:16.720> these<00:01:16.930> by<00:01:17.320> about<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.620> quarter

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
have offset these by about a quarter

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.710 
have offset these by about a quarter
inch<00:01:18.040> just<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.700> know<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.300> have<00:01:19.480> all<00:01:19.690> of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
inch just so I know that I have all of

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.800 
inch just so I know that I have all of
them<00:01:20.050> nice<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:20.830> squared<00:01:21.100> up<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.630> want<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.690> take

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
them nice and squared up I want to take

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.530 
them nice and squared up I want to take
a<00:01:22.840> ruler<00:01:23.110> in<00:01:23.440> and<00:01:23.800> we're<00:01:24.640> going<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:24.820> cut<00:01:25.120> one

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
a ruler in and we're going to cut one

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.440 
a ruler in and we're going to cut one
two<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.710> half<00:01:27.010> so<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.000> two<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.300> a<00:01:28.330> half

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
two and a half so the two and a half

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.620 
two and a half so the two and a half
line<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.960> along<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.880> cut<00:01:30.880> edge<00:01:31.060> here<00:01:31.480> or

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
line is along the cut edge here or

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.270 
line is along the cut edge here or
they're<00:01:31.750> all<00:01:31.840> matched<00:01:32.050> up<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.440> I'm<00:01:33.070> just

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
they're all matched up and I'm just

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.640 
they're all matched up and I'm just
picking<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.760> random<00:01:34.020> horizontal<00:01:35.020> line<00:01:35.200> then<00:01:35.440> to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
picking a random horizontal line then to

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.830 
picking a random horizontal line then to
match<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.460> seam<00:01:36.730> line<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.240> top<00:01:37.420> piece

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
match the seam line of the top piece

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.490 
match the seam line of the top piece
here<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:39.100> down<00:01:39.790> through<00:01:40.180> all<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.990> stacks<00:01:41.260> at

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
here and down through all the stacks at

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.520 
here and down through all the stacks at
once<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.550> I've<00:01:42.790> got<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:43.780> great<00:01:43.990> set<00:01:44.350> of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
once so that I've got this great set of

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.430 
once so that I've got this great set of
pairs<00:01:45.450> now<00:01:46.450> we<00:01:46.510> don't<00:01:46.690> want<00:01:46.870> to<00:01:46.930> stack<00:01:47.170> them<00:01:47.350> on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
pairs now we don't want to stack them on

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.500 
pairs now we don't want to stack them on
top<00:01:47.650> of<00:01:47.710> each<00:01:47.890> other<00:01:48.100> because<00:01:48.580> when<00:01:49.000> we<00:01:49.150> pull

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
top of each other because when we pull

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.730 
top of each other because when we pull
this<00:01:49.600> apart<00:01:49.750> what<00:01:50.080> we're<00:01:50.200> going<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.470> be<00:01:50.530> doing

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
this apart what we're going to be doing

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.880 
this apart what we're going to be doing
is<00:01:51.070> adding<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:52.090> white<00:01:52.480> rectangle<00:01:52.720> down<00:01:53.680> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
is adding a white rectangle down the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.950 
is adding a white rectangle down the
center<00:01:54.250> down<00:01:55.000> through<00:01:55.330> all<00:01:55.480> of<00:01:55.510> these<00:01:55.750> and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
center down through all of these and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.380 
center down through all of these and
making<00:01:56.229> these<00:01:56.350> into<00:01:56.680> blocks<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.240> our

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
making these into blocks so this is our

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.090 
making these into blocks so this is our
goal<00:01:59.040> like<00:02:00.040> this<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:01.210> I'm<00:02:01.300> going<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.570> take

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
goal like this so I'm going to take

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.620 
goal like this so I'm going to take
these<00:02:03.100> two<00:02:03.400> pieces<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.210> would<00:02:04.300> take<00:02:04.479> them

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
these two pieces and it would take them

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.590 
these two pieces and it would take them
to<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.780> sewing<00:02:05.080> machine<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.409> add<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:06.600> quarter

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
to the sewing machine and add a quarter

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.119 
to the sewing machine and add a quarter
inch<00:02:07.720> seam<00:02:08.609> down<00:02:09.609> through<00:02:09.909> here<00:02:10.149> press<00:02:11.139> open

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
inch seam down through here press open

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.020 
inch seam down through here press open
that<00:02:12.340> so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
that so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.340 
that so
the<00:02:13.120> seam<00:02:13.330> allowance<00:02:13.600> goes<00:02:13.660> towards<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
the seam allowance goes towards the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.180 
the seam allowance goes towards the
white<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.910> then<00:02:15.910> come<00:02:16.390> back<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:17.020> pick<00:02:17.830> up<00:02:17.980> its

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
white and then come back and pick up its

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.699 
white and then come back and pick up its
mate<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.180> everything<00:02:19.569> matches<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.530> this

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
mate so that everything matches so this

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.240 
mate so that everything matches so this
block<00:02:21.010> then<00:02:21.310> becomes<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:22.209> in<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.690> end<00:02:23.250> again

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
block then becomes this in the end again

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.309 
block then becomes this in the end again
pressing<00:02:24.940> seam<00:02:25.330> allowances<00:02:25.780> toward<00:02:26.170> the

doing<00:02:29.500> working<00:02:29.770> with<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.520> can

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
doing working with that then you can

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.260 
doing working with that then you can
also<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.340> add<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.730> second<00:02:34.060> side

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
also see when you add the second side

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.690 
also see when you add the second side
the<00:02:35.020> little<00:02:35.200> way<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.470> keep<00:02:35.950> track<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.550> make

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
the little way to keep track that make

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.690 
the little way to keep track that make
sure<00:02:36.850> this<00:02:37.000> seam<00:02:37.600> goes<00:02:38.319> continuously<00:02:39.040> across

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
sure this seam goes continuously across

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.780 
sure this seam goes continuously across
and<00:02:40.060> doesn't<00:02:40.270> slide<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.720> one<00:02:40.870> side<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
and doesn't slide to one side is to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.330 
and doesn't slide to one side is to
match<00:02:43.000> up<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.420> seam<00:02:43.660> allowance<00:02:43.989> here<00:02:44.340> with

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
match up the seam allowance here with

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.130 
match up the seam allowance here with
the<00:02:45.459> front<00:02:45.700> face<00:02:45.910> here<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.930> know

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the front face here so that you know

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.160 
the front face here so that you know
when<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:47.890> open<00:02:47.920> this<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:49.510> seam<00:02:49.810> will<00:02:50.019> has

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
when you open this this seam will has

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.479 
when you open this this seam will has
looked<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.890> going<00:02:51.160> straight<00:02:51.340> through

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
looked like it's going straight through

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.000 
looked like it's going straight through
the<00:02:51.730> block<00:02:52.080> okay<00:02:53.080> so<00:02:53.410> we're<00:02:53.530> gonna<00:02:53.620> create

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
the block okay so we're gonna create

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.040 
the block okay so we're gonna create
down<00:02:54.670> through<00:02:54.940> all<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.209> our<00:02:55.510> pairs<00:02:55.840> we're

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
down through all of our pairs we're

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.620 
down through all of our pairs we're
gonna<00:02:56.140> create<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.650> block<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.250> then<00:02:57.940> you'll

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
gonna create this block and then you'll

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.960 
gonna create this block and then you'll
see<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.380> we're<00:02:59.590> going<00:02:59.769> to<00:03:00.130> be<00:03:00.959> joining<00:03:02.970> block

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
see that we're going to be joining block

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.400 
see that we're going to be joining block
to<00:03:04.330> block<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:05.760> then<00:03:06.930> we're<00:03:07.930> going<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.200> create

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
to block and then we're going to create

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.780 
to block and then we're going to create
rows<00:03:08.970> within<00:03:09.970> our<00:03:10.209> quilt<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:11.640> there<00:03:12.640> are

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
rows within our quilt and there are

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.120 
rows within our quilt and there are
wider<00:03:13.060> sashing<00:03:13.720> strips<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.860> run

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
wider sashing strips that run

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.430 
wider sashing strips that run
horizontally<00:03:15.430> across<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.180> quilt<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:17.290> we're

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
horizontally across the quilt so we're

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.120 
horizontally across the quilt so we're
going<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.590> be<00:03:17.739> adding<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.340> piece<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:19.090> here

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
going to be adding this piece in here

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.270 
going to be adding this piece in here
and<00:03:21.130> again<00:03:21.790> we<00:03:22.269> want<00:03:22.510> these<00:03:22.780> lines<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:24.040> seem

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
and again we want these lines to seem

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.340 
and again we want these lines to seem
continuous<00:03:25.000> as<00:03:25.239> if<00:03:25.390> they<00:03:25.600> weave<00:03:25.810> through<00:03:26.230> the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
continuous as if they weave through the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.090 
continuous as if they weave through the
quilts<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.700> order<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.030> do<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:29.100> we're

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
quilts and in order to do that we're

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.440 
quilts and in order to do that we're
going<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.280> flip<00:03:30.430> our<00:03:30.549> fabric<00:03:30.910> over<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.360> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
going to flip our fabric over to the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.569 
going to flip our fabric over to the
wrong<00:03:31.600> side<00:03:31.980> white<00:03:32.980> n<00:03:33.130> white<00:03:33.340> can<00:03:33.549> be

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
wrong side white n white can be

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.220 
wrong side white n white can be
sometimes<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.450> challenge<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.959> make<00:03:35.079> sure

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
sometimes of a challenge to make sure

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.449 
sometimes of a challenge to make sure
that<00:03:35.350> you've<00:03:35.470> got<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.709> right<00:03:35.860> side<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
that you've got the right side of the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.910 
that you've got the right side of the
fabric<00:03:36.640> but<00:03:37.030> double<00:03:37.600> check<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.049> you're<00:03:38.799> going

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
fabric but double check and you're going

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.259 
fabric but double check and you're going
to<00:03:38.950> come<00:03:39.160> in<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.519> you're<00:03:39.670> going<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.940> use<00:03:40.239> a

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
to come in and you're going to use a

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.780 
to come in and you're going to use a
marking<00:03:40.780> tool<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:41.980> can<00:03:42.070> make<00:03:42.160> small

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
marking tool and you can make small

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.810 
marking tool and you can make small
little<00:03:43.630> like<00:03:43.989> registration<00:03:44.410> marks<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
little like registration marks in the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
little like registration marks in the
seam<00:03:46.060> allowance<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.000> would<00:03:49.329> Merrick<00:03:49.630> mark

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
seam allowance so I would Merrick mark

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.270 
seam allowance so I would Merrick mark
here<00:03:50.340> here<00:03:51.540> here<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:52.750> then<00:03:52.930> off<00:03:53.109> this<00:03:53.440> one<00:03:53.739> all

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
here here here and then off this one all

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.030 
here here here and then off this one all
the<00:03:54.579> way<00:03:54.670> along<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.359> I<00:03:55.390> can<00:03:55.690> match<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:57.010> I

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
the way along so that I can match so I

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.800 
the way along so that I can match so I
know<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:57.340> this<00:03:57.760> is<00:03:57.940> going<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.209> be<00:03:58.359> in<00:03:58.480> place
