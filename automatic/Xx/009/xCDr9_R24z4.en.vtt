00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.690
 welcome back to one 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.940
 new edition of the terminal blocks 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.280
 eureka on clever stone erik de and also 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.320
 at 1000 stones de manna moscow I go 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.910
 present regularly from lego now and 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.490
 I already announced it 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.789
 work through this lego movie set 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 through and are now at 7 0 8 0 1 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.499
 arrived what on the beautiful 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.640
 romantic names become space and 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.520
 we just get ideas here 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.920
 on the pack and we are yes 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.070
 as I said in the world of how 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.520
 the movie appears in april 2004 with us 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.180
 in the word usa i mentioned it and it 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.969
 is that we the good endgames 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.710
 which is nothing but a normal one 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.140
 resident and suddenly somehow 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.930
 is pulled in somewhere and you think 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.780
 he is the messiah and he must now 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.640
 the piece of resistance probably somehow 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.679
 protect further brings watt with him 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.020
 and a probably very unsympathetic gentleman 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.549
 with name lord business the trial grad 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.530
 to seize world domination and 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.600
 even the fantasy to take us away 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.640
 because of course you have against as lego fans 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.500
 and that's why we just have to 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.290
 defend and we already see in 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.630
 this little z for 14 99 are not 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.329
 only 122 parts in it but also three 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.950
 mini figures including the m and and 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.650
 that's pretty much not to say 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.450
 exactly the same as in the set 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.420
 I discussed last week 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.829
 namely the flight with the glider also 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.290
 the scared face is back 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.450
 Here and this beautiful great with 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.560
 this little hairline up there man 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 Note if you go again 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.119
 From above it looks like red 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.520
 That said, that's the piece of resistance 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.430
 yes that is the evil in this set 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.590
 namely the swatch robot ago 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 You can see that he is a policeman 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.530
 that's why spot is swt and he has one 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.840
 robot face and only 1 otherwise 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.460
 well decorated with appropriate brands 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.640
 and even there is a radio in the back 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.460
 elegant, so to speak 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.420
 otherwise head has nothing else than 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.450
 Robot head and a weapon in hand 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.280
 it must be as bad for that 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.750
 highlight what the figures are in 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.580
 this set is that here 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.800
 or this lady who is 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.410
 Namely wildstyle is called each with 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.020
 y, she also looks 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.300
 nice in black he kept so ninja 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.810
 look you have to say and she has an ax 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.490
 in the hand 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.930
 with that she wants the emmett in 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.660
 Here we come free this set 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.640
 equal to what also nice firstly 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.710
 she has a nice face and she has 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.910
 a pretty flexible hat we there 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.950
 just had in hand 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.850
 you have to look very closely that 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.380
 the faces are really 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.090
 they make a difference with ease 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.490
 my behind a bit dogged 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.310
 in front a bit more friendly 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.510
 yes and that's exactly how hipster is 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.070
 we do not do it now but like that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.890
 that sounds and then we have too 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.970
 already pulled the hooded pullover so pure 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.890
 as we may perhaps from the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.200
 Trailer from the movie already know 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.170
 And this is the melting pot 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.020
 or that's our good 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.750
 reader looks a bit like out 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.709
 including a james bond movie 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.959
 switchboard what we have with two 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.540
 button a few ads and up here 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.190
 this is the laser and you can 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.070
 it almost suspect in this construct 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.590
 not only good in the sense of not being too 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.750
 say he wants our ans ans 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.100
 leather or in this case different pieces 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.720
 the resistance that he has on the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.340
 back then we'll see you soon 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.110
 Here we see the laser is also with 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.310
 connected to a corresponding hose 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.590
 and on the other side 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.880
 there one never knows where else with the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.620
 handcuffs we all know about 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.180
 home because we have something there is a 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.670
 possibility because we can click in 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.770
 then left son there because that comes 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.170
 Delinquent on it so speak in this 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.050
 if our image has the goal yes 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.250
 be tormented since you are still like that 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.350
 possibilities to bind him firmly and 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.840
 then put it on the laser to all 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.640
 compose must be around that 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.500
 good piece of resistance to remove 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.650
 we can move everything before and he 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.900
 moves cliffs and also the laser out and 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.030
 move on so now take that 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.680
 Emmett and we pack now 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.989
 face down so she owns it 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.560
 namely in this set here in his 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.390
 chair 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.000
 there was the piece of resistance this 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.900
 red behind and yes there must now one 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.850
 fumble a bit 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.430
 but we can do that already 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.890
 find end to back and then now 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.660
 please do not scream but just 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.390
 to endure and here 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.650
 the chains to the hand what you ask 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.230
 with hold on 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.060
 that brings a little bit to everyone 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.880
 More fun only and then bring the now 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.370
 We'll click on that laser now 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.080
 We can see that too 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.210
 James Bond can be 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.380
 Fantastic at least if you are here 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.180
 Do not have to sit on this chair and 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.100
 We also see the laser in the back 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.930
 everywhere so little lights so here 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.390
 indicated lights we can do everything 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.000
 we can move and move everything 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.980
 and so if you want you can go there 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.480
 quite a bit flexible the whole 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.200
 show and if it should go around 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.880
 still turn 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.440
 we can already see the smiles here 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.990
 we can get away too much 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.600
 Of course, and we'll see it now 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.890
 right here for now 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.210
 strapped and then he wants 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.410
 of course, his scared 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.240
 have face else that makes it all 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.220
 no fun here with the laser you see 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.750
 there he has him and now we can do it all 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.190
 good piece so then the piece of 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.400
 Resistance ran 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.500
 yes yes yes, here she is also tormenting us 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.330
 and the good is yes we have the yes 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.080
 Wildstyle and she wants us with the yes 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.940
 to liberate the ax 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.400
 the skin by cold namely the so 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.320
 the story here then we see how 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.860
 the whole thing is built on the 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.690
 set course parts 122 said yes already 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.970
 you have them in the quarter of an hour 20 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.370
 minutes together and already can 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.180
 the great fun with the reader machine 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:51.680
 and strapped to the ad then go off 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.270
 because we have so nice there 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.740
 small set I must confess the 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.150
 I actually found gliders now 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.070
 a bit nicer that somehow had 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.400
 a few more interesting that grows 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.440
 So here then I am so close 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.360
 especially wildstyle there so the 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.330
 Minifigures that I find the nicest 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.040
 and so on readers and games 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.450
 such stories are the can 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.200
 of course, this set also his 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.730
 have fun 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.890
 that was it for today with the 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.900
 small building block lyric and at 1000 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.850
 stones dw we will then at 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.980
 see you again in a few days and hear and 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.760
 which is yours will that be that 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.380
 you will never betray 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.380
 look in and bye
