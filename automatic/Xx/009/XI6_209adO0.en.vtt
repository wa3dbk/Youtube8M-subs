-Attention banana lovers.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.660
Use up overripe bananas with this moist and
delicious banana cake featuring 3 bananas

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.000
in each batch.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.199
First, start by greasing a 13 x 9 inch baking
pan then flour the pan.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.999
As an alternate, to make a layer cake, you
can also use two 8 or 9-inch round cake pans.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.780
Go ahead and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.140
Next, to two and a quarter cups of all purpose
flour in a mixing bowl, add one and a half

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.690
cups of sugar, one and a half teaspoons of
baking power, one teaspoon of baking soda,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.420
and a half teaspoon of salt.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.719
Stir these dry ingredients together well.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.880
Now we'll add the wet ingredients.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.350
Add 1 cup of mashed rice bananas.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.079
It will take about 3 bananas to make 1 cup.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.430
Next, pour in 3 quarters of a cup of buttermilk.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.140
Add a half cup of shortening and add 1 teaspoon
of vanilla.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.990
Use an electric mixer on low speed to combine
the ingredients then add 2 eggs and beat on

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.240
medium speed for 2 minutes.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.730
Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.930
Place the baking pan into the oven.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.360
Bake the cake until a wooden toothpick inserted
in the middle comes out clean.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.530
This will take about 35 minutes.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.070
It will take 5 or 10 less minutes to bake
round cake layers.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.190
Place the cake on a wire rack to cool.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.820
Once it's cooled thoroughly, frost it with
your favorite frosting.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.290
Cream cheese frosting pairs particularly well
with banana cakes, so we're trying that.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.500
And other frosting flavors such as chocolate
or peanut butter will be yummy too.
