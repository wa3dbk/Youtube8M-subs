00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.690
 good afternoon everyone good no doubt that 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.730
 today is a very important day 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.689
 for this institution 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.420
 and in which I have to present to 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.900
 our technical director Juan Antonio 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.140
 pizzi as many of you know your 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 great career as a footballer 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.730
 visiting in very important teams 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.160
 worldwide 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.150
 likewise began his career as 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.920
 technical director in argentina using the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.840
 Peruvian soccer 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.160
 later in Chilean football it was 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.829
 champion had a great experience 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.300
 and then return to Argentina where without 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.660
 doubt that it was a great stage in which 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.460
 he was also champion with san lorenzo 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.500
 we know that the last club met very 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.960
 important as is the valence of 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.270
 Spain 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.390
 so from my part Juan part of the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.260
 unity of people who come to a club 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.330
 where 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.710
 there is a great hobby that is very 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.260
 Pending what happens with this 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.750
 point that you know very well the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.540
 project that you have accepted from wadi of my 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.970
 I thank that commitment that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.350
 you had this body with your institution 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.840
 technical all your people 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.299
 and above all wish you much success I know 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.750
 that your ability in everything you've 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.869
 learned in all these years is going to 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.869
 come very well so welcome 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.810
 first I think this is a football that 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.899
 ah 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.579
 I have evolved remarkably all 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.579
 last 15 or 20 years older 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.330
 we probably can not place in the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.080
 first place of 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.390
 d 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.970
 in the world better indigo 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.979
 In America 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.170
 second and behind this institution there are 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.680
 a group that tells me my oldest of the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.430
 respects 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.739
 because he has shown not only in his 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.920
 equipment but in other activities a 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.220
 seriousness a commitment 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.550
 a dedication and above all has 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.460
 managed to be successful in most of 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.080
 they and 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.300
 and for me this was a very good 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.350
 opportunity 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.470
 that he could not stop taking advantage of 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.620
 have the ball out of the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.750
 Circulation possessions 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.080
 I like that I have the equipment is 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.190
 fundamental first possess something have something 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.900
 for 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.270
 to have it many times you have to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.819
 recover everything and that recovery how much 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.760
 sooner and faster 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.469
 much much more time to have the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.480
 ball in your possession and much more time goes 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:14.849
 to be a protagonist that what he wants 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.719
 no we are not with the right time no 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.719
 It is the problem 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.220
 let's work it 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.790
 with a physical adaptation to the beginning 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.970
 we will try to play some games 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.900
 friendly here in Mexico and we end up in 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.370
 the preparation prior to the start of 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:42.450
 championship for a colorful match in 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.490
 everyone to soccer is that life 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.110
 that is to honor and we are also 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.319
 constantly comparing 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.900
 and the things 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.900
 I believe that nobody should forget 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.560
 what did gustavo matosas 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:08.390
 this is the success they have had in this 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.290
 then neither 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:16.459
 although his masters as president 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.019
 and I just say it in advance 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.019
 to try to take advantage of all of 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.289
 good things that I think matoso did 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.710
 so it's not something that bothers me the 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.840
 comparison we're just looking at no no 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.190
 I have not even had the opportunity to 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.190
 be with the players 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.330
 I think it is broadly in line 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:44.540
 general the campus is made up of 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.540
 big modifications 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.070
 and what do we say we can 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.710
 strengthen let's suggest the club 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.780
 some alternatives and then decide 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.510
 If you can afford them, I always have 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.880
 the maximum ambition as far as wÃ¡n for 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.880
 teamwork independently of 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:10.919
 I always have the highest ambition and 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:13.439
 maximum ambition if you have to meet 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.670
 or we have to meet the objectives that 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:20.260
 they are allowing that 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:24.380
 that you get to achieve that achievement 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.530
 goal reference that may have been 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.080
 marked to remove the truth that does not pass 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.230
 long time we're talking 225 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.230
 years 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.499
 in my first experience outside of 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.499
 Argentina 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.729
 and another pretty pretty young 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.250
 and without a doubt it was the country and the 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.449
 football that taught me in my career that 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:58.319
 I arrive with great enthusiasm I come with many 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:02.419
 with much desire is a very challenging 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.419
 important in my career and in my life
