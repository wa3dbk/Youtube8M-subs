00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.869
 vargas I get very high this very long 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.849
 fighting what was born for the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.200
 repatriation of the machine and this for 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.349
 protect me 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.690
 and again that the fight with my 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.470
 mom 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.260
 it can be 26 130 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:35.260
 26 endeavor 26 equal back to 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.300
 talk about it then appears after 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.220
 the decision is defeated practically was 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.170
 done pretty fast in your mind that you 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.150
 you wanted to continue your career no no no no 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.519
 it's not what I said that night it was like that 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.610
 flight he fought want 26 wow fight but in 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.040
 26 then by chance of life I 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.000
 call a week and offer me for the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.069
 28th place Aug 28 26 because what stage and 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.690
 it was we say we think again we go to the 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.700
 opportunity let's do a little more 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.920
 of noise does not want to end my career 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.860
 the way he ends up escaping with 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.599
 several I want to do something come on 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.700
 win but if you have to it will be that 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.380
 we won and we were dragged bolt 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.019
 We're going to be a fight a lot 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.860
 more not finishing so we just 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.810
 never so that we come to win 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.730
 the fact that that opportunity has 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.250
 arrived was part of what helps you 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.540
 make the decision to continue as 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.370
 you came to that decision that I wanted 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.710
 follow because it's definitely the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.300
 opportunity for a fight that was 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:38.310
 World Cup to win a fight 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:42.620
 they should have two rounds and it was worth it 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.270
 the risk is worth the opportunity 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.880
 there are many people that as we say later 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.280
 of all the things that they had practiced 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.990
 to that fanatic that you have followed that 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.720
 has seen your fights that you say to 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.610
 them about that because you continue in 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.590
 boxing I do not think all of that will see 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.140
 and morals said there was a group of 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.910
 people who said they could not group 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.100
 said that if by the state this group is 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.780
 since if the project egalitarian jose 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.489
 many people say no 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.200
 the group maybe smaller that says 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.600
 that if I have to follow that I think that 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.640
 you already maqueda still feel in the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.010
 gym that I can still give you the 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.870
 maximum here and I want to demonstrate 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.880
 prove it publicly is not so good 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.810
 as last as it does so do that is 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.130
 for good 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.380
 maximum public there are many people who 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.270
 also maybe he had picked up a glue 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.400
 easier for a boxer than ever 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.250
 applied the large objects that always 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.840
 is the good fights of a lot of action is 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.970
 part of that service is 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.740
 instituted of wanting to have big fights 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.950
 to get rid of the good that makes you 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.220
 continue boxing and if indeed 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.220
 for home 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.380
 we must take public we are still 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.690
 here so that what remains public in 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.010
 It was worth interesting fight 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.810
 internationally when I come back from 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.460
 after a year of retired but I did 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.040
 two more or less easy fights that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.080
 really motivated me how it was that 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.090
 if it motivated you personally and about 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.250
 everything that give public good deed 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.740
 good stops in peace and not the point 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.540
 key and so we will follow it with something that 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.310
 always heard from you mom I love you not 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.830
 people always say juan kills good 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.330
 fights that touch nothing else the wait for 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.770
 all that talk I've always followed 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.780
 in world boxing they medicate themselves 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.039
 Cuban political as you know for everything 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.039
 it and what can you expect on Thursday 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:39.340
 so that the public does not fight and do 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.260
 a great fight of degree to be a ranch 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.860
 wilson do it that amador so look 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.860
 Billboard
