00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:14.396
 Presentation of Johanna 

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:19.425
 The crusade is calling us, my friend. 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.160
 Johanna, a formidable cross of the Zakarum Church 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.225
 and fiery protector of the Light, 

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.928
 is native to the eastern lands of Sanctuary. 

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.457
 Johanna seeks to eliminate the dark influence 

00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:35.857
 from the primordial Demon Mephisto on the Zakarum. 

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:38.250
 Determined to sacrifice for the crusade, 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.502
 Johanna entered the Nexus to find an apprentice 

00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:43.502
 who will replace her at her death. 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.410
 Johanna is a very tenacious front-line warrior, 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.747
 particularly effective to interrupt his enemies 

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:53.147
 while protecting themselves from control effects. 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.777
 &lt;i&gt; Forward for the fight. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:58.907 --> 00:01:01.107
 Johanna benefits from the Galvanisation trait. 

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:04.507
 Defensive size advantage, Galvanizing lasts 4 seconds, 

00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:06.879
 during which Johanna is unstoppable. 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.679
 It also gives him a shield 

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.579
 absorbing significant damage. 

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:16.804
 Fixes damage and slows down enemies. 

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.699
 Johanna moves forward and hits with her shield 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.699
 inflicting moderate damage in front of her 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.429
 and causing a slowing of the targets by 60%, 

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:27.664
 effect that fades over 2 seconds. 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.180
 Johanna has Blame, an important control talent. 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.930
 After a delay of one second, 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.463
 Blame attracts all nearby enemies, 

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.867
 stunning them for a quarter of a second 

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:41.617
 and inflicting small damage. 

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:46.807
 Glare is the last basic ability of the crossover. 

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.107
 It deals a limited amount of damage 

00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:50.907
 to enemies in the target area 

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:54.307
 and makes them miss their basic attacks for 1.5 seconds. 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.019
 Johanna's first heroic ability is called Couperet. 

00:02:00.547 --> 00:02:02.547
 The cross jumps to the target area 

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:04.447
 and, after 2 seconds of jump, 

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:07.316
 inflicts significant damage to nearby enemies 

00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:08.666
 while reversing them. 

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:12.666
 During her jump, Johanna can adjust the place where she will land 

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.516
 by repositioning the target area. 

00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:19.356
 For more accurate shots in combat, 

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.106
 Johanna can count on Divine Shield. 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.489
 This targeted shot deals moderate damage 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:25.939
 to the first enemy hit, 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.127
 before stunting for 2 seconds. 

00:02:28.327 --> 00:02:31.277
 His shield then bounces off two nearby enemies, 

00:02:31.477 --> 00:02:34.777
 inflicting small damage and stunning them for 1 second. 

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:38.632
 Johanna's positioning is crucial. 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.950
 Its toughness and strength are at the cost of reduced mobility, 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.544
 which must be taken into account before starting a fight. 

00:02:46.744 --> 00:02:49.344
 The synergy between Blame and Galvanization 

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:53.294
 allows Johanna to take her position of strength. 

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:56.177
 Use them to engage a fight for your team 

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:59.777
 or to repel your enemies and gain ground. 

00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:04.308
 Once in combat, use Correction and Glare 

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:05.808
 on important targets 

00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.058
 to limit their damage and slow them down. 

00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:11.745
 Even if they do damage, 

00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:15.645
 these abilities are essentially utilitarian. 

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:18.445
 Your teammates will have to position themselves accordingly 

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:21.899
 to inflict the damage needed to eliminate targets. 

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:24.255
 If the defense of the opposing team 

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:27.855
 prevents you from intervening in combat, 

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:30.245
 remember to use Couperet to impose yourself 

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:33.195
 and take the weakest killers off guard. 

00:03:34.205 --> 00:03:36.505
 Do not forget that this ability also allows 

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:38.891
 to get out of thorny situations. 

00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:44.674
 Divine Shield can be a devastating heroic ability, 

00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:49.755
 but this is a targeted shot that is better not to miss. 

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:52.285
 Use it to engage a fight, 

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:55.335
 defend a murderer sued, 

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.635
 or catch up with an enemy on the run. 

00:04:03.032 --> 00:04:05.532

00:04:05.732 --> 00:04:07.982

00:04:08.182 --> 00:04:09.682
 We are eager to see 

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.778
