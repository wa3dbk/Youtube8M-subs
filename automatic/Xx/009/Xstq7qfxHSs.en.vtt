an hour and a half and I'm unlikely to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
do anything afterwards but I might it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.620

starting a new game trying out a new
game<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.960> at<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.679> moment<00:00:32.040> i<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
game and at the moment i think it is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360 
game and at the moment i think it is
ninety-nine<00:00:34.110> percent<00:00:34.260> likely<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.070> game

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
ninety-nine percent likely that game

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.680 
ninety-nine percent likely that game
will<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.899> watchdogs<00:00:36.899> another<00:00:37.890> youtube<00:00:38.690> user

called smoke ring halo sent me a copy of
that<00:00:42.450> game<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.780> thank<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:42.989> very<00:00:43.050> much<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.680> i

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that i think is a good candidate for

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.319 
that i think is a good candidate for
live<00:00:47.820> streaming<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.039> Friday<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:51.120> will

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
hopefully it will go a little smoother

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.700

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the last playthrough we had lost more

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.010 
the last playthrough we had lost more
than<00:01:20.250> five<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.509> point<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
than five when we got to this point and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
than five when we got to this point and
we<00:01:22.770> didn't<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.310> succeed<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
we didn't actually succeed at that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.520 
we didn't actually succeed at that
mission<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.640> whale<00:01:26.970> mission<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.960> this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
mission the the whale mission so this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.120 
mission the the whale mission so this
time<00:01:28.710> succeeded<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.740> we've<00:01:31.950> lost

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
time succeeded at it and and we've lost

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.289 
time succeeded at it and and we've lost
five<00:01:32.369> people<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.850> yeah<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.150> wasn't

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
five people so yeah there wasn't

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.850 
five people so yeah there wasn't
brilliant<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:33.900> hopefully<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.530> thought<00:01:34.680> have

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
brilliant but hopefully we thought have

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.740 
brilliant but hopefully we thought have
a<00:01:34.890> smoother<00:01:35.640> smoother<00:01:36.450> time<00:01:36.630> from<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:38.750> I'd

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
a smoother smoother time from now on I'd

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.830 
a smoother smoother time from now on I'd
say<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.409> couldn't<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.829> any<00:01:40.920> worse<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.840> think

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
say it couldn't be any worse but I think

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.960 
say it couldn't be any worse but I think
we<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.259> probably<00:01:44.070> would<00:01:44.939> be

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
we all know that probably would be

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.990 
we all know that probably would be
wishful<00:01:45.750> thinking<00:01:46.350> anyway<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.700> want<00:01:47.880> to
