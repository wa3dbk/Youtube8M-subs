00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
it was our tradition and we kind of used

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.070 
it was our tradition and we kind of used
as<00:00:17.250> one<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.520> our<00:00:17.670> slogans<00:00:18.180> within<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> program

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
as one of our slogans within the program

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.750 
as one of our slogans within the program
and<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.770> athletic<00:00:20.130> department<00:00:20.609> is

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
and it really the athletic department is

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.269 
and it really the athletic department is
being<00:00:21.150> powered<00:00:21.539> by<00:00:21.570> tradition<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
being powered by tradition and the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.800 
being powered by tradition and the
tradition<00:00:23.730> has<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.000> do<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> lot<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> things<00:00:24.660> not

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
tradition has to do a lot of things not

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.290 
tradition has to do a lot of things not
just<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.199> field<00:00:25.470> success<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.250> feel<00:00:26.460> also

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
just on field success but we feel also

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.820 
just on field success but we feel also
that<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.349> things<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
that we want to do things in a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.099 
that we want to do things in a
first-class<00:00:29.160> way<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.240> things<00:00:30.420> right<00:00:30.810> and

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
first-class way and do things right and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.990 
first-class way and do things right and
always<00:00:31.590> strive<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.309> best<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.850> can

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
always strive to be the best that we can

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.060 
always strive to be the best that we can
be<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.300> many<00:00:33.630> different<00:00:33.930> ways<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.829> off<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
be in many different ways on and off the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.560 
be in many different ways on and off the
field<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.610> think<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> ways

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
field and I think that's one of the ways

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.680 
field and I think that's one of the ways
that<00:00:36.620> once<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.829> wanted<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> look<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.090> upgrades

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that once we wanted to look for upgrades

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.049 
that once we wanted to look for upgrades
in<00:00:39.930> our<00:00:40.230> facilities<00:00:40.860> especially<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.940> our

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
in our facilities especially in our

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.630 
in our facilities especially in our
equipment<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:43.410> partnered<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.890> something

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
equipment we partnered with something

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.510 
equipment we partnered with something
like<00:00:44.789> spacing<00:00:45.270> before<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.340> bunch

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
like spacing before it was just a bunch

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
like spacing before it was just a bunch
of<00:00:47.670> big<00:00:47.789> cabinets<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.690> had<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> jam<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> in

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
of big cabinets you had to jam it in

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
of big cabinets you had to jam it in
there<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> doors<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.059> close<00:00:51.239> on

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there to get the doors just to close on

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
there to get the doors just to close on
it<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> very<00:00:52.559> inefficient<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it it was it very inefficient a lot of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.520 
it it was it very inefficient a lot of
stuff<00:00:53.579> got<00:00:53.730> damaged<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:54.809> everything<00:00:55.320> has

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
stuff got damaged and now everything has

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.670 
stuff got damaged and now everything has
its<00:00:55.739> own<00:00:55.920> spot<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.610> as<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.410> do

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
its own spot and as you can see we do

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.490 
its own spot and as you can see we do
have<00:00:58.890> extra<00:00:59.219> space<00:00:59.430> now<00:00:59.899> we<00:01:00.899> obviously<00:01:01.050> needed

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
have extra space now we obviously needed

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.680 
have extra space now we obviously needed
to<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.579> things<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.910> our<00:01:03.000> equipment<00:01:03.480> room

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
to do some things in our equipment room

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.469 
to do some things in our equipment room
and<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> think<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.970> really<00:01:05.970> serves<00:01:06.210> two

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and so I think it's a really serves two

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.120 
and so I think it's a really serves two
purposes<00:01:06.510> number<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.470> there's<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.740> there's<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
purposes number one there's a there's a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.649 
purposes number one there's a there's a
functional<00:01:08.640> purpose<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.450> it's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
functional purpose because it's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
functional purpose because it's
innovative<00:01:10.470> storage<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.549> saved

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
innovative storage and it really saved

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
innovative storage and it really saved
us<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> area<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.140> made<00:01:13.650> things<00:01:13.920> work

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
us in that area and made things work

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
us in that area and made things work
more<00:01:14.369> efficiently<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.150> there's<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.630> an

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
more efficiently but there's also an

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
more efficiently but there's also an
aesthetic<00:01:16.380> quality<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.490> where<00:01:17.570> players

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
aesthetic quality to it where players

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
aesthetic quality to it where players
and<00:01:18.930> things<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.380> walk<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> locker<00:01:20.100> room

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and things can walk in the locker room

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.980 
and things can walk in the locker room
and<00:01:20.490> they<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> design<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:21.840> can

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and they can see the design and they can

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
and they can see the design and they can
see<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.710> athletes<00:01:23.310> hers<00:01:23.580> first-class

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
see it's that athletes hers first-class

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.999 
see it's that athletes hers first-class
kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> thing<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.530> makes<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.830> guy<00:01:25.979> feel

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
kind of a thing it makes a guy feel

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.390 
kind of a thing it makes a guy feel
special<00:01:26.670> I'd<00:01:27.570> say<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> ability<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.439> store<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
special I'd say the ability to store it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
special I'd say the ability to store it
stacked<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.090> put<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.720> compartments<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
stacked and put it in compartments I

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
stacked and put it in compartments I
think<00:01:32.159> definitely<00:01:32.549> helps<00:01:32.909> preserve<00:01:33.329> your

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
think definitely helps preserve your

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.749 
think definitely helps preserve your
equipment<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.560> important<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.400> we

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
equipment it's very important because we

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.539 
equipment it's very important because we
work<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.390> limited<00:01:36.810> resources<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> fundings

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
work on limited resources and fundings

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
work on limited resources and fundings
