00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.179 
exactly why cutting the power leads to
the<00:01:54.540> gas<00:01:54.720> vanishing<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.680> any<00:01:55.799> rate<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
the gas vanishing but at any rate the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.190 
the gas vanishing but at any rate the
power<00:01:56.369> generated<00:01:56.939> relative<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> its<00:01:57.659> size<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
power generated relative to its size is

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
power generated relative to its size is
phenomenal<00:01:59.040> that's<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.030> week<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
phenomenal that's it for this week and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.030 
phenomenal that's it for this week and
for<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.810> bulletin<00:02:01.229> thanks<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.740> everyone

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
for this bulletin thanks to everyone

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
for this bulletin thanks to everyone
who's<00:02:02.250> watched<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.790> know<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.939> few<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.450> have

who's watched I know a few of you have

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.149 
who's watched I know a few of you have
been<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:04.079> since<00:02:04.409> right<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> very<00:02:04.950> start

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
been here since right at the very start

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.700 
been here since right at the very start
so<00:02:05.670> thank<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.630> we'll<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.170> back<00:02:07.290> with<00:02:07.560> more

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
so thank you and we'll be back with more

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.919 
so thank you and we'll be back with more
science<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.700> happens<00:02:09.119> throughout<00:02:09.629> next

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
science as it happens throughout next

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.170 
science as it happens throughout next
week
