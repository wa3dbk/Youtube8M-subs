00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello to all types have made a ride starting to have my little 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.429
 childhood it's going great 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.219
 so you're so here we go we have the third part of the final 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.010
 of the tournament this must be organized in places common point 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.739
 who on France 3 points on the terrace 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.210
 yet his story 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.300
 the mixed funds who lost the first two parts and that time has 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.550
 chosen hangs there ends cool is delighted with nantes a very very note 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.619
 large mass 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.630
 who is 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.930
 it lends itself to prototypes of sun that it lends itself 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.120
 the protoss 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.470
 I would rather say that it lends itself to terraces in celebration 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.350
 because with the Vikings 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.760
 see if your opponent takes his dull screen on it more posed your 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.729
 victims here 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.309
 for control of this incarnated scene attacked on the art school in 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.379
 lack of the contract of the savoie is a vote must destroy is so tight 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.889
 its rocks to access the cliff so I will not play what 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:03.249
 say it's my little favors the thick oar shaped we'll see what's up 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.700
 so give just for the signal is the stake of the match 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.730
 so think we won 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.530
 the heroes against promised so coveted this part you have to bet 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.670
 to eliminate points that become master of the world or in any case 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.780
 babacar of the tournament and I will say no more 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.330
 so have a party afterwards for the fun that we're going while we're going 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.009
 comment 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.539
 so we had the opportunity to visit the police house that starts to 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.359
 to make disorder among the alternatives for béthune 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.780
 I had come by chance 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.510
 we see that the father has not yet stolen 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.610
 and who goes on a year 4 spoiled pretty fast 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.830
 here's a pretty fast guy so the barracuda 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.840
 I wanted 10% there are only two possibilities so to stay have 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.750
 assisted by his barak superiors 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.140
 then if blagnac or sup sup then barak then gauze these standaard aids at 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.750
 veterans so there he chose theater but at the expense of his 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.280
 role 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.080
 so we'll see what's going to happen 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.520
 maybe 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 you're more aggressive for example with a zelda pronounce 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.740
 I leave what could allow him to display 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.250
 according to me I took a good option will see what he will do 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.550
 the orbital station and the devil and for what may possibly allow him to 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.639
 make bouncy distributions 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.370
 during marauding 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.529
 so here's the options are open 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.489
 tourists from difficult beginnings and placed his three points 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.699
 it was a true one of macedonia 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.699
 meanwhile we admit that the protoss 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.979
 the team starts from the current team 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.489
 thanks to its cybernetic module 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.099
 the operation baptized 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.489
 we will see 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.639
 a day that begins to crumble 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.019
 especially France 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.140
 where he so it starts quietly 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.319
 you must know that 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.140
 gold like like to know departures are going to be an info next patch kim 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.380
 who will take place 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.450
 in mid-September and that will go from 40 to 45 seconds production so that 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.630
 it is a mayor who was eagerly awaited every year and by all the protoss players 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.069
 but especially zerg players who undergoes this is really the mas rigueur 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.069
 while doing the others 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.950
 by his side arfa it's a very good operation he saw 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.329
 the second by at-c 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.150
 juppé attention here with you and me the ultimate he saw he had not 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
 extension that surfs the barracks so it's a bide 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.079
 me if I was if I was protoss and if I saw that I would say a mass 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.459
 marine 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.799
 and a raven 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.769
 so I know what I'll do instead of understanding we'll see what it's like 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.220
 will give and that is why it is in its own right 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.309
 extension 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.729
 god machining and for the space women who is getting closer and closer 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.819
 celebrate the goal that I predicted 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.819
 So here we go see no globo the same profession of actor 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:34.910
 apparently 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.859
 we have a second diagram second gaga 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.669
 I have been faithful to what is planned 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.499
 literally and the blues the civilians so the civilian I want to say that 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:45.379
 controversial 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.230
 still not on the one hand where they suspect 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.480
 that the protoss is here 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.209
 but he's still not there this cut off his opponent who did not get at all 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.229
 everything that is doing 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.889
 his business there is no doubt that ten departments need both 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:57.829
 previous parts 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.189
 this case 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.299
 so a big suspense to do it 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.699
 who will finally finish his report to the storage format that wants 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.649
 the emirate fire store water 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.209
 for the latter 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.209
 number of these years 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.169
 mystery is intact 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.889
 a little shop nicely 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.699
 christofias remains disturbed 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.699
 he participated in their marines so who not really araxxe 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.129
 at first it was exciting 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.330
 gold this life that falls 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.020
 e for civilians who have you pillow we wait 15 years who research and the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.730
 vikings a bikini in any case that is being produced 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.730
 in the half of the field 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.349
 Grasshopper 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.039
 - the protoss who is really trying to race 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.969
 so the movie that is really taking part in this contest which usually is 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:46.600
 similar 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.190
 but I think this time she's going to develop this little this 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.190
 little aggression on the part of all 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.729
 a fight against the crimes of armored fires person who was armored the 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:58.759
 range to make the expenses 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.800
 he steps back and he's a viking 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.039
 it's a Viking it's not too much yet so far for me a 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.349
 bikini who is especially proud especially vocation to cut himself 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.889
 it was communicated 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.199
 1 in this case on the part of understand that in my opinion a very good choice a 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.559
 very good choice on his part 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:16.570
 but for justice to know if we qualify 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.260
 a lot of actors time it's a lack-to-win 279 that he would have done 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.339
 270 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.289
 more and more harm to anyone 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.470
 will declare a good operation and there and that's exactly in the cross three 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.980
 transfer agreements a robotic complex so 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.270
 the lawyers the building the arrival 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.150
 his opponent building immortal green if auxerre is what is done 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.509
 usually 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.509
 so here is the pontoon pond 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.210
 do not leave room for working capital 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.080
 and m and the army the army the police and the army that does not attack 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.150
 because twenty years ago 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.389
 do not cry explain there to fix it and when marie 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.110
 but did he add a little more 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.110
 scalded do it as much as earlier it's moonlight 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:01.839
 they live like that 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.550
 do not they know it was necessarily 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.550
 retired from third countries so we admitted Martin who comes to temper 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.900
 m together 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.520
 it replaces summer 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.740
 any retreat we will laugh in the locker room yes the protoss 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.749
 now place to take the lead 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:20.680
 two tanks in festival seat mode 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.500
 since he could have also the public who could have perhaps more 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.599
 on the tanks but there actually it is a little more 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.340
 and the intimate relationship with him 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.310
 the immortal required Thursday five years of damage to the deposit of witnesses of the 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.029
 facts so to the world 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.979
 in clear while that 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.439
 the interface is transported by Ariane 6 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.770
 speaker at the tuque 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.400
 I think he has passed for no cash the fire of time 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.490
 who used to pray you street clearly there was there was a mistake of 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.570
 microphones the toque and also to attack gives because I do not know if you 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:50.569
 seen but he positioned his immortal in front 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.349
 even though his fine size 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.999
 the price effect of germany caught fire 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.719
 he sees there he put his immortal in front of 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:03.439
 it does not carry very well the marine damage so the trip 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.439
 business 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:09.319
 interviewed at the time he was 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.509
 fo going to the attacked in five years halifa easily sallah their prowess 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:16.660
 who does not leave the more complex task at the back have been submitted who 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:17.409
 miss the frame 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:21.999
 but we're with you nice part on the guitar the police do not have to go through 

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:26.519
 a delayed match in which family that could benefit from 

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:29.220
 this hill but who decided not to do it 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.790
 who will probably come back for that I feel that they feel threatened 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.800
 three classes they feel threatened psychological my impression that he is 

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:39.119
 he does not attempt 

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:40.580
 does not necessarily take the initiative
