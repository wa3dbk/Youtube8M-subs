saber-toothed tiger I had for breakfast

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.010 
saber-toothed tiger I had for breakfast
I<00:00:17.010> bet<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.550> could<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:17.940> really<00:00:18.180> really<00:00:18.539> useful

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I bet that could be really really useful

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320 
I bet that could be really really useful
and<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.830> was<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.460> really<00:00:20.609> useful<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.210> came

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
and it was really really useful it came

a<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.789> good<00:00:29.939> thing<00:00:29.970> evolutionary

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
a really good thing evolutionary

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.510 
a really good thing evolutionary
speaking<00:00:31.320> gave<00:00:31.470> us<00:00:31.590> lots<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.859> protein<00:00:32.070> lots<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
speaking gave us lots of protein lots of

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.970 
speaking gave us lots of protein lots of
energy<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.480> could<00:00:33.660> grow<00:00:33.870> our<00:00:34.110> big<00:00:34.469> brains

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
energy so we could grow our big brains

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.280 
energy so we could grow our big brains
and<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.309> smarter<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.840> sure<00:00:37.050> there's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and get smarter and I'm sure there's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.690 
and get smarter and I'm sure there's
more<00:00:37.410> than<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.770> vegetarian<00:00:38.219> sitting<00:00:38.579> out

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
more than one vegetarian sitting out

there right now saying we're smart

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.720 
there right now saying we're smart
enough<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.559> fact<00:00:40.770> we're<00:00:40.950> smart<00:00:41.219> enough<00:00:41.370> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
enough in fact we're smart enough to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.150 
enough in fact we're smart enough to
realize<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.020> don't<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.680> eat<00:00:43.829> meat
