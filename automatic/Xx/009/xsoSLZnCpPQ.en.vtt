00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
not really good not bad we placed first

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.370 
not really good not bad we placed first
place<00:00:22.150> at<00:00:22.540> ipl5<00:00:24.000> that's<00:00:25.000> not<00:00:25.990> the<00:00:26.140> greatest

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
place at ipl5 that's not the greatest

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.800 
place at ipl5 that's not the greatest
result<00:00:26.920> but<00:00:27.160> it's<00:00:27.460> not<00:00:27.730> really<00:00:28.330> bad<00:00:28.450> because

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
result but it's not really bad because

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.690

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739

world championship for 1 million dollars

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.290 
world championship for 1 million dollars
so<00:00:50.649> in<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> first<00:00:51.070> game<00:00:51.340> it<00:00:51.550> was<00:00:51.700> we<00:00:52.149> were

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
so in the first game it was we were

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.080 
so in the first game it was we were
ahead<00:00:52.690> but<00:00:53.260> throw<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.829> in<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.640> second<00:00:54.970> game

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
ahead but throw and in the second game

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.620 
ahead but throw and in the second game
they<00:00:55.360> just<00:00:55.630> a<00:00:55.750> minute<00:00:55.989> it<00:00:56.110> as<00:00:56.380> overall<00:00:57.510> did<00:00:58.510> you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
they just a minute it as overall did you

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.229 
they just a minute it as overall did you
expect<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:59.110> do<00:00:59.260> better<00:00:59.530> or<00:00:59.950> did<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:00.880> exceed

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
expect to do better or did you exceed

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.180 
expect to do better or did you exceed
your<00:01:01.360> expectations<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:03.509> really<00:01:04.509> think<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:05.190> we

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
your expectations I really think that we

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.780 
your expectations I really think that we
could<00:01:06.400> do<00:01:07.000> better<00:01:07.440> but<00:01:08.440> still<00:01:08.590> like<00:01:08.890> we<00:01:09.190> played

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
could do better but still like we played

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.420 
could do better but still like we played
really<00:01:10.000> solid<00:01:10.479> in<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.659> first<00:01:10.900> game<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.950> if<00:01:12.400> we

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
really solid in the first game so if we

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.380 
really solid in the first game so if we
win<00:01:12.970> that<00:01:13.180> we<00:01:13.900> would<00:01:14.049> have<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:15.310> much<00:01:16.060> edge

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
win that we would have more much edge

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.050 
win that we would have more much edge
because<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.170> moral<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.710> other<00:01:17.950> stuff<00:01:18.310> but

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
because of the moral and other stuff but

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.330 
because of the moral and other stuff but
like<00:01:19.390> after<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.930> first<00:01:20.140> game<00:01:20.380> every<00:01:21.010> time<00:01:21.190> we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
like after the first game every time we

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.899 
like after the first game every time we
lose<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:22.180> play<00:01:22.210> really<00:01:22.659> bad<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.049> next<00:01:23.350> game<00:01:23.530> so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
lose we play really bad the next game so

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.950 
lose we play really bad the next game so
it's<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.890> was<00:01:27.070> hard<00:01:27.310> for<00:01:27.400> us<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.909> catch<00:01:28.690> up

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
it's a it was hard for us to catch up

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.770 
it's a it was hard for us to catch up
and<00:01:29.200> they<00:01:29.830> played<00:01:30.130> really<00:01:30.310> good<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.479> play

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780

think<00:06:49.310> that<00:06:49.400> season<00:06:49.850> three<00:06:50.030> is<00:06:50.090> coming<00:06:50.420> so<00:06:50.810> we

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
think that season three is coming so we

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.200 
think that season three is coming so we
are<00:06:51.200> going<00:06:51.380> to<00:06:51.590> take<00:06:51.740> a<00:06:51.770> break<00:06:52.070> I'm<00:06:52.760> not<00:06:53.030> sure

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
are going to take a break I'm not sure

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.360 
are going to take a break I'm not sure
how<00:06:53.450> long<00:06:53.660> it<00:06:53.870> will<00:06:53.900> be<00:06:54.080> I<00:06:54.440> will<00:06:54.830> still<00:06:55.160> keep

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
how long it will be I will still keep

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.090 
how long it will be I will still keep
playing<00:06:55.850> and<00:06:56.270> streaming<00:06:56.810> solo<00:06:57.260> but<00:06:57.830> I<00:06:57.860> don't

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
playing and streaming solo but I don't

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.380 
playing and streaming solo but I don't
think<00:06:58.220> that<00:06:58.400> we're<00:06:58.580> going<00:06:58.760> to<00:06:58.880> play<00:06:59.090> as<00:06:59.240> a<00:06:59.270> team

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
think that we're going to play as a team

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.020 
think that we're going to play as a team
for<00:06:59.960> one<00:07:00.170> or<00:07:00.410> two<00:07:00.440> months<00:07:00.740> because<00:07:01.670> the<00:07:01.850> team

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
for one or two months because the team

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.750 
for one or two months because the team
is<00:07:02.060> are<00:07:02.330> really<00:07:02.990> tired<00:07:03.260> and<00:07:03.590> not<00:07:03.710> only<00:07:03.890> of<00:07:04.280> the

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
is are really tired and not only of the

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.960 
is are really tired and not only of the
game<00:07:04.940> but<00:07:05.120> like<00:07:05.360> I<00:07:05.600> think<00:07:05.990> of<00:07:06.670> everyone<00:07:07.670> in<00:07:07.850> the

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
game but like I think of everyone in the

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.150 
game but like I think of everyone in the
team<00:07:08.120> so<00:07:08.450> we<00:07:08.690> were<00:07:08.810> playing<00:07:09.080> we're<00:07:09.950> playing

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
team so we were playing we're playing

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.090 
team so we were playing we're playing
one<00:07:10.970> year<00:07:11.270> maybe<00:07:11.510> a<00:07:11.630> bit<00:07:11.750> more<00:07:11.780> together<00:07:12.140> like

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
one year maybe a bit more together like

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.130 
one year maybe a bit more together like
everything<00:07:13.460> getting<00:07:13.970> really<00:07:14.780> tired<00:07:14.990> of

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
everything getting really tired of

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.930 
everything getting really tired of
everyone<00:07:15.830> so<00:07:16.310> I<00:07:17.920> think<00:07:18.920> we<00:07:19.070> really<00:07:19.550> need<00:07:19.760> some

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940
