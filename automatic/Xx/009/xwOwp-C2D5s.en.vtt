00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:25.086
Today we are going to make a meat ragu with polenta

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:37.066
The first thing to do is to cut the meat into small cubes

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:42.027
Then, sear it in a pan with just a little oil

00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.007
sauteing until it is deep golden brown and starts to release its juices

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.076
Then you add the salt

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:54.032
When the meat starts to brown, it is time to add the salt

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:55.055
Give it a stir

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:58.069
Let's now add the onion and the garlic.

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:11.081
At this point, add the Santo Mario cachaça and, before locking the pressure cooker lid

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:17.074
add the wine. Let it cook for a long time.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:27.003
The tomato will be added only at the end, because it doesn't need to be cooked for too long

00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:31.070
Now, let it cook under pressure for another 5 minutes

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.068
and our ragu is ready.

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:39.030
To make the polenta, put the cornmeal and the broth in a pan.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.034
You're going to use four cups of broth for two cups of cornmeal

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:47.080
stir it well, so it doesn't get lumpy.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.003
Add salt, black pepper and cook for a long time too

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.037
until it gets to the right consistence

00:01:55.037 --> 00:01:57.070
it's going to take about an hour, stirring.

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:16.023
The inspirations for this dish was Seu Mario, the producer of Santo Mario Cachaça in Catanduva.

00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:22.089
Seu Mario came from Bergamo, a city in the Northern part of Italy where polenta is very typical.

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:31.018
I thought of a polenta as a side for the meat ragout because in the region of Catanduva people eat a lot of meat.

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:34.043
So, that's why I chose the ragu

00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:39.008
So, here is our creamy polenta with ragu and cachaça

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:40.000
Amazing!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.001
Enjoy.
