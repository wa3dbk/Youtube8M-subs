00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.410
 hi there, this is project 1 video car market 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.320
 my name is ioan simakov i imagine 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.570
 auto rdm import some 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.759
 novice motorists are given such 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 question what kind of gasoline to pour into your 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.100
 car 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.600
 here it is actually very simple yes 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.740
 look at what gasoline is being sold 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.769
 at gas stations yes that is 90 95 98 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.660
 mostly very rarely now possible 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.120
 meet 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.830
 80 gasoline i.e. great as its 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.960
 now rarely meet at gas stations he 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.290
 already somehow departs that's why in 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.400
 principle, as if 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.100
 choice of a small but then how would 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.770
 what difficulties can be 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.790
 if for example the manufacturer 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.460
 recommended some kind of fuel to bring down 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.030
 oh well for example 92 gasoline you need to pour your 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.300
 car yes and you fill 80 gasoline in 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.170
 In this case, it's like playing evil 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.790
 joke at home will also lose power 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.170
 maybe it will overheat 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.310
 even breaks down the gasket cylinder 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.040
 Well, how many can be like that 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.990
 moments but not very desirable plus ko 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.630
 around if the machine such as its new you 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.240
 bought from an authorized dealer 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.369
 at some breakdown in the service department 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.550
 can take a sample of gas from your 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.140
 gas tank I did not find that gasoline is not 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.210
 corresponds to that which plant 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.960
 would recommend something like a warranty machine 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.380
 can fly away 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.630
 here therefore as though to lower octane 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.640
 the number is undesirable but slightly different 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.740
 situation with dea old and 95th gasoline 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.350
 of all modern machines 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.260
 recommended plant 95 petrol or uncle 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.080
 and with the second one it is easy to pour the difference as 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.940
 you would not particularly notice a little machine 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.890
 may be lost in power well, quite 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.549
 slightly given on the other side and on 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.190
 second petrol it is cheaper that's what 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.049
 concerns 98 gasoline and yes this gasoline he 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.810
 designed mainly for turbocharged 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.269
 machines whose turbines are set to 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.090
 which a lot of horsepower 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.030
 forces such gasoline in ordinary cars yes 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.920
 Well, it does not make sense because it will 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.880
 even the opposite effect that is the machine 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.299
 again lose power you like 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.400
 it is not necessary yes that is also such 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.290
 as in 98 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.790
 the son of the head is better to lead but the loss of power 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.120
 it will be possible here what else about this 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.760
 can say in principle 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.400
 cars not turbocharged modern not 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.340
 modern that is a car if you have 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.159
 1990 release or 2005 calmly as 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.920
 could this other 92 petrol 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:52.280
 if 95 gasoline will be worse from this 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.950
 will not be absolutely yes but if you 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.420
 a car with a turbo engine is already desirable 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.200
 after all, of course 98 gasoline well, again 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.120
 said 95 gasoline can be replaced 92 then 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.840
 there is here some sort of binding to specific 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.060
 year of release absolutely no yes if you 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.409
 the car is pretty old yes there 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.290
 80s or there even 70 and sometime in 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.510
 this car was filled with 80 gasoline now 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.159
 how would you hardly find it already 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.879
 there is it rarely therefore 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:29.569
 calm her 92 that's what i have already 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.430
 said here as if your answer is simple 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.440
 car on if it is not turbocharged 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.859
 most likely whether 92 gasoline is needed here 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.590
 all so here everything is simple therefore not 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.109
 bother me but for this 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.909
 about everything go to our video channel 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.829
 first car market video go to our 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.900
 official site you 1 point ru 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.900
 thank you very much for your attention
